We demonstrate that the spectrum rearrangement can be considered as a
precursor of the metal-insulator transition observed in graphene dosed with
hydrogen atoms. The Anderson-type transition is attributed to the coincidence
between the Fermi level and the mobility edge, which appearance is induced by
the spectrum rearrangement. Available experimental data are thoroughly compared
to the theoretical results for the Lifshitz impurity model.
