Atomically engineered oxide multilayers and superlattices display unique
properties responsive to the electronic and atomic structures of the
interfaces. We have followed the growth of ferroelectric BaTiO3 on SrRuO3
electrode with in situ atomic scale analysis of the surface structure at each
stage. An oxygen-induced surface reconstruction of SrRuO3 leads to formation of
SrO rows spaced at twice the bulk periodicity. This reconstruction modifies the
structure of the first BaTiO3 layers grown subsequently, including intermixing
observed with cross-section spectroscopy. These observations reveal that this
common oxide interface is much more interesting than previously reported, and
provide a paradigm for oxygen engineering of oxide structure at an interface.
