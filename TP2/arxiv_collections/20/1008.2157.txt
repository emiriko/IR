Over the last few years several models have been proposed to interpret the
widespread soft excess observed in the X-ray spectra of type 1 active galactic
nuclei (AGN). In particular, reflection from the photoionized accretion disc
blurred by relativistic effects has proven to be successful in reproducing both
the spectral shape and the variability pattern of many sources. As a further
test to this scenario we present the analysis of a recent ~100 ks long Suzaku
observation of Arakelian 120, a prototypical 'bare' Seyfert 1 galaxy in which
no complex absorption system is expected to mimic a soft excess or mask the
intrinsic properties of this key component. We show that a reflection model
allowing for both warm/blurred and cold/distant reprocessing provides a
self-consistent and convincing interpretation of the broadband X-ray emission
of Ark 120, also characterized by a structured iron feature and a high-energy
hump. Although warm absorbers, winds/outflows and multiple Comptonizing regions
may play significant roles in sources with more spectral complexity, this case
study adds evidence to the presence of blurred disc reflection as a basic
component of the X-ray spectra of type 1 AGN.
