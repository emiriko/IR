We propose a new type of quantum pump made out of graphene, adiabatically
driven by oscillating voltages applied to two back gates. From a practical
point of view, graphene-based quantum pumps present advantages as compared to
normal pumps, like enhanced robustness against thermal effects and a wider
adiabatic range in driving frequency. From a fundamental point of view, apart
from conventional pumping through propagating modes, graphene pumps can tap
into evanescent modes, which penetrate deeply into the device as a consequence
of chirality. At the Dirac point the evanescent modes dominate pumping and give
rise to a universal response under weak driving for short and wide pumps, even
though the charge per unit cycle in not quantized.
