We introduce a procedure to generate scattering states which display
trajectory-like wave function patterns in wave transport through complex
scatterers. These deterministic scattering states feature the dual property of
being eigenstates to the Wigner-Smith time-delay matrix and to the transmission
matrix with classical (noiseless) transmission eigenvalues close to 0 or 1. Our
procedure to create such beam-like states is based solely on the scattering
matrix and successfully tested numerically for regular, chaotic and disordered
cavities. These results pave the way for the experimental realization of highly
collimated wave fronts in transport through complex media with possible
applications like secure and low-power communication.
