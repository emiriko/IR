We examine the practicality for a user of using Answer Set Programming (ASP)
for representing logical formalisms. Our example is a formalism aiming at
capturing causal explanations from causal information. We show the naturalness
and relative efficiency of this translation job. We are interested in the ease
for writing an ASP program. Limitations of the earlier systems made that in
practice, the ``declarative aspect'' was more theoretical than practical. We
show how recent improvements in working ASP systems facilitate the translation.
