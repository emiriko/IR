Intermediate Scattering Functions (ISF's) are measured for colloidal hard
sphere systems using both Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) and X-ray Photon
Correlation Spectroscopy (XPCS). We compare the techniques, and discuss the
advantages and disadvantages of each. Both techniques agree in the overlapping
range of scattering vectors. We investigate the scaling behaviour found by
Segre and Pusey [1] but challenged by Lurio et al. [2]. We observe a scaling
behaviour over several decades in time but not in the long time regime.
Moreover, we do not observe long time diffusive regimes at scattering vectors
away from the peak of the structure factor and so question the existence of a
long time diffusion coefficients at these scattering vectors.
