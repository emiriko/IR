Velasquez and Felipe recently introduced quasi-Jordan algebras based on the
product $a \triangleleft b = \tfrac12 ( a \dashv b + b \vdash a )$ in an
associative dialgebra with operations $\dashv$ and $\vdash$. We determine the
polynomial identities of degree $\le 4$ satisfied by this product. In addition
to right commutativity and the right quasi-Jordan identity, we obtain a new
associator-derivation identity.
