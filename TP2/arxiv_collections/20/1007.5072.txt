We compute the amplitudes for non-leptonic annihilation decays of $B$ mesons
into two particles within the pQCD collinear approach. The end point
divergences are regulated with the help of an infrared finite gluon propagator
characterized by a non-perturbative dynamical gluon mass consistent with recent
lattice simulations. The divergences at twist-3 are regulated by a dynamical
quark mass. Our results fit quite well the existent data of $B^0\to D_s^-K^+$
and $B^0\to D_s^{-*}\bar{K}^+$ for the expected range of dynamical gluon
masses. We also make predictions for the rare decays $\bar{B}^0\to K^-K^+$,
$\bar{B}^0_s\to \pi^-\pi^+,\pi^0\pi^0$, $B^+\to D_s^{(*)+}\bar{K}^0$, $B^0\to
D_s^{\pm(*)} K^\mp$ and $B_s^0\to D^{\pm(*)} \pi^\mp, D^0\pi^0$.
