Large scale square ring laser gyros with a length of four meters on each side
are approaching a sensitivity of 1x10^-11 rad/s/sqrt(Hz). This is about the
regime required to measure the gravitomagnetic effect (Lense Thirring) of the
Earth. For an ensemble of linearly independent gyros each measurement signal
depends upon the orientation of each single axis gyro with respect to the
rotational axis of the Earth. Therefore at least 3 gyros are necessary to
reconstruct the complete angular orientation of the apparatus. In general, the
setup consists of several laser gyroscopes (we would prefer more than 3 for
sufficient redundancy), rigidly referenced to each other. Adding more gyros for
one plane of observation provides a cross-check against intra-system biases and
furthermore has the advantage of improving the signal to noise ratio by the
square root of the number of gyros. In this paper we analyze a system of two
pairs of identical gyros (twins) with a slightly different orientation with
respect to the Earth axis. The twin gyro configuration has several interesting
properties. The relative angle can be controlled and provides a useful null
measurement. A quadruple twin system could reach a 1% sensitivity after 3:2
years of data, provided each square ring has 6 m length on a side, the system
is shot noise limited and there is no source for 1/f- noise.
