Spin waves in (0,pi) and (0,pi,pi) ordered spin-density-wave (SDW) states of
the t-t' Hubbard model are investigated at finite doping. In the presence of
small t', these composite ferro-antiferromagnetic (F-AF) states are found to be
strongly stabilized at finite hole doping due to enhanced carrier-induced
ferromagnetic spin couplings as in metallic ferromagnets. Anisotropic spin-wave
velocities, spin-wave energy scale of around 200meV, reduced magnetic moment,
and rapid suppression of magnetic order with electron doping x (corresponding
to F substitution of O atoms in La O_{1-x} F_x Fe As or Ni substitution of Fe
atoms in Ba Fe_{2-x} Ni_x As_2) obtained in this model are in agreement with
observed magnetic properties of doped iron pnictides.
