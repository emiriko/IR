We have shown that in a large number of generic and renormalizable
Wess-Zumino models existence of a $Z_n$ R-symmetry is sufficient to break
supersymmetry spontaneously. This implies that existence of a $Z_n$ R-symmetry
is a necessary condition for supersymmetry breaking in generic and
renormalizable Wess-Zumino models.
