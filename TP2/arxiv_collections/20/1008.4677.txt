We show that mean-field rate equations for submonolayer growth can
successfully predict island size distributions in the pre-coalescence regime if
the full dependence of capture numbers on both the island size and the coverage
is taken into account. This is demonstrated by extensive Kinetic Monte Carlo
simulations for a growth kinetics with hit and stick aggregation. A detailed
analysis of the capture numbers reveals a nonlinear dependence on the island
size for small islands. This nonlinearity turns out to be crucial for the
successful prediction of the island size distribution and renders an analytical
treatment based on a continuum limit of the mean-field rate equations
difficult.
