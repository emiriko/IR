Two and a half years prior to China's M7.9 Wenchuan earthquake of May 2008,
at least 300 million metric tons of water accumulated with additional seasonal
water level changes in the Minjiang River Valley at the eastern margin of the
Longmen Shan. This article shows that static surface loading in the Zipingpu
water reservoir induced Coulomb failure stresses on the nearby Beichuan thrust
fault system at <17km depth. Triggering stresses exceeded levels of daily lunar
and solar tides and perturbed a fault area measuring 416+/-96km^2. These stress
perturbations, in turn, likely advanced the clock of the mainshock and directed
the initial rupture propagation upward towards the reservoir on the
"Coulomb-like" Beichuan fault with rate-and-state dependent frictional
behavior. Static triggering perturbations produced up to 60 years (0.6%) of
equivalent tectonic loading, and show strong correlations to the coseismic
slip. Moreover, correlations between clock advancement and coseismic slip,
observed during the mainshock beneath the reservoir, are strongest for a longer
seismic cycle (10kyr) of M>7 earthquakes. Finally, the daily event rate of the
micro-seismicity (M>0.5) correlates well with the static stress perturbations,
indicating destabilization.
