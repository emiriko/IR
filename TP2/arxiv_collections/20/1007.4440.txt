We empirically study the activity patterns of individual blog-posting and
find significant memory effects. The memory coefficient first decays in a power
law and then turns to an exponential form. Moreover, the inter-event time
distribution displays a heavy-tailed nature with power-law exponent dependent
on the activity. Our findings challenge the priority-queue model that can not
reproduce the memory effects or the activity-dependent distributions. We think
there is another kind of human activity patterns driven by personal interests
and characterized by strong memory effects. Accordingly, we propose a simple
model based on temporal preference, which can well reproduce both the
heavy-tailed nature and the strong memory effects. This work helps in
understanding both the temporal regularities and the predictability of human
behaviors.
