I give a brief overview of the exploration of baryon properties in meson
photo- and electroproduction. These processes provide ample information for the
study of electromagnetic couplings of baryon resonances and to search for
states, yet to be discovered. The CLAS detector, combined with the use of
energy-tagged polarized photons and polarized electrons, as well as polarized
targets and the measurement of recoil polarization, provide the tools for a
comprehensive nucleon resonance program. I briefly present the status of this
program, prospects for the next few years, and plans for the Jefferson Lab 12
GeV upgrade.
