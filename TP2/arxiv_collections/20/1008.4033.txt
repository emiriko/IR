The solution of a (stochastic) differential equation (SDE) can be locally
approximated by a stochastic expansion, a linear combination of iterated
integrals. Quantities of interest, like moments, can then be approximated with
the expansion. We present a formula for the case where the drivers of the
equation are time and Wiener processes. We also present a Mathematica
implementation of the result.
