R-hadrons are only one of many possible stable colored states that the LHC
might produce. All such particles would provide a spectacular, if somewhat
unusual, signal at ATLAS and CMS. Produced in large numbers and leaving a
characteristic signature throughout all layers of the detector, including the
muon chamber, they could be straightforward to discover even with low
luminosity. Though such long lived colored particles (LLCPs) can be realized in
many extensions of the Standard Model, most analyses of their phenomenology
have focused only on R-hadrons. In order to distinguish among the
possibilities, fundamental quantum numbers of the new states must be measured.
In this paper, we demonstrate how to identify the $SU(3)_C$ charge and spin of
such new particles at the LHC.
