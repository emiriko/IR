Using density-functional theory with the on-site Coulomb correction (the
LDA+U method), we perform the structural optimization of BiMnO3 by starting
from different experimentally reported structures. We confirm that
irrespectively on the starting condition, all calculations converge to the same
centrosymmetric structure, in agreement with the previous finding.
Nevertheless, the structural optimization substantially reduces the Jahn-Teller
(JT) distortion in the system. We attribute this fact to the strong competition
of local distortions around the Mn- and Bi-sites: while the local
Mn-environment experiences the JT instability, the one of the Bi-sites favours
the off-centrosymmetric displacements, which involves the same oxygen atoms.
The existence of the second mechanism explains the difference between BiMnO3
and more canonical JT manganites, such as LaMnO3. Finally, being motivated by
experimental studies, we have investigated the formation of different types of
defects and obtained that BiMnO3 (contrary to other considered systems, such as
LaMnO3 and BiFeO3) can relatively easily form oxygen impurities at interstitial
sites. The impurity oxygen atom tends to form a pair with the host oxygen,
which explains the insulating character of the oxygen-excessive BiMnO3+x.
Moreover, we found that the BiMnO3+x samples experience the "memory effect",
where the optimized crystal structure strongly depends on the starting
configuration. We suggest that such a memory effect may explain stability of
some of the crystal structures of BiMnO3, which have been previously reported
experimentally.
