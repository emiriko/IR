Let $R$ be a commutative complex Banach algebra with the involution $\cdot
^\star$ and suppose that $A\in R^{n\times n}$, $B\in R^{n\times m}$, $C\in
R^{p\times n}$. The question of when the Riccati equation $$ PBB^\star
P-PA-A^\star P-C^\star C=0 $$ has a solution $P\in R^{n\times n}$ is
investigated. A counterexample to a previous result in the literature on this
subject is given, followed by sufficient conditions on the data guaranteeing
the existence of such a $P$. Finally, applications to spatially distributed
systems are discussed.
