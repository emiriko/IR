X-ray emission from the supernova remnant N23 in the Large Magellanic Cloud
(LMC) is studied using the X-ray Imaging Spectrometer (XIS) onboard Suzaku.
Thanks to superior energy resolution of the XIS in the soft X-ray band, we
resolved H-like and He-like Oxygen K\alpha emission lines from N23 with
unprecedentedly high quality, and as a result, identified a new optically thin
thermal emission component with a temperature ~0.2 keV, as well as that with a
temperature of ~0.5-0.7 keV previously known. This alters the estimate of the
ionization timescale net from ~10^{10-11} cm^-3s to >~10^{12} cm^{-3}s. Under
the assumption that N23 is still in the Sedov phase, its age evaluated from the
newly discovered low temperature component is ~8000 yr, although it is possible
that N23 has already moved into the radiative phase. The abundances of the
heavy elements are found to be roughly consistent with those of the LMC
average, which indicates that the origin of the X-ray emission of N23 is
swept-up ambient material, as expected from its ionization timescale.
