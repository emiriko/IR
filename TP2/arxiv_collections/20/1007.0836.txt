Let $\rho : G \to \operatorname{GL}(V)$ be a rational finite dimensional
complex representation of a reductive linear algebraic group $G$, and let
$\sigma_1,\sigma_n$ be a system of generators of the algebra of invariant
polynomials $\mathbb{C}[V]^G$. We study the problem of lifting mappings $f :
\mathbb{R}^q \supseteq U \to \sigma(V) \subseteq \mathbb{C}^n$ over the mapping
of invariants $\sigma=(\sigma_1,\sigma_n) : V \to \sigma(V)$. Note that
$\sigma(V)$ can be identified with the categorical quotient $V /\!\!/ G$ and
its points correspond bijectively to the closed orbits in $V$. We prove that,
if $f$ belongs to a quasianalytic subclass $\mathcal{C} \subseteq C^\infty$
satisfying some mild closedness properties which guarantee resolution of
singularities in $\mathcal{C}$ (e.g.\ the real analytic class), then $f$ admits
a lift of the same class $\mathcal{C}$ after desingularization by local
blow-ups and local power substitutions. As a consequence we show that $f$
itself allows for a lift which belongs to $SBV_{\operatorname{loc}}$ (i.e.\
special functions of bounded variation). If $\rho$ is a real representation of
a compact Lie group, we obtain stronger versions.
