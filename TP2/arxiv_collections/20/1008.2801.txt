Performing high-resolution, high-fidelity, three-dimensional simulations of
Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) requires not only algorithms that accurately
represent the correct physics, but also codes that effectively harness the
resources of the most powerful supercomputers. We are developing a suite of
codes that provide the capability to perform end-to-end simulations of SNe Ia,
from the early convective phase leading up to ignition to the explosion phase
in which deflagration/detonation waves explode the star to the computation of
the light curves resulting from the explosion. In this paper we discuss these
codes with an emphasis on the techniques needed to scale them to petascale
architectures. We also demonstrate our ability to map data from a low Mach
number formulation to a compressible solver.
