We present deep spectroscopic data for a 24-object subsample of our full
41-object z~0.5 radio galaxy sample in order to investigate the evolution of
the Fundamental Plane of radio galaxies. We find that the low-luminosity,
FRI-type, radio galaxies in our sample are consistent with the local
Fundamental Plane of radio galaxies defined by Bettoni et al. when corrected
for simple passive evolution of their stellar populations. However, we find
that the higher luminosity, FRII-type radio galaxies are inconsistent with the
local Fundamental Plane if only passive evolution is considered, and find
evidence for a rotation in the Fundamental Plane at z~0.5 when compared with
the local relation. We show that neither passive evolution, nor a
mass-dependent evolution in the mass-to-light ratio, nor an evolution in the
size of the host galaxies can, by themselves, plausibly explain the observed
tilt. However, we suggest that some combination of all three effects, with size
evolution as the dominant factor, may be sufficient to explain the difference
between the planes. We also find evidence for a correlation between host galaxy
velocity dispersion and radio luminosity at the 97% significance level within
our sub-sample, although further observations are required in order to
determine whether this is different for the FRI and FRII radio sources.
Assuming that the M_BH - sigma relation still holds at z~0.5, this implies that
radio luminosity scales with black hole mass, in agreement with previous
studies.
