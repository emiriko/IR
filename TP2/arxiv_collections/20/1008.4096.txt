We present an overview of photonic textile displays woven on a Jacquard loom,
using newly discovered polymer photonic bandgap fibers that have the ability to
change color and appearance when illuminated with ambient or transmitted light.
The photonic fiber can be thin (smaller than 300 microns in diameter) and
highly flexible, which makes it possible to weave in the weft on a computerized
Jacquard loom and develop intricate double weave structures together with a
secondary weft yarn. We demonstrate how photonic crystal fibers enable a
variety of color and structural patterns on the textile, and how dynamic
imagery can be created by balancing the ambient and emitted radiation. Finally,
a possible application in security ware for low visibility conditions is
described as an example.
