We review quark model calculations of the transverse momentum dependent
parton distributions (TMDs). For the T-even TMDs, we discuss the physical
origin of model relations which hold in a large class of quark models. For the
T-odd TMDs we review results in a light-cone constituent quark model (CQM) with
the final state interaction effects generated via single-gluon exchange
mechanism. As phenomenological application, we show the good agreement between
results in the light-cone CQM and available experimental data for the Collins
asymmetry.
