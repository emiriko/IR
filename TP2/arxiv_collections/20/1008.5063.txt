In this note we discuss a generalization ("extension") of the pre-lambda
structure on the Grothendieck ring of quasi-projective varieties and of the
corresponding power structure over it to the Grothendieck ring of stacks,
discuss some of their properties and give some explicit formulae for the
Kapranov zeta function for some stacks.
