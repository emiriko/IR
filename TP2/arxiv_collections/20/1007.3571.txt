Recently $f(T)$ theories based on modifications of teleparallel gravity where
torsion is the geometric object describing gravity instead of curvature have
been proposed to explain the present cosmic accelerating expansion. The field
equations are always second order, remarkably simpler than $f(R)$ theories. In
analogy to the $f(R)$ theory, we consider here three types of $f(T)$ gravity,
and find that all of them can give rise to cosmic acceleration with interesting
features, respectively.
