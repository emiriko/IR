Recently, the presence of noise has been found to play a key role in
assisting the transport of energy and information in complex quantum networks
and even in biomolecular systems. Here we propose an experimentally realizable
optical network scheme for the demonstration of the basic mechanisms underlying
noise-assisted transport. The proposed system consists of a network of coupled
quantum optical cavities, injected with a single photon, whose transmission
efficiency can be measured. Introducing dephasing in the photon path this
system exhibits a characteristic enhancement of the transport efficiency that
can be observed with presently available technology.
