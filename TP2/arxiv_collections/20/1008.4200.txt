We investigate radiation spectra arising from accelerated point-like
impurities in the homogeneous Bose-Einstein condensate. A general formula for
the radiation spectrum is obtained in the integral form as a function of given
impurity trajectory. The Planckian spectrum is obtained for a special
accelerated motion, which is shown to be unphysical. Non-Planckian spectrum is
found in the case of a uniformly accelerated impurity. We compare our result
with similar settings as discussed in other quantum many-body systems.
