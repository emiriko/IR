We explore numerically the flow induced in a spherical shell by
differentially rotating the inner and outer spheres. The fluid is also taken to
be electrically conducting (in the low magnetic Reynolds number limit), and a
magnetic field is imposed parallel to the axis of rotation. If the outer sphere
is stationary, the magnetic field induces a Shercliffe layer on the tangent
cylinder, the cylinder just touching the inner sphere and parallel to the
field. If the magnetic field is absent, but a strong overall rotation is
present, Coriolis effects induce a Stewartson layer on the tangent cylinder.
The non-axisymmetric instabilities of both types of layer separately have been
studied before; here we consider the two cases side by side, as well as the
mixed case, and investigate how magnetic and rotational effects interact. We
find that if the differential rotation and the overall rotation are in the same
direction, the overall rotation may have a destabilizing influence, whereas if
the differential rotation and the overall rotation are in the opposite
direction, the overall rotation always has a stabilizing influence.
