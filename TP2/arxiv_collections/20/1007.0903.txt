Mesoscopic systems in a slowly fluctuating environment are often well
described by superstatistical models. We develop a generalized statistical
mechanics formalism for superstatistical systems, by mapping the
superstatistical complex system onto a system of ordinary statistical mechanics
with modified energy levels. We also briefly review recent examples of
applications of the superstatistics concept for three very different subject
areas, namely train delay statistics, turbulent tracer dynamics, and cancer
survival statistics.
