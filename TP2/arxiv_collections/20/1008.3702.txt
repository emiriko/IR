We present the results of a combined experimental and theoretical
investigation of the surface-tension-driven coalescence of flexible structures.
Specifically, we consider the dynamics of the rise of a wetting liquid between
flexible sheets that are clamped at their upper ends. As the elasticity of the
sheets is progressively increased, we observe a systematic deviation from the
classical diffusive-like behaviour: the time to reach equilibrium increases
dramatically and the departure from classical rise occurs sooner, trends that
we elucidate via scaling analyses. Three distinct temporal regimes are
identified and subsequently explored by developing a theoretical model based on
lubrication theory and the linear theory of plates. The resulting free-boundary
problem is solved numerically and good agreement is obtained with experiments.
