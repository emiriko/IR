We extend the work in our earlier article [4] to show that time-periodic,
asymptotically-flat solutions of the Einstein equations analytic at scri, whose
source is one of a range of scalar-field models, are necessarily stationary. We
also show that, for some of these scalar-field sources, in stationary,
asymptotically-flat solutions analytic at scri, the scalar field necessarily
inherits the symmetry. To prove these results we investigate miscellaneous
properties of massless and conformal scalar fields coupled to gravity, in
particular Bondi mass and its loss.
