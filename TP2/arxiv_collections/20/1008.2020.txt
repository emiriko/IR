Superconducting metamaterials combine the advantages of low-loss, large
inductance (with the addition of kinetic inductance), and extreme tunability
compared to their normal metal counterparts. Therefore, they allow realization
of compact designs operating at low frequencies. We have recently developed
radio frequency (RF) metamaterials with a high loaded quality factor and an
electrical size as small as $\sim$$\lambda$658, ($\lambda$ is the free space
wavelength) by using Nb thin films. The RF metamaterial is composed of truly
planar spirals patterned with lithographic techniques. Linear transmission
characteristics of these metamaterials show robust Lorentzian resonant peaks in
the sub- 100 MHz frequency range below the $T_c$ of Nb. Though Nb is a
non-magnetic material, the circulating currents in the spirals generated by RF
signals produce a strong magnetic response, which can be tuned sensitively
either by temperature or magnetic field thanks to the superconducting nature of
the design. We have also observed strong nonlinearity and meta-stable jumps in
the transmission data with increasing RF input power until the Nb is driven
into the normal state. We discuss the factors modifying the induced magnetic
response from single and 1-D arrays of spirals in the light of numerical
simulations.
