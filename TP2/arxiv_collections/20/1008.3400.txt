We obtain the exact nonequilibrium work generating function (NEWGF), for a
small system consisting of a massive Brownian particle connected to internal
and external springs. The external work is provided to the system for a finite
time interval. The Jarzynski equality (JE), obtained in this case directly from
the NEWGF, is shown to be valid for the present model, in an exact way
regardless of the rate of external work.
