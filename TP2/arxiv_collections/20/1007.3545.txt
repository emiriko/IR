Pulsars provide a wealth of information about General Relativity, the
equation of state of superdense matter, relativistic particle acceleration in
high magnetic fields, the Galaxy's interstellar medium and magnetic field,
stellar and binary evolution, celestial mechanics, planetary physics and even
cosmology. The wide variety of physical applications currently being
investigated through studies of radio pulsars rely on: (i) finding interesting
objects to study via large-scale and targeted surveys; (ii) high-precision
timing measurements which exploit their remarkable clock-like stability. We
review current surveys and the principles of pulsar timing and highlight
progress made in the rotating radio transients, intermittent pulsars, tests of
relativity, understanding pulsar evolution, measuring neutron star masses and
the pulsar timing array.
