Recently, Silvestre proved that certain weak solutions of the slightly
supercritical surface quasi-geostrophic equation eventually become smooth. To
prove this, he employed a De Giorgi type argument originated in the work of
Caffarelli and Vasseur. Kiselev and Nazarov proved a variation of the result of
Caffarelli and Vasseur by introducing a class of test functions. Motivated by
the results of Silvestre, we will modify the class of test functions from the
work of Kiselev and Nazarov and use this modified class to show that a solution
to the supercritical SQG that is smooth up to a certain time must remain smooth
forever.
