We image the micro-electroluminescence (EL) spectra of self-assembled InAs
quantum dots (QDs) embedded in the intrinsic region of a GaAs p-i-n diode and
demonstrate optical detection of resonant carrier injection into a single QD.
Resonant tunneling of electrons and holes into the QDs at bias voltages below
the flat-band condition leads to sharp EL lines characteristic of individual
QDs, accompanied by a spatial fragmentation of the surface EL emission into
small and discrete light- emitting areas, each with its own spectral
fingerprint and Stark shift. We explain this behavior in terms of Coulomb
interaction effects and the selective excitation of a small number of QDs
within the ensemble due to preferential resonant tunneling paths for carriers.
