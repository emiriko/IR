We state and prove a generalized adiabatic theorem for Markov chains and
provide examples and applications related to Glauber dynamics of Ising model
over Z^d/nZ^d. The theorems derived in this paper describe a type of adiabatic
dynamics for l^1(R_+^n) norm preserving, time inhomogeneous Markov
transformations, while quantum adiabatic theorems deal with l^2(C^n) norm
preserving ones, i.e. gradually changing unitary dynamics in C^n.
