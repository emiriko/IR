On June 30th, 1908, there was a massive explosion over Tunguska, in Central
Siberia. A number of scientists have proposed that this Tunguska Phenomenon was
caused due to the tangential passage of an astral body that grazed the Earths'
atmosphere, underwent a partial explosion and later entered a heliocentric
orbit. It has also been argued that astral bodies might deposit microbes and
viruses on Earth (contributing to evolution and diseases) and may become
contaminated with Earthly microbes. The identity of the Tunguska Space Body
(TSB) is unknown though several likely candidates have been identified
including NEA 2005NB56, a known Near Earth Asteroid (NEA). NEA 2005NB56 made a
close approach to Earth when it was discovered in 2005 and will again cross
Earth orbit in 2045. This gives us a unique opportunity to send a Stardustlike
mission, the proposed Vernadskiy Mission, to analyze materials from NEA
2005NB56. We might be able to find some tell-tale components of Earth's
atmosphere and even Earth's microorganisms incorporated in NEA 2005NB56 thereby
proving beyond doubt the transfer of life from Earth to outer space.
