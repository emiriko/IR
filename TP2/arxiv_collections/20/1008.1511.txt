In the last few years there has been some interest in WIMP Dark Matter models
featuring a velocity dependent cross section through the Sommerfeld enhancement
mechanism, which is a nonrelativistic effect due to massive bosons in the dark
sector. In the first part of this article, we find analytic expressions for the
boost factor for three different model potentials, the Coulomb potential, the
spherical well and the spherical cone well and compare with the numerical
solution of the Yukawa potential. We find that the resonance pattern of all the
potentials can be cast into the same universal form. In the second part of the
article we perform a detailed computation of the Dark Matter relic density for
models having Sommerfeld enhancement by solving the Boltzmann equation
numerically. We calculate the expected distortions of the CMB blackbody
spectrum from WIMP annihilations and compare these to the bounds set by FIRAS.
We conclude that only a small part of the parameter space can be ruled out by
the FIRAS observations.
