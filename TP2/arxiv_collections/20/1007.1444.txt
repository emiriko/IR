When the Lake Louise Winter Institute started twenty-five years ago, many
properties of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) were believed to be true, but had
not been demonstrated to be true. This talk surveys a variety of results that
have been established with lattice gauge theory, directly from the QCD
Lagrangian, shedding light on the origin of (your) mass and its interplay with
dynamical symmetry breaking, as well as some further intriguing features of the
natural world.
