We derive the Bosonic Dynamical Mean-Field equations for bosonic atoms in
optical lattices with arbitrary lattice geometry. The equations are presented
as a systematic expansion in 1/z, z being the number of lattice neighbors.
Hence the theory is applicable in sufficiently high dimensional lattices. We
apply the method to a two-component mixture, for which a rich phase diagram
with spin-order is revealed.
