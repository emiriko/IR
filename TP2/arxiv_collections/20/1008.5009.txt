The unusual ratio of the neutron and proton transition matrix elements,
$M_n/M_p$, may indicate the exotic feature of decoupled neutron and proton
density distributions. In this contribution we show that these transition
matrix elements are not the same as the ones calculated within the
configuration-interaction shell model approach.
