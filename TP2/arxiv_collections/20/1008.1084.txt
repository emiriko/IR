We introduce the concept of hyperreflection groups, which are a
generalization of Coxeter groups. We prove the Deletion and Exchange Conditions
for hyperreflection groups, and we discuss special subgroups and fundamental
sectors of hyperreflection groups. In the second half of the paper, we prove
that Coxeter groups and graph products of groups are examples of
hyperreflection groups.
