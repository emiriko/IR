In this paper, we discuss the dissociative electron attachment process in
Methane. Kinetic energy and angular distributions of H^{-} and CH_{2}^{-}
fragment anions across the broad resonance about 10 eV is reported. Angular
distribution of H^{-} ions changes from being perpendicular to forward-backward
scattering across the resonance. Possibility of Jahn-Teller effect on
excitation of the triply degenerate 1t2 molecular orbital is inferred.
