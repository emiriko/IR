The low-temperature magnetic phase diagram of the multiferroic system
FeTe$_2$O$_5$Br down to 300 mK and up to 9 T is presented. Short-range magnetic
correlations within the crystal layers start to develop already at $\sim$50 K,
i.e., far above $T_{N1} \sim$ 11.0 K, where the system undergoes a magnetic
phase transition into the high-temperature incommensurate (HT-ICM) phase. Only
0.5 K lower, at $T_{N2}$, the system undergoes a second phase transition into
the low-temperature incommensurate amplitude-modulated (LT-ICM) phase
accompanied by a spontaneous electric polarization. When the magnetic field is
applied, the transition temperatures shift depending on the field orientation.
In the case of $B||b$ and $B >$ 4.5 T, the HT-ICM phase disappears along with
the electric polarization in the LT-ICM phase. The field dependence of the
magnetic transition temperatures is explained in the context of the magnetic
susceptibility behavior. Similarities and differences between the novel
amplitude-modulated and well-established helicoidal magnetoelectrics are
discussed.
