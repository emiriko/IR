In this paper, we develop the crystal basis theory for the quantum queer
superalgebra $\Uq$. We define the notion of crystal bases, describe the tensor
product rule, and present the existence and uniqueness of crystal bases for
finite-dimensional $\Uq$-modules in the category $\mathcal{O}_{int}^{\ge 0}$.
