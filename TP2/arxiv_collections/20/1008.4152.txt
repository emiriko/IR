We investigate potential biases in the measurements of exoplanet orbital
parameters obtained from radial velocity observations for single-planet
systems. We create a mock catalog of radial velocity data, choosing input
planet masses, periods, and observing patterns from actual radial velocity
surveys and varying input eccentricities. We apply Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) simulations and compare the resulting orbital parameters to the input
values. We find that a combination of the effective signal-to-noise ratio of
the data, the maximal gap in phase coverage, and the total number of periods
covered by observations is a good predictor of the quality of derived orbit
parameters. As eccentricity is positive definite, we find that eccentricities
of planets on nearly circular orbits are preferentially overestimated, with
typical bias of 1-2 times the median eccentricity uncertainty in a survey
(e.g., 0.04 in the Butler et al. 2006 catalog). When performing population
analysis, we recommend using the mode of the marginalized posterior
eccentricity distribution to minimize potential biases. While the Butler et al.
(2006) catalog reports eccentricities below 0.05 for just 17% of single-planet
systems, we estimate that the true fraction of e < 0.05 orbits is about
f(0.05)=38\pm 9%. For planets with P > 10 days, we find f(0.05)=28\pm 8% versus
10% from Butler et al. (2006). These planets either never acquired a large
eccentricity or were circularized following any significant eccentricity
excitation.
