We consider conditions under which an embedded eigenvalue of a self-adjoint
operator remains embedded under small perturbations. In the case of a simple
eigenvalue embedded in continuous spectrum of multiplicity m < \infty we show
that in favorable situations the set of small perturbations of a suitable
Banach space which do not remove the eigenvalue form a smooth submanifold of
co-dimension m.
