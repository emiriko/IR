This paper is concerned with the asymptotic spreading of a Lotka-Volterra
cooperative system. By using the theory of asymptotic spreading of
nonautonomous equations, the asymptotic speeds of spreading of unknown
functions formulated by a coupled system are estimated. Our results imply that
the asymptotic spreading of one species can be significantly fastened by
introducing a mutual species, which indicates the role of cooperation described
by the coupled nonlinearities.
