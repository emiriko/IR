Some 80-90 years ago, George A. Linhart, unlike A. Einstein, P. Debye, M.
Planck and W. Nernst, has managed to derive a very simple, but ultimately
general mathematical formula for heat capacity vs. temperature from the
fundamental thermodynamical principles, using what we would nowadays dub a
"Bayesian approach to probability". Moreover, he has successfully applied his
result to fit the experimental data for diverse substances in their solid state
in a rather broad temperature range. Nevertheless, Linhart's work was
undeservedly forgotten, although it does represent a valid and fresh standpoint
on thermodynamics and statistical physics, which may have a significant
implication for academic and applied science.
