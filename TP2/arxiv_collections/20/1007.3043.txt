In this paper we obtain violations of general bipartite Bell inequalities of
order $\frac{\sqrt{n}}{\log n}$ with $n$ inputs, $n$ outputs and
$n$-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Moreover, we construct explicitly, up to a
random choice of signs, all the elements involved in such violations: the
coefficients of the Bell inequalities, POVMs measurements and quantum states.
Analyzing this construction we find that, even though entanglement is necessary
to obtain violation of Bell inequalities, the Entropy of entanglement of the
underlying state is essentially irrelevant in obtaining large violation. We
also indicate why the maximally entangled state is a rather poor candidate in
producing large violations with arbitrary coefficients. However, we also show
that for Bell inequalities with positive coefficients (in particular, games)
the maximally entangled state achieves the largest violation up to a
logarithmic factor.
