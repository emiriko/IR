The mass of the triply heavy baryon Omega_bbb is calculated in lattice QCD
with 2+1 flavors of light sea quarks. The b quark is implemented with improved
lattice NRQCD. Gauge field ensembles from both the RBC/UKQCD and MILC
collaborations with lattice spacings in the range from 0.08 fm to 0.12 fm are
used. The final result for the Omega_bbb mass, which includes an electrostatic
correction, is 14.371+-0.004(stat)+-0.011(syst)+-0.001(exp) GeV. The hyperfine
splitting between the physical J=3/2 state and a fictitious J=1/2 state is also
calculated.
