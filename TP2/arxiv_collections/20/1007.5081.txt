We consider growth of nanoclusters and nanopillars in a model of surface
deposition and restructuring yielding morphologies of interest in designing
catalysis applications. Kinetic Monte Carlo numerical modeling yields examples
of the emergence of FCC-symmetry surface features, allowing evaluation of the
fraction of the resulting active sites with desirable properties, such as
(111)-like coordination, as well as suggesting the optimal growth regimes.
