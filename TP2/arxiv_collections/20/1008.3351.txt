We derive the three-loop dilatation operator of the flavor SU(2) subsector of
N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in the planar limit by a direct Feynman
diagram calculation in N=1 superspace. The transcendentality three
contributions which appear in intermediate steps cancel among each other,
leaving a rational result which confirms the predictions from integrability. We
derive finiteness conditions that allow us to avoid the explicit evaluation of
entire classes of Feynman graphs and also yield constraints on the D-algebra
manipulations. Based on these results, we discover universal cancellation
mechanisms. As a check for the consistency of our result, we verify the
cancellation of all higher-order poles.
