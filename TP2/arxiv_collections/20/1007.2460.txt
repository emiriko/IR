We describe computer algorithms that produce the complete set of isohedral
tilings by n-omino or n-iamond tiles in which the tiles are fundamental domains
and the tilings have 3-, 4-, or 6-fold rotational symmetry. The symmetry groups
of such tilings are of types p3, p31m, p4, p4g, and p6. There are no isohedral
tilings with symmetry groups p3m1, p4m, or p6m that have polyominoes or
polyiamonds as fundamental domains. We display the algorithms' output and give
enumeration tables for small values of n. This expands on our earlier works
(Fukuda et al 2006, 2008).
