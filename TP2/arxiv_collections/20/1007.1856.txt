We have studied second harmonic generation (SHG) in a polar ferrimagnet
GaFeO_3, employing a FeO_6 cluster model in which the Fe atom is slightly
shifted from the center of the octahedron. The electric-dipole transition could
take place between the 3d states through the effective hybridization of the 4p
states with the 3d states, due to the breaking of the space-inversion symmetry.
In the third-order perturbation with H_{int} = -(j.A)/c, we calculate the
probability per unit time, I_{\eta aa}, for the process that two photons are
absorbed with polarization parallel to the $a$ axis and one photon is emitted
with polarization parallel to the \eta (=a,b,c) axis. The calculated SHG
intensities consist of several peaks as a function of two-photon energy in
agreement with the experiments. It is found that the corresponding amplitude
S_{aaa} at each Fe site changes its sign while S_{baa} remains the same with
the reversal of the direction of the local magnetic moment. This implies that
I_{aaa} would disappear while I_{baa} would survive in the paramagnetic phase
in accordance with the experiment.
