We consider the hydrodynamic behavior of some conservative particle systems
with degenerate jump rates without exclusive constraints. More precisely, we
study the particle systems without restrictions on the total number of
particles per site with nearest neighbor exchange rates which vanish for
certain configurations. Due to the degeneracy of the rates, there exists
blocked configurations which do not evolve under the dynamics and all of the
hyperplanes of configurations with a fixed number particles can be decomposed
into different irreducible sets. We show that, for initial profiles smooth
enough and bounded away from zero, the macroscopic density profile evolves
under the diffusive time scaling according to a nonlinear diffusion equation
(which we call the modified porous medium equation). The proof is based on the
Relative Entropy method but it cannot be straightforwardly applied because of
the degeneracy.
