We consider the ground state of an atom in the framework of non-relativistic
qed.
  We assume that the ultraviolet cutoff is of the order of the Rydberg energy
and that the atomic Hamiltonian has a non-degenerate ground state. We show that
the ground state energy and the ground state are k-times continuously
differentiable functions of the fine structure constant and respectively the
square root of the fine structure constant on some nonempty interval [0,c_k).
