In view of the recent result from the anti-neutrino run of MiniBooNE, we
suggest to repeat the original Liquid Scintillator Neutrino Detector (LSND)
experiment using Super-Kamiokande, doped with Gadolinium, as detector. Due to
the more than 100 times larger detector mass offered by Super-Kamiokande, the
neutrino source requires a proton beam power of less than 300kW at a proton
energy around a 1 GeV. A one year run of this setup can corroborate or refute
both the LSND and MiniBooNE claims at more than 5 sigma confidence level. If a
signal is observed, the large size of Super-Kamiokande combined with its good
ability to determine the position of an anti-neutrino event allows to establish
the characteristic L/E-dependence of oscillation.
