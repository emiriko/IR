The ~800 yr-old pulsar J1846-0258 is a unique transition object between
rotation-powered pulsars and magnetars: though behaving like a rotation-powered
pulsar most of the time, in 2006 it exhibited a distinctly magnetar-like
outburst accompanied by a large glitch. Here we present X-ray timing
observations taken with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer over a 2.2-yr period
after the X-ray outburst and glitch had recovered. We observe that the braking
index of the pulsar, previously measured to be n=2.65+/-0.01, is now
n=2.16+/-0.13, a decrease of 18+/-5%. We also note a persistent increase in the
timing noise relative to the pre-outburst level. Despite the timing changes, a
2009 Chandra X-ray Observatory observation shows that the X-ray flux and
spectrum of the pulsar and its wind nebula are consistent with the quiescent
levels observed in 2000.
