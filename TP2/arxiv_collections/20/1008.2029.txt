We report resistivity $\rho$ and Hall effect measurements on EuFe$_2$As$_2$
at ambient pressure and 28 kbar and magnetization measurements at ambient
pressure. We analyze the temperature and magnetic-field dependence of $\rho$
and the Hall effect using a molecular-field theory for magnetoresistance and an
empirical formula for the anomalous Hall effect and find that electron
scattering due to the Eu$^{2+}$ local moments plays only a minor role in
determining electronic transport properties of EuFe$_2$As$_2$.
