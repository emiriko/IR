Within the replica approach to mean-field spin-glasses the transition from
ergodic high-temperature behaviour to the glassy low-temperature phase is
marked by the instability of the replica-symmetric saddle-point. For general
spin-glass models with non-Gaussian field distributions the corresponding
Hessian is a $2^n\times 2^n$ matrix with the number $n$ of replicas tending to
zero eventually. We block-diagonalize this Hessian matrix using representation
theory of the permutation group and identify the blocks related to the
spin-glass susceptibility. Performing the limit $n\to 0$ within these blocks we
derive expressions for the de~Almeida-Thouless line of general spin-glass
models. Specifying these expressions to the cases of the
Sherrington-Kirkpatrick, Viana-Bray, and the L\'evy spin glass respectively we
obtain results in agreement with previous findings using the cavity approach.
