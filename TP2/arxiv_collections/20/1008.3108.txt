Let X be a holomorphic symplectic manifold, of dimension divisible by 4, and
s an antisymplectic involution of X . The fixed locus F of s is a Lagrangian
submanifold of X ; we show that its \^A-genus is 1. As an application, we
determine all possibilities for the Chern numbers of F when X is a deformation
of the Hilbert square of a K3 surface.
