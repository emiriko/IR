We show that the popular ILC approach is unstable in respect to the division
of the sample of map pixels to the set of ``homogeneous'' subsamples. For
suitable choice of such subsamples we can obtain the restored CMB signal with
amplitudes ranged from zero to the amplitudes of the observed signal. We
propose approach which allows us to obtain reasonable estimates of $C_\ell$ at
$\ell\leq 30$ and similar to WMAP $C_\ell$ for larger $\ell$. With this
approach we reduce some anomalies of the WMAP results. In particular, our
estimate of the quadrupole is well consistent to theoretical one, the effect of
the ``axis of evil'' is suppressed and the symmetry of the north and south
galactic hemispheres increases. This results can change estimates of quadrupole
polarization and the redshift of reionization of the Universe. We propose also
new simple approach which can improve WMAP estimates of high $\ell$ power
spectrum.
