A short survey is provided about our recent explorations of the young topic
of noise-based logic. After outlining the motivation behind noise-based
computation schemes, we present a short summary of our ongoing efforts in the
introduction, development and design of several noise-based deterministic
multivalued logic schemes and elements. In particular, we describe classical,
instantaneous, continuum, spike and random-telegraph-signal based schemes with
applications such as circuits that emulate the brain's functioning and string
verification via a slow communication channel.
