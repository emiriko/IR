We report the first variational Monte Carlo (VMC) study of the iron-based
superconductors. We use realistic band structures, and the ordering
instabilities/variational ansatzs are suggested by previous functional
renormalization group calculations. We examine antiferromagnetism,
superconducting pairing, normal state fermi surface distortion, and orbital
order in the antiferromagnetic state.
