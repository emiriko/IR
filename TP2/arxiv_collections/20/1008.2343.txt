Based on a recent work by Schuller et al., a geometric representation of all
skewonless, non-birefringent, linear media is obtained. The derived
constitutive law is based on a "core", encoding the optical metric up to a
constant. All further corrections are provided by two (anti-)selfdual
bivectors, and an "axion". The bivectors are found to vanish if the optical
metric has signature (3,1) - that is, if the Fresnel equation is hyperbolic. We
propose applications of this result in the context of transformation optics and
premetric electrodynamics.
