In this review I discuss the application of scanning magnetic imaging to
fundamental studies of superconductors, concentrating on three scanning
magnetic microscopies - scanning SQUID microscopy (SSM), scanning Hall bar
microscopy (SHM), and magnetic force microscopy (MFM). I briefly discuss the
history, sensitivity, spatial resolution, invasiveness, and potential future
developments of each technique. I then discuss a selection of applications of
these microscopies.
