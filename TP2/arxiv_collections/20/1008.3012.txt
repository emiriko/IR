A new Schottky-gate Bipolar Mode Field Effect Transistor (SBMFET) is proposed
and verified by two-dimensional simulation. Unlike in the case of conventional
BMFET, which uses deep diffused p+-regions as the gate, the proposed device
uses the Schottky gate formed on the silicon planar surface for injecting
minority carriers into the drift region. The SBMFET is demonstrated to have
improved current gain, identical breakdown voltage and ON-voltage drop when
compared to the conventional BMFET. Since the fabrication of the SBMFET is much
simpler and obliterates the need for deep thermal diffusion of P+-gates, the
SBMFET is expected to be of great practical importance in medium-power
high-current switching applications.
