We study fractal measures on Euclidean space through the dynamics of "zooming
in" on typical points. The resulting family of measures (the "scenery"), can be
interpreted as an orbit in an appropriate dynamical system which often
equidistributes for some invariant distribution. The first part of the paper
develops basic properties of these limiting distributions and the relations
between them and other models of dynamics on fractals, specifically to Z\"ahle
distributions and Furstenberg's CP-processes. In the second part of the paper
we study the geometric properties of measures arising in these contexts,
specifically their behavior under projection and conditioning on subspaces.
