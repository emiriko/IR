According to the quantum interest conjecture any negative energy pulse must
be associated with a positive energy pulse of greater magnitude than that of
the negative energy pulse. In this paper we will demonstrate a counter-example
to this conjecture. We will show that, for a massless scalar field in 1-1D
space-time, it is possible to generate an "isolated" negative energy pulse.
