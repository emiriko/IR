The first LHC pp collisions at centre-of-mass energies of 0.9 and 2.36 TeV
were recorded by the CMS detector in December 2009. The trajectories of charged
particles produced in the collisions were reconstructed using the all-silicon
Tracker and their momenta were measured in the 3.8 T axial magnetic field.
Results from the Tracker commissioning are presented including studies of
timing, efficiency, signal-to-noise, resolution, and ionization energy.
Reconstructed tracks are used to benchmark the performance in terms of track
and vertex resolutions, reconstruction of decays, estimation of ionization
energy loss, as well as identification of photon conversions, nuclear
interactions, and heavy-flavour decays.
