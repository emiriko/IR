A tutorial is presented which demonstrates the theory and usage of the
Parker-Sochacki method of numerically solving systems of differential
equations. Solutions are demonstrated for the case of projectile motion in air,
and for the classical Newtonian N-body problem with mutual gravitational
attraction.
