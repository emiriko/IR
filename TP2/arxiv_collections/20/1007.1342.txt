Holes in a Mott insulator are represented by spinless fermions in the
fermion-boson model introduced by Edwards. Although the physically interesting
regime is for low to moderate fermion density the model has interesting
properties over the whole density range. It has previously been studied at
half-filling in the one-dimensional (1D) case by numerical methods, in
particular exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group
(DMRG). In the present study the one-particle Green's function is calculated
analytically by means of a decoupling scheme for the equations of motion, valid
for arbitrary density in 1D, 2D and 3D with fairly large boson energy and zero
boson relaxation parameter. The Green's function is used to compute some ground
state properties, and the one-fermion spectral function, for fermion densities
n=0.1, 0.5 and 0.9 in the 1D case. The results are generally in good agreement
with numerical results obtained by DMRG and dynamical DMRG and new light is
shed on the nature of the ground state at different fillings. The Green's
function approximation is sufficiently successful in 1D to justify future
application to the 2D and 3D cases.
