Magnesium diboride (MgB2) thin films are a potential alternative to
low-temperature superconductors (LTS) due to a higher critical temperature (Tc)
of approximately 39 K. The reactive evaporation deposition technique also
affords relatively simple growth of MgB2 films on flexible substrates compared
to high-temperature superconductors (HTS). We have designed and fabricated a
cable architecture consisting of MgB2 traces on flexible yttria-stabilized
zirconia (YSZ) compatible with commercially available connectors or direct
wirebonds. Key performance metrics such as critical current density (Jc) and Tc
are measured and compared. We discuss thermal conductivity and passivation
schemes for these cables.
