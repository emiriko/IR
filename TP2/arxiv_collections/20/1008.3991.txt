We propose a calibrated two-dimensional cellular automaton model to simulate
pedestrian motion behavior. It is a v=4 (3) model with exclusion statistics and
random shuffled dynamics. The underlying regular grid structure results in a
direction-dependent behavior, which has in particular not been considered
within previous approaches. We efficiently compensate these grid-caused
deficiencies on model level.
