An analysis from the D0 Collaboration measuring the charge asymmetry A^b_sl
of like-sign dimuon events due to semileptonic b-hadron decays at the Fermilab
Tevatron Collider is described. It differs by 3.2 standard deviations from the
Standard Model prediction to provide first evidence of CPT-invariant anomalous
CP violation in the mixing of neutral B mesons, and is compared to the
CP-violating phase obtained from a D0 analysis of the time-dependent decay
angles in B0_s -> J/psi phi. If CPT violation is allowed, the dimuon asymmetry
also yields the first sensitivity to CPT violation in the B0_s system.
