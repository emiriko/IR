The behavior of fermions with two spin states that interact with a large
scattering length is constrained by universal relations that hold for any state
of the system. These relations involve a central property of the system called
the contact, which measures the number of pairs of fermions with different
spins that have small separations. The contact controls the thermodynamics of
the system as well as the large-momentum and high-frequency tails of
correlation functions. This review summarizes the current theoretical and
experimental status of these universal relations.
