Suppose a client, Alice, has outsourced her data to an external storage
provider, Bob, because he has capacity for her massive data set, of size n,
whereas her private storage is much smaller--say, of size O(n^{1/r}), for some
constant r > 1. Alice trusts Bob to maintain her data, but she would like to
keep its contents private. She can encrypt her data, of course, but she also
wishes to keep her access patterns hidden from Bob as well. We describe schemes
for the oblivious RAM simulation problem with a small logarithmic or
polylogarithmic amortized increase in access times, with a very high
probability of success, while keeping the external storage to be of size O(n).
To achieve this, our algorithmic contributions include a parallel MapReduce
cuckoo-hashing algorithm and an external-memory dataoblivious sorting
algorithm.
