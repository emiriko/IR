Extending the methods developed in the author's previous paper and using
adapted coordinate systems in two variables, an L^p boundedness theorem is
proven for maximal operators over hypersurfaces in R^3 when p > 2. When the
best possible p is greater than 2, the theorem typically provides sharp
estimates. This gives another approach to the subject of recent work of
Ikromov, Kempe, and Muller on this subject
