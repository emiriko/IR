Exchange interaction tends to favor collinear or coplanar magnetic orders in
rotationally invariant spin systems. Indeed, such magnetic structures are
usually selected by thermal or quantum fluctuations in highly frustrated
magnets. Here we show that a complex noncoplanar magnetic order with a
quadrupled unit cell is stabilized by itinerant electrons on the pyrochlore
lattice. Specifically we consider the Kondo-lattice and Hubbard models at
quarter filling. The electron Fermi 'surface' at this filling factor is
topologically equivalent to three intersecting Fermi circles. Perfect nesting
of the Fermi lines leads to magnetic ordering with multiple wavevectors and a
definite handedness. The chiral order might persist without magnetic order in a
chiral spin liquid at finite temperatures.
