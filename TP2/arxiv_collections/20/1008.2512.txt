We present first quantitative results of the surface magnetic field
measurements in selected M-dwarfs based on detailed spectra synthesis conducted
simultaneously in atomic and molecular lines of the FeH Wing-Ford
$F^4\,\Delta-X^4\,\Delta$ transitions. A modified version of the Molecular
Zeeman Library (MZL) was used to compute Land\'e g-factors for FeH lines in
different Hund's cases. Magnetic spectra synthesis was performed with the
Synmast code. We show that the implementation of different Hund's case for FeH
states depending on their quantum numbers allows us to achieve a good fit to
the majority of lines in a sunspot spectrum in an automatic regime. Strong
magnetic fields are confirmed via the modelling of atomic and FeH lines for
three M-dwarfs YZ~CMi, EV~Lac, and AD~Leo, but their mean intensities are found
to be systematically lower than previously reported. A much weaker field
($1.7-2$~kG against $2.7$~kG) is required to fit FeH lines in the spectra of
GJ~1224. Our method allows us to measure average magnetic fields in very
low-mass stars from polarized radiative transfer. The obtained results indicate
that the fields reported in earlier works were probably overestimated by about
$15-30$\%. Higher quality observations are needed for more definite results.
