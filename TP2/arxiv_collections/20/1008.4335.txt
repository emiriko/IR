The ASTrometric and phase-Referenced Astronomy (ASTRA) project will provide
phase referencing and astrometric observations at the Keck Interferometer,
leading to enhanced sensitivity and the ability to monitor orbits at an
accuracy level of 30-100 microarcseconds. Here we discuss recent scientific
results from ASTRA, and describe new scientific programs that will begin in
2010-2011. We begin with results from the "self phase referencing" (SPR) mode
of ASTRA, which uses continuum light to correct atmospheric phase variations
and produce a phase-stabilized channel for spectroscopy. We have observed a
number of protoplanetary disks using SPR and a grism providing a spectral
dispersion of ~2000. In our data we spatially resolve emission from dust as
well as gas. Hydrogen line emission is spectrally resolved, allowing
differential phase measurements across the emission line that constrain the
relative centroids of different velocity components at the 10 microarcsecond
level. In the upcoming year, we will begin dual-field phase referencing (DFPR)
measurements of the Galactic Center and a number of exoplanet systems. These
observations will, in part, serve as precursors to astrometric monitoring of
stellar orbits in the Galactic Center and stellar wobbles of exoplanet host
stars. We describe the design of several scientific investigations capitalizing
on the upcoming phase-referencing and astrometric capabilities of ASTRA.
