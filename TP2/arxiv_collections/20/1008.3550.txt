The exclusive processes in electron-ion ($eA$) interactions are an important
tool to investigate the QCD dynamics at high energies as they are in general
driven by the gluon content of the target, which is strongly subject to parton
saturation effects. In this paper we compute the cross sections for the
exclusive vector meson production as well as the deeply virtual Compton
scattering (DVCS) relying on the color dipole approach and considering the
numerical solution of the Balitsky-Kovchegov equation including running
coupling corrections (rcBK). The production cross sections obtained with the
rcBK solution and bCGC parametrization are very similar, the former being
slightly larger.
