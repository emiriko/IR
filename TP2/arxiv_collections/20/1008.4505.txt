We calculate the pressure, entropy density, trace anomaly and speed of sound
of the gluon plasma using the dilaton potential of Ref. arXiv:0911.0627[hep-ph]
in the dilaton-gravity theory of AdS/QCD. The finite temperature observables
are calculated from the Black Hole solutions of the Einstein equations, and
using the Bekenstein-Hawking equality of the entropy with the area of the
horizon. Renormalization is well defined, because the T=0 theory has asymptotic
freedom. Comparison with lattice simulations is made.
