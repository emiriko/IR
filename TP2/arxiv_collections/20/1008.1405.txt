We show that all results of Yasar and Ozer [Comput. Math. Appl. 59 (2010),
3203-3210] on symmetries and conservation laws of a "nonconservative
Fokker-Planck equation" can be easily derived from results existing in the
literature by means of using the fact that this equation is reduced to the
linear heat equation by a simple point transformation. Moreover nonclassical
symmetries and local and potential conservation laws of the equation under
consideration are exhaustively described in the same way as well as infinite
series of potential symmetry algebras of arbitrary potential orders are
constructed.
