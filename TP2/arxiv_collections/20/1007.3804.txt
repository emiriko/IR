We deploy algebraic complexity theoretic techniques for constructing
symmetric determinantal representations of for00504925mulas and weakly skew
circuits. Our representations produce matrices of much smaller dimensions than
those given in the convex geometry literature when applied to polynomials
having a concise representation (as a sum of monomials, or more generally as an
arithmetic formula or a weakly skew circuit). These representations are valid
in any field of characteristic different from 2. In characteristic 2 we are led
to an almost complete solution to a question of B\"urgisser on the
VNP-completeness of the partial permanent. In particular, we show that the
partial permanent cannot be VNP-complete in a finite field of characteristic 2
unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses.
