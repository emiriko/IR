We propose a minimal multi-agent model for the collective dynamics of opinion
formation in the society, by modifying kinetic exchange dynamics studied in the
context of income, money or wealth distributions in a society. This model has
an intriguing spontaneous symmetry breaking transition to polarized opinion
state starting from non-polarized opinion state. In order to analyze the model,
we introduce an iterative map version of the model, which has very similar
statistical characteristics. An approximate theoretical analysis of the
numerical results are also given, based on the iterative map version.
