I present estimates to justify previously proposed by me heuristic Dipole
Dynamical Model (DDM) of Ball Lightning (BL). The movement and energy supplying
to the dipole BL are due to the atmospheric electric field. Crucial for the
detailed analysis of BL is using the new relation of balance of the force of
atmospheric electric field (per unit mass of electron cloud) and dipole forces
electrons-ions within BL dipole (per unit mass of BL) as the first necessary
condition for the existance of BL as an integer. This model is unique because,
unlike existing static models, fundamental condition for the existence of Ball
Lightning is its forward motion. The virial theorem limiting BL power does not
apply to BL which is not closed system like the Sun or Galaxy systems and is
strongly dependent part of the infinitely extended in time and space large
system. Stability of BL is due to two free parameters with the fundamental role
of thermodynamic non-equilibrium, ionization, recombination and translational
movement with energy loss by radiation and also excess volumetric positive
charge. Stability of BL is not related to the presence of any external shells.
Polarization degree of BL plasma is characterized by polarizability factor
{\gamma}. An example is presented of calculating the stability of an option of
BL. There is also a possible connection of stability BL with statistical
distributions of the atmospheric electric field in time and space. Destruction
of BL can also occur due to arising kinematical instability at its accelerating
(or decelerating) movement. Maximal energy density in BL DDM does not exceed
the value Espec<(10(8) - 10(9)) J/m(3) decreasing with the growing BL radius.
Resulting indefinitely long BL lifetime is also discussed. BL has no outer
shell and no any inner rigid or elastic microstructure elements.
