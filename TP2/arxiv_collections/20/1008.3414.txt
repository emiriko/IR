We report on a quantitative investigation of the spin-dependent quasiparticle
lifetimes and electron correlation effects in ferromagnetic hcp Co(0001) by
means of spin and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. The experimental
spectra are compared in detail to state-of-the-art many-body calculations
within the dynamical mean field theory and the three-body scattering
approximation, including a full calculation of the one-step photoemission
process. From this comparison we conclude that although strong local many-body
Coulomb interactions are of major importance for the qualitative description of
correlation effects in Co, more sophisticated many-body calculations are needed
in order to improve the quantitative agreement between theory and experiment,
in particular concerning the linewidths. The quality of the overall agreement
obtained for Co indicates that the effect of non-local correlations becomes
weaker with increasing atomic number.
