The adsorption profiles and electronic structures of Pt$_n$ (n = 1--4)
clusters on stoichiometric, reduced and reconstructed rutile TiO$_2$(110)
surfaces were systematically studied using on site d-d Coulomb interaction
corrected hybrid density functional theory calculations. The atomic structure
of small Pt cluster adsorbates mainly depend on the stoichiometry of the
corresponding titania support. The cluster shapes on the bulk terminated ideal
surface look like their gas phase low energy structures. However, for instance,
they get significantly distorted on the reduced surfaces with increasing oxygen
vacancies. On non-stoichiometric surfaces, Pt--Ti coordination becomes dominant
in the determination of the adsorption geometries. The electronic structure of
Pt$_n$/TiO$_2$(110) systems can not be correctly described by pure DFT methods,
particularly for non-stoichiometric cases, due to the inappropriate treatment
of the correlation for $d$ electrons. We performed DFT+U calculations to give a
reasonable description of the reconstructed rutile (110) surface. Pt clusters
induce local surface relaxations that influence band edges of titania support,
and bring a number of band-gap states depending on the cluster size.
Significant band gap narrowing occurs upon Pt$_n$--surface interaction due to
adsorbate driven states on the bulk terminated and reduced surfaces. On the
other hand, they give rise to a band gap widening associated to partial
reoxidation of the reconstructed surface. No metallization arises even for
Pt$_4$ on rutile.
