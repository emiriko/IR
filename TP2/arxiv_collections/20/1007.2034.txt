As a possible source of the single transverse spin asymmetry, we study the
contribution from purely gluonic correlation represented by the twist-3
``three-gluon correlation" functions in the transversely polarized nucleon. We
first define a complete set of the relevant three-gluon correlation functions,
and then derive its contribution to the twist-3 single-spin-dependent cross
section for the $D$-meson production in semi-inclusive deep inelastic
scattering, which is relevant to determine the three-gluon correlations. Our
cross-section formula differs from the corresponding result in the literature,
and the origin of the discrepancy is clarified.
