This paper derives new algorithms for signomial programming, a generalization
of geometric programming. The algorithms are based on a generic principle for
optimization called the MM algorithm. In this setting, one can apply the
geometric-arithmetic mean inequality and a supporting hyperplane inequality to
create a surrogate function with parameters separated. Thus, unconstrained
signomial programming reduces to a sequence of one-dimensional minimization
problems. Simple examples demonstrate that the MM algorithm derived can
converge to a boundary point or to one point of a continuum of minimum points.
Conditions under which the minimum point is unique or occurs in the interior of
parameter space are proved for geometric programming. Convergence to an
interior point occurs at a linear rate. Finally, the MM framework easily
accommodates equality and inequality constraints of signomial type. For the
most important special case, constrained quadratic programming, the MM
algorithm involves very simple updates.
