We study the propagation of surface polaritons in a left-handed curved slab,
i.e. a curved slab made of a negative-refractive-index material. We consider
the effects of the slab curvature on their dispersion relations and
attenuations. We show more particularly that surface polaritons with a
"left-handed behavior" (i.e. with opposite group and phase velocities)
propagate without any attenuation.
