We present near-IR observations of the 2010 outburst of U Sco. JHK photometry
is presented on ten consecutive days starting from 0.59 days after outburst.
Such photometry can gainfully be integrated into a larger database of other
multi-wavelength data which aim to comprehensively study the evolution of U
Sco. Early near-IR spectra, starting from 0.56 days after outburst, are
presented and their general characteristics discussed. Early in the eruption,
we see very broad wings in several spectral lines, with tails extending up to
~10000km/s along the line of sight; it is unexpected to have a nova with
ejection velocities equal to those usually thought to be exclusive to
supernovae. From recombination analysis, we estimate an upper limit of
10^-4.64[+0.92.-0.74]Msun for the ejected mass.
