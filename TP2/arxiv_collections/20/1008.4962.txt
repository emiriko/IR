We show that the boundary between quark-dominated and hadron-dominated
regions of nuclear structure may be blurred by multi-nucleon quark clusters
arising from color percolation. Recent experiments supporting partial
percolation in cold nuclei and full percolation in hot/dense nuclear matter
include: deep inelastic lepton-nucleus scattering, relativistic heavy-ion
collisions and the binding energy in $^5 He_{\Lambda}$.
