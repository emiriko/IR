A measurement of the top-quark pair-production cross section in ppbar
collisions at sqrt{s}=1.96 TeV using data corresponding to an integrated
luminosity of 1.12/fb collected with the Collider Detector at Fermilab is
presented. Decays of top-quark pairs into the final states e nu + jets and mu
nu + jets are selected, and the cross section and the b-jet identification
efficiency are determined using a new measurement technique which requires that
the measured cross sections with exactly one and multiple identified b-quarks
from the top-quark decays agree. Assuming a top-quark mass of 175 GeV/c^2, a
cross section of 8.5+/-0.6(stat.)+/-0.7(syst.) pb is measured.
