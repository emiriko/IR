We have carried out neutron diffraction, muon spin relaxation (muSR) and
inelastic neutron scattering investigations on a polycrystalline sample of
CeOs2Al10 to investigate the nature of the phase transition observed near 29 K
in the resistivity and heat capacity. Our muSR data clearly reveal coherent
frequency oscillations below 28 K, indicating the presence of an internal field
at the muon site, which confirms the long-range magnetic ordering of the
Ce-moment below 28 K. Upon cooling the sample below 15 K, unusual behaviour of
the temperature dependent muSR frequencies may indicate either a change of the
muon site, consistent with the observation of superstructure reflections in
electron diffraction or a change of the ordered magnetic structure. Neutron
diffraction data do not reveal any clear sign of either magnetic Bragg peaks or
superlattice reflections. Furthermore, inelastic neutron scattering (INS)
measurements clearly reveal the presence of a sharp inelastic excitation near
11 meV between 5 K and 26 K, due to opening of a gap in the spin excitation
spectrum, which transforms into a broad response at and above 30 K. The
magnitude of the spin-gap (11 meV) as derived from the INS peak position agrees
very well with the gap value as estimated from the bulk properties.
