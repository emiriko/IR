In a recent paper published in this journal, Almeida and collaborators [Phys.
Rev. D \textbf{79}, 125022 (2009)] analyze the issue of fermion localization of
fermions on a brane constructed from two scalar fields coupled with gravity
(Bloch brane model). In this meritorious research the simplest Yukawa coupling
$\eta\bar{\Psi}\phi\chi\Psi$ was considered. In that work does not analyze the
zero mode in details. In this paper, the localization of fermions on two-field
thick branes is reinvestigated. It is found that the simplest Yukawa coupling
does not support the localization of fermions on the brane. In addition, the
problem of fermion localization for some other Yukawa couplings are analyzed.
It is shown that the zero mode for left-handed and right-handed fermions can be
localized on the brane depending on the values for the coupling constant $\eta$
and the Bloch brane's parameter $a$.
