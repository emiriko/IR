Despite the low elemental deuterium abundance in the Galaxy, enhanced
molecular D/H ratios have been found in the environments of low-mass star
forming regions, and in particular the Class 0 protostar IRAS 16293-2422. The
CHESS (Chemical HErschel Surveys of Star forming regions) Key Program aims at
studying the molecular complexity of the interstellar medium. The high
sensitivity and spectral resolution of the HIFI instrument provide a unique
opportunity to observe the fundamental 1,1,1 - 0,0,0 transition of the
ortho-D2O molecule, inaccessible from the ground, and to determine the
ortho-to-para D2O ratio. We have detected the fundamental transition of the
ortho-D2O molecule at 607.35 GHz towards IRAS 16293-2422. The line is seen in
absorption with a line opacity of 0.62 +/- 0.11 (1 sigma). From the previous
ground-based observations of the fundamental 1,1,0 - 1,0,1 transition of
para-D2O seen in absorption at 316.80 GHz we estimate a line opacity of 0.26
+/- 0.05 (1 sigma). We show that the observed absorption is caused by the cold
gas in the envelope of the protostar. Using these new observations, we estimate
for the first time the ortho to para D2O ratio to be lower than 2.6 at a 3
sigma level of uncertainty, to be compared with the thermal equilibrium value
of 2:1.
