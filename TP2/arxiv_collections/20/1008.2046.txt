Monochromatic gamma-rays are thought to be the smoking gun signal for
identifying the dark matter annihilation. However, the flux of monochromatic
gamma-rays is usually suppressed by the virtual quantum effects since dark
matter should be neutral and does not couple with gamma-rays directly. In the
work we study the detection strategy of the monochromatic gamma-rays in a
future space-based detector. The monochromatic gamma-ray flux is calculated by
assuming supersymmetric neutralino as a typical dark matter candidate. We
discuss both the detection focusing on the Galactic center and in a scan mode
which detects gamma-rays from the whole Galactic halo are compared. The
detector performance for the purpose of monochromatic gamma-rays detection,
with different energy and angular resolution, field of view, background
rejection efficiencies, is carefully studied with both analytical and fast
Monte-Carlo method.
