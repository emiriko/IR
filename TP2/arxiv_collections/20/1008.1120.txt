We study the production of heavy quarks, charm at BNL-RHIC ($\sqrt{s}$=200
GeV/nucleon) and CERN-LHC ($\sqrt{s}$=5.5 TeV/nucleon) and bottom at CERN-LHC
from heavy ions colliding at relativistic energies. We consider initial fusion
of gluons (and quark- anti-quark annihilation), pre-thermal parton interactions
and interactions in thermalized quark gluon plasma. We also consider
free-streaming partons as another extreme and compare the results with those
from a thermalized plasma of partons. The pre-thermal contribution is
calculated by considering interaction among partons having large transverse
momenta (jet-partons) after the initial interaction, and from passage of these
partons through a thermalized quark gluon plasma. Charm production from
pre-thermal processes is found to be comparable to that from prompt (initial)
interactions at LHC. It is suggested that this may have important implications
for the study of nuclear modification factor, R$_{\rm {AA}}$ as well as for
back-to-back correlation of heavy quarks and production of dileptons having a
large mass.
