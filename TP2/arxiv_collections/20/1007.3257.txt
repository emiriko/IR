The phase-space structure of our Galaxy holds the key to understand and
reconstruct its formation. The Lambda-CDM model predicts a richly structured
phase-space distribution of dark matter and (halo) stars, consisting of streams
of particles torn from their progenitors during the process of hierarchical
merging. While such streams quickly loose their spatial coherence in the
process of phase mixing, the individual stars keep their common origin
imprinted into their kinematic and chemical properties, allowing the recovery
of the Galaxy's individual "building blocks". The field of Galactic Archeology
has witnessed a dramatic boost over the last decade, thanks to the increasing
quality and size of available data sets. This is especially true for the solar
neighborhood, a volume of 1-2 kpc around the sun, where large scale surveys
like SDSS/SEGUE continue to reveal the full 6D phase-space information of
thousands of halo stars. In this review, I summarize the discoveries of stellar
halo streams made so far and give a theoretical overview over the search
strategies imployed. This paper is intended as an introduction to researchers
new to field, but also as a reference illustrating the achievements made so
far. I conclude that disentangling the individual fragments from which the
Milky Way was built requires more precise data that will ultimately be
delivered by the Gaia mission.
