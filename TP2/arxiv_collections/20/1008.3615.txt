The lowest order constrained variational (LOCV) technique has been used to
investigate some of the thermodynamic properties of spin polarized hot
asymmetric nuclear matter, such as the free energy, symmetry energy,
susceptibility and equation of state. We have shown that the symmetry energy of
the nuclear matter is substantially sensitive to the value of spin
polarization.
  Our calculations show that the equation of state of the polarized hot
asymmetric nuclear matter is stiffer for the higher values of the polarization
as well as the isospin asymmetry parameter. Our results for the free energy and
susceptibility show that the spontaneous ferromagnetic phase transition cannot
occur for hot asymmetric matter.
