This paper contains the first written exposition of some ideas (announced in
a previous survey) on an approach to quantum gravity based on Tomita-Takesaki
modular theory and A. Connes non-commutative geometry aiming at the
reconstruction of spectral geometries from an operational formalism of states
and categories of observables in a covariant theory. Care has been taken to
provide a coverage of the relevant background on modular theory, its
applications in non-commutative geometry and physics and to the detailed
discussion of the main foundational issues raised by the proposal.
