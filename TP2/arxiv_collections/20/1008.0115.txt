We revisit the mathematical formulation of the famous Jaynes-Cummings-Paul
Hamiltonian, which describes the interaction of a two-level atom with a single
mode of an electromagnetic cavity reservoir. We rigorously show that under the
condition of Ultrastrong coupling between the atom and cavity, in which the
transition frequency is comparable to the coupling frequency, the bosonic field
operators undergo non-sinusoidal time variations. As a result, the well-known
solutions to the Jaynes-Cummings-Paul model are no longer valid, even when the
rotating wave approximation is not used. We show how a correct mathematical
solution could be found instead.
