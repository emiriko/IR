While very often a hot intergalactic medium (IGM) is optically thin to
continuum radiation, the optical depth in resonant lines can be of order unity
or larger. Resonant scattering in the brightest X-ray emission lines can cause
distortions in the surface brightness distribution, spurious variations in the
abundance of heavy elements, changes in line spectral shapes and even
polarization of line emission. The magnitude of these effects not only depends
on the density, temperature and ionization state of the gas, but is also
sensitive to the characteristics of the gas velocity field. This opens a
possibility to use resonant scattering as a convenient and powerful tool to
study IGM properties. We discuss the application of these effects to galaxy
clusters.
