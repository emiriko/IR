We report resistivity, Hall coefficient, current-voltage characteristics, and
magneto-optical imaging measurements of epitaxial Co-doped BaFe_{2}As_{2} thin
films deposited on MgO(001) substrate. The Hall resistivity of the films has a
substantial contribution arising from anomalous Hall effect of ferromagnetic
components. The critical current density (J_{c}) of the films is ~2 MA/cm^{2}
at low temperatures. Differential magneto-optical images of the remanent state
give similar J_{c} values and also exhibit presence of extended defects in the
film.
