Comparison of programming languages is a common topic of discussion among
software engineers. Few languages ever become sufficiently popular that they
are used by more than a few people or find their niche in research or
education; but professional programmers can easily use dozens of different
languages during their career. Multiple programming languages are designed,
specified, and implemented every year in order to keep up with the changing
programming paradigms, hardware evolution, etc. In this paper we present a
comparative study between ten programming languages: Haskell, Java, Perl, C++,
AspectJ, COBOL, Ruby, PHP, Bash Scripts, and Scheme; with respect of the
following criteria: Secure programming practices, web applications development,
web services design and composition, object oriented-based abstraction,
reflection, aspect-orientation, functional programming, declarative
programming, batch scripting, and user interface prototype design.
