This paper proposes Leader in Charge (LiC), a reliable multicast architecture
for device-to-device (D2D) radio underlaying cellular networks. The
multicast-requesting user equipments (UEs) in close proximity form a D2D
cluster to receive the multicast packets through cooperation. In addition to
receiving the multicast packets from the eNB, UEs share what they received from
the multicast on short-range links among UEs, namely the D2D links, to exploit
the wireless resources a more efficient way. Consequently, we show that
utilizing the D2D links in cellular networks increases the throughput of a
multicast session by means of simulation. We also discuss some practical issues
facing the integration of LiC into the current cellular networks. In
particular, we propose efficient delay control mechanism to reduce the average
and maximum delay experienced by LiC users, which is further confirmed by the
simulation results.
