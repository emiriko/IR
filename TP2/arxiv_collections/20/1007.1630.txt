We consider boson shells in scalar electrodynamics coupled to Einstein
gravity. The interior of the shells can be empty space, or harbour a black hole
or a naked singularity. We analyze the properties of these types of solutions
and determine their domains of existence. We investigate the energy conditions
and present mass formulae for the composite black hole--boson shell systems. We
demonstrate that these types of solutions violate black hole uniqueness.
