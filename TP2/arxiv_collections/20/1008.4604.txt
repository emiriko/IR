We use photoluminescence spectroscopy of ''bright'' and ''dark'' exciton
states in single InP/GaInP quantum dots to measure hyperfine interaction of the
valence band hole with nuclear spins polarized along the sample growth axis.
The ratio of the hyperfine constants for the hole (C) and electron (A) is found
to be C/A~-0.11. In InP dots the contribution of spin 1/2 phosphorus nuclei to
the hole-nuclear interaction is weak, which enables us to determine
experimentally the value of C for spin 9/2 indium nuclei as C_In~-5 micro-eV.
This high value of C is in good agreement with recent theoretical predictions
and suggests that the hole-nuclear spin interaction has to be taken into
account when considering spin qubits based on holes.
