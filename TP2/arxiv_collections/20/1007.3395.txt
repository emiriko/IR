Gangbo and McCann showed that optimal transportation between hypersurfaces
generally leads to multivalued optimal maps - bivalent when the target surface
is strictly convex. In this paper we quantify H\"older continuity of the
bivalent map optimizing average distance squared between arbitrary measures
supported on Euclidean spheres.
