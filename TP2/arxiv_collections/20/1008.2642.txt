We present scanning tunneling microscopy studies of the LaOFeAs parent
compound of iron pnictide superconductors. Topographic imaging reveals two
types of atomically flat surfaces, corresponding to the exposed LaO layer and
FeAs layer respectively. On one type of surface, we observe strong standing
wave patterns induced by quasiparticle interference of two-dimensional surface
states. The distribution of scattering wavevectors exhibits pronounced two-fold
symmetry, consistent with the nematic electronic structure found in the
Ca(Fe1-xCox)2As2 parent state.
