1.5D Vlasov-Maxwell simulations are employed to model electromagnetic
emission generation in a fully self-consistent plasma kinetic model for the
first time in the solar physics context. The simulations mimic the plasma
emission mechanism and Larmor drift instability in a plasma thread that
connects the Sun to Earth with the spatial scales compressed appropriately. The
effects of spatial density gradients on the generation of electromagnetic
radiation are investigated. It is shown that 1.5D inhomogeneous plasma with a
uniform background magnetic field directed transverse to the density gradient
is aperiodically unstable to Larmor-drift instability. The latter results in a
novel effect of generation of electromagnetic emission at plasma frequency.
When density gradient is removed (i.e. when plasma becomes stable to
Larmor-drift instability) and a $low$ density, super-thermal, hot beam is
injected along the domain, in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic
field, plasma emission mechanism generates non-escaping Langmuir type
oscillations which in turn generate escaping electromagnetic radiation. It is
found that in the spatial location where the beam is injected, the standing
waves, oscillating at the plasma frequency, are excited. These can be used to
interpret the horizontal strips observed in some dynamical spectra. Quasilinear
theory predictions: (i) the electron free streaming and (ii) the beam long
relaxation time, in accord with the analytic expressions, are corroborated via
direct, fully-kinetic simulation. Finally, the interplay of Larmor-drift
instability and plasma emission mechanism is studied by considering $dense$
electron beam in the Larmor-drift unstable (inhomogeneous) plasma.
