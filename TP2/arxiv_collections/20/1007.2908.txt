We study multipartite entanglement in a system consisting of
indistinguishable fermions. Specifically, we have proposed a geometric
entanglement measure for N spin-1/2 fermions distributed over 2L modes (single
particle states). The measure is defined on the 2L qubit space isomorphic to
the Fock space for 2L single particle states. This entanglement measure is
defined for a given partition of 2L modes containing m >= 2 subsets. Thus this
measure applies to m <= 2L partite fermionic system where L is any finite
number, giving the number of sites. The Hilbert spaces associated with these
subsets may have different dimensions. Further, we have defined the local
quantum operations with respect to a given partition of modes. This definition
is generic and unifies different ways of dividing a fermionic system into
subsystems. We have shown, using a representative case, that the geometric
measure is invariant under local unitaries corresponding to a given partition.
We explicitly demonstrate the use of the measure to calculate multipartite
entanglement in some correlated electron systems. To the best of our knowledge,
there is no usable entanglement measure of m > 3 partite fermionic systems in
the literature, so that this is the first measure of multipartite entanglement
for fermionic systems going beyond the bipartite and tripartite cases.
