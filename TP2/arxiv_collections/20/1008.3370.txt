Monohydroxy alcohols show a structural relaxation and at longer time scales a
Debye-type dielectric peak. From spin-lattice relaxation experiments using
different nuclear probes an intermediate, slower-than-structural dynamics is
identified for n-butanol. Based on these findings and on diffusion
measurements, a model of self-restructuring, transient chains is proposed. The
model is demonstrated to explain consistently the so far puzzling observations
made for this class of hydrogen-bonded glass forming liquids.
