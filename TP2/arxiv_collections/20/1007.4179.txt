We investigate the entanglement features of the quantum states employed in
quantum algorithms. In particular, we analyse the multipartite entanglement
properties in the Deutsch-Jozsa, Grover and Simon algorithms. Our results show
that for these algorithms most instances involve multipartite entanglement.
