In the present work we investigated the validity of the generalized second
law (GSL) of thermo- dynamics in presence of interaction between DBI-essence
and other four candidates of dark energy namely modified Chaplygin gas,
hessence, tachyonic field and new agegraphic dark energy. It has been observed
that the GSL breaks down in presence of the interactions. However, the event
horizon remains to be an increasing function of time.
