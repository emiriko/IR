We study the general model of self-financing trading strategies in illiquid
markets introduced by Schoenbucher and Wilmott, 2000. A hedging strategy in the
framework of this model satisfies a nonlinear partial differential equation
(PDE) which contains some function g(alpha). This function is deep connected to
an utility function. We describe the Lie symmetry algebra of this PDE and
provide a complete set of reductions of the PDE to ordinary differential
equations (ODEs). In addition we are able to describe all types of functions
g(alpha) for which the PDE admits an extended Lie group. Two of three special
type functions lead to models introduced before by different authors, one is
new. We clarify the connection between these three special models and the
general model for trading strategies in illiquid markets. We study with the Lie
group analysis the new special case of the PDE describing the self-financing
strategies. In both, the general model and the new special model, we provide
the optimal systems of subalgebras and study the complete set of reductions of
the PDEs to different ODEs. In all cases we are able to provide explicit
solutions to the new special model. In one of the cases the solutions describe
power derivative products.
