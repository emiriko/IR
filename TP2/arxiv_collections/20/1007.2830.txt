We study the structure of the invariant of K3 surfaces with involution, which
we obtained using equivariant analytic torsion. It was known before that the
invariant is expressed as the Petersson norm of an automorphic form on the
moduli space. When the rank of the invariant sublattice of the K3-lattice with
respect to the involution is strictly bigger than 10, we prove that this
automorphic form is expressed as the tensor product of an explicit Borcherds
lift and Igusa's Siegel modular form.
