We study a stochastic process $X_t$ related to the Bessel and the Rayleigh
processes, with various applications in physics, chemistry, biology, economics,
finance and other fields. The stochastic differential equation is $dX_t =
(nD/X_t) dt + \sqrt{2D} dW_t$, where $W_t$ is the Wiener process. Due to the
singularity of the drift term for $X_t = 0$, different natures of boundary at
the origin arise depending on the real parameter $n$: entrance, exit, and
regular. For each of them we calculate analytically and numerically the
probability density functions of first-passage times or first-exit times.
Nontrivial behaviour is observed in the case of a regular boundary.
