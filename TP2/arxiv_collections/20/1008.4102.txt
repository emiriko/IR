The occurrence of parity-time reversal ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry breaking is
discussed in a non-Hermitian spin chain. The Hermiticity of the model is broken
by the presence of an alternating, imaginary, transverse magnetic field. A full
real spectrum, which occurs if and only if all the eigenvectors are
$\mathcal{PT}$ symmetric, can appear only in presence of dimerization, i.e.
only if the hopping amplitudes between nearest-neighbor spins assume alternate
values along the chain. In order to make a connection between such system and
the Hermitian world, we study the critical magnetic properties of the model and
look for the conditions that would allow to observe the same phase diagram in
the absence of the imaginary field. Such procedure amounts to renormalizing the
spin-spin coupling amplitudes.
