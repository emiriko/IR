Using a fundamental measure density functional theory we investigate both
bulk and inhomogeneous systems of the binary non-additive hard sphere model.
For sufficiently large (positive) non-additivity the mixture phase separates
into two fluid phases with different compositions. We calculate bulk
fluid-fluid coexistence curves for a range of size ratios and non-additivity
parameters and find that they compare well to simulation results from the
literature. Using the Ornstein-Zernike equation, we investigate the asymptotic,
r->infinity, decay of the partial pair correlation functions, g_ij(r). At low
densities there occurs a structural crossover in the asymptotic decay between
two different damped oscillatory modes with different wavelengths corresponding
to the two intra-species hard core diameters. On approaching the fluid-fluid
critical point there is Fisher-Widom crossover from exponentially damped
oscillatory to monotonic asymptotic decay. Using the density functional we
calculate the density profiles for the planar free fluid-fluid interface
between coexisting fluid phases. We show that the type of asymptotic decay of
g_ij(r) not only determines the asymptotic decay of the interface profiles, but
is also relevant for intermediate and even short-ranged behaviour. We also
determine the surface tension of the free fluid interface, finding that it
increases with non-additivity, and that on approaching the critical point
mean-field scaling holds.
