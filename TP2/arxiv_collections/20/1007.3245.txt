Magneto-optical traps (MOTs) of Er and Dy have recently been shown to exhibit
population-wide sub-Doppler cooling due to their near degeneracy of excited and
ground state Lande g factors. We discuss here an additional, unusual intra-MOT
sub-Doppler cooling mechanism that appears when the total Dy MOT cooling laser
intensity and magnetic quadrupole gradient increase beyond critical values.
Specifically, anisotropically sub-Doppler-cooled cores appear, and their
orientation with respect to the quadrupole axis flips at a critical ratio of
the MOT laser intensity along the quadrupole axis versus that in the plane of
symmetry. This phenomenon can be traced to a loss of the velocity-selective
resonance at zero velocity in the cooling force along directions in which the
atomic polarization is oriented by the quadrupole field. We present data
characterizing this anisotropic laser cooling phenomenon and discuss a
qualitative model for its origin based on the extraordinarily large Dy magnetic
moment and Dy's near degenerate g factors.
