The classification of relevant, marginal and irrelevant operators is studied
in the Randall-Sundrum spacetime. We find that there exist marginal and
interacting operators in the Randall-Sundrum spacetime unlike a
higher-dimensional effective theory near the free-field fixed point. This gives
a direction to treat quantum corrections in the field-theoretical framework
with extra dimensions by constructing models out of relevant and marginal
operators.
