I present a review of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH), with the aim of
providing a mathematically rigorous, clear derivation of the algorithms from
first principles. The method of discretising a continuous field into particles
using a smoothing kernel is considered, and also the errors associated with
this approach. A fully conservative form of SPH is then derived from the
Lagrangian, demonstrating the explicit conservation of mass, linear and angular
momenta and energy/entropy. The method is then extended to self-consistently
include spatially varying smoothing lengths, (self) gravity and various forms
of artificial viscosity, required for the correct treatment of shocks. Finally
two common methods of time integration are discussed, the Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg
and leapfrog integrators, along with an overview of time-stepping criteria.
