We give a combinatorial characterization of isotropic subspaces in the Orlik-
Solomon algebra of a hyperplane arrangement in terms of decorations of its
intersection lattice. We then use this characterization to prove a result that
relates these isotropic subspaces with linear systems supported on the
arrangement, for arrangements with isolated non-normal crossings of a
particular form.
