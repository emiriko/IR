We consider a statistical model for pairs of traded assets, based on a
Cointegrated Vector Auto Regression (CVAR) Model. We extend standard CVAR
models to incorporate estimation of model parameters in the presence of price
series level shifts which are not accurately modeled in the standard Gaussian
error correction model (ECM) framework. This involves developing a novel matrix
variate Bayesian CVAR mixture model comprised of Gaussian errors intra-day and
Alpha-stable errors inter-day in the ECM framework. To achieve this we derive a
novel conjugate posterior model for the Scaled Mixtures of Normals (SMiN CVAR)
representation of Alpha-stable inter-day innovations. These results are
generalized to asymmetric models for the innovation noise at inter-day
boundaries allowing for skewed Alpha-stable models.
  Our proposed model and sampling methodology is general, incorporating the
current literature on Gaussian models as a special subclass and also allowing
for price series level shifts either at random estimated time points or known a
priori time points. We focus analysis on regularly observed non-Gaussian level
shifts that can have significant effect on estimation performance in
statistical models failing to account for such level shifts, such as at the
close and open of markets. We compare the estimation accuracy of our model and
estimation approach to standard frequentist and Bayesian procedures for CVAR
models when non-Gaussian price series level shifts are present in the
individual series, such as inter-day boundaries. We fit a bi-variate
Alpha-stable model to the inter-day jumps and model the effect of such jumps on
estimation of matrix-variate CVAR model parameters using the likelihood based
Johansen procedure and a Bayesian estimation. We illustrate our model and the
corresponding estimation procedures we develop on both synthetic and actual
data.
