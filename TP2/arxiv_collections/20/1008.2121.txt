Constraint propagation is one of the basic forms of inference in many
logic-based reasoning systems. In this paper, we investigate constraint
propagation for first-order logic (FO), a suitable language to express a wide
variety of constraints. We present an algorithm with polynomial-time data
complexity for constraint propagation in the context of an FO theory and a
finite structure. We show that constraint propagation in this manner can be
represented by a datalog program and that the algorithm can be executed
symbolically, i.e., independently of a structure. Next, we extend the algorithm
to FO(ID), the extension of FO with inductive definitions. Finally, we discuss
several applications.
