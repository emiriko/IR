Most early twentieth century relativists --- Lorentz, Einstein, Eddington,
for examples --- claimed that general relativity was merely a theory of the
aether. We shall confirm this claim by deriving the Einstein equations using
aether theory. We shall use a combination of Lorentz's and Kelvin's conception
of the aether. Our derivation of the Einstein equations will not use the
vanishing of the covariant divergence of the stress-energy tensor, but instead
equate the Ricci tensor to the sum of the usual stress-energy tensor and a
stress-energy tensor for the aether, a tensor based on Kelvin's aether theory.
A crucial first step is generalizing the Cartan formalism of Newtonian gravity
to allow spatial curvature, as conjectured by Gauss and Riemann.
