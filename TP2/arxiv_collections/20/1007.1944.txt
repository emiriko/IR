To extract physics results from the recorded data, the LHC experiments are
using Grid computing infrastructure. The event data processing on the Grid
requires scalable access to non-event data (detector conditions, calibrations,
etc.) stored in relational databases. The database-resident data are critical
for the event data reconstruction processing steps and often required for
physics analysis. This paper reviews LHC experience with database technologies
for the Grid computing. List of topics includes: database integration with Grid
computing models of the LHC experiments; choice of database technologies;
examples of database interfaces; distributed database applications (data
complexity, update frequency, data volumes and access patterns); scalability of
database access in the Grid computing environment of the LHC experiments. The
review describes areas in which substantial progress was made and remaining
open issues.
