We define a two-step learner for RFSAs based on an observation table by using
an algorithm for minimal DFAs to build a table for the reversal of the language
in question and showing that we can derive the minimal RFSA from it after some
simple modifications. We compare the algorithm to two other table-based ones of
which one (by Bollig et al. 2009) infers a RFSA directly, and the other is
another two-step learner proposed by the author. We focus on the criterion of
query complexity.
