We report the results of a search for R parity violating (RPV) interactions
leading to the production of supersymmetric sneutrinos decaying into emu final
states using 5.3 fb^-1 of integrated luminosity collected by the D0 experiment
at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider. Having observed no evidence for production
of emu resonances, we set direct bounds on the RPV couplings lambda^'_311 and
lambda_312 as a function of sneutrino mass.
