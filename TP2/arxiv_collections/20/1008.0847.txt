We propose what we believe to be a novel type of optical source for
ultra-cold atomic Far Off-Resonance optical-dipole Traps (FORTs). The source is
based on an Erbium Amplified Spontaneous Emission (ASE) source that seeds a
high power Erbium Doped Fiber Amplifier (EDFA). The main interest of this
source is its very low coherence length, thus allowing an incoherent
superposition of several trapping beams without any optical interference. The
behavior of the superimposed beams is then a scalar sum greatly simplifying
complex configurations. As an illustration, we report an estimation of the
intensity noise of this source and an estimation of the atomic excess heating
rate for an evaporative cooling experiment application. They are both found to
be suitable for cold atoms experiments.
