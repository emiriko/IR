We give a short, simple and conceptual proof, based on spin structures, of
sphere eversion: an embedded 2-sphere in $R^3$ can be turned inside out by
regular homotopy. Ingredients of this eversion are seamlessly connected. We
also give the mathematical origins of the proof: the Hopf fibration, and the
topological structure of real-projective 3-space.
