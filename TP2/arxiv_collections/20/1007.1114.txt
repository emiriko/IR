Recent results of particle production in the energy regime of the CERN-SPS
are reviewed. In order to collect information on the properties of the QCD
phase diagram systematic studies of the system size and the energy dependence
of particle production in heavy ion collisions have been performed. Net-baryon
distributions and results on strangeness production are discussed. The system
size dependence of many observables can be understood in the core-corona
approach, which has implications on the possibility to use system size as a
control parameter to study different areas of the phase diagram. Recent
attempts to search for a critical point, such as multiplicity fluctuations and
the transverse mass dependence of anti-baryon/baryon ratios are reviewed.
