A class of non-supersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model is proposed in
which there is a multiplicity of light scalar doublets in a multiplet of a
non-abelian family group with the Standard Model Higgs doublet. Anthropic
tuning makes the latter light, and consequently the other scalar doublets
remain light because of the family symmetry. The family symmetry greatly
constrains the pattern of FCNC and proton decay operators coming from
scalar-exchange. Such models show that useful constraints on model-building can
come from an extended naturalness principle when the electroweak scale is
anthropically tuned.
