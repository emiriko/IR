The electron and hole states in a CdTe quantum dot containing a single
magnetic impurity in an external magnetic field are investigated, using the
multiband approximation which includes the heavy hole-light hole coupling
effects. The electron-hole spin interactions and s,p-d interactions between the
electron, the hole and the magnetic impurity are also included. The exciton
energy levels and optical transitions are evaluated using the exact
diagonalization scheme. A novel mechanism is proposed here to manipulate
impurity-spin in the quantum dot which allows us to drive selectively the spin
of the magnetic atom into each of its six possible orientations.
