We discuss the topical and fundamental problem of strong-coupling between a
quantum dot an the single mode of a microcavity. We report seminal quantitative
descriptions of experimental data, both in the linear and in the nonlinear
regimes, based on a theoretical model that includes pumping and quantum
statistics.
