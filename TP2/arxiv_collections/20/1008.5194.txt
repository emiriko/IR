We study the non-Abelian statistics of quasiparticles in the Ising-type
quantum Hall states which are likely candidates to explain the observed Hall
conductivity plateaus in the second Landau level, most notably the one at
filling fraction nu=5/2. We complete the program started in Nucl. Phys. B 506,
685 (1997) and show that the degenerate four-quasihole and six-quasihole
wavefunctions of the Moore-Read Pfaffian state are orthogonal with equal
constant norms in the basis given by conformal blocks in a c=1+1/2 conformal
field theory. As a consequence, this proves that the non-Abelian statistics of
the excitations in this state are given by the explicit analytic continuation
of these wavefunctions. Our proof is based on a plasma analogy derived from the
Coulomb gas construction of Ising model correlation functions involving both
order and (at most two) disorder operators. We show how this computation also
determines the non-Abelian statistics of collections of more than six
quasiholes and give an explicit expression for the corresponding conformal
block-derived wavefunctions for an arbitrary number of quasiholes. Our method
also applies to the anti-Pfaffian wavefunction and to Bonderson-Slingerland
hierarchy states constructed over the Moore-Read and anti-Pfaffian states.
