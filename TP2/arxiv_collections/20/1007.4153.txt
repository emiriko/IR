Cyclotron resonance in highly doped graphene has been explored using infrared
magnetotransmission. Contrary to previous work, which only focused on the
magneto-optical properties of graphene in the quantum regime, here we study the
quasi-classical response of this system. We show that it has a character of
classical cyclotron resonance, with an energy which is linear in the applied
magnetic field and with an effective cyclotron mass defined by the position of
the Fermi level m = E_F/v_F^2.
