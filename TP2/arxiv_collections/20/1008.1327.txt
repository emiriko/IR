Advances in the technologies associated with position sensitive gaseous
detectors especially featuring CsI as reflective photoconverters will be
reviewed. These photodetectors represent the most effective solution for what
concerns cost and performance in the case of large area Cherenkov imaging
applications in relatively low rate (or low occupancy) high energy physics and
astrophysics experiments. Moreover, they are the only choice when the Cherenkov
detector is embedded in a magnetic field. Recently proposed single photon MPGDs
(Micropattern Gaseous Detectors) will be also discussed in view of the
successful efforts so far made to extend their sensitivity to visible light.
With some modifications, photosensitive gaseous detectors can also be used in
the imaging of X-rays and particles.
