The intrinsically secure communications graph (iS-graph) is a random graph
which captures the connections that can be securely established over a
large-scale network, in the presence of eavesdroppers. It is based on
principles of information-theoretic security, widely accepted as the strictest
notion of security. In this paper, we are interested in characterizing the
global properties of the iS-graph in terms of percolation on the infinite
plane. We prove the existence of a phase transition in the Poisson iS-graph,
whereby an unbounded component of securely connected nodes suddenly arises as
we increase the density of legitimate nodes. Our work shows that long-range
communication in a wireless network is still possible when a secrecy constraint
is present.
