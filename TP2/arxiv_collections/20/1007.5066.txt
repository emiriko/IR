The calculation of entanglement entropy S of quantum fields in spacetimes
with horizon shows that, quite generically, S (a) is proportional to the area A
of the horizon and (b) is divergent. I argue that this divergence, which arises
even in the case of Rindler horizon in flat spacetime, is yet another
indication of a deep connection between horizon thermodynamics and
gravitational dynamics. In an emergent perspective of gravity, which
accommodates this connection, the fluctuations around the equipartition value
in the area elements will lead to a minimal quantum of area, of the order of
L_P^2, which will act as a regulator for this divergence. In a particular
prescription for incorporating L_P^2 as zero-point-area of spacetime, this does
happen and the divergence in entanglement entropy is regularized, leading to S
proportional to (A/L_P^2) in Einstein gravity. In more general models of
gravity, the surface density of microscopic degrees of freedom is different
which leads to a modified regularisation procedure and the possibility that the
entanglement entropy - when appropriately regularised - matches the Wald
entropy.
