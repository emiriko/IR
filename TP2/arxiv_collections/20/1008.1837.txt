We give a combinatorial characterization of generic minimal rigidity for
planar periodic frameworks. The characterization is a true analogue of the
Maxwell-Laman Theorem from rigidity theory: it is stated in terms of a finite
combinatorial object and the conditions are checkable by polynomial time
combinatorial algorithms.
  To prove our rigidity theorem we introduce and develop periodic direction
networks and Z2-graded-sparse colored graphs.
