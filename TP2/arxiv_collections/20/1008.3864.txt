Glint, the specular reflection of sunlight off Earth's oceans, may reveal the
presence of oceans on an extrasolar planet. As an Earth-like planet nears
crescent phases, the size of the ocean glint spot increases relative to the
fraction of illuminated disk, while the reflectivity of this spot increases.
Both effects change the planet's visible reflectivity as a function of phase.
However, strong forward scattering of radiation by clouds can also produce
increases in a planet's reflectivity as it approaches crescent phases, and
surface glint can be obscured by Rayleigh scattering and atmospheric
absorption. Here we explore the detectability of glint in the presence of an
atmosphere and realistic phase-dependent scattering from oceans and clouds. We
use the NASA Astrobiology Institute's Virtual Planetary Laboratory 3-D
line-by-line, multiple-scattering spectral Earth model to simulate Earth's
broadband visible brightness and reflectivity over an orbit. Our validated
simulations successfully reproduce phase-dependent Earthshine observations. We
find that the glinting Earth can be as much as 100% brighter at crescent phases
than simulations that do not include glint, and that the effect is dependent on
both orbital inclination and wavelength, where the latter dependence is caused
by Rayleigh scattering limiting sensitivity to the surface. We show that this
phenomenon may be observable using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) paired
with an external occulter.
