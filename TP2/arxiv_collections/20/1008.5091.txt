We study the prospects and opportunities of a large muon electric dipole
moment (EDM) of the order (10^{-24} - 10^{-22}) ecm. We investigate how natural
such a value is within the general minimal supersymmetric extension of the
Standard Model with CP violation from lepton flavor violation in view of the
experimental constraints. In models with hybrid gauge-gravity mediated
supersymmetry breaking a large muon EDM is indicative for the structure of
flavor breaking at the Planck scale, and points towards a high messenger scale.
