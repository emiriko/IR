Given a connection on a meromorphic vector bundle over a compact Riemann
surface with reductive Galois group, we associate to it a projective variety.
Connections such that their associated projective variety are curves can be
classified, up to projective equivalence, using ruled surfaces. In particular,
such a meromorphic connection is the pullbacks of a Standard connection. This
extend a similar result by Klein for second-order ordinary linear differential
equations to a broader class of equations.
