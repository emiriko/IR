The dissipative XY model in two spatial dimensions belongs to a new
universality class of quantum critical phenomena with the remarkable property
of the decoupling of the critical fluctuations in space and time. We have shown
earlier that the quantum critical point is driven by proliferation in time of
topological configurations that we termed warps. We show here that a warp may
be regarded as a configuration of a monopoles surrounded symmetrically by
anti-monopoles so that the total charge of the configuration is zero. Therefore
the interaction with other warps is local in space. They however interact with
other warps at the same spatial point logarithmically in time. As a function of
dissipation warps unbind leading to a quantum phase transition. The critical
fluctuations are momentum independent but have power law correlations in time.
