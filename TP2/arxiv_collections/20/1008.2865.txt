The effects of mid-range repulsion in Lattice Boltzmann models on the
coalescence/breakup behaviour of single-component, non-ideal fluids are
investigated. It is found that mid-range repulsive interactions allow the
formation of spray-like, multi-droplet configurations, with droplet size
directly related to the strength of the repulsive interaction. The simulations
show that just a tiny ten-percent of mid-range repulsive pseudo-energy can
boost the surface/volume ratio of the phase- separated fluid by nearly two
orders of magnitude. Drawing upon a formal analogy with magnetic Ising systems,
a pseudo-potential energy is defined, which is found to behave like a
quasi-conserved quantity for most of the time-evolution. This offers a useful
quantitative indicator of the stability of the various configurations, thus
helping the task of their interpretation and classification. The present
approach appears to be a promising tool for the computational modelling of
complex flow phenomena, such as atomization, spray formation and
micro-emulsions, break-up phenomena and possibly glassy-like systems as well.
