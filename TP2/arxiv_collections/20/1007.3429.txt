This paper is concerned with the traveling waves of delayed
reaction-diffusion systems where the reaction function possesses the mixed
quasimonotonicity property. By the so-called monotone iteration scheme and
Schauder's fixed point theorem, it is shown that if the system has a pair of
coupled upper and lower solutions, then there exists at least a traveling wave
solution. More precisely, we reduce the existence of traveling waves to the
existence of an admissible pair of coupled quasi-upper and quasi-lower
solutions which are easy to construct in practice.
