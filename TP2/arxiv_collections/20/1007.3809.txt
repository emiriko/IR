The adhesion zone of immune cells, the 'immunological synapse', exhibits
characteristic domains of receptor-ligand complexes. The domain formation is
likely caused by a length difference of the receptor-ligand complexes, and has
been investigated in experiments in which T cells adhere to supported membranes
with anchored ligands. For supported membranes with two types of anchored
ligands, MHCp and ICAM1, that bind to the receptors TCR and LFA1 in the cell
membrane, the coexistence of domains of TCR-MHCp and LFA1-ICAM1 complexes in
the cell adhesion zone has been observed for a wide range of ligand
concentrations and affinities. For supported membranes with long and short
ligands that bind to the same cell receptor CD2, in contrast, domain
coexistence has been observed for a rather narrow ratio of ligand
concentrations. In this article, we determine detailed phase diagrams for cells
adhering to supported membranes with a statistical-physical model of cell
adhesion. We find a characteristic difference between the adhesion scenarios in
which two types of ligands in a supported membrane bind (i) to the same cell
receptor or (ii) to two different cell receptors, which helps to explain the
experimental observations. Our phase diagrams fully include thermal shape
fluctuations of the cell membranes on nanometer scales, which lead to a
critical point for the domain formation and to a cooperative binding of the
receptors and ligands.
