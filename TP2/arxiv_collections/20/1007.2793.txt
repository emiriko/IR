The magnetic chirality in solar atmosphere has been studied based on the soft
X-ray and magnetic field observations. It is found that some of large-scale
twisted soft X-ray loop systems occur for several months in the solar
atmosphere, before the disappearance of the corresponding background
large-scale magnetic field. It provides the observational evidence of the
helicity of the large-scale magnetic field in the solar atmosphere and the
reverse one relative to the helicity rule in both hemispheres with solar
cycles. The transfer of the magnetic helicity from the subatmosphere is
consistent with the formation of large-scale twisted soft X-ray loops in the
both solar hemispheres.
