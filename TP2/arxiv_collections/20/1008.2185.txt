This review is devoted to assess and compare various processes aiming at
recover CO2 from power plants fed with natural gas (NGCC) and pulverized coal
(PC). These processes are post combustion CO2 capture using chemical solvents,
natural gas reforming for pre-combustion capture and oxy-fuel combustion with
cryogenic recovery of CO2. These processes were evaluated to give some clues
for choosing the best option for each type of power plant. The comparison of
these various concepts suggests that, in the short and medium term, chemical
absorption is the most interesting process for NGCC power plants. For CP power
plants, oxy-combustion can be a very interesting option, as well as
post-combustion capture by chemical solvents.
