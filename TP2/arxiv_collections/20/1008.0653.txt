We compute the static-light baryon spectrum with N_f = 2 flavors of sea
quarks using Wilson twisted mass lattice QCD. As light valence quarks we
consider quarks, which have the same mass as the sea quarks with corresponding
pion masses in the range 340 MeV < m_PS < 525 MeV, as well as partially
quenched quarks, which have the mass of the physical s quark. We extract masses
of states with isospin I = 0, 1/2, 1, with strangeness S = 0, -1, -2, with
angular momentum of the light degrees of freedom j = 0, 1 and with parity P =
+, -. We present a preliminary extrapolation in the light u/d and an
interpolation in the heavy b quark mass to the physical point and compare with
available experimental results.
