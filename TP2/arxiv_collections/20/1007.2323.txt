The left-right symmetric model with doublet and bi-doublet Higgs scalars can
accommodate linear, inverse or double seesaw for generating small neutrino
masses in the presence of three singlet fermions. If the singlet fermions have
small Majorana masses, they can form three pairs of quasi-degenerate Majorana
fermions with three right-handed neutrinos. The decays of the quasi-degenerate
Majorana fermions can realize the resonant leptogenesis. Alternatively, the
right-handed neutrinos can obtain seesaw suppressed Majorana masses if the
singlet fermions are very heavy. In this case leptogenesis, with or without
resonant effect, is allowed in the decays of the right-handed neutrinos.
