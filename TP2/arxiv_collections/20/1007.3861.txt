We consider a singular Liouville equation on a compact surface, arising from
the study of Chern-Simons vortices in a self dual regime. Using new improved
versions of the Moser-Trudinger inequalities (whose main feature is to be
scaling invariant) and a variational scheme, we prove new existence results.
