We report on the fabrication of Nb/AlO_x/Pd_{0.82}Ni_{0.18}/Nb
superconductor/insulator/ferromagnetic metal/superconductor (SIFS) Josephson
junctions with high critical current densities, large normal resistance times
area products, high quality factors, and very good spatial uniformity. For
these junctions a transition from 0- to \pi-coupling is observed for a
thickness d_F ~ 6 nm of the ferromagnetic Pd_{0.82}Ni_{0.18} interlayer. The
magnetic field dependence of the \pi-coupled junctions demonstrates good
spatial homogeneity of the tunneling barrier and ferromagnetic interlayer.
Magnetic characterization shows that the Pd_{0.82}Ni_{0.18} has an out-of-plane
anisotropy and large saturation magnetization, indicating negligible dead
layers at the interfaces. A careful analysis of Fiske modes provides
information on the junction quality factor and the relevant damping mechanisms
up to about 400 GHz. Whereas losses due to quasiparticle tunneling dominate at
low frequencies, the damping is dominated by the finite surface resistance of
the junction electrodes at high frequencies. High quality factors of up to 30
around 200 GHz have been achieved. Our analysis shows that the fabricated
junctions are promising for applications in superconducting quantum circuits or
quantum tunneling experiments.
