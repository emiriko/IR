The thermal conductivity (TC) of isolated graphene with different
concentrations of isotopes (C13) is studied with equilibrium molecular dynamics
method at 300K. In the limit of pure C12 or C13 graphene, TC of graphene in
zigzag and armchair directions are ~630 W/mK and ~1000W/mK, respectively. We
find that the TC of graphene can be maximally reduced by ~80%, in both armchair
and zigzag directions, when a random distribution of C12 and C13 is assumed at
different doping concentrations. Therefore, our simulation results suggest an
effective way to tune the TC of graphene without changing its atomic and
electronic structure, thus yielding a promising application for nanoelectronics
and thermoelectricity of graphene based nano-device.
