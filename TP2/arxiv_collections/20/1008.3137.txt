We study rotating boson stars in five spacetime dimensions. The boson fields
consist of a complex doublet scalar field. Considering boson stars rotating in
two orthogonal planes with both angular momenta of equal magnitude, a special
ansatz for the boson field and the metric allows for solutions with nontrivial
dependence on the radial coordinate only. The charge of the scalar field equals
the sum of the angular momenta. The rotating boson stars are globally regular
and asymptotically flat. For our choice of a sixtic potential the rotating
boson star solutions possess a flat spacetime limit. We study the solutions in
flat and curved spacetime.
