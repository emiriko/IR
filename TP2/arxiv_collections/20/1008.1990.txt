This thesis is dedictaed to the study of fluctuation and correlation
observables of hadronic equilibrium systems. The statistical hadronization
model of high energy physics, in its ideal, i.e. non-interacting, gas
approximation will be investigated in different ensemble formulations. The
hypothesis of thermal and chemical equilibrium in high energy interaction will
be tested against qualitative and quantitative predictions.
