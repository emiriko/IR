We investigate theoretically the transmission properties through a p-n-p
junction on graphene. Here we show that the electronic transport property
presents deep analogies with light propagation. It originates from the
similarity between the linear spectrum of the Dirac fermions and photons that
obey the Maxwell's equations. We demonstrate the p-n-p channel acts as a
electronic fiber in which electrons propagate along the channel without
dissipation.
