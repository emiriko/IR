In the past years a wealth of observations has unraveled the structural
properties of dark and luminous mass distribution in galaxies, a benchmark for
understanding dark matter and the process of galaxy formation. The study of the
kinematics of over thousand spirals has evidenced a dark-luminous matter
coupling and the presence of a series of scaling laws, pictured by the
Universal Rotation Curve paradigm, an intriguing observational scenario not
easily explained by present theories of galaxy formation.
