In this paper we construct a new kind of positive solutions of $$\De
u-u+u^{p}=0 \text{on} \R^2$$ when $p> 2.$ These solutions
$\displaystyle{u(x,z)\sim \om(x-f(z))+ \sum_{i=1}^{\infty}\om_{0}((x,
z)-\xi_i\vec{e}_{1})}$ as $L\rightarrow +\infty$ where $\om$ is a unique
positive homoclinic solution of $\om"-\om+\om^{p}=0$ in $\R$ ; $\om_{0}$ is the
two dimensional positive solution and $\vec{e}_{1}= (1, 0)$ and $\xi_{j}$ are
points such that $\xi_{j}= jL+ \mathcal{O}(1)$ for all $j\geq 1.$ This
represents a first result on the {\em coexistence} of fronts and bumps.
Geometrically, our new solutions correspond to {\em triunduloid} in the theory
of CMC surface.
