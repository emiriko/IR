The launch of the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope has heralded a new era in
the study of gamma-ray pulsars. The population of confirmed gamma-ray pulsars
has gone from 6-7 to more than 60, and the superb sensitivity of the Large Area
Telescope (LAT) on Fermi has allowed the detailed study of their spectra and
light curves. Twenty-four of these pulsars were discovered in blind searches of
the gamma-ray data, and twenty-one of these are, at present, radio quiet,
despite deep radio follow-up observations. In addition, millisecond pulsars
have been confirmed as a class of gamma-ray emitters, both individually and
collectively in globular clusters. Recently, radio searches in the direction of
LAT sources with no likely counterparts have been highly productive, leading to
the discovery of a large number of new millisecond pulsars. Taken together,
these discoveries promise a great improvement in the understanding of the
gamma-ray emission properties and Galactic population of pulsars. We summarize
some of the results stemming from these newly-detected pulsars and their timing
and multi-wavelength follow-up observations.
