It is now feasible to host basic web services on a smart phone due to the
advances in wireless devices and mobile communication technologies. While the
applications are quite welcoming, the ability to provide secure and reliable
communication in the vulnerable and volatile mobile ad-hoc topologies is vastly
becoming necessary. The paper mainly addresses the details and issues in
providing secured communication and access control for the mobile web service
provisioning domain. While the basic message-level security can be provided,
providing proper access control mechanisms for the Mobile Host still poses a
great challenge. This paper discusses details of secure communication and
proposes the distributed semantics-based authorization mechanism.
