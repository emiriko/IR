We investigate the descriptional complexity of limited propagating
Lindenmayer systems and their deterministic and tabled variants with respect to
the number of rules and the number of symbols. We determine the decrease of
complexity when the generative capacity is increased. For incomparable
families, we give languages that can be described more efficiently in either of
these families than in the other.
