We derive and investigate the microscopic model of the quantum magnet
BiCu2PO6 using band structure calculations, magnetic susceptibility and
high-field magnetization measurements, as well as ED and DMRG techniques. The
resulting quasi-one-dimensional spin model is a two-leg AFM ladder with
frustrating next-nearest-neighbor couplings along the legs. The individual
couplings are estimated from band structure calculations and by fitting the
magnetic susceptibility with theoretical predictions, obtained using ED. The
nearest-neighbor leg coupling J1, the rung coupling J4, and one of the
next-nearest-neighbor couplings J2 amount to 120-150 K, while the second
next-nearest-neighbor coupling is J2'~J2/2. The spin ladders do not match the
structural chains, and although the next-nearest-neighbor interactions J2 and
J2' have very similar superexchange pathways, they differ substantially in
magnitude due to a tiny difference in the O-O distances and in the arrangement
of non-magnetic PO4 tetrahedra. An extensive ED study of the proposed model
provides the low-energy excitation spectrum and shows that the system is in the
strong rung coupling regime. The strong frustration by the
next-nearest-neighbor couplings leads to a triplon branch with an
incommensurate minimum. This is further corroborated by a strong-coupling
expansion up to second order in the inter-rung coupling. Based on high-field
magnetization measurements, we estimate the spin gap of 32 K and suggest the
likely presence of antisymmetric DM anisotropy and inter-ladder coupling J3. We
also provide a tentative description of the physics of BiCu2PO6 in magnetic
field, in the light of the low-energy excitation spectra and numerical
calculations based on ED and DMRG. In particular, we raise the possibility for
a rich interplay between one- and two-component Luttinger liquid phases and a
magnetization plateau at 1/2 of the saturation value.
