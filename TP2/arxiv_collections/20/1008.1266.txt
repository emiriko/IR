We investigate spectral properties of a discrete random displacement model, a
Schr\"odinger operator on $\ell^2(\Z^d)$ with potential generated by randomly
displacing finitely supported single-site terms from the points of a sublattice
of $\Z^d$. In particular, we characterize the upper and lower edges of the
almost sure spectrum. For a one-dimensional model with Bernoulli distributed
displacements, we can show that the integrated density of states has a
$1/\log^2$-singularity at external as well as internal band edges.
