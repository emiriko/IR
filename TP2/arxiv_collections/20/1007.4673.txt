In this work, we study and quantify properties of strong-field small-scale
convection and compare observed properties with those predicted by numerical
simulations. We analyze spectropolarimetric 630.25 nm data from a unipolar
ephemeral region near sun center. We use line-of-sight velocities and magnetic
field measurements obtained with Milne-Eddington inversion techniques along
with measured continuum intensities and Stokes V amplitude asymmetry at a
spatial resolution of 0.15 arcseconds to establish statistical relations
between the measured quantities. We also study these properties for different
types of distinct magnetic features, such as micropores, bright points,
ribbons, flowers and strings. We present the first direct observations of a
small-scale granular magneto-convection pattern within extended regions of
strong (more than 600 G average) magnetic field. Along the boundaries of the
flux concentrations we see mostly downflows and asymmetric Stokes V profiles,
consistent with synthetic line profiles calculated from MHD simulations. We
note the frequent occurrence of bright downflows along these boundaries. In the
interior of the flux concentrations, we observe an up/down flow pattern that we
identify as small-scale magnetoconvection, appearing similar to that of
field-free granulation but with scales 4 times smaller. Measured RMS velocities
are 70% of those of nearby field-free granulation, even though the average
radiative flux is not reduced. The interiors of these flux concentrations are
dominated by upflows.
