Using the Chandra X-ray Observatory, we have pinpointed the location of a
faint X-ray point source (CXOUJ182913.1-125113) and an associated diffuse
nebula in the composite supernova remnant G18.95-1.1. These objects appear to
be the long-sought pulsar and its wind nebula. The X-ray spectrum of the point
source is best described by an absorbed powerlaw model with Gamma=1.6 and an
N_H of ~1x10^(22) cm^(-2). This model predicts a relatively low unabsorbed
X-ray luminosity of about L_X (0.5-8.0keV) = 4.1x10^(31)D_2^2 erg s^(-1), where
D_2 is the distance in units of 2kpc. The best-fitted model of the diffuse
nebula is a combination of thermal (kT = 0.48keV) and non-thermal (1.4 < Gamma
< 1.9) emission. The unabsorbed X-ray luminosity of L_X = 5.4x10^(33)D_2^2 erg
s^(-1) in the 0.5-8keV energy band seems to be largely dominated by the thermal
component from the SNR, providing 87% of L_X in this band. No radio or X-ray
pulsations have been reported for CXOUJ182913.1-125113. If we assume an age of
~5300yr for G18.95-1.1 and use the X-ray luminosity for the pulsar and the wind
nebula together with the relationship between spin-down luminosity (via
magnetic dipole radiation) and period, we estimate the pulsar's period to be P
= 0.4s. Compared to other rotation-powered pulsars, a magnetic field of
2.2x10^(13)G is implied by its location in the P-Pdot diagram, a value which is
close to that of the quantum critical field.
