In previous reports (arXiv:0901.2487, arXiv:1007.0745), we introduced a new
fermionic variational wavefunction, suitable for interacting multi-species
systems and sustaining superfluidity. This disentangled wavefunction contains a
new quantum index. Here we introduce a general spin triplet version of this
wavefunction.
