There has been considerable recent work developing a new stochastic network
utility maximization framework using Backpressure algorithms, also known as
MaxWeight. A key open problem has been the development of utility-optimal
algorithms that are also delay efficient. In this paper, we show that the
Backpressure algorithm, when combined with the LIFO queueing discipline (called
LIFO-Backpressure), is able to achieve a utility that is within $O(1/V)$ of the
optimal value, while maintaining an average delay of $O([\log(V)]^2)$ for all
but a tiny fraction of the network traffic. This result holds for general
stochastic network optimization problems and general Markovian dynamics.
Remarkably, the performance of LIFO-Backpressure can be achieved by simply
changing the queueing discipline; it requires no other modifications of the
original Backpressure algorithm. We validate the results through empirical
measurements from a sensor network testbed, which show good match between
theory and practice.
