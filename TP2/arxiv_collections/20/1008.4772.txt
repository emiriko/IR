Present contribution represents a significant improvement of our previous
calculation of Maxwellian-averaged cross sections and astrophysical reaction
rates. Addition of newly-evaluated neutron reaction libraries, such as ROSFOND
and Low-Fidelity Covariance Project, and improvements in data processing
techniques allowed us to extend it for entire range of s-process nuclei,
calculate Maxwellian-averaged cross section uncertainties for the first time,
and provide additional insights on all currently available neutron-induced
reaction data. Nuclear reaction calculations using ENDF libraries and current
Java technologies will be discussed and new results will be presented.
