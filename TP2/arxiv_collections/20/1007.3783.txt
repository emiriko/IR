V2O3 nanocrystals can be synthesized through hydrothermal reduction of
VO(OH)2 using hydrazine as a reducing agent. Addition of different ligands to
the reaction produces nanoparticles, nanorods and nanoplatelets of different
sizes. Small nanoparticles synthesized in this manner show suppression of the
magnetic phase transition to lower temperatures. Using muon spin relaxation
spectroscopy and synchrotron x-ray diffraction, it is determined that the
volume fraction of the high-temperature phase, characterized by a rhombohedral
structure and paramagnetism, gradually declines with decreasing temperature, in
contrast to the sharp transition observed in bulk V2O3.
