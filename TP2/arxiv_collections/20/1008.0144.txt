We consider a particle system of the squared Bessel processes with index $\nu
> -1$ conditioned never to collide with each other, in which if $-1 < \nu < 0$
the origin is assumed to be reflecting. When the number of particles is finite,
we prove for any fixed initial configuration that this noncolliding diffusion
process is determinantal in the sense that any multitime correlation function
is given by a determinant with a continuous kernel called the correlation
kernel. When the number of particles is infinite, we give sufficient conditions
for initial configurations so that the system is well defined. There the
process with an infinite number of particles is determinantal and the
correlation kernel is expressed using an entire function represented by the
Weierstrass canonical product, whose zeros on the positive part of the real
axis are given by the particle-positions in the initial configuration. From the
class of infinite-particle initial configurations satisfying our conditions, we
report one example in detail, which is a fixed configuration such that every
point of the square of positive zero of the Bessel function $J_{\nu}$ is
occupied by one particle. The process starting from this initial configuration
shows a relaxation phenomenon converging to the stationary process, which is
determinantal with the extended Bessel kernel, in the long-term limit.
