We describe Monte Carlo models for the dynamical evolution of the massive
globular cluster 47 Tuc (NGC 104). The code includes treatments of two-body
relaxation, most kinds of three- and four-body interactions involving
primordial binaries and those formed dynamically, the Galactic tide, and the
internal evolution of both single and binary stars. We arrive at a set of
initial parameters for the cluster which, after 12Gyr of evolution, gives a
model with a fairly satisfactory match to surface brightness and density
profiles, the velocity dispersion profile, the luminosity function in two
fields, and the acceleration of pulsars. Our models appear to require a
relatively steep initial mass function for stars above about turnoff, with an
index of about 2.8 (where the Salpeter mass function has an index of 2.35), and
a relatively flat initial mass function (index about 0.4) for the lower main
sequence. According to the model, the current mass is estimated at 0.9 million
solar masses, of which about 34% consists of remnants. We find that primordial
binaries are gradually taking over from mass loss by stellar evolution as the
main dynamical driver of the core. Despite the high concentration of the
cluster, core collapse will take at least another 20Gyr.
