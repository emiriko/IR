The Maxwell's equations are solved when it has an inhomogeneous terms as a
source. The solution is very general in a sense that it handles arbitrary
current source and anisotropic media. The calculation is carried out in the
k-domain after Fourier transform, and its results are confirmed with the
propagators of the new coupling-free wave equations derived from the Maxwell
equations for anisotropic environments.
