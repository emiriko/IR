The Lorentz covariance of a non-linear, time-dependent relativistic wave
equation is demonstrated; the equation has recently been shown to have highly
interesting and significant empirical consequences. It is established here that
an operator already exists which ensures the relativistic properties of the
equation. Furthermore, we show that the time-dependent equation is gauge
invariant. The equation however, breaks Poincare symmetry via time translation
in a way consistent with its physical interpretation. It is also shown herein
that the Casimir invariant PmuPmu of the Poincare group, which corresponds to
the square of the rest mass M-squared can be expressed in terms of quaternions
such that M is described by an operator Q which has a constant norm and a phase
phi which varies in hypercomplex space.
