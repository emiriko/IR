We study motion of a charged particle in the vicinity of a weakly magnetized
Schwarzschild black hole and focus on its bounded trajectories lying in the
black hole equatorial plane. If the Lorentz force, acting on the particle, is
directed outward from the black hole, there exist two qualitatively different
types of trajectories, one is a curly motion and another one is a trajectory
without curls. We calculated the critical value of the magnetic field for the
transition between these two types. If the magnetic field is greater than the
critical one, for fixed values of the particle energy and angular momentum, the
bounded trajectory has curls. The curls appear as a result of the gravitational
drift. The greater the value of the magnetic field, the larger is the number of
curls. We constructed an approximate analytical solution for a bounded
trajectory and found the gravitational drift velocity of its guiding center.
