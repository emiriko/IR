We calculate the photon pair production rate in strong magnetic field created
in off-central heavy-ion collisions. Photon decay leads to depletion of the
photon yield by a few percent at RHIC and by as much as 20% at the LHC. It also
generates a substantial azimuthal asymmetry ("elliptic flow") of the final
photon distribution. We estimate v_2~2% at RHIC and v_2~14% at LHC. Photon
decay measurements is an important tool for studying the magnetic fields in
early stages of heavy-ion collisions.
