We present the results of numerical analysis of normal zone propagation in a
stack of $YBa_2Cu_3O_{7-x}$ coated conductors which imitates a pancake coil.
Our main purpose is to determine whether the quench protection quality of such
coils can be substantially improved by increased contact resistance between the
superconducting film and the stabilizer. We show that with increased contact
resistance the speed of normal zone propagation increases, the detection of a
normal zone inside the coil becomes possible earlier, when the peak temperature
inside the normal zone is lower, and stability margins shrink. Thus, increasing
contact resistance may become a viable option for improving the prospects of
coated conductors for high $T_c$ magnets applications.
