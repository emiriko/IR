We consider novel phylogenetic models with rate matrices that arise via the
embedding of a progenitor model on a small number of character states, into a
target model on a larger number of character states. Adapting
representation-theoretic results from recent investigations of Markov
invariants for the general rate matrix model, we give a prescription for
identifying and counting Markov invariants for such `symmetric embedded'
models, and we provide enumerations of these for low-dimensional cases. The
simplest example is a target model on 3 states, constructed from a general 2
state model; the `2->3' embedding. We show that for 2 taxa, there exist two
invariants of quadratic degree, that can be used to directly infer pairwise
distances from observed sequences under this model. A simple simulation study
verifies their theoretical expected values, and suggests that, given the
appropriateness of the model class, they have greater statistical power than
the standard (log) Det invariant (which is of cubic degree for this case).
