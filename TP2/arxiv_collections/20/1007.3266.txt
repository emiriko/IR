In our previous work, we identify the Sublattice-Pairing State (SPS) in
Schwinger-fermion representation as the spin liquid phase discovered in recent
numerical study on a honeycomb lattice. In this paper, we show that SPS is
identical to the zero-flux $Z_2$ spin liquid in Schwinger-boson representation
found by Wang\cite{Wang2010} by an explicit duality transformation. SPS is
connected to an \emph{unusual} antiferromagnetic ordered phase, which we term
as chiral-antiferromagnetic (CAF) phase, by an O(4) critical point. CAF phase
breaks the SU(2) spin rotation symmetry completely and has three Goldstone
modes. Our results indicate that there is likely a hidden phase transition
between CAF phase and simple AF phase at large $U/t$. We propose numerical
measurements to reveal the CAF phase and the hidden phase transition.
