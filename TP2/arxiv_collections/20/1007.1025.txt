We investigate inflection structure of a synthetic language using Latin as an
example. We construct a bipartite graph in which one group of vertices
correspond to dictionary headwords and the other group to inflected forms
encountered in a given text. Each inflected form is connected to its
corresponding headword, which in some cases in non-unique. The resulting sparse
graph decomposes into a large number of connected components, to be called word
groups. We then show how the concept of the word group can be used to construct
coverage curves of selected Latin texts. We also investigate a version of the
inflection graph in which all theoretically possible inflected forms are
included. Distribution of sizes of connected components of this graphs
resembles cluster distribution in a lattice percolation near the critical
point.
