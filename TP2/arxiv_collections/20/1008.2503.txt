We experimentally reveal an unconventional anomalous Hall effect (UAHE) in a
quasi-two-dimensional triangular-lattice antiferromagnet PdCrO2. Using high
quality single crystals of PdCrO2, we found that the Hall resistivity deviates
from the conventional behavior below T* = 20 K, noticeably lower than TN = 37.5
K, at which Cr^{3+} (S=3/2) spins order in a 120 degree structure. In view of
the theoretical expectation that the spin chirality cancels out in the simplest
120 degree spin structure, we discuss required conditions for the emergence of
UAHE within Berry-phase mechanisms.
