We study the excitation dynamics of an inhomogeneously broadened spin
ensemble coupled to a single cavity mode. The collective excitations of the
spin ensemble can be described in terms of generalized spin waves and, in the
absence of the cavity, the free evolution of the spin ensemble can be described
as a drift in the wave number without dispersion. In this article we show that
the dynamics in the presence of coupling to the cavity mode can be described
solely by a modified time evolution of the wave numbers. In particular, we show
that collective excitations with a well- defined wave number pass without
dispersion from negative to positive valued wave numbers without populating the
zero wave number spin wave mode. The results are relevant for multi-mode
collective quantum memories where qubits are encoded in different spin waves.
