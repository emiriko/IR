Far ultraviolet (FUV) spectral images of the Spica H II region are first
presented here for the Si II* 1533.4A and Al II 1670.8A lines and then compared
with the optical Halpha image. The H alpha and Si II* images show enhanced
emissions in the southern part of the H II region where H I density increases
outwards. This high density region, which we identify as part of the
"interaction ring" of the Loop I superbubble and the Local Bubble, seems to
bound the southern H II region. On the other hand, the observed profile of Al
II shows a broad central peak, without much difference between the northern and
southern parts, which we suspect results from multiple resonant scattering. The
extended tails seen in the radial profiles of the FUV intensities suggest that
the nebula may be embedded in a warm ionized gas. Simulation with a spectral
synthesis code yields the values of the Lyman continuum luminosity and the
effective temperature of the central star similar to previous estimates with
10^46.2 photons s^-1 and 26,000 K, respectively, but the density of the
northern H II region, 0.22 cm^-3, is much smaller than previous estimates for
the H alpha brightest region.
