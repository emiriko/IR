Nulling interferometry is still a promising method to characterize spectra of
exoplanets. One of the main issues is to cophase at a nanometric level each arm
despite satellite disturbances. The bench PERSEE aims to prove the feasibility
of that technique for spaceborne missions. After a short description of PERSEE,
we will first present the results obtained in a simplified configuration: we
have cophased down to 0.22 nm rms in optical path difference (OPD) and 60 mas
rms in tip/tilt, and have obtained a monochromatic null of 3E-5 stabilized at
3E-6. The goal of 1 nm with additional typical satellite disturbances requires
the use of an optimal control law; that is why we elaborated a dedicated Kalman
filter. Simulations and experiments show a good rejection of disturbances.
Performance of the bench should be enhanced by using a Kalman control law, and
we should be able to reach the desired nanometric stability. Following, we will
present the first results of the final polychromatic configuration, which
includes an achromatic phase shifter, perturbators and optical delay lines. As
a conclusion, we give the first more general lessons we have already learned
from this experiment, both at system and component levels for a future space
mission.
