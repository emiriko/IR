We discuss the problems of modeling, control, and decision support in complex
dynamic systems from a general system theoretic point of view. The main
characteristics of complex systems and of system approach to complex system
study are considered. We provide an overview and analysis of known existing
paradigms and methods of mathematical modeling and simulation of complex
systems, which support the processes of control and decision making. Then we
continue with the general dynamic modeling and simulation technique for complex
hierarchical systems functioning in control loop. Architectural and structural
models of computer information system intended for simulation and decision
support in complex systems are presented.
