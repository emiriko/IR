Turbulent color fields, which can arise in the early and late stages of
relativistic heavy ion collisions, may contribute significantly to the
transport processes in the matter created in these collisions. We review the
theory of these anomalous transport processes and discuss their possible
phenomenology in the glasma and quasistationary expanding quark-gluon plasma.
