The Minimal Supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model (MSSM) predicts
the existence of a light neutral Higgs boson. Once found at the LHC, its mass
will immediately become a precision observable. The theoretical value of the
Higgs mass Mh is subject to large radiative corrections. Due to the large top
Yukawa coupling, loops of top quarks and their superpartners provide the
dominant contribution to the radiative corrections.
  We present a calculation of the SUSY-QCD corrections to these diagrams, up to
the three-loop order. We find that our three-loop results can be in the range
of one GeV, and are thus relevant when compared with the expected experimental
accuracy at the LHC. We also find a significantly reduced dependency on the
renormalisation prescription, thus decreasing the theoretical uncertainty of
the prediction of Mh.
