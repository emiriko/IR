We present a fault-tolerant semi-global control strategy for universal
quantum computers. We show that N-dimensional array of qubits where only
(N-1)-dimensional addressing resolution is available is compatible with
fault-tolerant universal quantum computation. What is more, we show that
measurements and individual control of qubits are required only at the
boundaries of the fault-tolerant computer, i.e. holographic fault-tolerant
quantum computation. Our model alleviates the heavy physical conditions on
current qubit candidates imposed by addressability requirements and represents
an option to improve their scalability.
