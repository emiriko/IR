We present the third release of the AMBER data reduction software by the
JMMC. This software is based on core algorithms optimized after several years
of operation. An optional graphic interface in a high level language allows the
user to control the process step by step or in a completely automatic manner.
Ongoing improvement is the implementation of a robust calibration scheme,
making use of the full calibration sets available during the night. The output
products are standard OI-FITS files, which can be used directly in high level
software like model fitting or image reconstruction tools. The software
performances are illustrated on a full data set of calibrators observed with
AMBER during 5 years taken in various instrumental setup.
