The activities towards the fabrication and test of a 1 m3 semi-digital
hadronic calorime- ter are reviewed. The prototype sampling planes would
consist of 1 m2 Micromegas chambers with 1 cm2 granularity and embedded 2 bits
readout suitable for PFA calorime- try at an ILC detector. The design of the 1
m2 chamber is presented first, followed by an overview of the basic performance
of small prototypes. The basic units composing the 1 m2 chamber are 32 \times
48 cm2 boards with integrated electronics and a micro-mesh. Results of
character- ization tests of such boards are shown. Micromegas as a proportional
detector is well suited for semi-digital hadronic calorimetry. In order to
quantify the gain in perfor- mance when using one or more thresholds,
simulation studies are being carried out, some of which will be reported in
this contribution.
