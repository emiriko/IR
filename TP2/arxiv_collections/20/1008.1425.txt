The thermonuclear burn-up of highly compressed deuterated methane CD$_4$ is
considered in the spherical geometry. The minimal required values of the
burn-up parameter $x = \rho_0 \cdot r_f$ are determined for various
temperatures $T$ and densities $\rho_0$. It is shown that thermonuclear burn-up
in $CD_4$ becomes possible in practice if its initial density $\rho_0$ exceeds
$\approx 5 \cdot 10^3$ $g \cdot cm^{-3}$. Burn-up in CD$_2$T$_2$ methane
requires significantly ($\approx$ 100 times) lower compressions. The developed
approach can be used in order to compute the critical burn-up parameters in an
arbitrary deuterium containing fuel.
