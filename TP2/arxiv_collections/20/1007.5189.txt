The graviton 1-loop partition function in Euclidean topologically massive
gravity (TMG) is calculated using heat kernel techniques. The partition
function does not factorize holomorphically, and at the chiral point it has the
structure expected from a logarithmic conformal field theory. This gives strong
evidence for the proposal that the dual conformal field theory to TMG at the
chiral point is indeed logarithmic. We also generalize our results to new
massive gravity.
