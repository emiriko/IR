While the projections of Schubert varieties in a full generalized flag
manifold G/B to a partial flag manifold $G/P$ are again Schubert varieties, the
projections of Richardson varieties (intersections of Schubert varieties with
opposite Schubert varieties) are not always Richardson varieties. The
stratification of G/P by projections of Richardson varieties arises in the
theory of total positivity and also from Poisson and noncommutative geometry.
  In this paper we show that many of the geometric properties of Richardson
varieties hold more generally for projected Richardson varieties; they are
normal, Cohen-Macaulay, have rational singularities, and are compatibly
Frobenius split with respect to the standard splitting. Indeed, we show that
the projected Richardson varieties are the only compatibly split subvarieties,
providing an example of the recent theorem [Schwede, Kumar-Mehta] that a
Frobenius split scheme has only finitely many compatibly split subvarieties.
(The G/B case was treated by [Hague], whose proof we simplify somewhat.)
  One combinatorial analogue of a Richardson variety is the order complex of
the corresponding Bruhat interval in W; this complex is known to be an
EL-shellable ball [Bjorner-Wachs '82]. We prove that the projection of such a
complex into the order complex of the Bruhat order on W/W_P is again a
shellable ball. This requires extensive analysis of "P-Bruhat order", a
generalization of the k-Bruhat order of [Bergeron-Sottile '98]. In the case
that G/P is minuscule (e.g. a Grassmannian), we show that its Grobner
degeneration takes each projected Richardson variety to the Stanley-Reisner
scheme of its corresponding ball.
