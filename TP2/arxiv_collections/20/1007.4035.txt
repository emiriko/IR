An open question in the field of relativistic quantum information is how
parties in arbitrary motion may distribute and store quantum entanglement. We
propose a scheme for storing quantum information in the field modes of cavities
moving in flat space-time and analyze it in a quantum field theoretical
framework. In contrast to previous work that found entanglement degradation
between observers moving with uniform acceleration, we find the quantum
information in such systems is protected. We further discuss a method for
establishing the entanglement in the first place and show that in principle it
is always possible to produce maximally entangled states between the cavities.
