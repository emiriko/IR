By numerical simulation and variational analysis of the Gross-Pitaevskii
equation we study the localization, with an exponential tail, of a dipolar
Bose-Einstein condensate (DBEC) of $^{52}$Cr atoms in a three-dimensional
bichromatic optical-lattice (OL) generated by two monochromatic OL of
incommensurate wavelengths along three orthogonal directions. For a fixed
dipole-dipole interaction, a localized state of a small number of atoms ($\sim
1000$) could be obtained when the short-range interaction is not too attractive
or not too repulsive. A phase diagram showing the region of stability of a DBEC
with short-range interaction and dipole-dipole interaction is given.
