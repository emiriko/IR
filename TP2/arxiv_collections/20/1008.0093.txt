We investigate theoretically the polarization switching kinetics in
ferroelectric thin films. In such substances, the domain walls are pinned by
(usually dipole) defects, which are present also in ordered samples as
technologically unavoidable impurities. This random interaction with dipole
pinning centers results, in particular, in exponentially broad distribution of
switching times. Under supposition of low pinning centers concentration, we
derive the distribution function of switching times showing that it is not
simply Lorentzian (as it was first suggested by Tagantsev et al [\prb, {\bf
66}, 214109 (2002)] ), but is a "square of Lorentzian", which is due to the
vector nature of electric field. This improved formalism delivers a better
description of available experimental data and elucidates the physical
mechanism of domain switching times distribution.
