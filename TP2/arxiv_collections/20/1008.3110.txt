The action of inverse soft factors on scattering amplitudes in N=4 SYM is
shown to take a remarkably simple form in momentum twistor space. This is used
to identify individual residues of the grassmannian with primitive leading
singularities at NMHV and N^2MHV and to derive explicit expressions in terms of
momentum twistors.
