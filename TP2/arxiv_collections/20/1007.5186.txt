We investigate electric current in a single-electron tunnelling device weakly
coupled to an ac-driven underdamped harmonic nanomechanical oscillator. In the
linear regime, the current can respond to the external frequency in a resonant
as well as in an anti-resonant fashion. The main resonance is accompanied by an
additional resonance at a half of the external frequency.
