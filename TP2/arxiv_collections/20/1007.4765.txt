In this talk I review how to search for CP violation in top-quark pair
production and decay using T-odd correlations. I discuss two examples which
illustrate many of the relevant features: CP violation in a heavy neutral Higgs
boson; and CP violating anomalous top-quark couplings. I present some numerical
results for the LHC and some for the Tevatron.
