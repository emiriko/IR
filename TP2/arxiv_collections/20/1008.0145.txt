A direct WIMP (Weakly Interacting Massive Particle) detector with a neutron
veto system is designed to better reject neutrons. Two experimental
configurations are studied in the present paper: one is for an Xe detector
enclosed in a Gd-loaded scintillator and the other one is for an Xe detector
placed inside a reactor neutrino detector. The Gd-doped liquid scintillator (or
the neutrino detector) is used as a neutron veto device. The neutron
backgrounds for the two experimental designs have been estimated using Geant4
simulations. The results show that the neutron backgrounds can decrease to
O(0.1) events per year per tonne of liquid Xenon. We calculate the
sensitivities to spin-independent WIMP-nucleon elastic scattering. An exposure
of one tonne $\times$ year could reach a cross-section of about
6$\times$$10^{-11}$ pb.
