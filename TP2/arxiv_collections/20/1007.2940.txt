PSRB1055-52 is a middle-aged (~535 kyr) radio, X-ray, and gamma-ray pulsar
showing X-ray thermal emission from the neutron star (NS) surface. A candidate
optical counterpart to PSRB1055-52 was proposed by Mignani and coworkers based
on Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations performed in 1996, in one spectral
band only. We report on HST observations of this field carried out in 2008, in
four spectral bands. The astrometric and photometric analyses of these data
confirm the identification of the proposed candidate as the pulsar's optical
counterpart. Similarly to other middle-aged pulsars, its optical-UV spectrum
can be described by the sum of a power-law (PLO) component, presumably emitted
from the pulsar magnetosphere, and a Rayleigh-Jeans (RJ) component emitted from
the NS surface. The spectral index of the PLO component, alpha_O=1.05+/-0.34,
is larger than for other pulsars with optical counterparts. The RJ component,
with the brightness temperature TO=(0.66+/-0.10) d_350**2 R_O,13**-2 MK (where
d_350 and R_O,13 are the distance to the pulsar in units of 350 pc and the
radius of the emitting area in units of 13 km), shows a factor of 4 excess with
respect to the extrapolation of the X-ray thermal component into the
UV-optical. This hints that the RJ component is emitted from a larger, colder
area, and suggests that the distance to the pulsar is smaller than previously
thought. From the absolute astrometry of the HST images we measured the pulsar
coordinates with a position accuracy of 0.15". From the comparison with
previous observations we measured the pulsar proper motion, mu = 42+/-5 mas/yr,
which corresponds to a transverse velocity V_t = (70+/-8) d_350 km/s.
