We give a brief review of our recent QCD analysis carried out over the deep
inelastic scattering data on F2 structure function and in the non-singlet
approximation to the accuracy up to next-to-next-to-leading-order.
Specifically, analysis was performed over high statistics deep inelastic
scattering data provided by BCDMS, SLAC, NMC and BFP collaborations. For the
coupling constant the following value alpha_s(M_Z^2) = 0.1167 \pm 0.0022 was
found.
