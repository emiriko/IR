We compute the one loop new physics effects to the CP even triple neutral
gauge boson vertices $\gamma^\star \gamma Z$, $\gamma^\star Z \,Z$, $Z^\star
\,Z\,\gamma$ and $Z^\star\,Z\,Z$ in the context of Little Higgs models. In
addition, we re-examine the MSSM contribution at the chosen point of SPS1a' and
compare with the SM and Little Higgs models.
