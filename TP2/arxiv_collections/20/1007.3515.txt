Hybrid MKNF knowledge bases are one of the most prominent tightly integrated
combinations of open-world ontology languages with closed-world (non-monotonic)
rule paradigms. The definition of Hybrid MKNF is parametric on the description
logic (DL) underlying the ontology language, in the sense that non-monotonic
rules can extend any decidable DL language. Two related semantics have been
defined for Hybrid MKNF: one that is based on the Stable Model Semantics for
logic programs and one on the Well-Founded Semantics (WFS). Under WFS, the
definition of Hybrid MKNF relies on a bottom-up computation that has polynomial
data complexity whenever the DL language is tractable. Here we define a general
query-driven procedure for Hybrid MKNF that is sound with respect to the stable
model-based semantics, and sound and complete with respect to its WFS variant.
This procedure is able to answer a slightly restricted form of conjunctive
queries, and is based on tabled rule evaluation extended with an external
oracle that captures reasoning within the ontology. Such an (abstract) oracle
receives as input a query along with knowledge already derived, and replies
with a (possibly empty) set of atoms, defined in the rules, whose truth would
suffice to prove the initial query. With appropriate assumptions on the
complexity of the abstract oracle, the general procedure maintains the data
complexity of the WFS for Hybrid MKNF knowledge bases.
  To illustrate this approach, we provide a concrete oracle for EL+, a fragment
of the light-weight DL EL++. Such an oracle has practical use, as EL++ is the
language underlying OWL 2 EL, which is part of the W3C recommendations for the
Semantic Web, and is tractable for reasoning tasks such as subsumption. We show
that query-driven Hybrid MKNF preserves polynomial data complexity when using
the EL+ oracle and WFS.
