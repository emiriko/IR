We consider a hidden-variable theoretic description of successive
measurements of non commuting spin observables on a input spin-s state. In this
scenario, the hidden-variable theory leads to a Hardy-type argument that
quantum predictions violate it. We show that the maximum probability of success
of Hardy's argument in quantum theory is $(\frac{1}{2})^{4s}$, which is more
than in the spatial case.
