We synthesize and study the structural and optical properties of
nanocrystalline graphene monofluoride and graphite monofluoride, which are
carbon-based wide bandgap materials. Using laser excitations 2.41 - 5.08 eV, we
identify six emission modes of graphite monofluoride, spanning the visible
spectrum from red to violet. The energy and linewidth of the modes point to
defect-induced midgap states as the source of the photoemission. We discuss
possible candidates. Our findings open the window to electro-optical
applications of graphene fluoride.
