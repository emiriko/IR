One of the science drivers of the new Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) is
large-area surveys of the low-frequency radio sky. Realizing this goal requires
automated processing of the interferometric data, such that fully calibrated
images are produced by the system during survey operations. The LOFAR Imaging
Pipeline is the tool intended for this purpose, and is now undergoing
significant commissioning work. The pipeline is now functional as an automated
processing chain. Here we present several recent LOFAR images that have been
produced during the still ongoing commissioning period. These early LOFAR
images are representative of some of the science goals of the commissioning
team members.
