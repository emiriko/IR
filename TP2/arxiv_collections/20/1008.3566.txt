We report on two XMM-Newton observations of the planetary host star HD189733.
The system has a close in planet and it can potentially affect the coronal
structure via interactions with the magnetosphere. We have obtained X-ray
spectra and light curves from EPIC and RGS on board XMM-Newton which we have
analyzed and interpreted. We reduced X-ray data from primary transit and
secondary eclipse occurred in April 17th 2007 and May 18th 2009, respectively.
In the April 2007 observation only variability due to weak flares is
recognized. In 2009 HD189733 exhibited a X-ray flux always larger than in the
2007 observation. The average flux in 2009 was higher than in 2007 observation
by a factor of 45%. During the 2009 secondary eclipse we observed a softening
of the X-ray spectrum significant at level of ~3 sigma. Further, we observed
the most intense flare recorded at either epochs. This flare occurred 3 ks
after the end of the eclipse.The flare decay shows several minor ignitions
perhaps linked to the main event and hinting for secondary loops that emit
triggered by the main loop. Magneto-Hydro-Dynamical (MHD) simulations show that
the magnetic interaction between planet and star enhances the density and the
magnetic field in a region comprised between the planet and the star because of
their relative orbital/rotation motion. X-ray observations and model
predictions are globally found in agreement, despite the quite simple MHD model
and the lack of precise estimate of parameters including the alignment and the
intensity of stellar and planetary magnetic fields. Future observations should
confirm or disprove this hypothesis, by determining whether flares are
systematically recurring in the light curve at the same planetary phase.
