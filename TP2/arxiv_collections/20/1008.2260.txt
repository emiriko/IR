We analyse the recent experiments investigating the low-energy physics of
three lithium 6 atoms in different internal states with resonant two-body
scattering lengths. All observed features are qualitatively consistent with the
expected Efimov effect, i.e. the effective universal three-body attraction that
arises for large values of the scattering lengths. However, we find that a
quantitative description at negative energy requires non-universal two- and
three-body corrections due to presently unknown behaviour at short distance. An
attempt to implement these corrections is made through energy-dependent
parameters fitted to the experimental data.
