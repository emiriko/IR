We consider the spin orentation of the final Z bosons for the processes in
the Standard Model. We demonstrate that at the threshold energies of these
processes the analytical expressions for the Z boson polarization vectors and
alignment tensors coincide (e^+ e^- -> ZH, Z\gamma) or are very similar (e^+
e^- -> ZZ). In addition, we present interesting symmetry properties for the
spin orientation parameters.
