Using the Feynman-Vdovichenko combinatorial approach to the two dimensional
Ising model, we determine the exact Curie temperature for all two dimensional
Archimedean lattices. By means of duality, we extend our results to cover all
two dimensional Laves lattices. For those lattices where the exact critical
temperatures are not exactly known yet, we compare them with Monte Carlo
simulations.
