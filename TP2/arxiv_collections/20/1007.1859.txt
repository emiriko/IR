Using the quantum molecular dynamics model, we aim to investigate the emis-
sion of light complex particles, and degree of stopping reached in heavy-ion
colli- sions. We took incident energies between 50 and 1000 MeV/nucleon. In
addition, central and peripheral collisions and different masses are also
considered. We ob- serve that the light complex particles act in almost similar
manner as anisotropic ratio. In other words, multiplicity of light complex
particles is an indicator of global stopping in heavy-ion collisions. We see
that maximum light complex particles and stopping is obtained for heavier
masses in central collisions.
