The quasi-nonlocal quasicontinuum method (QNL) is a consistent hybrid
coupling method for atomistic and continuum models. Embedded atom models are
empirical many-body potentials that are widely used for FCC metals such as
copper and aluminum. In this paper, we consider the QNL method for EAM
potentials, and we give a stability and error analysis for a chain with
next-nearest neighbor interactions. We identify conditions for the pair
potential, electron density function, and embedding function so that the
lattice stability of the atomistic and the EAM-QNL models are asymptotically
equal.
