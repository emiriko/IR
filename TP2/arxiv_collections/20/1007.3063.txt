The hydrodynamics of quantized vortices and solitons in an atomic
Bose-Einstein condensate excited by an oscillating potential are studied by
numerically solving the two-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation. The
oscillating potential keeps nucleating vortex dipoles, whose impulses
alternatively change their direction synchronously with the oscillation of the
potential. This leads to synergy dynamics of vortices and solitons which have
not been previously reported in quantum fluids.
