We have systematically investigated the structural property and electrical
structures of the transition metal intercalated titanium disulfide compound
Fe$_x$TiS$_2$ ($0\leq x\leq0.33$) from angle-resolved photoelectron
spectroscopy with tunable polarized synchrotron radiation. The effect of
intercalation on the energy bands and density of states of the host material
around two high-symmetry points ($\Gamma, L$) is studied. Charge transfer from
the Fe atoms to the dichalcogenide layers leads to the movement of the Ti
3d-derived electron pocket. Two hybridized states are observed around $\sim500$
meV and Fermi level. Knowledge of hybridization among the Fe $3d$, Ti $3d$, and
S $3p$ states is very important to understand the physical of Fe$_x$TiS$_2$
system.
