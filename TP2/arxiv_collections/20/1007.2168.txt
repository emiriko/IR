The CEA/LETI and CEA/SAp started the development of far-infrared filled
bolometer arrays for space applications over a decade ago. The unique design of
these detectors makes possible the assembling of large focal planes comprising
thousands of bolometers running at 300 mK with very low power dissipation. Ten
arrays of 16x16 pixels were thoroughly tested on the ground, and integrated in
the Herschel/PACS instrument before launch in May 2009. These detectors have
been successfully commissioned and are now operating in their nominal
environment at the second Lagrangian point of the Earth-Sun system. In this
paper we briefly explain the functioning of CEA bolometer arrays, and we
present the properties of the detectors focusing on their noise
characteristics, the effect of cosmic rays on the signal, the repeatability of
the measurements, and the stability of the system.
