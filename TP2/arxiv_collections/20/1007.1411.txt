The Bianchi type III dark energy models with constant deceleration parameter
are investigated. The equation of state parameter $\omega$ is found to be time
dependent and its existing range for this model is consistent with the recent
observations of SN Ia data, SN Ia data (with CMBR anisotropy) and galaxy
clustering statistics. The physical aspect of the dark energy models are
discussed.
