We update our previous determination of both the decay constant and the mass
of the $D_s$ meson using the Highly Improved Staggered Quark formalism. We
include additional results at two finer values of the lattice spacing along
with improved determinations of the lattice spacing and improved tuning of the
charm and strange quark masses. We obtain $m_{D_s}$ = 1.9691(32) GeV, in good
agreement with experiment, and $f_{D_s}$ = 0.2480(25) GeV. Our result for
$f_{D_s}$ is 1.6$\sigma$ lower than the most recent experimental average
determined from the $D_s$ leptonic decay rate and using $V_{cs}$ from CKM
unitarity. Combining our $f_{D_s}$ with the experimental rate we obtain a
direct determination of $V_{cs} = 1.010(22)$, or alternatively $0.990 {+0.013
\atop -0.016}$ using a probability distribution for statistical errors for this
quantity which vanishes above 1. We also include an accurate prediction of the
decay constant of the $\eta_c$, $f_{\eta_c}$ = 0.3947(24) GeV, as a calibration
point for other lattice calculations.
