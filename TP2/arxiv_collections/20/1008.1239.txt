A 'PILOT-Like Telescope' is likely to have differences in science goals to
the original PILOT. Furthermore, our understanding of the environmental
conditions at Dome C has changed significantly since the start of the PILOT
design study in June 2007. Therefore, it is timely to re-examine some of the
basic design decisions. We present here one alternative concept: a
silicon-carbide, GLAO-assisted, three-mirror anastigmat, and possibly
equatorial, PILOT-Like-Telescope.
