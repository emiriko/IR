We present composite 3.6 and 4.5 micron luminosity functions for cluster
galaxies measured from the Spitzer Deep, Wide-Field Survey (SDWFS) for 0.3<z<2.
We compare the evolution of m* for these luminosity functions to models for
passively evolving stellar populations to constrain the primary epoch of star
formation in massive cluster galaxies. At low redshifts (z < 1.3) our results
agree well with models with no mass assembly and passively evolving stellar
populations with a luminosity-weighted mean formation redshift zf=2.4 assuming
a Kroupa initial mass function (IMF). We conduct a thorough investigation of
systematic biases that might influence our results, and estimate systematic
uncertainites of Delta zf=(+0.16-0.18) (model normalization), Delta
zf=(+0.40-0.05) (alpha), and Delta zf=(+0.30-0.45) (choice of stellar
population model). For a Salpeter type IMF, the typical formation epoch is thus
strongly constrained to be z ~2-3. Higher formation redshifts can only be made
consistent with the data if one permits an evolving IMF that is bottom-light at
high redshift, as suggested by van Dokkum et al 2008. At high redshift (z >
1.3) we also witness a statistically significant (>5sigma) disagreement between
the measured luminosity function and the continuation of the passive evolution
model from lower redshifts. After considering potential systematic biases that
might influence our highest redshift data points, we interpret the observed
deviation as potential evidence for ongoing mass assembly at this epoch.
