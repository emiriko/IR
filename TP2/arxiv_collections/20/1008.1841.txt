The HIJING (Heavy-ion Jet Interaction Generator) Monte Carlo model is updated
with the latest parton distributions functions (PDF) and new set of the
parameters in the two-component mini-jet model that controls total $p+p$ cross
section and the central pseudorapity density. We study hadron spectra and
multiplicity distributions using the HIJING 2.0 model and compare to recent
experimental data from $p+p$ collisions at the LHC energies. We also give
predictions of hadron production in $p+p$, $p+Pb$ and $Pb+Pb$ collisions at the
full LHC energy.
