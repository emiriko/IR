Using a nanomanipulation technique a nanodiamond with a single nitrogen
vacancy center is placed directly on the surface of a gallium phosphide
photonic crystal cavity. A Purcell-enhancement of the fluorescence emission at
the zero phonon line (ZPL) by a factor of 12.1 is observed. The ZPL coupling is
a first crucial step towards future diamond-based integrated quantum optical
devices.
