In this work, we systematically study the interaction of $D^*$ and nucleon,
which is stimulated by the observation of $\Lambda_c(2940)^+$ close to the
threshold of $D^*p$. Our numerical result obtained by the dynamical
investigation indicates the existence of the $D^*N$ systems with
$J^P=1/2^\pm,\,3/2^\pm$, which not only provides valuable information to
understand the underlying structure of $\Lambda_c(2940)^+$ but also improves
our knowledge of the interaction of $D^*$ and nucleon. Additionally, the bottom
partners of the $D^*N$ systems are predicted, which might be as one of the
tasks in LHCb experiment.
