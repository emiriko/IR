We propose a ribbon braided category approach to zeta-functions in q-deformed
geometry. As a proof of concept we compute $\zeta_t(C^n)$ where $C^n$ is viewed
as the standard representation in the category of modules of $U_q(sl_n)$. We
show that the same $\zeta_t(C^n)$ is obtained for the $n$-dimensional
representation in the category of $U_q(sl_2)$ modules. We show that this
implies and is equivalent to the generating function for the decomposition into
irreducibles of the symmetric tensor products $S^j(V)$ for $V$ an irreducible
representation of $sl_2$. We discuss $\zeta_t(C_q(S^2))$ for the standard
q-deformed sphere.
