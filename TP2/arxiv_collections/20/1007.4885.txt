We investigated the lattice Weinberg - Salam model without fermions for the
Higgs mass around $300$ GeV. On the phase diagram there exists the vicinity of
the phase transition between the physical Higgs phase and the unphysical
symmetric phase, where the fluctuations of the scalar field become strong while
Nambu monopoles are dense. According to our numerical results (obtained on the
lattices of sizes up to $20^3\times 24$) the maximal value of the ultraviolet
cutoff in the model cannot exceed the value around $1.4$ TeV.
