We propose a new method to analyze seismic time series and estimate the
arrival-times of seismic waves. Our approach combines two ingredients: the
times series are first lifted into a high-dimensional space using time-delay
embedding; the resulting phase space is then parametrized using a nonlinear
method based on the eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian. We validate our
approach using a dataset of seismic events that occurred in Idaho, Montana,
Wyoming, and Utah, between 2005 and 2006. Our approach outperforms methods
based on singular-spectrum analysis, waveleta nalysis, and STA/LTA.
