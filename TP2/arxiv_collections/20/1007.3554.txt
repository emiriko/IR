We present designs of 2D isotropic, disordered photonic materials of
arbitrary size with complete band gaps blocking all directions and
polarizations. The designs with the largest gaps are obtained by a constrained
optimization method that starts from a hyperuniform disordered point pattern,
an array of points whose number variance within a spherical sampling window
grows more slowly than the volume. We argue that hyperuniformity, combined with
uniform local topology and short-range geometric order, can explain how
complete photonic band gaps are possible without long-range translational
order. We note the ramifications for electronic and phononic band gaps in
disordered materials.
