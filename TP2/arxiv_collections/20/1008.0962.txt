We undertake a detailed analysis of the non-local properties of the
fundamental problem of two trapped, distinguishable neutral atoms which
interact with a short range potential characterised by an s-wave scattering
length. We show that this interaction generates continuous variable (CV)
entanglement between the external degrees of freedom of the atoms and consider
its behaviour as a function of both, the distance between the traps and the
magnitude of the inter-particle scattering length. We first quantify the
entanglement in the ground state of the system at zero temperature and then,
adopting a phase-space approach, test the violation of the
Clauser-Horn-Shimony-Holt inequality at zero and non-zero temperature and under
the effects of general dissipative local environments.
