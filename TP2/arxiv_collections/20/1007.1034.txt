We demonstrate how the two dominant constituents of the Universe, dark energy
and dark matter, could possess a large scattering cross-section without
considerably impacting observations. Unlike models involving energy exchange
between the two fluids, the background cosmology remains unaltered, leaving
fewer observational signatures. Following a brief review of the scattering
cross-sections between cosmologically significant particles, we explore the
implications of an elastic interaction between dark matter and dark energy. The
growth of large scale structure is suppressed, yet this effect is found to be
weak due to the persistently low dark energy density. Thus we conclude that the
dark matter-dark energy cross section may exceed the Thomson cross-section by
several orders of magnitude.
