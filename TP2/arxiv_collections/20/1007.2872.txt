A model is proposed such that quasi-particles (electrons or holes) residing
in the CuO2 planes of cuprates may interact leading to metallic or
superconducting behaviors. The metallic phase is obtained when the
quasi-particles are treated as having classical kinetic energies and the
superconducting phase occurs when the quasi-particles are taken as extremely
relativistic objects. The interaction between both kinds of particles is
provided by a force dependent-on-velocity. In the case of the superconducting
behavior, the motion of apical oxygen ions provides the glue to establish the
Cooper pair. The model furnishes explicit relations for the Fermi velocity, the
perpendicular and the in-plane coherence lengths, the zero-temperature energy
gap, the critical current density, the critical parallel and perpendicular
magnetic fields. All these mentioned quantities are expressed in terms of
fundamental physical constants as: charge and mass of the electron, light
velocity in vacuum, Planck constant, electric permittivity of the vacuum.
Numerical evaluation of these quantities show that their values are close those
found for the superconducting YBaCuO, leading to think the model as being a
possible scenario to explain superconductivity in cuprates.
