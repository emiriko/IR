In this paper we study monomial ideals attached to posets, introduce
generalized Hibi rings and investigate their algebraic and homological
properties. The main tools to study these objects are Groebner basis theory,
the concept of sortability due to Sturmfels and the theory of weakly
polymatroidal ideals.
