It is increasingly widely believed that at high levels of resolution
spacetime geometry may be inherently non-commutative. In this work we introduce
an effective mechanism that maps matter fields onto a non-commutative
background manifold. The mechanism, which is relevant at high densities in
strongly gravitating systems (black holes, early universe) deforms a density
field into two distinct fields, one residing dominantly on the lattice tops
(hereafter, on-cell) and the other residing dominantly in the inter-lattice
regions (hereafter, off-cell). The two fields have different physical and
themodynamic characterics which we describe, and some of which play a role in
halting singularity formation resulting from gravitational collpse. The
mechanism quantizes the fields, sets an upper bound on their density and
off-sets curvature singularity formation.
