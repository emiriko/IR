A design is a finite set of points in a space on which every "simple"
functions averages to its global mean. Illustrative examples of simple
functions are low-degree polynomials on the Euclidean sphere or on the Hamming
cube.
  We prove lower bounds on designs in spaces with a large group of symmetries.
These spaces include globally symmetric Riemannian spaces (of any rank) and
commutative association schemes with 1-transitive group of symmetries.
  Our bounds are, in general, implicit, relying on estimates on the spectral
behavior of certain symmetry-invariant linear operators. They reduce to the
first linear programming bound for designs in globally symmetric Riemannian
spaces of rank 1 or in distance regular graphs. The proofs are different
though, coming from viewpoint of abstract harmonic analysis in symmetric
spaces. As a dividend we obtain the following geometric fact: a design is large
because a union of "spherical caps" around its points "covers" the whole space.
