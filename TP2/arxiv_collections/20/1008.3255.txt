We study the conductance of a biased bilayer graphene flake with monolayer
nanoribbon contacts. We find that the transmission through the bilayer ribbon
strongly depends on the applied bias between the two layers and on the relative
position of the monolayer contacts. Besides the opening of an energy gap on the
bilayer, the bias allows to tune the electronic density on the bilayer flake,
making possible the control of the electronic transmission by an external
parameter.
