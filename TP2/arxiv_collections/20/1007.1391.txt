We study correlation functions of the totally asymmetric simple exclusion
process (TASEP) in discrete time with backward sequential update. We prove a
determinantal formula for the generalized Green function which describes
transitions between positions of particles at different individual time
moments. In particular, the generalized Green function defines a probability
measure at staircase lines on the space-time plane. The marginals of this
measure are the TASEP correlation functions in the space-time region not
covered by the standard Green function approach. As an example, we calculate
the current correlation function that is the joint probability distribution of
times taken by selected particles to travel given distance. An asymptotic
analysis shows that current fluctuations converge to the ${Airy}_2$ process.
