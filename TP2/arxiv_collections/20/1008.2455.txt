It is shown that the Hohenberg-Kohn lemma and theorem are direct consequences
of the statement that the ground state energy (or free energy) of a system of
interacting particles in an external field is a unique functional of the
potential of this field. This means that, if the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem is
valid, the nonuniform density in the equilibrium system and the external field
potential are biunique functionals. In this case, the nonuniform density is
intimately related to the inverse response function. On this basis, a regular
procedure can be constructed for determining the density functional for the
free energy or ground state energy.
