Observation of the interplay between interacting energy levels of two spin
species is limited by the difficulties in continuously tracking energy levels,
and thus leaves spin transport in quantum wires still not well understood. We
present a dc conductance feature in the non-equilibrium transport regime, a
direct indication that the first one-dimensional subband is filled mostly by
one spin species only. How this anomalous spin population changes with magnetic
field and source-drain bias is directly measured. We show the source-drain bias
changes spin polarisation in semiconductor nanowires, providing a fully
electrical method for the creation and manipulation of spin polarization as
well as spin-polarized currents.
