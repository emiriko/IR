DSPSR is a high-performance, open-source, object-oriented, digital signal
processing software library and application suite for use in radio pulsar
astronomy. Written primarily in C++, the library implements an extensive range
of modular algorithms that can optionally exploit both multiple-core processors
and general-purpose graphics processing units. After over a decade of research
and development, DSPSR is now stable and in widespread use in the community.
This paper presents a detailed description of its functionality, justification
of major design decisions, analysis of phase-coherent dispersion removal
algorithms, and demonstration of performance on some contemporary
microprocessor architectures.
