The progressive edge-growth algorithm is a well-known procedure to construct
regular and irregular low-density parity-check codes. In this paper, we propose
a modification of the original algorithm that improves the performance of these
codes in the waterfall region when constructing codes complying with both,
check and symbol node degree distributions. The proposed algorithm is thus
interesting if a family of irregular codes with a complex check node degree
distribution is used.
