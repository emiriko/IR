Homogeneous rotation symmetric Boolean functions have been extensively
studied in recent years because of their applications in cryptography. Little
is known about the basic question of when two such functions are affine
equivalent. The simplest case of quadratic rotation symmetric functions which
are generated by cyclic permutations of the variables in a single monomial was
only settled in 2009. This paper studies the much more complicated cubic case
for such functions. A new concept of \emph{patterns} is introduced, by means of
which the structure of the smallest group G_n, whose action on the set of all
such cubic functions in $n$ variables gives the affine equivalence classes for
these functions under permutation of the variables, is determined. We
conjecture that the equivalence classes are the same if all nonsingular affine
transformations, not just permutations, are allowed. This conjecture is
verified if n < 22. Our method gives much more information about the
equivalence classes; for example, in this paper we give a complete description
of the equivalence classes when n is a prime or a power of 3.
