The result provided in this paper helps complete a unified picture of the
scaling behavior in heavy-tailed stochastic models for transmission of packet
traffic on high-speed communication links. Popular models include infinite
source Poisson models, models based on aggregated renewal sequences, and models
built from aggregated on-off sources. The versions of these models with finite
variance transmission rate share the following pattern: if the sources connect
at a fast rate over time the cumulative statistical fluctuations are fractional
Brownian motion, if the connection rate is slow the traffic fluctuations are
described by a stable L\'evy process, while the limiting fluctuations for the
intermediate scaling regime are given by fractional Poisson motion.
