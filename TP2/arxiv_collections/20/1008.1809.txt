In the context of Answer Set Programming, this paper investigates
symmetry-breaking to eliminate symmetric parts of the search space and,
thereby, simplify the solution process. We propose a reduction of disjunctive
logic programs to a coloured digraph such that permutational symmetries can be
constructed from graph automorphisms. Symmetries are then broken by introducing
symmetry-breaking constraints. For this purpose, we formulate a preprocessor
that integrates a graph automorphism system. Experiments demonstrate its
computational impact.
