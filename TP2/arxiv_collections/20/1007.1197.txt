Subband structure and depolarization shifts in an ultra-high mobility
GaAs/Al_{0.24}Ga_{0.76}As quantum well are studied using magneto-infrared
spectroscopy via resonant subband Landau level coupling. Resonant couplings
between the 1st and up to the 4th subbands are identified by well-separated
anti-level-crossing split resonance, while the hy-lying subbands were
identified by the cyclotron resonance linewidth broadening in the literature.
In addition, a forbidden intersubband transition (1st to 3rd) has been
observed. With the precise determination of the subband structure, we find that
the depolarization shift can be well described by the semiclassical slab plasma
model, and the possible origins for the forbidden transition are discussed.
