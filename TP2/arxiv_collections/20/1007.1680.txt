Ellesmere Island, at the most northerly tip of Canada, possesses the highest
mountain peaks within 10 degrees of the pole. The highest is 2616 m, with many
summits over 1000 m, high enough to place them above a stable low-elevation
thermal inversion that persists through winter darkness. Our group has studied
four mountains along the northwestern coast which have the additional benefit
of smooth onshore airflow from the ice-locked Arctic Ocean. We deployed small
robotic site testing stations at three sites, the highest of which is over 1600
m and within 8 degrees of the pole. Basic weather and sky clarity data for over
three years beginning in 2006 are presented here, and compared with available
nearby sea-level data and one manned mid-elevation site. Our results point to
coastal mountain sites experiencing good weather: low median wind speed, high
clear-sky fraction and the expectation of excellent seeing. Some practical
aspects of access to these remote locations and operation and maintenance of
equipment there are also discussed.
