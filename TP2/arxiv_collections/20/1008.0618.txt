We study the effect of extended charge defects in electronic transport
properties of graphene. Extended defects are ubiquitous in chemically and
epitaxially grown graphene samples due to internal strains associated with the
lattice mismatch. We show that at low energies these defects interact quite
strongly with the 2D Dirac fermions and have an important effect in the
DC-conductivity of these materials.
