The argument of physical dimension/units is applied to electrical switched
circuits, making the topic of the nonlinearity of such circuits simpler. This
approach is seen against the background of a more general outlook (IEEE CAS
MAG, III, 2009, pp. 56-62) on singular (switched and sampling) systems. The
appendix suggests some points for the axiomatization of system theory
considered as an independent science.
