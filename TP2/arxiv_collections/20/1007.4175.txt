We explore the predictions of the renormalized perturbation theory for an
n-channel Anderson model, both with and without Hund's rule coupling, in the
regime away from particle-hole symmetry. For the model with n=2 we deduce the
renormalized parameters from numerical renormalization group calculations, and
plot them as a function of the occupation at the impurity site, nd. From these
we deduce the spin, orbital and charge susceptibilities, Wilson ratios and
quasiparticle density of states at T=0, in the different parameter regimes,
which gives a comprehensive overview of the low energy behavior of the model.
We compare the difference in Kondo behaviors at the points where nd=1 and nd=2.
One unexpected feature of the results is the suppression of the charge
susceptibility in the strong correlation regime over the occupation number
range 1 <nd <3.
