Given a divisor $D$ on a tropical curve $\Gamma$, we show that reduced
divisors define an integral affine map from the tropical curve to the complete
linear system $|D|$. This is done by providing an explicit description of the
behavior of reduced divisors under infinitesimal modifications of the base
point. We consider the cases where the reduced-divisor map defines an embedding
of the curve into the linear system, and in this way, classify all the tropical
curves with a very ample canonical divisor. As an application of the
reduced-divisor map, we show the existence of Weierstrass points on tropical
curves of genus at least two and present a simpler proof of a theorem of Luo on
rank-determining sets of points. We also discuss the classical analogue of the
(tropical) reduced-divisor map: For a smooth projective curve $C$ and a divisor
$D$ of non-negative rank on $C$, reduced divisors equivalent to $D$ define a
morphism from $C$ to the complete linear system $|D|$, which is described in
terms of Wronskians.
