In this paper, we extend previous results to prove that generalized modular
forms with rational Fourier expansions whose divisors are supported only at the
cusps and certain other points in the upper half plane are actually classical
modular forms. We discuss possible limitations to this extension and pose
questions about possible zeroes for modular forms of prime level.
