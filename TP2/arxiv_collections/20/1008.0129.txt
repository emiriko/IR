The aim of this paper is to describe how to use regularization and
renormalization to construct a perturbative quantum field theory from a
Lagrangian. We first define renormalizations and Feynman measures, and show
that although there need not exist a canonical Feynman measure, there is a
canonical orbit of Feynman measures under renormalization. We then construct a
perturbative quantum field theory from a Lagrangian and a Feynman measure, and
show that it satisfies perturbative analogues of the Wightman axioms, extended
to allow time-ordered composite operators over curved spacetimes.
