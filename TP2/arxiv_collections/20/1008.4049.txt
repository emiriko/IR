The recommendation to change breathing patterns from the mouth to the nose
can have a significantly positive impact upon the general well being of the
individual. We classify nasal and mouth breathing by using an acoustic sensor
and intelligent signal processing techniques. The overall purpose is to
investigate the possibility of identifying the differences in patterns between
nasal and mouth breathing in order to integrate this information into a
decision support system which will form the basis of a patient monitoring and
motivational feedback system to recommend the change from mouth to nasal
breathing. Our findings show that the breath pattern can be discriminated in
certain places of the body both by visual spectrum analysis and with a Back
Propagation neural network classifier. The sound file recoded from the sensor
placed on the hollow in the neck shows the most promising accuracy which is as
high as 90%.
