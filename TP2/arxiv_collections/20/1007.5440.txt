We study the number of (set-theoretically) defining equations of Segre
products of projective spaces times certain projective hypersurfaces, extending
results by Singh and Walther. Meanwhile, we prove some results about the
cohomological dimension of certain schemes. In particular, we solve a
conjecture of Lyubeznik about an inequality involving the cohomological
dimension and the etale cohomological dimension of a scheme, in the
characteristic-zero-case and under a smoothness assumption. Furthermore, we
show that a relationship between depth and cohomological dimension discovered
by Peskine and Szpiro in positive characteristic holds true also in
characteristic-zero up to dimension three.
