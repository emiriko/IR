Dispersive representations of the Kpi vector and scalar form factors are used
to fit the spectrum of tau ---> K pi nu_tau obtained by the Belle collaboration
incorporating constraints from results for K_l3 decays. The slope and curvature
of the vector form factor are obtained directly from the data through the use
of a three-times-subtracted dispersion relation. We find $\lambda_+'=(25.49 \pm
0.31) \times 10^{-3}$ and $\lambda_+"= (12.22 \pm 0.14) \times 10^{-4}$. From
the pole position on the second Riemann sheet the mass and width of the
$K^*(892)^{\pm}$ are found to be $m_{K^*(892)^\pm}=892.0\pm 0.5$~MeV and
$\Gamma_{K^*(892)^\pm}=46.5\pm 1.1$~MeV. The phase-space integrals needed for
K_l3 decays are calculated as well. Furthermore, the Kpi isospin-1/2 P-wave
threshold parameters are derived from the phase of the vector form factor. For
the scattering length and the effective range we find respectively
$a_{1}^{1/2}\,= ( 0.166\pm 0.004)\,m_\pi^{-3}$ and $b_{1}^{1/2}\,=( 0.258\pm
0.009)\,m_\pi^{-5}$.
