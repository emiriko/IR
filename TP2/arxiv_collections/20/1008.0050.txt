We develop a stochastic foundation for bandwidth estimation of networks with
random service, where bandwidth availability is expressed in terms of bounding
functions with a defined violation probability. Exploiting properties of a
stochastic max-plus algebra and system theory, the task of bandwidth estimation
is formulated as inferring an unknown bounding function from measurements of
probing traffic. We derive an estimation methodology that is based on iterative
constant rate probes. Our solution provides evidence for the utility of packet
trains for bandwidth estimation in the presence of variable cross traffic.
Taking advantage of statistical methods, we show how our estimation method can
be realized in practice, with adaptive train lengths of probe packets, probing
rates, and replicated measurements required to achieve both high accuracy and
confidence levels. We evaluate our method in a controlled testbed network,
where we show the impact of cross traffic variability on the time-scales of
service availability, and provide a comparison with existing bandwidth
estimation tools.
