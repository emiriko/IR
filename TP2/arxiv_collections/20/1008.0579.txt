To test Lorentz symmetry we used a 3He/129Xe co-magnetometer. We will give a
short summary of our experimental setup and the results of our latest
measurements. We obtained preliminary results for the equatorial component of
the background field interacting with the spin of the bound neutron: b_n < 3.72
x 10^(-32) GeV (95 C.L.).
