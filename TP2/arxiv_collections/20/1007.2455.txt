Density functional modeling of atomic structure and calculation of electronic
structure of one-side one-sublattice functionalized graphene (graphone) are
performed for hydrogen and fluorine adatoms. Shown that using of fluorine for
functionalization not on enhance stability of compound but also provide switch
of magnetic ground state from ferro- to antiferromagnetic. Half-metallic
ferromagnetic state in fluorine based graphone is also discussed.
