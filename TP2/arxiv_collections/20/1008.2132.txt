Nominally pure undoped parent manganite LaMnO_3 exhibits a puzzling behavior
inconsistent with a simple picture of an A-type antiferromagnetic insulator
(A-AFI) with a cooperative Jahn-Teller ordering. We do assign its anomalous
properties to charge transfer instabilities and competition between insulating
A-AFI phase and metallic-like dynamically disproportionated phase formally
separated by a first-order phase transition at T_{disp}=T_{JT}\approx 750 K.
The unconventional high-temperature phase is addressed to be a specific
electron-hole Bose liquid (EHBL) rather than a simple "chemically"
disproportionated R(Mn^{2+}Mn^{4+})O_3 phase. New phase does nucleate as a
result of the charge transfer (CT) instability and evolves from the
self-trapped CT excitons, or specific EH-dimers, which seem to be a precursor
of both insulating and metallic-like ferromagnetic phases observed in
manganites. We arrive at highly frustrated system of triplet (e_g^2)^3A_{2g}
bosons moving in a lattice formed by hole Mn^{4+} centers. Starting with
different experimental data we have reproduced a typical temperature dependence
of the volume fraction of high-temperature mixed-valent EHBL phase. We argue
that a slight nonisovalent substitution, photo-irradiation, external pressure
or magnetic field gives rise to an electronic phase separation with a
nucleation or an overgrowth of EH-droplets. Such a scenario provides a
comprehensive explanation of numerous puzzling properties observed in parent
and nonisovalently doped manganite LaMnO_3 including an intriguing
manifestation of superconducting fluctuations.
