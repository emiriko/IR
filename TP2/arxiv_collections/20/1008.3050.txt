In $2048^3$ simulation of quantum turbulence within the Gross-Pitaevskii
equation we demonstrate that the large scale motions have a classical
Kolmogorov-1941 energy spectrum E(k) ~ k^{-5/3}, followed by an energy
accumulation with E(k) ~ const at k about the reciprocal mean intervortex
distance. This behavior was predicted by the L'vov-Nazarenko-Rudenko bottleneck
model of gradual eddy-wave crossover [J. Low Temp. Phys. 153, 140-161 (2008)],
further developed in the paper.
