We exhibit a recurrence on the number of discrete line segments joining two
integer points in the plane using an encoding of such segments as balanced
words of given length and height over the two-letter alphabet $\{0,1\}$. We
give generating functions and study the asymptotic behaviour. As a particular
case, we focus on the symmetrical discrete segments which are encoded by
balanced palindromes.
