Measuring the muon flux is important to the Sanford Underground Laboratory at
Homestake, for which several low background experiments are being planned. The
nearly-vertical cosmic ray muon flux was measured in three locations at this
laboratory: on the surface (1.149 \pm 0.017 x 10^-2 cm^-2 s^-1 sr^-1), at the
800-ft (0.712 km w.e.) level (2.67 \pm 0.06 x 10^-6 cm^-2 s^-1 sr^-1), and at
the 2000-ft (1.78 km w.e.) level (2.56 \pm 0.25 x 10^-7 cm^-2 s^-1 sr^-1).
These fluxes agree well with model predictions.
