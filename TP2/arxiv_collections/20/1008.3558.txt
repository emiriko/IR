The behavior of a Lattice Monte Carlo algorithm (if it is designed correctly)
must approach that of the continuum system that it is designed to simulate as
the time step and the mesh step tend to zero. However, we show for an algorithm
for unbiased particle diffusion that if one of these two parameters remains
fixed, the accuracy of the algorithm is optimal for a certain finite value of
the other parameter. In one dimension, the optimal algorithm with moves to the
two nearest neighbor sites reproduces the correct second and fourth moments
(and minimizes the error for the higher moments at large times) of the particle
distribution and preserves the first two moments of the first-passage time
distributions. In two and three dimensions, the same level of accuracy requires
simultaneous moves along two axes ("diagonal" moves). Such moves attempting to
cross an impenetrable boundary should be projected along the boundary, rather
than simply rejected. We also treat the case of absorbing boundaries.
