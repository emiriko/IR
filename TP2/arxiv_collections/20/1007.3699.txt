Pulsar Wind Nebulae (PWNe) act as calorimeters for the relativistic pair
winds emanating from within the pulsar light cylinder. Their radiative
dissipation in various wavebands is significantly different from that of their
pulsar central engines: the broadband spectra of PWNe possess characteristics
distinct from those of pulsars, thereby demanding a site of lepton acceleration
remote from the pulsar magnetosphere. A principal candidate for this locale is
the pulsar wind termination shock, a putatively highly-oblique,
ultra-relativistic MHD discontinuity. This paper summarizes key characteristics
of relativistic shock acceleration germane to PWNe, using predominantly Monte
Carlo simulation techniques that compare well with semi-analytic solutions of
the diffusion-convection equation. The array of potential spectral indices for
the pair distribution function is explored, defining how these depend
critically on the parameters of the turbulent plasma in the shock environs.
Injection efficiencies into the acceleration process are also addressed.
Informative constraints on the frequency of particle scattering and the level
of field turbulence are identified using the multiwavelength observations of
selected PWNe. These suggest that the termination shock can be comfortably
invoked as a principal injector of energetic leptons into PWNe without
resorting to unrealistic properties for the shock layer turbulence or MHD
structure.
