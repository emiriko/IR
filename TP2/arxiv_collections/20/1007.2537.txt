We show that the fate of moons of a close-in giant planet is mainly
determined by the migration history of the planet in the protoplanetary disk.
As the planet migrates in the disk from beyond the snow line towards a
multi-day period orbit, the formed and forming moons become unstable as the
planet's sphere of influence shrinks. Disk-driven migration is faster than the
moons' tidal orbital evolution. Moons are eventually ejected from around
close-in exoplanets or forced into collision with them before tides from the
star affect their orbits. If moons are detected around close-in exoplanets,
they are unlikely to have been formed in situ, instead they were captured from
the protoplanetary disk on retrograde orbits around the planets.
