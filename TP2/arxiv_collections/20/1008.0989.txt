The equations which relate three-body and two-body symmetry violating
scattering amplitudes are derived in the first order of symmetry violating
interactions. They can be used to obtain three-body symmetry violating
scattering amplitudes from two-body symmetry violating scattering amplitudes
calculated in low energy effective field theory.
