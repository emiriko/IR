Spin-Fermion systems which obtain their magnetic properties from a system of
localized magnetic moments being coupled to conducting electrons are
considered. The dynamical degrees of freedom are spin-$s$ operators of
localized spins and spin-1/2 Fermi operators of itinerant electrons.
Renormalized spin-wave theory, which accounts for the magnon-magnon
interaction, and its extension are developed to describe the two ferrimagnetic
phases in the system: low temperature phase $0<T<T^{*}$, where all electrons
contribute the ordered ferromagnetic moment, and high temperature phase
$T^{*}<T<T_C$, where only localized spins form magnetic moment. The
magnetization as a function of temperature is calculated. The theoretical
predictions are utilize to interpret the experimentally measured
magnetization-temperature curves of $UGe_2$..
