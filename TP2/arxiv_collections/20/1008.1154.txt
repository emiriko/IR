A model based on optical phonon scattering is developed to explain
peculiarities in the current drive, transconductance, and high speed behavior
of short gate length GaN transistors. The model is able to resolve these
peculiarities, and provides a simple way to explain transistor behavior in any
semiconductor material system in which electron-optical phonon scattering is
strong.
