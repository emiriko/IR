We have successfully demonstrated an integrated optical system for collecting
the fluorescence from a trapped ion. The system, consisting of an array of
transmissive, dielectric micro-optics and an optical fiber array, has been
intimately incorporated into the ion-trapping chip without negatively impacting
trapping performance. Epoxies, vacuum feedthrough, and optical component
materials were carefully chosen so that they did not degrade the vacuum
environment, and we have demonstrated light detection as well as ion trapping
and shuttling behavior comparable to trapping chips without integrated optics,
with no modification to the control voltages of the trapping chip.
