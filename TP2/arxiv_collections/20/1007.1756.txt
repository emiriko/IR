The interference channel is the simplest communication scenario where
multiple autonomous users compete for shared resources. We combine game theory
and information theory to define a notion of a Nash equilibrium region of the
interference channel. The notion is game theoretic: it captures the selfish
behavior of each user as they compete. The notion is also information
theoretic: it allows each user to use arbitrary communication strategies as it
optimizes its own performance. We give an exact characterization of the Nash
equilibrium region of the two-user linear deterministic interference channel
and an approximate characterization of the Nash equilibrium region of the
two-user Gaussian interference channel to within 1 bit/s/Hz..
