Gamma ray bursts are the most luminous physical phenomena in the universe,
consisting of flashes of gamma rays that last from seconds to hours. There have
been attempts to observe gamma ray bursts, for example, from population III
stars of about 500 solar mass at high redshifts. Here we argue that collapse of
such high mass stars does not lead to gamma ray burst as their core collapse
temperatures are not sufficient to produce gamma rays, leading to GRBs.
