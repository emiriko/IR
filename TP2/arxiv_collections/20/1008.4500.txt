Infra-nilmanifold endomorphisms were introduced in the late sixties. They
play a very crucial role in dynamics, especially when studying expanding maps
and Anosov diffeomorphisms. However, in this note we will explain that the two
main results in this area are based on a false result and that although we can
repair one of these two theorems, there remains doubt on the correctness of the
other one. Moreover, we will also show that the notion of an infra-nilmanifold
endomorphism itself has not always been interpreted in the same way. Finally,
we define a slightly more general concept of the notion of an infra-nilmanifold
endomorphism and explain why this is really the right concept to work with.
