A new mechanism is proposed to explain the puzzling damping of collective
excitations, which was recently observed in the experiments of strongly
interacting Fermi gases below the superfluid critical temperature on the
fermionic (BCS) side of Feshbach resonance. Sound velocity, superfluid density
and damping rate are calculated with effective field theory. We find that a
dominant damping process is due to the interaction between superfluid phonons
and thermally excited fermionic quasiparticles, in contrast to the previously
proposed pair-breaking mechanism. Results from our effective model are compared
quantitatively with recent experimental findings, showing a good agreement.
