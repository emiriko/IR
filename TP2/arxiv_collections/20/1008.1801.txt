High energy electrons and positrons from annihilating dark matter can imprint
unique angular anisotropies on the diffuse gamma-ray flux by inverse Compton
scattering off the interstellar radiation field. We develop a numerical tool to
compute gamma-ray emission from such electrons and positrons produced in the
smooth host halo and in substructure halos with masses down to 10^(-6)M_sun. We
show that the angular power spectrum from inverse Compton scattering is
exponentially suppressed below an angular scale determined by the diffusion
length of electrons and positrons. We also find that the total flux and the
shape of the angular power spectrum depends sensitively on the spatial
distribution of subhalos in the Milky Way. Finally, the contribution from the
smooth host halo component to the gamma-ray mean intensity is negligibly small
compared to subhalos.
