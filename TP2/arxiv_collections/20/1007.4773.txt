We present evidence that the strong electron-electron interactions in gapped
carbon nanotubes lead to finite hierarchies of excitons within a given nanotube
subband. We study these hierarchies by employing a field theoretic reduction of
the gapped carbon nanotube permitting electron-electron interactions to be
treated exactly. We analyze this reduction by employing a Wilsonian-like
numerical renormalization group. We are so able to determine the gap ratios of
the one-photon excitons as a function of the effective strength of
interactions. We also determine within the same subband the gaps of the
two-photon excitons, the single particle gaps, as well as a subset of the dark
excitons. The strong electron-electron interactions in addition lead to
strongly renormalized dispersion relations where the consequences of
spin-charge separation can be readily observed.
