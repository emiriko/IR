Using similar nonlinear stationary mean-field models for Bose-Einstein
Condensation of cold atoms and interacting electrons in a Quantum Dot, we
propose to describe the original many-particle ground state as a one-particle
statistical mixed state of the nonlinear eigenstates whose weights are provided
by the eigenstate non-orthogonality. We search for physical grounds in the
interpretation of our two main results, namely, quantum-classical nonlinear
transition and interference between nonlinear eigenstates.
