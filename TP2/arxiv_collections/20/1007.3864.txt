We present a systematic study of the effect of Y doping and hydration level
on the structural transformations of BaCeO3 based on anelastic spectroscopy
experiments. The temperature of the intermediate transformation between
rhombohedral and orthorhombic Imma phases rises with increasing the molar
fraction x of Y roughly as (500 K)x in the hydrated state, and is depressed of
more than twice that amount after complete dehydration. This is explained in
terms of the effect of doping on the average (Ce/Y)-O and Ba-O bond lengths,
and of lattice relaxation from O vacancies. The different behavior of the
transition to the lower temperature Pnma orthorhombic phase is tentatively
explained in terms of progressive flattening of the effective shape of the OH
ion and ordering of the O vacancies during cooling.
