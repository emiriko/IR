The PLANCK satellite mission has been launched the 14th of May 2009 and is
dedicated to the measurement of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) in
temperature and polarization. The presence of diffuse galactic polarized
emission contaminates the measurement of the CMB anisotropies, in particular in
polarization. Therefore a good knowledge of these emissions is needed to the
accuracy required for PLANCK. In this context, we have developed and
implemented a coherent 3D model of the two main polarized galactic emissions :
synchrotron radiation and thermal dust. We have compared these models to the
WMAP and ARCHEOPS data and to the 408 MHz all-sky continuum survey. From this,
we are able to estimate the contribution of polarized foreground emissions to
the polarized CMB radiation measured with PLANCK.
