Both D0 and CDF at Tevatron reported the measurements of forward-backward
asymmetry in top pair production, which showed possible deviation from the
standard model QCD prediction. In this paper, we explore how to examine the
{\em same} higher-order QCD effects at the more powerful Large Hadron Collider.
