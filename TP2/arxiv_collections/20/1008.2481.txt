We present a new primary transit observation of the hot-jupiter HD189733b,
obtained at 3.6 microns with the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) onboard the
Spitzer Space Telescope. Previous measurements at 3.6 microns suffered from
strong systematics and conclusions could hardly be obtained with confidence on
the water detection by comparison of the 3.6 and 5.8 microns observations. We
use a high S/N Spitzer photometric transit light curve to improve the precision
of the near infrared radius of the planet at 3.6 microns. The observation has
been performed using high-cadence time series integrated in the subarray mode.
We are able to derive accurate system parameters, including planet-to-star
radius ratio, impact parameter, scale of the system, and central time of the
transit from the fits of the transit light curve. We compare the results with
transmission spectroscopic models and with results from previous observations
at the same wavelength. We obtained the following system parameters:
R_p/R_\star=0.15566+0.00011-0.00024, b=0.661+0.0053-0.0050, and
a/R_\star=8.925+0.0490-0.0523 at 3.6 microns. These measurements are three
times more accurate than previous studies at this wavelength because they
benefit from greater observational efficiency and less statistic and systematic
errors. Nonetheless, we find that the radius ratio has to be corrected for
stellar activity and present a method to do so using ground-based long-duration
photometric follow-up in the V-band. The resulting planet-to-star radius ratio
corrected for the stellar variability is in agreement with the previous
measurement obtained in the same bandpass (Desert et al. 2009). We also discuss
that water vapour could not be evidenced by comparison of the planetary radius
measured at 3.6 and 5.8 microns, because the radius measured at 3.6 microns is
affected by absorption by other species, possibly Rayleigh scattering by haze.
