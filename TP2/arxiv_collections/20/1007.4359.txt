An antenna array devoted to the autonomous radio-detection of high energy
cosmic rays is being deployed on the site of the 21 cm array radio telescope in
XinJiang, China. Thanks in particular to the very good electromagnetic
environment of this remote experimental site, self-triggering on extensive air
showers induced by cosmic rays has been achieved with a small scale prototype
of the foreseen antenna array. We give here a detailed description of the
detector and present the first detection of extensive air showers with this
prototype.
