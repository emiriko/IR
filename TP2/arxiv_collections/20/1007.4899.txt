Recent work of Pickett has given a construction of self-dual normal bases for
extensions of finite fields, whenever they exist. In this article we present
these results in an explicit and constructive manner and apply them, through
computer search, to identify the lowest complexity of self-dual normal bases
for extensions of low degree. Comparisons to similar searches amongst normal
bases show that the lowest complexity is often achieved from a self-dual normal
basis.
