Considering the curvaton field that follows dissipative slow-roll equation,
we show that the field can lead to entropy production and generation of
curvature perturbation after reheating. Spectral index is calculated to
discriminate warm and thermal scenarios of dissipative curvatons from the
standard curvaton model. In contrast to the original curvaton model, quadratic
potential is not needed in the dissipative scenario, since the growth in the
oscillating period is not essential for the model.
