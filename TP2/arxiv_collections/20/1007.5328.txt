Spread of information in crowd is analysed in terms of directed percolation
in two-dimensional spatial network. We investigate the case when the
information transmitted can be incomplete or damaged. The results indicate that
for small or moderate probability of errors, it is only the critical
connectivity that varies with this probability, but the shape of the
transmission velocity curve remains unchanged in a wide range of the
probability. The shape of the boundary between those already informed and those
yet uninformed becomes complex when the connectivity of agents is small.
