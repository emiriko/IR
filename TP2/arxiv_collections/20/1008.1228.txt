The size effect in ferroelectrics is treated as a competition between the
geometrical symmetry of the ferroelectric sample and its crystalline symmetry.
The manifestation of this competition is shown to be polarization rotation,
which is driven by temperature and/or size variations, thus providing a
qualitative indication of intrinsic finite size effect on ferroelectrics. The
concept is demonstrated in a simple case of PbTiO3 nanowires having their axis
parallel to [111]C direction, where the size effect is shown to include
polarization rotation and an additional phase transition.
