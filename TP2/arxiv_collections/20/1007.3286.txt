We examine two members of the NGC 4065 group of galaxies: a bent-double
(a.k.a. wide angle tail) radio source and an HI deficient spiral galaxy. Models
of the X-ray emitting intragroup gas and the bent-double radio source, NGC
4061, are used to probe the density of intergalactic gas in this group. HI
observations reveal an asymmetric, truncated distribution of neutral gas in
spiral galaxy, UGC 07049, and the accompanying radio continuum emission reveals
strong star formation. We examine the effectiveness of ram pressure stripping
as a gas removal mechanism and find that it alone cannot account for the HI
deficiency that is observed in UGC 07049 unless this galaxy has passed through
the core of the group with a velocity of ~800 km/s. A combination of tidal and
ram pressure stripping are necessary to produce the HI deficiency and asymmetry
in this galaxy.
