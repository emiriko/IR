We analytically work out the long-term, i.e. averaged over one orbital
revolution, time variations of some direct observable quantities Y induced by
classical and general relativistic dynamical perturbations of the two-body
pointlike Newtonian acceleration in the case of transiting exoplanets moving
along elliptic orbits. More specifically, the observables $Y$ with which we
deal are the transit duration, the radial velocity and the time interval
between primary and secondary eclipses. The dynamical effects considered are
the centrifugal oblateness of both the star and the planet, their tidal bulges
mutually raised on each other, a distant third body X, and general relativity
(both Schwarzschild and Lense-Thirring). We take into account the effects due
to the perturbations of all the Keplerian orbital elements involved in a
consistent and uniform way. First, we explicitly compute their instantaneous
time variations due to the dynamical effects considered and plug them in the
general expression for the instantaneous change of Y; then, we take the overall
average over one orbital revolution of the so-obtained instantaneous rate $\dot
Y(t)$ specialized to the perturbations considered. Instead, somewhat hybrid
expressions can be often found in literature: in them, the secular precession
of, typically, the periastron only is straightforwardly inserted into
instantaneous formulas. Numerical evaluations of the obtained results are given
for a typical star-planet scenario and compared with the expected observational
accuracies over a time span 10 yr long. Our results are, in principle, valid
also for other astronomical scenarios. They may allow, e.g., for designing
various tests of gravitational theories with natural and artificial bodies in
our solar system. (Abridged)
