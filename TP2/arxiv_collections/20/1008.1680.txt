Polycrystalline samples of FeSe$_{0.5}$Te$_{0.5}$ were synthesized using a
conventional solid-state reaction method. The onset of bulk superconductivity
transition was confirmed by SQUID magnetometry at 12.5~K. $^{57}$Fe M\"ossbauer
spectra in transmission geometry were recorded at temperatures between 6.0 and
320 K. Both the isomer shift and the total absorption started to drop about
$T_c$, indicating a softening of the lattice. The drop is estimated to
correspond to at least 60~K from the original Debye temperature $\theta_{\rm
D}\approx 460$~K. Seebeck measurements indicate that the samples are $n$-type
conductors at low temperatures with a cross-over to $p$-type conductivity
around 135 K. The zero Seebeck coefficient is seen below $10.6$~K.
