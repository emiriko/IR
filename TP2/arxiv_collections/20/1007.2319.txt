The effects of the $\alpha$ particles in nuclear matter at low densities are
investigated within three different parametrizations of relativistic models at
finite temperature. Both homogeneous and inhomogeneous matter (pasta phase) are
described for neutral nuclear matter with fixed proton fractions and stellar
matter subject to $\beta$-equilibrium and trapped neutrinos. In homogeneous
matter, $\alpha$ particles are only present at densities below 0.02 fm$^{-3}$
and their presence decreases with the increase of the temperature and, for a
fixed temperature, the $\alpha$ particle fraction decreases for smaller proton
fractions. A repulsive interaction is important to mimic the dissolution of the
clusters in homogeneous matter. The effects of the $\alpha$ particles on the
pasta structure is very small except close to the critical temperatures and /
or proton fractions when it may still predict a pasta phase while no pasta
phase would occur in the absence of light clusters. It is shown that for
densities above 0.01 fm$^{-3}$ the $\alpha$ particle fraction in the pasta
phase is much larger than the $\alpha$ particle fraction in homogeneous matter.
