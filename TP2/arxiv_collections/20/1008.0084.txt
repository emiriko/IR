We investigate different physical properties of a spin imbalanced fermionic
superfluid described by an attractive Hubbard model in presence of a harmonic
trap. To characterize the ground state of such a system, we compute various
correlation functions, such as pairing, density and current correlations To
underscore the effect of the trap, we compute these quantities as a function of
strength of the trapping potential. A distinguishing feature of a superfluid
state with population imbalance, is the appearance of a phase with spatially
modulating gap function, called the Fulde- Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO)
phase which is present for both with and without trap. Trapping effects induce
lowering of particle density and yields an empty system in the limit of large
trapping depths.
