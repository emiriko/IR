We analyse the density of states of the random graph Laplacian in the
percolating regime. A symmetry argument and knowledge of the density of states
in the nonpercolating regime allows us to isolate the density of states of the
percolating cluster (DSPC) alone, thereby eliminating trivially localised
states due to finite subgraphs. We derive a nonlinear integral equation for the
integrated DSPC and solve it with a population dynamics algorithm. We discuss
the possible existence of a mobility edge and give strong evidence for the
existence of discrete eigenvalues in the whole range of the spectrum.
