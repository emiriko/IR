We consider an idealized situation where the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) is
described by a perfect, 3+1 dimensional fluid dynamic model starting from an
initial state and expanding until a final state where freeze-out and/or
hadronization takes place. We study the entropy production with attention to
effects of (i) numerical viscosity, (ii) late stages of flow where the Bag
Constant and the partonic pressure are becoming similar, (iii) and the
consequences of final freeze-out and constituent quark matter formation.
