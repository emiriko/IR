The phase space for a system of $n$ qubits is a discrete grid of $2^{n}
\times 2^{n}$ points, whose axes are labeled in terms of the elements of the
finite field $\Gal{2^n}$ to endow it with proper geometrical properties. We
analyze the representation of graph states in that phase space, showing that
these states can be identified with a class of non-singular curves. We provide
an algebraic representation of the most relevant quantum operations acting on
these states and discuss the advantages of this approach.
