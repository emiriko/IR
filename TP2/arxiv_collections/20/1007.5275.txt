Using a recent understanding of mass generation for Yang-Mills theory and a
quartic massless scalar field theory mapping each other, we show that when such
a scalar field theory is coupled to a gauge field and Dirac spinors, all fields
become massive at a classical level with all the properties of supersymmetry
fulfilled, when the self-interaction of the scalar field is taken infinitely
large. Assuming that the mechanism for mass generation must be the same in QCD
as in the Standard Model, this implies that Higgs particle must be
supersymmetric.
