Monte Carlo method within, so called, classical fields approximation is
applied to one dimensional weakly interacting repulsive Bose gas trapped in a
harmonic potential. Equilibrium statistical properties of the condensate are
calculated within a canonical ensemble. We also calculate experimentally
relevant low order correlation functions of the whole gas.
