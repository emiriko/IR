In this paper we present a method for reformulating the Recommender Systems
problem in an Information Retrieval one. In our tests we have a dataset of
users who give ratings for some movies; we hide some values from the dataset,
and we try to predict them again using its remaining portion (the so-called
"leave-n-out approach"). In order to use an Information Retrieval algorithm, we
reformulate this Recommender Systems problem in this way: a user corresponds to
a document, a movie corresponds to a term, the active user (whose rating we
want to predict) plays the role of the query, and the ratings are used as
weigths, in place of the weighting schema of the original IR algorithm. The
output is the ranking list of the documents ("users") relevant for the query
("active user"). We use the ratings of these users, weighted according to the
rank, to predict the rating of the active user. We carry out the comparison by
means of a typical metric, namely the accuracy of the predictions returned by
the algorithm, and we compare this to the real ratings from users. In our first
tests, we use two different Information Retrieval algorithms: LSPR, a recently
proposed model based on Discrete Fourier Transform, and a simple vector space
model.
