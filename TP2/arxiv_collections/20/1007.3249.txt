Although in most cases class initialization works as expected, some static
fields may be read before being initialized, despite being initialized in their
corresponding class initializer. We propose an analysis which compute, for each
program point, the set of static fields that must have been initialized and
discuss its soundness. We show that such an analysis can be directly applied to
identify the static fields that may be read before being initialized and to
improve the precision while preserving the soundness of a null-pointer
analysis.
