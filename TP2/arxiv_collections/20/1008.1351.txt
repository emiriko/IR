From the realization of $q-$oscillator algebra in terms of generalized
derivative, we compute the matrix elements from deformed exponential functions
and deduce generating functions associated with Rogers-Szeg\H{o} polynomials as
well as their relevant properties. We also compute the matrix elements
associated to the $(p,q)-$oscillator algebra (a generalization of the $q-$one)
and perform the Fourier-Gauss transform of a generalization of the deformed
exponential functions.
