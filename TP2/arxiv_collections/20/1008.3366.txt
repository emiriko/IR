We generalize a concept of classical finite extensive game to make it useful
for application of quantum objects. The generalization extends a quantum
realization scheme of static games to any finite extensive game. It represents
an extension of any classical finite extensive games to the quantum domain. In
addition our model is compatible with well-known quantum schemes of static
games. The paper is summed up by two examples.
