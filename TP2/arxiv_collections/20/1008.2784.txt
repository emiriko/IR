Dynamics of the one-dimensional open Ising chain under influence of $\pi$
-pulses is studied. It is shown that the application of a specific sequence of
such instant kicks to selective spins stimulates arising of perfect dynamical
pairwise entanglement between ends of the spin chain. Analytic formulas for the
concurrence dynamics are derived. It is also shown that the time required to
perfectly entangle the ends of the chains grows linearly with the number of
spins in the chain. The final entangled state of the ending spins is always the
same and does not depend on length the chain.
