Universality and crossover is described for attractive and repulsive
interactions where, respectively, the BCS-BEC crossover takes place and a
ferromagnetic phase transition is claimed. Crossovers are also described for
optical lattices and multicomponent systems. The crossovers, universal
parameters and phase transitions are described within the Leggett and NSR
models and calculated in detail within the Jastrow-Slater approximation. The
physics of ultracold Fermi atoms is applied to neutron, nuclear and quark
matter, nuclei and electrons in solids whenever possible. Specifically, the
differences between optical lattices and cuprates is discussed w.r.t.
antiferromagnetic, d-wave superfluid phases and phase separation.
