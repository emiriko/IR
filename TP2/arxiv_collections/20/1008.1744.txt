We consider optimal scalar quantization with $r$th power distortion and
constrained R\'enyi entropy of order $\alpha$. For sources with an absolutely
continuous distribution the high rate asymptotics of the quantizer distortion
has long been known for $\alpha=0$ (fixed-rate quantization) and $\al pha=1$
(entropy-constrained quantization). For a large class of absolutely continuous
source distributions we determine the sharp asymptotics of the optimal
quantization distortion for $\alpha\in [-\infty,0)\cup (0,1)$. The
achievability proof is based on finding (asymptotically) optimal quantizers via
the companding approach, and is thus constructive.
