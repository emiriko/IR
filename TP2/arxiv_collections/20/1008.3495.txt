The expansion dynamics of hot electron-positron-photon plasma droplets is
dealt with within relativistic hydrodynamics. Such droplets, envisaged to be
created in future experiments by irradiating thin foils with
counter-propagating ultra-intense laser beams, are sources of flashes of gamma
radiation. Warm electron-positron plasma droplets may be identified and
characterized by a broadened 511 keV line.
