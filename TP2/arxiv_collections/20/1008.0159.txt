The Kondo lattice model with substitutional disorder is studied with
attention to the size of the Fermi surface and the associated Dingle
temperature. The model serves for understanding heavy-fermion Ce compounds
alloyed with La according to substitution Ce{x}La{1-x}. The Fermi surface is
identified from the steepest change of the momentum distribution of conduction
electrons, and is derived at low enough temperature by the dynamical mean-field
theory (DMFT) combined with the coherent potential approximation (CPA). The
Fermi surface without magnetic field increases in size with decreasing x from
x=1 (Ce end), and disappears at such x that gives the same number of localized
spins as that of conduction electrons. From the opposite limit of x=0 (La end),
the Fermi surface broadens quickly as x increases, but stays at the same
position as that of the La end. With increasing magnetic field, a metamagnetic
transition occurs, and the Fermi surface above the critical field changes
continuously across the whole range of x. The Dingle temperature takes a
maximum around x=0.5. Implication of the results to experimental observation is
discussed.
