We consider the nonrelativistic particle moving on noncommutative space-time
in the presence of constant force $\vec{F}$. Further, following the paper M.

[math-ph], we recall that the considered noncommutativity generates additional
force terms, which appear in the corresponding Newton equation. We demonstrate
that the same force terms can be generated by the proper noninertial
transformation of classical nonrelativistic space-time.
