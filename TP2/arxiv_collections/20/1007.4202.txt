The entanglement entropy of the $\nu = 1/3$ and $\nu = 5/2$ quantum Hall
states in the presence of short range random disorder has been calculated by
direct diagonalization. A microscopic model of electron-electron interaction is
used, electrons are confined to a single Landau level and interact with long
range Coulomb interaction. For very weak disorder, the values of the
topological entanglement entropy are roughly consistent with expected
theoretical results. By considering a broader range of disorder strengths, the
fluctuation in the entanglement entropy was studied in an effort to detect
quantum phase transitions. In particular, there is a clear signature of a
transition as a function of the disorder strength for the $\nu = 5/2$ state.
Prospects for using the density matrix renormalization group to compute the
entanglement entropy for larger system sizes are discussed.
