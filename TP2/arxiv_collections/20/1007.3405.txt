We consider a class of generalized Inonu-Wigner contraction for semidirect
product of two particularly related semisimple Lie (super)algebras. The special
class of such contractions provides D=4 Maxwell algebra and recently introduced
simple D=4 Maxwell superalgebra. Further we present two types of D=4 N-extended
Maxwell superalgebras, the nonstandard one for any N with 1/2 N(N-1) central
charges and the standard one, for even N=2k, with k(2k-1) internal symmetry
generators.
