We study tensor norms over Banach spaces and their relations to quantum
information theory, in particular their connection with two-prover games. We
consider a version of the Hilbertian tensor norm $\gamma_2$ and its dual
$\gamma_2^*$ that allow us to consider games with arbitrary output alphabet
sizes. We establish direct-product theorems and prove a generalized
Grothendieck inequality for these tensor norms. Furthermore, we investigate the
connection between the Hilbertian tensor norm and the set of quantum
probability distributions, and show two applications to quantum information
theory: firstly, we give an alternative proof of the perfect parallel
repetition theorem for entangled XOR games; and secondly, we prove a new upper
bound on the ratio between the entangled and the classical value of two-prover
games.
