We analyze the driven resonantly coupled Jaynes-Cummings model in terms of a
quasienergy approach by switching to a frame rotating with the external
modulation frequency and by using the dressed atom picture. A quasienergy
surface in phase space emerges whose level spacing is governed by a rescaled
effective Planck constant. Moreover, the well-known multiphoton transitions can
be reinterpreted as resonant tunneling transitions from the local maximum of
the quasienergy surface. Most importantly, the driving defines a quasienergy
well which is nonperturbative in nature. The quantum mechanical quasienergy
state localized at its bottom is squeezed. In the Purcell limited regime, the
potential well is metastable and the effective local temperature close to its
minimum is uniquely determined by the squeezing factor. The activation occurs
in this case via dressed spin flip transitions rather than via quantum
activation as in other driven nonlinear quantum systems such as the quantum
Duffing oscillator. The local maximum is in general stable. However, in
presence of resonant coherent or dissipative tunneling transitions the system
can escape from it and a stationary state arises as a statistical mixture of
quasienergy states being localized in the two basins of attraction. This gives
rise to a resonant or an antiresonant nonlinear response of the cavity at
multiphoton transitions. The model finds direct application in recent
experiments with a driven superconducting circuit QED setup.
