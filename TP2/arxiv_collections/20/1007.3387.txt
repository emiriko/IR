A search for the axioelectric absorption of 5.5-MeV solar axions produced in
the $p+d\rightarrow \rm{^3He}+\gamma(5.5 \rm{MeV})$ reaction was performed with
two BGO detectors placed inside a low-background setup. A model independent
limit on axion-photon and axion-nucleon couplings was obtained: $|g_{Ae}\times
g_{AN}| \leq 3.2\times 10^{-9} (m_A=0)$. Constraints on the axion-electron
coupling constant were obtained for axions with masses in the $(0.1-1.0)$ MeV
range: $g_{Ae}\leq (1.8-9.0)\times 10^{-7}$. The solar positron flux from
$A\rightarrow e^-+e^+$ decay was determined for axions with masses $m_A >
2m_e$. Using the existing experimental data on the interplanetary positron
flux, a new constraint on the axion-electron coupling constant for axions with
masses in the $(1.2-5.4)$ MeV range was obtained: $g_{Ae} \leq (1-5)\times
10^{-17}$.
