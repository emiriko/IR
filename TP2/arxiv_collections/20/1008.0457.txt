We study the $K\Lambda(1405)$ configuration of the $K\bar{K}N$ system by
considering $K\pi\Sigma$ as a coupled channel. We solve the Faddeev equations
for these systems and find confirmation of the existence of a new $N^{*}$
resonance around 1920 MeV with $J^{\pi}=1/2^{+}$ predicted in a single-channel
potential model and also found in a Faddeev calculation as an $a_{0}(980)N$
state, with the $a_{0}(980)$ generated in the $K\bar{K}$, $\pi\eta$
interaction.
