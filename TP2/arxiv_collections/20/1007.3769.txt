In this paper, we present a systematic way of deriving (1) languages of
(generalised) regular expressions, and (2) sound and complete axiomatizations
thereof, for a wide variety of systems. This generalizes both the results of
Kleene (on regular languages and deterministic finite automata) and Milner (on
regular behaviours and finite labelled transition systems), and includes many
other systems such as Mealy and Moore machines.
