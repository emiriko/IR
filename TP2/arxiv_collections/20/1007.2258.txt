A nonlinear interferometry scheme is described theoretically to induce and
resolve electron wave- function beating on time scales shorter than the optical
cycle of the time-delayed pump and probe pulses. By employing two moderately
intense few-cycle laser fields with a stable carrier-envelope phase, a large
range of the entire electronic level structure of a quantum system can be
retrieved. In contrast to single-photon excitation schemes, the retrieved
electronic states include levels that are both dipole- and
non-dipole-accessible from the ground electronic state. The results show that
strong-field interferometry can reveal both high-resolution and broad-band
spectral information at the same time with important consequences for
quantum-beat spectroscopy on attosecond or even shorter time scales.
