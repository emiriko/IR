We study reactions between neutron-rich $^{132}$Sn nucleus and $^{96}$Zr
within a dynamic microscopic theory at energies in the vicinity of the ion-ion
potential barrier peak, and we compare the properties to those of the stable
system $^{124}$Sn+$^{96}$Zr. The calculations are carried out on a
three-dimensional lattice using the density-constrained Time-Dependent
Hartree-Fock method. In particular, we calculate the dynamic excitation energy
$E^*(t)$ and the quadrupole moment of the dinuclear system, $Q_{20}(t)$, during
the initial stages of the heavy-ion collision. Capture cross sections for the
two reactions are analyzed in terms of dynamic effects and a comparison with
recently measured data is given.
