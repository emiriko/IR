Magnetically modulated optical nanoprobes (MagMOONs) were used to detect and
distinguish probe fluorescence from autofluorescent backgrounds in turbid
media. MagMOONs are micro/nano-sized particles with magnetically controlled
orientation and orientation-dependent fluorescence. These probes blink when
they rotate in response to rotating external magnetic fields. This blinking
signal can be separated from backgrounds enabling spectrochemical sensing in
media with strong autofluorescence. We explore the effect of scattering on
MagMOON fluorescence. Turbid media reduce the modulated MagMOON signal due to a
combination of attenuation of fluorescence signal and reduction in contrast
between "On" and "Off" states. The blinking MagMOON fluorescence spectrum can
be detected in turbid non-dairy creamer solution with extinction 2.0, and
through 9 mm of chicken breast tissue, suggesting that whole mouse imaging is
feasible by using this strategy.
