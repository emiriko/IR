A pronounced resonance-like structure has been observed in the current
dependence of AC susceptibility for two-dimensional array of unshunted
Nb-AlOx-Nb Josephson junctions. Using a single-plaquette approximation, we were
able to successfully fit our data assuming that resonance structure is related
to the geometric (inductive) properties of the array.
