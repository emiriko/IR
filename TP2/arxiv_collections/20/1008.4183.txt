The paper presents an novel electric triple layer(ETL) model as an improved
model of electrical double layer(EDL) to predict electroosmosis flow rate on
the electrode surface at low frequency. The predicted slip velocity based on
classical EDL theory is much higher than experimental results, and ETL model
can account for this deviation. Cross-over frequency at which the maximum
electroosmosis flow velocity occurs based on ETL model is a little bit higher
than that predicted in EDL theory, but still in keeping with classical
prediction. Influences of triple layer thickness and electrode surface
roughness on electroosmosis flow are analyzed via simulation and theoretical
analysis agrees with experimental data very well, proving its validity.
