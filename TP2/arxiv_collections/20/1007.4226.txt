We present observations of twelve rotational transitions of H2O-16, H2O-18,
and H2O-17 toward the massive star-forming region NGC 6334 I, carried out with
Herschel/HIFI as part of the guaranteed time key program Chemical HErschel
Surveys of Star forming regions (CHESS). We analyze these observations to
obtain insights into physical processes in this region.
  We identify three main gas components (hot core, cold foreground, and
outflow) in NGC 6334 I and derive the physical conditions in these components.
  The hot core, identified by the emission in highly excited lines, shows a
high excitation temperature of 200 K, whereas water in the foreground component
is predominantly in the ortho- and para- ground states. The abundance of water
varies between 4 10^-5 (outflow) and 10^-8 (cold foreground gas). This
variation is most likely due to the freeze-out of water molecules onto dust
grains. The H2O-18/H2O-17 abundance ratio is 3.2, which is consistent with the
O-18/O-17 ratio determined from CO isotopologues. The ortho/para ratio in water
appears to be relatively low 1.6(1) in the cold, quiescent gas, but close to
the equilibrium value of three in the warmer outflow material (2.5(0.8)).
