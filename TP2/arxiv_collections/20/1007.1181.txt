The dispersive effect of the Coriolis force for the stationary Navier-Stokes
equations is investigated. The effect is of a different nature than the one
shown for the non-stationary case by J. Y. Chemin, B. Desjardins, I. Gallagher
and E. Grenier. Existence of a unique solution is shown for arbitrary large
external force provided the Coriolis force is large enough. The analysis is
carried out in a new framework of the Fourier-Besov spaces. In addition to the
stationary case counterparts of several classical results for the
non-stationary Navier-Stokes problem have been proven.
