The pi pi scattering is studied in two-flavor chiral models with a finite
pion mass to investigate the nature of the sigma meson which is observed as the
lowest scalar-isoscalar resonance. We compare several models with different
origins of the sigma meson, such as the chiral partner of the pion and the
dynamically generated pi pi molecule. We find that the dynamically generated
sigma meson exhibits a novel pattern of the threshold enhancement reflecting
the s-wave nature of the resonance, which is qualitatively different from the
softening of the chiral partner introduced as a bare field. This behavior
around the threshold energy region is universal as far as the bare sigma pole
stays away from the threshold throughout the symmetry restoration process. On
the other hand, for m_pi=0, the dynamically generated sigma behaves similarly
to the chiral partner in the symmetry restoration limit, implying the
possibility of the dynamically generated chiral partner.
