We investigate the nature of phase transitions induced by
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions on a classical pyrochlore
antiferromagnet. For both symmetry-allowed antisymmetric exchange interactions,
the macroscopic degeneracy due to geometrical frustration is relieved and a
long-range magnetic order appears in the ground state. We find an Ising-like
phase transition in the case of direct DM interaction which selects a doubly
degenerate all-in all-out magnetic order. In the presence of indirect DM
coupling, the magnet undergoes an XY-like phase transition into a state with
broken Z6 symmetry. We show that the critical behavior in both cases is
modified due to the constrained spin fluctuations in the correlated Coulomb
phase. We also demonstrate an interesting order from disorder phenomenon where
the system switches between two distinct types of broken Z6 symmetry.
