Applying newly developed dynamical density matrix renormalization group
techniques at zero and finite temperatures to a Hubbard-Holstein model at
half-filling, we examine the optical conductivity of a typical one-dimensional
Mott insulator Sr_2CuO_3. We find a set of parameters in the Hubbard-Holstein
model, which can describe optical conductivity for both Mott-gap excitation in
the high-energy region and phonon-assisted spin excitation in the low-energy
region. We also find that electron-phonon interaction gives additional
broadening in the temperature dependence of the Mott-gap excitation.
