The interstellar medium (ISM) has a multiphase structure characterized by
gas, dust and molecules. The gas can be found in different charge states:
neutral, low-ionized (warm) and high-ionized (hot). It is possible to probe the
multiphase ISM through the observation of its absorption lines and edges in the
X-ray spectra of background sources. We present a high-quality RGS spectrum of
the low-mass X-ray binary GS 1826-238 with an unprecedent detailed treatment of
the absorption features due to the dust and both the neutral and ionized gas of
the ISM. We constrain the column density ratios within the different phases of
the ISM and measure the abundances of elements such as O, Ne, Fe and Mg. We
found significant deviations from the proto-Solar abundances: oxygen is
over-abundant by a factor 1.23 +/- 0.05, neon 1.75 +/- 0.11, iron 1.37 +/- 0.17
and magnesium 2.45 +/- 0.35. The abundances are consistent with the measured
metallicity gradient in our Galaxy: the ISM appears to be metal-rich in the
inner regions. The spectrum also shows the presence of warm/hot ionized gas.
The gas column has a total ionization degree less than 10%. We also show that
dust plays an important role as expected from the position of GS 1826-238: most
iron appears to be bound in dust grains, while 10-40% of oxygen consists of a
mixture of dust and molecules.
