Let $X$ be a smooth projective variety over $\mathbb C$. We prove that a
twisted Higgs vector bundle $(\calE\, ,\theta)$ on $X$ admits an
Einstein--Hermitian connection if and only if $(\calE\, ,\theta)$ is
polystable. A similar result for twisted vector bundles (no Higgs fields) was
proved by S. Wang in \cite{Wa}. Our approach is simpler.
