Impact of induced strain on charge carrier mobility is investigated for a
monolayer graphene sheet. Mobility is computed within Born approximation by
including impurity scattering, surface roughness effects and interaction with
lattice phonons. Unlike its sSi counterpart, strained graphene shows a drop in
mobility with increasing strain. Main reason for this effect is decrease in
Fermi velocity due to induced distortions in the graphene honeycomb.
