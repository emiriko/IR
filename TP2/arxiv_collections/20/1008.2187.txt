We study the simulated CO emission from elliptical galaxies formed in the
mergers of gas-rich disk galaxies. The cold gas not consumed in the
merger-driven starburst quickly resettles into a disk-like configuration. By
analyzing a variety of arbitrary merger orbits that produce a range of fast to
slow-rotating remnants, we find that molecular disk formation is a fairly
common consequence of gas-rich galaxy mergers. Hence, if a molecular disk is
observed in an early-type merger remnant, it is likely the result of a "wet
merger" rather than a "dry merger". We compare the physical properties from our
simulated disks (e.g. size and mass) and find reasonably good agreement with
recent observations. Finally, we discuss the detectability of these disks as an
aid to future observations.
