Variable ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs), which are considered to be black
hole binaries (BHBs), are known to show state transitions similarly to Galactic
BHBs. However, the relation between the ULX states and the Galactic BHB states
is still unclear primarily due to less well-understood behaviors of ULXs in
contrast to the Galactic BHBs. Here, we report a statistical X-ray spectral
study of 34 energy spectra from seven bright ULXs in the interacting galaxy
systems M51 and NGC4490/85, using archive data from multiple Chandra and
XMM-Newton observations spanning for a few years. In order to compare with
Galactic BHB states, we applied representative spectral models of BHBs; a
power-law (PL), a multi-color disk black body (MCD), and a slim disk model to
all the ULX spectra. We found a hint of a bimodal structure in the luminosity
distribution of the samples, suggesting that ULXs have two states with typical
luminosities of 3-6*10^{39} and 1.5-3*10^{39} ergs/s. Most spectra in the
brighter state are explained by the MCD or the slim disk model, whereas those
in the fainter state are explained by the PL model. In particular, the slim
disk model successfully explains the observed spectral variations of NGC4490/85
ULX-6 and ULX-8 by changes of the mass accretion rate to a black hole of an
estimated mass of <40 Msun. From the best-fit model parameters of each state,
we speculate that the brighter state in these two ULXs corresponds to the
brightest state of Galactic BHBs, which is often called the ``apparently
standard state''. The fainter state of the ULXs has a PL shaped spectrum, but
the photon index range is much wider than that seen in any single state of
Galactic BHBs. We thus speculate that it is a state unique to ULXs. Some
sources show much fainter and steeper spectra than the faint state, which we
identified as another state.
