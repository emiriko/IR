We analyze theoretically the phenomenon of electromagnetically induced
transparency (EIT) under conditions where the probe laser is not in the usual
weak limit. We consider the effects in both three-level and four-level systems,
which are either closed or open (due to losses to an external metastable
level). We find that the EIT dip almost disappears in a closed three-level
system but survives in an open system. In four-level systems, there is a narrow
enhanced-absorption peak (EITA) at line center, which has applications as an
optical clock. The peak converts to an EIT dip in a closed system, but again
survives in an open system.
