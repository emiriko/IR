Recently, the problem of obtaining a short regular expression equivalent to a
given finite automaton has been intensively investigated. Algorithms for
converting finite automata to regular expressions have an exponential blow-up
in the worst-case. To overcome this, simple heuristic methods have been
proposed.
  In this paper we analyse some of the heuristics presented in the literature
and propose new ones. We also present some experimental comparative results
based on uniform random generated deterministic finite automata.
