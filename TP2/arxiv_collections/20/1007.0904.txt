We consider in this paper the problem of information reconciliation in the
context of secret key agreement between two legitimate parties, Alice and Bob.
Beginning the discussion with the secret key agreement model introduced by
Ahlswede and Csisz\'ar, the channel-type model with wiretapper, we study a
protocol based on error correcting codes. The protocol can be adapted to
changes in the communication channel extending the original source. The
efficiency of the reconciliation is only limited by the quality of the code
and, while transmitting more information than needed to reconcile Alice's and
Bob's sequences, it does not reveal any more information on the original source
than an ad-hoc code would have revealed.
