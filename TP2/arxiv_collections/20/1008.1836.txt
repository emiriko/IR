Tropicalization is a procedure that assigns polyhedral complexes to algebraic
subvarieties of a torus. If one fixes a weighted polyhedral complex, one may
study the set of all subvarieties of a toric variety that have that complex as
their tropicalization. This gives a "tropical realization" moduli functor. We
use rigid analytic geometry and the combinatorics of Chow complexes as studied
by Alex Fink to prove that when the ambient toric variety is quasiprojective,
the moduli functor is represented by a rigid space. As an application, we show
that if a polyhedral complex is the tropicalization of a formal family of
varieties then it is the tropicalization of an algebraic family of varieties.
