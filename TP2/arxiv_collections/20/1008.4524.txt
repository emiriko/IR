The continuum high-energy gamma-ray emission between 1 GeV and 100 TeV from
the Crab Nebula has been measured for the first time in overlapping energy
bands by the Fermi large-area telescope (Fermi/LAT) below ~ 100 GeV and by
ground-based imaging air Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) above ~ 60 GeV. To follow
up on the phenomenological approach suggested by Hillas et al. (1998), the
broad band spectral and spatial measurement (from radio to low-energy
gamma-rays < 1 GeV) is used to extract the shape of the electron spectrum.
While this model per construction provides an excellent description of the data
at energies < 1 GeV, the predicted inverse Compton component matches the
combined Fermi/LAT and IACT measurements remarkably well after including all
relevant seed photon fields and fitting the average magnetic field to B = (124
+/- 6 (stat.) +15 / -6 (sys.)) {\mu}G. The close match of the resulting broad
band inverse Compton component with the combined Fermi/LAT and IACTs data is
used to derive instrument specific energy-calibration factors. These factors
can be used to combine data from Fermi/LAT and IACTs without suffering from
systematic uncertainties on the common energy scale. As a first application of
the cross calibration, we derive an upper limit to the diffuse gamma-ray
emission between 250 GeV and 1 TeV based upon the combined measurements of
Fermi/LAT and the H.E.S.S. ground-based Cherenkov telescopes. Finally, the
predictions of the magneto-hydrodynamic flow model of Kennel & Coroniti (1984)
are compared to the measured SED.
