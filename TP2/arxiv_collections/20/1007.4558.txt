The quantum critical properties of the sub-Ohmic spin-1/2 spin-boson model
and of the Bose-Fermi Kondo model have recently been discussed controversially.
The role of the Berry phase in the breakdown of the quantum-to-classical
mapping of quantum criticality in the spin-isotropic Bose-Fermi Kondo model has
been discussed previously. In the present article, some of the subtleties
underlying the functional integral representation of the spin-boson and related
models with spin anisotropy are discussed. To this end, an introduction to spin
coherent states and spin path integrals is presented with a focus on the
spin-boson model. It is shown that, even for the Ising-anisotropic case as in
the spin-boson model, the path integral in the continuum limit in the coherent
state representation involves a Berry phase term. As a result, the effective
action for the spin degrees of freedom does not assume the form of a
Ginzburg-Landau-Wilson functional. The implications of the Berry-phase term for
the quantum-critical behavior of the spin-boson model are discussed. The case
of arbitrary spin is also considered.
