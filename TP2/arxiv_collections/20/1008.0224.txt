Complex Ginzburg-Landau (CGL) models of laser media (with the cubic-quintic
nonlinearity) do not contain an effective diffusion term, which makes all
vortex solitons unstable in these models. Recently, it has been demonstrated
that the addition of a two-dimensional periodic potential, which may be induced
by a transverse grating in the laser cavity, to the CGL equation stabilizes
compound (four-peak) vortices, but the most fundamental "crater-shaped"
vortices (CSVs), alias vortex rings, which are, essentially, squeezed into a
single cell of the potential, have not been found before in a stable form. In
this work we report families of stable compact CSVs with vorticity S=1 in the
CGL model with the external potential of two different types: an axisymmetric
parabolic trap, and the periodic potential. In both cases, we identify
stability region for the CSVs and for the fundamental solitons (S=0). Those
CSVs which are unstable in the axisymmetric potential break up into robust
dipoles. All the vortices with S=2 are unstable, splitting into tripoles.
Stability regions for the dipoles and tripoles are identified too. The periodic
potential cannot stabilize CSVs with S>=2 either; instead, families of stable
compact square-shaped quadrupoles are found.
