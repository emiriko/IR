The C-Algorithm introduced in [Chouikha2007] is designed to determine
isochronous centers for Lienard-type differential systems, in the general real
analytic case. However, it has a large complexity that prevents computations,
even in the quartic polynomial case.
  The main result of this paper is an efficient algorithmic implementation of
C-Algorithm, called ReCA (Reduced C-Algorithm). Moreover, an adapted version of
it is proposed in the rational case. It is called RCA (Rational C-Algorithm)
and is widely used in [BardetBoussaadaChouikhaStrelcyn2010] and
[BoussaadaChouikhaStrelcyn2010] to find many new examples of isochronous
centers for the Li\'enard type equation.
