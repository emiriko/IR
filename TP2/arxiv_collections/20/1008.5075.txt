In recent years Hagedorn states have been used to explain the physics close
to the critical temperature within a hadron gas. Because of their large decay
widths these massive resonances lower $\eta/s$ to near the AdS/CFT limit within
the hadron gas phase.
  A comparison of the Hagedorn model to recent lattice results is made and it
is found that for both Tc =176 MeV and Tc=196 MeV, the hadrons can reach
chemical equilibrium almost immediately, well before the chemical freeze-out
temperatures found in thermal fits for a hadron gas without Hagedorn states. In
this paper we also observe the effects of Hagedorn States on the $K^+/\pi^+$
horn seen at AGS, SPS, and RHIC.
