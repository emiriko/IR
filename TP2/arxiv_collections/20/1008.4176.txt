Huang's Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) is an algorithm for analyzing
nonstationary data that provides a localized time-frequency representation by
decomposing the data into adaptively defined modes. EMD can be used to estimate
a signal's instantaneous frequency (IF) but suffers from poor performance in
the presence of noise. To produce a meaningful IF, each mode of the
decomposition must be nearly monochromatic, a condition that is not guaranteed
by the algorithm and fails to be met when the signal is corrupted by noise. In
this work, the extraction of modes containing both signal and noise is
identified as the cause of poor IF estimation. The specific mechanism by which
such "transition" modes are extracted is detailed and builds on the observation
of Flandrin and Goncalves that EMD acts in a filter bank manner when analyzing
pure noise. The mechanism is shown to be dependent on spectral leak between
modes and the phase of the underlying signal. These ideas are developed through
the use of simple signals and are tested on a synthetic seismic waveform.
