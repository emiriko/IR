This paper considers the invariance of knot Floer homology in a purely
algebraic setting, without reference to Heegaard diagrams, holomorphic disks,
or grid diagrams. We show that (a small modification of) Ozsv\'ath and
Szab\'o's cube of resolutions for knot Floer homology, which is assigned to a
braid presentation with a basepoint, is invariant under braid-like Reidemeister
moves II and III and under conjugation. All moves are assumed to happen away
from the basepoint. We also describe the behavior of the cube of resolutions
under stabilization. The techniques echo those employed to prove the invariance
of HOMFLY-PT homology by Khovanov and Rozansky, and are further evidence of a
close relationship between the theories. The key idea is to prove categorified
versions of certain equalities satisfied by the Murakami-Ohtsuki-Yamada state
model for the HOMFLY-PT polynomial.
