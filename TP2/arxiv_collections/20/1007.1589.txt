The design of electron multiplying CCD cameras require a very different
approach from that appropriate for slow scan CCD operation. This paper
describes the main problems in using electron multiplying CCDs for high-speed,
photon counting applications in astronomy and how these may be substantially
overcome. With careful design it is possible to operate the E2V Technologies
L3CCDs at rates well in excess of that claimed by the manufacturer, and that
levels of clock induced charge dramatically lower than those experienced with
commercial cameras that need to operate at unity gain. Measurements of the
performance of the E2V Technologies CCD201 operating at 26 MHz will be
presented together with a guide to the effective reduction of clock induced
charge levels. Examples of astronomical results obtained with our cameras are
presented.
