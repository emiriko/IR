This paper presents a straightforward application of an indirect method based
on a three-microphone impedance tube setup to determine the non-acoustic
properties of a sound absorbing porous material. First, a three-microphone
impedance tube technique is used to measure some acoustic properties of the
material (i.e., sound absorption coefficient, sound transmission loss,
effective density and effective bulk modulus) regarded here as an equivalent
fluid. Second, an indirect characterization allows one to extract its
non-acoustic properties (i.e., static airflow resistivity, tortuosity, viscous
and thermal characteristic lengths) from the measured effective properties and
the material open porosity. The procedure is applied to four different sound
absorbing materials and results of the characterization are compared with
existing direct and inverse methods. Predictions of the acoustic behavior using
an equivalent fluid model and the found non-acoustic properties are in good
agreement with impedance tube measurements.
