Using shape theory and the concept of cellularity, we show that if $A$ is the
global attractor associated with a dissipative partial differential equation in
a real Hilbert space $H$ and the set $A-A$ has finite Assouad dimension $d$,
then there is an ordinary differential equation in ${\mathbb R}^{m+1}$, with $m
>d$, that has unique solutions and reproduces the dynamics on $A$. Moreover,
the dynamical system generated by this new ordinary differential equation has a
global attractor $X$ arbitrarily close to $LA$, where $L$ is a homeomorphism
from $A$ into ${\mathbb R}^{m+1}$.
