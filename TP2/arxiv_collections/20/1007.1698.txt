The frequency and temperature dependence of the dielectric constant, electric
modulus and electrical conductivity of the transparent glasses in the
composition 0.5Li2O-0.5Na2O-2B2O3 (LNBO) were investigated in the 100 Hz - 10
MHz frequency range. The dielectric data have been analyzed using Cole-Cole
equation with an addition of the conductivity term. The electrical conductivity
was found to be obeying Jonscher's universal law. The dielectric constant and
the loss for the as-quenched glasses increased with increasing temperature,
exhibiting anomalies in the vicinity of the glass transition and
crystallization temperatures. The bulk DC conductivity at various temperatures
was extracted from the electrical relaxation data. Conductivity plots were not
found to follow Summerfield scaling due to mixed alkali effect. The imaginary
part of electric modulus spectra was modeled using an approximate solution of
Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts (KWW) relation. The stretching exponent, {\beta}, was
found to be 0.56 and temperature independent.
