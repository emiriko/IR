We report measurements of electronic, thermoelectric, and galvanomagnetic
properties of individual single crystal antimony telluride (Sb2Te3) nanowires
with diameters in the range of 20-100 nm. Temperature dependent resistivity and
thermoelectric power (TEP) measurements indicate hole dominant diffusive
thermoelectric generation, with an enhancement of the TEP for smaller diameter
wires up to 110 uV/K at T = 300 K. We measure the magnetoresistance, in
magnetic fields both parallel and perpendicular to the nanowire [110] axis,
where strong anisotropic positive magnetoresistance behavior was observed.
