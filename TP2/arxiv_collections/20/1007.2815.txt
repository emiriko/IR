A microscopic formulation of the definition of both the heat flux and the
viscous stress tensor is proposed in the framework of kinetic theory for
relativistic gases emphasizing on the physical nature of such fluxes. A Lorentz
transformation is introduced as the link between the laboratory and local
comoving frames and thus between molecular and chaotic velocities. With such
transformation, the dissipative effects can be identified as the averages of
the chaotic kinetic energy and the momentum flux out of equilibrium,
respectively. Within this framework, a kinetic foundation of the ensuing
transport equations for the relativistic gas is achieved. To our knowledge,
this result is completely novel.
