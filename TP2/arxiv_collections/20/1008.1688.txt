We propose and analyze an on-chip all-optical dynamical tuning scheme for
coupled nonlinear resonators employing a single control beam injected in
parallel with a signal beam. We show that nonlinear Kerr response can be used
to dynamically switch the spectral properties between "dark-state" and
electromagnetically-induced transparency configurations. Such scheme can be
realized in integrated optical applications for pulse trapping and delaying.
