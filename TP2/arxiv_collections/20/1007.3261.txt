The Herschel Space Observatory opens the sky for observations in the far
infrared at high spectral and spatial resolution. A particular class of
molecules will be directly observable; light diatomic hydrides and their ions
(CH, OH, SH, NH, CH+, OH+, SH+, NH+). These simple constituents are important
both for the chemical evolution of the region and as tracers of high-energy
radiation. If outflows of a forming star erode cavities in the envelope,
protostellar far UV (FUV; 6 < E_gamma < 13.6 eV) radiation may escape through
such low-density regions. Depending on the shape of the cavity, the FUV
radiation then irradiates the quiescent envelope in the walls along the
outflow. The chemical composition in these outflow walls is altered by
photoreactions and heating via FUV photons in a manner similar to photo
dominated regions (PDRs).
  In this work, we study the effect of cavity shapes, outflow density, and of a
disk with the two-dimensional chemical model of a high-mass young stellar
object introduced in the second paper in this series.
  We find that the shape of the cavity is particularly important in the
innermost part of the envelope, where the dust temperatures are high enough (>
100 K) for water ice to evaporate. If the cavity shape allows FUV radiation to
penetrate this hot-core region, the abundance of FUV destroyed species (e.g.
water) is decreased. In particular, diatomic hydrides and their ions CH$+, OH+
and NH+ are enhanced by many orders of magnitude in the outflow walls due to
the combination of high gas temperatures and rapid photodissociation of more
saturated species. The enhancement of these diatomic hydrides is sufficient for
a detection using the HIFI and PACS instruments onboard Herschel. The effect of
X-ray ionization on the chemistry is found to be small, due to the much larger
luminosity in FUV bands compared to X-rays.
