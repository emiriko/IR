The present paper studies an operator norm that captures the
distinguishability of quantum strategies in the same sense that the trace norm
captures the distinguishability of quantum states or the diamond norm captures
the distinguishability of quantum channels. Characterizations of its unit ball
and dual norm are established via strong duality of a semidefinite optimization
problem. A full, formal proof of strong duality is presented for the
semidefinite optimization problem in question. This norm and its properties are
employed to generalize a state discrimination result of Ref. [GW05]. The
generalized result states that for any two convex sets S,T of strategies there
exists a fixed interactive measurement scheme that successfully distinguishes
any choice of s in S from any choice of t in T with bias proportional to the
minimal distance between the sets S and T as measured by this norm. A similar
discrimination result for channels then follows as a special case.
