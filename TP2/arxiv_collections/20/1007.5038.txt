The connections between the X(5)-models (the original X(5) using an infinite
square well, X(5)-$\beta^8$, X(5)-$\beta^6$, X(5)-$\beta^4$, and
X(5)-$\beta^2$), based on particular solutions of the geometrical Bohr
Hamiltonian with harmonic potential in the $\gamma$ degree of freedom, and the
interacting boson model (IBM) are explored. This work is the natural extension
of the work presented in [1] for the E(5)-models. For that purpose, a quite
general one- and two-body IBM Hamiltonian is used and a numerical fit to the
different X(5)-models energies is performed, later on the obtained wave
functions are used to calculate B(E2) transition rates. It is shown that within
the IBM one can reproduce well the results for energies and B(E2) transition
rates obtained with all these X(5)-models, although the agreement is not so
impressive as for the E(5)-models. From the fitted IBM parameters the
corresponding energy surface can be extracted and it is obtained that,
surprisingly, only the X(5) case corresponds in the moderate large N limit to
an energy surface very close to the one expected for a critical point, while
the rest of models seat a little farther.
