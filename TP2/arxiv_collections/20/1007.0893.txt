We present a calculation of O(\alpha_s) contributions to the process of
t-channel single-top production and decay, which include virtual and real
corrections arising from interference of the production and decay subprocesses.
The calculation is organized as a simultaneous expansion of the matrix elements
in the couplings \alpha_{ew},\alpha_s and the virtuality of the intermediate
top quark, (p_t^2-m_t^2)/m_t^2 ~ \Gamma_t/m_t, and extends earlier results
beyond the narrow-width approximation.
