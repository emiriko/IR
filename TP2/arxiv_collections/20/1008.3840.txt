In this paper it was developed a modification of the known multiagent model
Minority Game, designed to simulate the behavior of traders in financial
markets and the resulting price dynamics on the abstract resource. The model
was implemented in the form of software. The modified version of Minority Game
was investigated with the aim of reproducing the basic properties of real
financial time series. It was proved that such properties as the clustering of
volatility, the Levy distribution and multifractality are inherent for
generated by this version of the Minority Game time series of prices.
