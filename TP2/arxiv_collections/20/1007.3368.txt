Two definitions of Mach's principle are proposed. Both are related to gauge
theory, are universal in scope and amount to formulations of causality that
take into account the relational nature of position, time, and size. One of
them leads directly to general relativity and may have relevance to the problem
of creating a quantum theory of gravity.
