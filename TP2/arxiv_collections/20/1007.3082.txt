The knowledge of accurate stellar parameters is paramount in several fields
of stellar astrophysics, particularly in the study of extrasolar planets, where
often the star is the only visible component and therefore used to infer the
planet's fundamental parameters. Another important aspect of the analysis of
planetary systems is the stellar activity and the possible star-planet
interaction. Here we present a self-consistent abundance analysis of the planet
hosting star WASP-12 and a high-precision search for a structured stellar
magnetic field on the basis of spectropolarimetric observations obtained with
the ESPaDOnS spectropolarimeter. Our results show that the star does not have a
structured magnetic field, and that the obtained fundamental parameters are in
good agreement with what was previously published. In addition we derive
improved constraints on the stellar age (1.0-2.65 Gyr), mass (1.23-1.49 M/M0),
and distance (295-465 pc). WASP-12 is an ideal object to look for pollution
signatures in the stellar atmosphere. We analyse the WASP-12 abundances as a
function of the condensation temperature and compare them with those published
by several other authors on planet hosting and non-planet hosting stars. We
find hints of atmospheric pollution in WASP-12's photosphere, but are unable to
reach firm conclusions with our present data. We conclude that a differential
analysis based on WASP-12 twins will probably clarify if an atmospheric
pollution is present, the nature of this pollution and its implications in the
planet formation and evolution. We attempt also the direct detection of the
circumstellar disk through infrared excess, but without success.
