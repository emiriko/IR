We propose to use a rotating corrugated material plate in order to stir,
through the Casimir-Polder interaction, quantized vortices in an harmonically
trapped Bose-Einstein condensate. The emergence of such vortices within the
condensate cannot be explained with a computation of the Casimir-Polder
potential based on the pairwise summation approach or on the proximity force
approximation. It thus appears as a genuine signature of non-trivial geometry
effects on the electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations, which fully exploits the
superfluid nature of the sample. In order to discuss quantitatively the
generation of Casimir-driven vortices, we derive an exact non-perturbative
theory of the Casimir-Polder potential felt by the atoms in front of the
grating. Our numerical results for a Rb condensate close to a Si grating show
that the resulting quantum vacuum torque is strong enough to provide a
contactless transfer of angular momentum to the condensate and generate
quantized vortices under realistic experimental conditions at separation
distances around $3$ microns.
