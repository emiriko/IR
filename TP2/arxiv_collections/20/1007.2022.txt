In this paper, we study a method to obtain non-Abelian FQH state through
double-layer FQH states and fractional exciton condensation. In particular, we
find that starting with the (330) double-layer state and then increasing the
interlayer tunneling strength, we may obtain a single-layer non-Abelian FQH
state S(330). We show that the S(330) state is actually the Z_4 parafermion
Read-Rezayi state. We also calculate the edge excitation of the S(330) state.
