We present an experimental method to produce 4-qubit phased Dicke states,
based on a source of 2-photon hyperentangled states. By introducing quantum
noise in the multipartite system in a controlled way, we have tested the
robustness of these states. To this purpose the entanglement of the resulting
multipartite entangled mixed states has been verified by using a new kind of
structural witness.
