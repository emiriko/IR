We bound the number of nearly orthogonal vectors with fixed VC-dimension over
$\setpm^n$. Our bounds are of interest in machine learning and empirical
process theory and improve previous bounds by Haussler. The bounds are based on
a simple projection argument and the generalize to other product spaces. Along
the way we derive tight bounds on the sum of binomial coefficients in terms of
the entropy function.
