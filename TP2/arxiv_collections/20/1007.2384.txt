We report on several methodologically different NNLO determinations of the
strong coupling constant from event shapes and related observables in e+e-
annihilation. The event shape distributions are analyzed within a combined
framework of NNLO and NNLA resummation. We also investigate the role of
hadronisation corrections, using both Monte Carlo generator predictions and
analytic models to parametrise non-perturbative power corrections.
