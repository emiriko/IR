The Z CMa binary is understood to undergo both FU Orionis (FUOR) and EX
Orionis (EXOR) type outbursts. While the SE component has been spectro-
scopically identified as an FUOR, the NW component, a Herbig Be star, is the
source of the EXOR outbursts. The system has been identified as the source of a
large outflow, however, previous studies have failed to identify the driver.
Here we present adaptive optics (AO) assisted [FeII] spectro-images which
reveal for the first time the presence of two jets. Observations made using
OSIRIS at the Keck Observatory show the Herbig Be star to be the source of the
parsec-scale outflow, which within 2'' of the source shows signs of wiggling
and the FUOR to '' be driving a ~ 0.4 jet. The wiggling of the Herbig Be star's
jet is evidence for an additional companion which could in fact be generating
the EXOR outbursts, the last of which began in 2008 (Grankin & Artemenko 2009).
Indeed the dy- namical scale of the wiggling corresponds to a time-scale of 4-8
years which is in agreement with the time-scale of these outbursts. The
spectro-images also show a bow-shock shaped feature and possible associated
knots. The origin of this structure is as of yet unclear. Finally interesting
low velocity structure is also observed. One possibility is that it originates
in a wide-angle outflow launched from a circumbinary disk.
