We study atomic systems that are in the frequency range of optical atomic
clocks and have enhanced sensitivity to potential time-variation of the fine
structure constant, alpha. The high sensitivity is due to coherent
contributions from three factors: high nuclear charge Z, high ionization
degree, and significant differences in the configuration composition of the
states involved. Configuration crossing keeps the frequencies in the optical
range despite the large ionization energies. We discuss a few promising
examples that have the largest alpha-sensitivities seen in atomic systems.
