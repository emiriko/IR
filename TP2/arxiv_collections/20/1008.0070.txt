Entangled quantum states are an important element of quantum information
techniques. We determine the requirements for states of quadrupolar nuclei with
spins >1/2 to be entangled. It was shown that entanglement is achieved at low
temperature by applying a magnetic field to a quadrupolar nuclei possess
quadrupole moments, which interacts with the electricfield gradient produced by
the charge distribution in their surroundings.
