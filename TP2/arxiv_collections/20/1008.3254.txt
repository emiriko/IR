With increasing electron-phonon coupling as described within the t-J-Holstein
model, bipolaron kinetic energy is lowered in comparison with that of the
polaron. This effect is accompanied with "undressing" of bipolaron from lattice
degrees of freedom. Consequently, the effective bipolaron mass becomes smaller
than the polaron mass. Magnetic as well as lattice degrees of freedom
cooperatively contribute to formation of spin-lattice bipolarons.
