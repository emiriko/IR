An abundance analysis is presented for IRAS 18095+2704 (V887 Her), a post-AGB
star and proto-planetary nebula. The analysis is based on high-resolution
optical spectra from the McDonald Observatory and the Special Astrophysical
Observatory. Standard analysis using a classical Kurucz model atmosphere and
the line analysis program MOOG provides the atmospheric parameters: Teff = 6500
K, log g = +0.5, and a microturbulent velocity Vt = 4.7 km/s and [Fe/H] = -0.9.
Extraction of these parameters is based on excitation of FeI lines, ionization
equilibrium between neutral and ions of Mg, Ca, Ti, Cr, and Fe, and the wings
of hydrogen Paschen lines. Elemental abundances are obtained for 22 elements
and upper limits for an additional four elements. These results show that the
star's atmosphere has not experienced a significant number of C- and s-process
enriching thermal pulses. Abundance anomalies as judged relative to the
compositions of unevolved and less-evolved normal stars of a similar
metallicity include Al, Y, and Zr deficiencies with respect to Fe of about 0.5
dex. Judged by composition, the star resembles a RV Tauri variable that has
been mildly affected by dust-gas separation reducing the abundances of the
elements of highest condensation temperature. This separation may occur in the
stellar wind. There are indications that the standard 1D LTE analysis is not
entirely appropriate for IRAS 18095+2704. These include a supersonic
macroturbulent velocity of 23 km/s, emission in H-alpha and the failure of
predicted profiles to fit observed profiles of H-beta and H-gamma.
