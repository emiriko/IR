In the framework of superanalysis we get a functions theory close to complex
analysis, under a suitable condition (A) on the real superalgebras in
consideration (this condition is a generalization of the classical relation 1 +
i^2 = 0 in C). Under the condition (A), we get an integral representation
formula for the superdifferentiable functions.We give a result of Hartogs type
of separated superdifferentiability, a continuation theorem of Hartogs-Bochner
type and a Liouville theorem for the superdifferentiable functions.
