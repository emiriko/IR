In this paper we study radial solutions of certain two-dimensional nonlinear
Schr\"odinger equation with harmonic potential, which is supercritical with
respect to the initial data. By combining the nonlinear smoothing effect of
Schr \"odinger equation with Lp estimates of Laguerre functions, we are able to
prove an almost sure global well-posedness result and the invariance of the
Gibbs measure. We also discuss an application to the NLS equation without
harmonic potential.
