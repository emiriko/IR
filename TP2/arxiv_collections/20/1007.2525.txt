It is shown that the optical-electronic system consisted of the transmission
Bragg grating, a laser and the intermediate sensitive to the vibrations mirror
can detect the vibrations, when touched by them laser beam scan will exceed the
angular divergence of the beam. The mathematical model of the sensor of the
vibrations presented in the form of Taylor series describes the system response
taking into account the operating point, in particular, describes the effect of
the doubling of the modulation frequency response relative to the frequency of
acting vibrations.
