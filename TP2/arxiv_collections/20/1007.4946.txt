The Lorentz-invariant S-matrix elements in interacting quantum field theory
(QFT) are used to represent the QFT state by a Lorentz-invariant many-time wave
function. Such a wave function can be used to describe inelastic scattering
processes (involving particle creation and destruction) by Bohmian particle
trajectories satisfying relativistic-covariant equations of motion.
