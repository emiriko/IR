Harder's reduction theory provides filtrations of euclidean buildings that
allow one to deduce cohomological and homological properties of S-arithmetic
groups over global function fields. In this survey I will sketch the main
points of Harder's reduction theory starting from Weil's geometry of numbers
and the Riemann-Roch theorem, describe a filtration that is particularly useful
for deriving finiteness properties of S-arithmetic groups, and state the rank
conjecture and its partial verifications that do not restrict the cardinality
of the underlying field of constants. As a motivation for further research I
also state a much more general conjecture on isoperimetric properties of
S-arithmetic groups over global fields (number fields or function fields).
