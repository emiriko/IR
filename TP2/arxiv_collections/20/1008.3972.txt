A fractional relaxation equation in dielectrics with response function of the
Havriliak-Negami type is derived. An explicit expression for the fractional
operator in this equation is obtained and Monte Carlo algorithm for calculation
of action of this operator is constructed. Relaxation functions calculated
numerically according to this scheme coincide with analytical functions
obtained earlier by other authors. The algorithm represents a numerical way of
calculation in relaxation problems with arbitrary initial and boundary
conditions. A fractional equation for electromagnetic waves in such dielectric
media is obtained. Numerical results are in a good agreement with experimental
data.
