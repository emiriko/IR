We investigate the effect of $A$-site size differences in the double
perovskites BiScO$_3$-$M$NbO$_3$ ($M$$=$Na, K and Rb) using first-principles
calculations. We find that the polarization of these materials is 70$\sim$90
$\mu$C/cm$^2$ along the rhombohedral direction. The main contribution to the
high polarization comes from large off-centerings of Bi ions, which are
strongly enhanced by the suppression of octahedral tilts as the $M$ ion size
increases. A high Born effective charge of Nb also contributes to the
polarization and this contribution is also enhanced by increasing the $M$ ion
size.
