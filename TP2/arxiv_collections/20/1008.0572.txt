A variational theory is proposed for the quasiparticle excitation in high
T$_{c}$ cuprates. The theory goes beyond the usual Gutzwiller projected mean
field state description by including the spin-charge recombination effect in
the RVB background. The spin-charge recombination effect is found to
qualitatively alter the behavior of the quasiparticle charge as a function of
doping and cause considerable anisotropy in quasiparticle weight on the Fermi
surface.
