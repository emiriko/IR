Present knowledge of QCD n-point functions of Wilson lines at high energies
is rather limited. In practical applications, it is therefore customary to
factorize higher n-point functions into products of two-point functions
(dipoles) which satisfy the BK evolution equation. We employ the JIMWLK
formalism to derive explicit evolution equations for the 4- and 6-point
functions of fundamental Wilson lines and show that if the Gaussian
approximation is carried out before the rapidity evolution step is taken, then
many leading order N_c contributions are missed. Our evolution equations could
specifically be used to improve calculations of forward dijet angular
correlations, recently measured by the STAR collaboration in deuteron-gold
collisions at the RHIC collider. Forward dijets in proton-proton collisions at
the LHC probe QCD evolution at even smaller light-cone momentum fractions. Such
correlations may provide insight into genuine differences between the JIMWLK
and BK approaches.
