The eigenvalue densities of two random matrix ensembles, the Wigner Gaussian
matrices and the Wishart covariant matrices, are decomposed in the
contributions of each individual eigenvalue distribution. It is shown that the
fluctuations of all eigenvalues, for medium matrix sizes, are described with a
good precision by nearly normal distributions.
