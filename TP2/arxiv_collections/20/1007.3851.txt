We study the correction to the scale invariant power spectrum of a scalar
field on de Sitter space from small black holes that formed during a
pre-inflationary matter dominated era. The formation probability of such black
holes is estimated from primordial Gaussian density fluctuations. We determine
the correction to the spectrum by first deriving the Keldysh propagator for a
massless scalar field on Schwarzschild-de Sitter space. Our results suggest
that the effect is strong enough to be tested -- and possibly even ruled out --
by observations.
