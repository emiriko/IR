With the discovery of Dark Energy, $\Lambda_{DE}$, there is now a universal
length scale, $\ell_{DE}=c/(\Lambda_{DE} G)^{1/2}$, associated with the
universe that allows for an extension of the geodesic equations of motion. In
this paper, we will study a specific class of such extensions, and show that
contrary to expectations, they are not automatically ruled out by either
theoretical considerations or experimental constraints. In particular, we show
that while these extensions affect the motion of massive particles, the motion
of massless particles are not changed; such phenomena as gravitational lensing
remain unchanged. We also show that these extensions do not violate the
equivalence principal, and that because $\ell_{DE}=14010^{800}_{820}$ Mpc, a
specific choice of this extension can be made so that effects of this extension
are not be measurable either from terrestrial experiments, or through
observations of the motion of solar system bodies. A lower bound for the only
parameter used in this extension is set.
