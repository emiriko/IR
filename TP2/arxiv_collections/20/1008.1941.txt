Two sets of vectors, covariant and orthogonal Lyapunov vectors (CLVs/OLVs),
are currently used to characterize the linear stability of chaotic systems. A
comparison is made to show their similarity and difference, especially with
respect to the influence on hydrodynamic Lyapunov modes (HLMs). Our numerical
simulations show that in both Hamiltonian and dissipative systems HLMs formerly
detected via OLVs survive if CLVs are used instead. Moreover the previous
classification of two universality classes works for CLVs as well, i.e. the
dispersion relation is linear for Hamiltonian systems and quadratic for
dissipative systems respectively. The significance of HLMs changes in different
ways for Hamiltonian and dissipative systems with the replacement of OLVs by
CLVs. For general dissipative systems with nonhyperbolic dynamics the long wave
length structure in Lyapunov vectors corresponding to near-zero Lyapunov
exponents is strongly reduced if CLVs are used instead, whereas for highly
hyperbolic dissipative systems the significance of HLMs is nearly identical for
CLVs and OLVs. In contrast the HLM significance of Hamiltonian systems is
always comparable for CLVs and OLVs irrespective of hyperbolicity. We also find
that in Hamiltonian systems different symmetry relations between conjugate
pairs are observed for CLVs and OLVs. Especially, CLVs in a conjugate pair are
statistically indistinguishable in consequence of the micro- reversibility of
Hamiltonian systems. Transformation properties of Lyapunov exponents, CLVs and
hyperbolicity under changes of coordinate are discussed in appendices.
