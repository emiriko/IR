This is a survey of the Kawamata-Morrison cone conjecture on the structure of
Calabi-Yau varieties and more generally Calabi-Yau pairs. We discuss the proof
of the cone conjecture for algebraic surfaces, with plenty of examples.
  We show that the automorphism group of a K3 surface need not be commensurable
with an arithmetic group, which answers a question by Mazur.
