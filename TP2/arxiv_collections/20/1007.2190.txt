If supersymmetry is observed at the LHC its model parameters can be measured
at the electroweak scale. We discuss the expected precision on the parameter
determination, including a proper treatment of experimental and theoretical
errors. Particular attention is paid to degenerate solutions. Using the SFitter
framework we perform a bottom-up reconstruction of the unified parameters at
the high scale, including a full error propagation.
