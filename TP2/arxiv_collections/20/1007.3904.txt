Large scale Monte Carlo simulation results for the two-orbital model for
manganites, including Jahn-Teller lattice distortions, are here presented. At
hole density x=1/4 and in the vicinity of the region of competition between the
ferromagnetic metallic and spin-charge-orbital ordered insulating phases, the
colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) phenomenon is observed with a
magnetoresistance ratio ~10,000% Our main result is that this CMR transition is
found to be of first order in some portions of the phase diagram, in agreement
with early results from neutron scattering, specific heat, and magnetization,
thus solving a notorious discrepancy between experiments and previous
theoretical studies. The first-order characteristics of the transition survive,
and are actually enhanced, when weak quenched disorder is introduced.
