Efficient electronic structure methods can be built around efficient tensor
representations of the wavefunction. Here we describe a general view of tensor
factorization for the compact representation of electronic wavefunctions. We
use these ideas to construct low-complexity representations of the doubles
amplitudes in local second order M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory. We
introduce two approximations - the direct orbital specific virtual
approximation and the full orbital specific virtual approximation. In these
approximations, each occupied orbital is associated with a small set of
correlating virtual orbitals. Conceptually, the representation lies between the
projected atomic orbital representation in Pulay-Saeb{\o} local correlation
theories and pair natural orbital correlation theories. We have tested the
orbital specific virtual approximations on a variety of systems and properties
including total energies, reaction energies, and potential energy curves.
Compared to the Pulay-Saeb{\o} ansatz, we find that these approximations
exhibit favourable accuracy and computational times, while yielding smooth
potential energy curves.
