The electronic properties, exchange interactions, finite-temperature
magnetism, and transport properties of random quaternary Heusler Ni$_{2}$MnSn
alloys doped with Cu- and Pd-atoms are studied theoretically by means of {\it
ab initio} calculations over the entire range of dopant concentrations. While
the magnetic moments are only weakly dependent on the alloy composition, the
Curie temperatures exhibit strongly non-linear behavior with respect to
Cu-doping in contrast with an almost linear concentration dependence in the
case of Pd-doping. The present parameter-free theory agrees qualitatively and
also reasonably well quantitatively with the available experimental results. An
analysis of exchange interactions is provided for a deeper understanding of the
problem. The dopant atoms perturb electronic structure close to the Fermi
energy only weakly and the residual resistivity thus obeys a simple Nordheim
rule. The dominating contribution to the temperature-dependent resistivity is
due to thermodynamical fluctuations originating from the spin-disorder, which,
according to our calculations, can be described successfully via the disordered
local moments model. Results based on this model agree fairly well with the
measured values of spin-disorder induced resistivity.
