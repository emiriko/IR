I apply the algebraic classification of self-adjoint endomorphisms of ${\bf
R}^{2,2}$ provided by their Jordan canonical form to the Ricci curvature tensor
of four-dimensional neutral manifolds and relate this classification to an
algebraic classification of the Ricci curvature spinor. These results parallel
similar results well known in four-dimensional Lorentzian geometry. The
classification is summarized in Table 2 at the end of the paper.
