We consider a mesoscopic {\it ballistic} structure with Rashba spin-orbit
splitting of the electron spectrum. The ballistic region is attached to the
leads with a voltage applied between them. We calculate the edge spin density
which appears in the presence of a charge current through the structure due to
the difference in populations of electrons coming from different leads.
Combined effect of the boundary scattering and spin precession leads to
oscillations of the edge polarization with the envelope function decaying as a
power law of the distance from the boundary. The problem is solved with the use
of scattering states. The simplicity of the method allows to gain an insight
into the underlaying physics. We clarify the role of the unitarity of
scattering for the problem of edge spin accumulation. In case of a straight
boundary it leads to exact cancellation of all long-wave oscillations of the
spin density. As a result, only the Friedel-like spin density oscillations with
the momentum 2k_F survive. However, this appears to be rather exceptional case.
In general, the smooth spin oscillations with the spin precession length
recover, as it happens, e.g., for the wiggly boundary. We demonstrate also,
that there is no relation between the spin current in the bulk, which is zero
in the considered case, and the edge spin accumulation.
