Electromagnetic properties of the nucleon are explored with lattice QCD using
a novel technique. Focusing on background electric fields, we show how the
electric polarizability can be extracted from nucleon correlation functions. A
crucial step concerns addressing contributions from the magnetic moment, which
affects the relativistic propagation of nucleons in electric fields. By
properly handing these contributions, we can determine both magnetic moments
and electric polarizabilities. Lattice results from anisotropic clover lattices
are presented. Our method is not limited to the neutron; we show results for
the proton as well.
