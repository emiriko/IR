I discuss four key questions about Galactic Center dynamics, their
implications for understanding both the environment of the Galactic MBH and
galactic nuclei in general, and the progress made in addressing them. The
questions are (1) Is the stellar system around the MBH relaxed? (2) Is there a
"dark cusp" around the MBH? (3) What is the origin of the stellar disk(s)?, and
(4) What is the origin of the S-stars?
