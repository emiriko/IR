We present a specific algorithm that generally satisfies the balance
condition without imposing the detailed balance in the Markov chain Monte
Carlo. In our algorithm, the average rejection rate is minimized, and even
reduced to zero in many relevant cases. The absence of the detailed balance
also introduces a net stochastic flow in a configuration space, which further
boosts up the convergence. We demonstrate that the autocorrelation time of the
Potts model becomes more than 6 times shorter than that by the conventional
Metropolis algorithm. Based on the same concept, a bounce-free worm algorithm
for generic quantum spin models is formulated as well.
