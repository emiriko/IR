The Minimal Supersymmetric Extension of the Standard Model (MSSM) features a
light Higgs boson, the mass Mh of which is predicted by the theory. Given that
the LHC will be able to measure the mass of a light Higgs with great accuracy,
a precise theoretical calculation of Mh yields an important test of the MSSM.
  In order to deliver this precision, we present three-loop radiative
corrections of O(alpha_t*alpha_s^2) and provide a computer code that combines
our results with corrections to Mh at lower loop orders that are available in
the literature.
