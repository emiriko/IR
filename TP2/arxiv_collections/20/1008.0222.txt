We review the motivation for hidden Higgs scenarios and discuss the light CP
odd Higgs scenario in the NMSSM as an example. We summarize experimental
constraints including recent limits from BaBar and Aleph. The main part of the
talk is the discussion of dominant decay modes of the standard model like Higgs
boson, and related decay modes of the charged Higgs and heavy CP even Higgs
bosons, in these scenarios with the focus on signatures and prospects for the
LHC. Examples include the direct production of a light CP odd Higgs boson, and
a light charged Higgs boson in top quark decays.
