We calculate the AC linear response of a superconductor in a nonequilibrium
electronic state. The nonequilibrium state is produced by injecting
quasiparticles into the superconductor from normal leads through asymmetric
tunnel contacts. The dissipative part of the response is drastically increased
by the injected quasiparticles and is proportional to their total number
regardless of the imbalance between the numbers of electron-like and hole-like
excitations.
