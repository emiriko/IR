An analysis has been investigated for the effects of thermal radiation and
Hall current on magnetohydrodynamic free-convective flow and mass transfer over
a stretching sheet with variable viscosity in the presence of heat
generation/absorption. The fluid viscosity is assumed to vary as an inverse
linear function of temperature. The boundary-layer equations governing the flow
problem under consideration have been reduced to a system of non-linear
ordinary differential equations by employing a similarity transformation. Using
the finite difference scheme, numerical solutions to the transform ordinary
differential equations have been solved and the results that obtained are
presented graphically. With an aim to test the accuracy, the numerical results
have been compared with the existing scientific literature and found excellent
agreement.
