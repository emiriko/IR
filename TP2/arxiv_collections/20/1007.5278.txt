We show that scalar, 0-form, Galileon actions --models whose field equations
contain only second derivatives-- can be generalized to arbitrary even p-forms.
More generally, they need not even depend on a single form, but may involve
mixed p combinations, including equal p multiplets, where odd p-fields are also
permitted: We construct, for given dimension D, general actions depending on
scalars, vectors and higher p-form field strengths, whose field equations are
of exactly second derivative order. We also discuss and illustrate their
curved-space generalizations, especially the delicate non-minimal couplings
required to maintain this order. Concrete examples of pure and mixed actions,
field equations and their curved space extensions are presented.
