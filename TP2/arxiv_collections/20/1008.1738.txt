The electric form factor of the neutron was determined from studies of the
reaction He3(e,e'n)pp in quasi-elastic kinematics in Hall A at Jefferson Lab.
Longitudinally polarized electrons were scattered off a polarized target in
which the nuclear polarization was oriented perpendicular to the momentum
transfer. The scattered electrons were detected in a magnetic spectrometer in
coincidence with neutrons that were registered in a large-solid-angle detector.
More than doubling the Q2-range over which it is known, we find GEn = 0.0225
+/- 0.0017 (stat) +/- 0.0024 (syst), 0.0200 +/- 0.0023 +/- 0.0018, and 0.0142
+/- 0.0019 +/- 0.0013 for Q2 = 1.72, 2.48, and 3.41 GeV2, respectively.
