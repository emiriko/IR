Based on the recent developed real-space theory of superconductivity
(arXiv:0910.5511 and arXiv:1001.5067), we study the physical nature of the
Meissner effect and London penetration depth in conventional and
non-conventional superconductors. It is argued that they originate from an
exactly the same reason of the real-space quasi-one-dimensional periodic
dynamic charge stripes in the superconductors. The fundamental relationship
between the London penetration depth and the superconducting electron density
is qualitatively determined.
