An extension of the Standard Model by at least one extra U(1) gauge symmetry
has been investigated by many authors. In this paper we explore the possibility
that this extra U(1) is anomalous. One of the possible signatures of this model
could be given by the photons produced in the decays of the NLSP into the LSP.
