We will discuss how we can obtain new quantum superintegrable Hamiltonians
allowing the separation of variables in Cartesian coordinates with higher order
integrals of motion from ladder operators. We will discuss also how higher
order supersymmetric quantum mechanics can be used to obtain systems with
higher order ladder operators and their polynomial Heisenberg algebra. We will
present a new family of superintegrable systems involving the fifth Painleve
transcendent which possess fourth order ladder operators constructed from
second order supersymmetric quantum mechanics. We present the polynomial
algebra of this family of superintegrable systems.
