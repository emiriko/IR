We propose a model which includes a nearest-neighbor intrinsic spin-orbit
coupling and a dimer Hamiltonian in the Kagom\'{e} lattice and promises to host
the transition from the quantum spin Hall insulator to the normal insulator. In
addition, we design an experimental scheme to simulate and detect this
transition in the ultracold atom system. The lattice intrinsic spin-orbit
coupling is generated via the laser-induced-gauge-field method. Furthermore, we
establish the connection between the spin Chern number and the spin-atomic
density which enables us to detect the topological quantum spin Hall insulator
directly by the standard density-profile technique used in the atomic systems.
