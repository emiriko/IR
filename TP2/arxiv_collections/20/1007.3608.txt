A comprehensive comparison between the magnetic field- and
temperature-dependent low frequency spin dynamics in the antiferromagnetic
spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain (AFHC) system copper pyrazine dinitrate, probed via
the 13C-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxation rate 1/T1, and the field
theoretical approach in the Luttinger liquid (LL) regime has been performed. We
have found a very good agreement between the experiment and theory in the
investigated temperature and field range. Our results demonstrate how strongly
the quantum critical point affects the spin dynamics of Heisenberg spin chain
compounds.
