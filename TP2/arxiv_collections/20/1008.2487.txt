We propose a novel mechanism to generate a suitable baryon asymmetry from
dark (hidden) sector. This is a Baryogenesis through a reverse pathway of the
"asymmetric dark matter" scenario. In the mechanism, the asymmetry of dark
matter is generated at first, and it is partially transferred into a baryon
asymmetry in the standard model sector. This mechanism enables us not only to
realize the generation of the baryon asymmetry but also to account for the
correct amount of dark matter density in the present universe within a simple
framework.
