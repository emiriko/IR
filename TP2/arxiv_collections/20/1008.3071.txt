We show that the Kisin varieties associated to simple $\phi$-modules of rank
$2$ are connected in the case of an arbitrary cocharacter. This proves that the
connected components of the generic fiber of the flat deformation ring of an
irreducible $2$-dimensional Galois representation of a local field are
precisely the components where the multiplicities of the Hodge-Tate weights are
fixed.
