Solar-Limb Effect is an observational phenomena connected to the solar
gravitational red-shift. It shows a variation of the magnitude of the
gravitational red-shift from the center to the limb of the solar disc. In the
present work an attempt, for interpreting this phenomena using a general
relativistic red-shift formula, is given . This formula takes into account the
effect of the the Sun's gravitational field, the effect of the solar rotation,
the effect of inclination of the line of sight and the motion of the observer.
In this study the gravitational field of the Sun is assumed to be given by
Lense-Thirring field instead of the Schwarzschild one. The Earth is assumed to
move along an elliptic orbit. Comparison with a previous relativistic study and
with observation is given.
