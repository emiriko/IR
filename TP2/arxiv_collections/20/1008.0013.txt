We give an abstract characterization of the Satake compactification of a
general Drinfeld modular variety. We prove that it exists and is unique up to
unique isomorphism, though we do not give an explicit stratification by
Drinfeld modular varieties of smaller rank which is also expected. We construct
a natural ample invertible sheaf on it, such that the global sections of its
$k$-th power form the space of (algebraic) Drinfeld modular forms of weight
$k$. We show how the Satake compactification and modular forms behave under all
natural morphisms between Drinfeld modular varieties; in particular we define
Hecke operators. We give explicit results in some special cases.
