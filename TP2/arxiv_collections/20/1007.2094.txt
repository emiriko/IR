The kinetic energy operator with position-dependent-mass in cylindrical
coordinates is obtained. The separability of the corresponding Schr\"odinger
equation is discussed within radial cylindrical mass settings. Azimuthal
symmetry is assumed and spectral signatures of various z-dependent interaction
potentials (Hermitian and non-Hermitian PT-symmetric) are reported.
