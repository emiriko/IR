We study the influence of the surrounding gas in the dynamics of drop impact
on a smooth surface. We use an axisymmetric 3D model for which both the gas and
the liquid are incompressible; lubrication regime applies for the gas film
dynamics and the liquid viscosity is neglected. In the absence of surface
tension a finite time singularity whose properties are analysed is formed and
the liquid touches the solid on a circle. When surface tension is taken into
account, a thin jet emerges from the zone of impact, skating above a thin gas
layer. The thickness of the air film underneath this jet is always smaller than
the mean free path in the gas suggesting that the liquid film eventually wets
the surface. We finally suggest an aerodynamical instability mechanism for the
splash.
