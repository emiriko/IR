The temperature-dependent transverse mechanical properties of single-walled
nanotubes are studied using a molecular mechanics approach. The stretching and
bond angle force constants describing the mechanical behaviour of the sp^{2}
bonds are resolved in the temperature range between 0 K and 1600 K, allowing to
identify a temperature dependence of the nanotubes wall thickness. We observe a
decrease of the stiffness properties (axial and shear Young's modulus) with
increasing temperatures, and an augmentation of the transverse Poisson's ratio,
with magnitudes depending on the chirality of the nanotube. Our closed-form
predictions compare well with existing Molecular Dynamics simulations.
