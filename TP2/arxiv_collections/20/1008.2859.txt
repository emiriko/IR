Exchange of biochemical substances is essential way in establishing
communication between bacterial cells. It is noticeable that all phases of the
process are heavily influenced by perturbations of either internal or external
parameters. Therefore, instead to develop an accurate quantitative model of
substances exchange between bacterial cells, we are interested in formalization
of the basic shape of the process, and creating the appropriate strategy that
allows further investigation of synchronization. Using a form of coupled
difference logistic equations we investigated synchronization of substances
exchange between abstract cells and its sensitivity to fluctuations of
environmental parameters using methods of nonlinear dynamics.
