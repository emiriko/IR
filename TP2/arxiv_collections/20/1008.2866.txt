We intend to show that the vacuum manifold inherent in the Minkowskian
non-Abelian model involving Higgs and Yang-Mills BPS vacuum modes and herewith
quantized by Dirac can be described with the help of the superselection rules
if and only if the "discrete" geometry for this vacuum manifold is assumed (it
is just a necessary thing in order justify the Dirac fundamental quantization
scheme applied to the mentioned model) and only in the infinitely narrow
spatial region of the cylindrical shape where topologically nontrivial vortices
are located inside this discrete vacuum manifold.
