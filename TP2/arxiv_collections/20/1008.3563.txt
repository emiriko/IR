[NIRSS is one of three concepts that contributed to the Wide-Field Infrared
Survey Telescope (WFIRST) mission advocated by the Decadal Survey.] Operating
beyond the reaches of the Earth's atmosphere, free of its limiting absorption
and thermal background, the Near-Infrared Sky Surveyor (NIRSS) will deeply map
the entire sky at near-infrared wavelengths, thereby enabling new and
fundamental discoveries ranging from the identification of extrasolar planets
to probing the reionization epoch by identifying thousands of quasars at z>10.
NIRSS will directly address the NASA scientific objective of studying cosmic
origins by using a 1.5-meter telescope to reach full-sky 0.2 uJy (25.6 mag AB)
sensitivities in four passbands from 1 to 4 microns in a 4-yr mission. At the
three shorter passbands (1 - 2.5 microns), the proposed depth is comparable to
the deepest pencil-beam surveys done to date and is 3000 times more sensitive
than the only previous all-sky near-infrared survey, 2MASS. At the longest
passband (3.5 micron), which is not feasible from the ground, NIRSS will be 500
times more sensitive than WISE. NIRSS fills a pivotal gap in our knowledge of
the celestial sphere, is a natural complement to WISE, and is well matched to
the next generation of deep (0.1 uJy), wide-area (>2 pi ster), ground-based
optical surveys (LSST and Pan-Starrs). With the high thermal backgrounds of
ground-based infrared observations, a near-infrared full sky survey at sub-uJy
sensitivity is only feasible from space.
