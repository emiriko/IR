Recently, Baker and Norine {Advances in Mathematics, 215(2): 766-788, 2007}
found new analogies between graphs and Riemann surfaces by developing a
Riemann-Roch machinery on a finite graph $G$. In this paper, we develop a
general Riemann-Roch Theory for sub-lattices of the root lattice $A_n$ by
following the work of Baker and Norine, and establish connections between the
Riemann-Roch theory and the Voronoi diagrams of lattices under certain
simplicial distance functions. In this way, we rediscover the work of Baker and
Norine from a geometric point of view and generalise their results to other
sub-lattices of $A_n$. In particular, we provide a geometric approach for the
study of the Laplacian of graphs. We also discuss some problems on
classification of lattices with a Riemann-Roch formula as well as some related
algorithmic issues.
