Time-division SQUID multiplexers are used in many applications that require
exquisite control of systematic error. One potential source of systematic error
is the pickup of external magnetic fields in the multiplexer. We present
measurements of the field sensitivity figure of merit, effective area, for both
the first stage and second stage SQUID amplifiers in three NIST SQUID
multiplexer designs. These designs include a new variety with improved
gradiometry that significantly reduces the effective area of both the first and
second stage SQUID amplifiers.
