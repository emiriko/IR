Currently there is great interest in computational models consisting of
underlying regular computational environments, and built on them distributed
computational structures. Examples of such models are cellular automata,
spatial computation and space-time crystallography. For any computational model
it is natural to define a functional equivalence of different but related
computational structures. In the finite automata theory an example of such
equivalence is automata homomorphism and, in particular, automata isomorphism.
If we continue to stick to the finite automata theory, a fundamental question
arise, what a state of a distributed computational structure is. This work is
devoted to particular solution of the issue.
