Some systems of parabolic equations with nonlocal initial conditions are
studied. The systems arise when considering steady-state solutions to diffusive
age-structured cooperative or competing species. Local and global bifurcation
techniques are employed to derive a detailed description of the structure of
positive coexistence solutions.
