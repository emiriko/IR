We illustrate how to calculate the finite-temperature linear-response
conductance of quantum impurity models from the Matsubara Green function. A
continued fraction expansion of the Fermi distribution is employed which was
recently introduced by Ozaki [Phys. Rev. B 75, 035123 (2007)] and converges
much faster than the usual Matsubara representation. We give a simplified
derivation of Ozaki's idea using concepts from many-body condensed matter
theory and present results for the rate of convergence. In case that the Green
function of some model of interest is only known numerically, interpolating
between Matsubara frequencies is much more stable than carrying out an analytic
continuation to the real axis. We demonstrate this explicitly by considering an
infinite tight-binding chain with a single site impurity as an exactly-solvable
test system, showing that it is advantageous to calculate transport properties
directly on the imaginary axis. The formalism is applied to the single impurity
Anderson model, and the linear conductance at finite temperatures is calculated
reliably at small to intermediate Coulomb interactions by virtue of the
Matsubara functional renormalization group. Thus, this quantum many-body method
combined with the continued fraction expansion of the Fermi function
constitutes a promising tool to address more complex quantum dot geometries at
finite temperatures.
