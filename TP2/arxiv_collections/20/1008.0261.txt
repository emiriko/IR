We study the scaling properties in deep inelastic scattering using the most
recent combined structure function data $F_2$ from the H1 and ZEUS
collaborations. We also perform a direct fit to the $F_2$ data inspired by the
scaling properties. Our analysis favours the QCD saturation mechanism from the
Balitski Kovchegiv equation wuth running coupling.
