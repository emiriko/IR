We studied both components of a slightly overlooked visual binary HR 1847
spectroscopically to determine its basic physical and orbital parameters. Basic
stellar parameters were determined by comparing synthetic spectra to the
observed echelle spectra, which cover both the optical and near-IR regions. New
observations of this system used the Ond\v{r}ejov and Rozhen 2-m telescopes and
their coud\'e spectrographs. Radial velocities from individual spectra were
measured and then analysed with the code {\FOTEL} to determine orbital
parameters. The spectroscopic orbit of HR 1847A is presented for the first
time. It is a single-lined spectroscopic binary with a B-type primary, a period
of 719.79 days, and a highly eccentric orbit with e=0.7. We confirmed that HR
1847B is a Be star. Its H\alpha emission significantly decreased from 2003 to
2008. Both components have a spectral type B7-8 and luminosity class IV-V.
