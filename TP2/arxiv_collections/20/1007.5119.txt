A method for symbolically computing conservation laws of nonlinear partial
differential equations (PDEs) in multiple space dimensions is presented in the
language of variational calculus and linear algebra. The steps of the method
are illustrated using the Zakharov-Kuznetsov and Kadomtsev-Petviashvili
equations as examples. The method is algorithmic and has been implemented in
Mathematica. The software package, ConservationLawsMD.m, can be used to
symbolically compute and test conservation laws for polynomial PDEs that can be
written as nonlinear evolution equations. The code ConservationLawsMD.m has
been applied to (2+1)-dimensional versions of the Sawada-Kotera, Camassa-Holm,
and Gardner equations, and the multi-dimensional Khokhlov-Zabolotskaya
equation.
