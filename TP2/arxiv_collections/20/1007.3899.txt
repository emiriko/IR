We introduce a new variational method for the study of stability in the
isoperimetric inequality. The method is quite general as it relies on a
penalization technique combined with the regularity theory for quasiminimizers
of the perimeter. Two applications are presented. First we give a new proof of
the sharp quantitative isoperimetric inequality in $R^n$. Second we positively
answer to a conjecture by Hall concerning the best constant for the
quantitative isoperimetric inequality in $R^2$ in the small asymmetry regime.
