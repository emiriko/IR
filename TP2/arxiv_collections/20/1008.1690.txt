A deep similarity of photo-stimulated effects occurring in physical and
biological objects involving fullerene forces to raise the question: what is
meant under nanophotonics of fullerene and if should we not imply under this
conventional term, usually restricted to optical events, something more
general? Discussed in the paper, makes it possible to suggest that the
formation of positive-negative fullerene ion pair at each photon absorption act
is common for photo stimulated events in chemistry, medicine, and optics thus
providing their common origin.
