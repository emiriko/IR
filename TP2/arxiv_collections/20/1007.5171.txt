The automobile is always a point of interest where new technology has been
deployed. Because of this interest, human-vehicle interaction has been an
appealing area for much research in recent years. The current in-vehicle design
has been improved but still possesses some of the design from the traditional
interaction style. In this paper, we propose a new user-oriented model for
in-vehicle interaction model known as i-Interaction. The i-Interaction model
provides user with an intuitive approach to interact with the In-Vehicle
Information System (IVIS) by the keypad entry. It is the intent that the
proposed usability testing for this model will help improve the way research
and development is implemented from this topic. This model does not only
provide the user with a direct interaction in vehicles but also introduce a new
prospective that other research has not addressed.
