We perform numerical simulations of a simple model of one-patch colloidal
particles to investigate: (i) the behavior of the gas-liquid phase diagram on
moving from a spherical attractive potential to a Janus potential and (ii) the
collective structure of a system of Janus particles. We show that, for the case
where one of the two hemispheres is attractive and one is repulsive, the system
organizes into a dispersion of orientational ordered micelles and vesicles and,
at low $T$, the system can be approximated as a fluid of such clusters,
interacting essentially via excluded volume. The stability of this cluster
phase generates a very peculiar shape of the gas and liquid coexisting
densities, with a gas coexistence density which increases on cooling,
approaching the liquid coexistence density at very low $T$.
