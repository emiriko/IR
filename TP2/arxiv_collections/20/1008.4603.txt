We demonstrate that ultracold interacting bosonic atoms in an optical lattice
show sub-Poissonian on-site and inter-site atom number fluctuations. The
experimental observations agree with numerical predictions of the truncated
Wigner approximation. The correlations persist in the presence of multi-mode
atom dynamics and even over large spatially extended samples involving several
sites and large populations.
