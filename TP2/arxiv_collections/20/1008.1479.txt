This paper has been withdrawn by the author due to some experimental
mistakes. In this paper, we reported that C66, C44 and (C11-C12)/2 show
remarkable softening toward the structural transition temperature TS. The data
reported in this paper were acquired using the ultrasonic frequency lower than
25 MHz. Recently, we performed high-frequency measurements for the same system.
We found that the anomaly of C44 and (C11-C12)/2 tend to disappear rapidly with
increasing the frequency. On the other hand, C66 anomaly is still there at high
frequencies. Therefore, we concluded that the observed anomalies in C44 and
(C11-C12)/2 are not true. They would be ascribed to certain influence by the
large softening of C66. So, we have checked our data through careful
measurements by using ultrasonic frequency higher than 60 MHz, so far. Then, it
has been found that C66 shows still nice softening toward TS, but that its
temperature dependence is slightly different from the results of this paper. We
have accumulated reliable data now. They will be reported in near future.
