E.V. Kozik and B.V. Svistunov (KS) paper "Symmetries and Interaction
Coefficients of Kelvin waves", arXiv:1006.1789v1, [cond-mat.other] 9 Jun 2010,
contains a comment on paper "Symmetries and Interaction coefficients of Kelvin
waves", V. V. Lebedev and V. S. L'vov, arXiv:1005.4575, 25 May 2010. It relies
mainly on the KS text "Geometric Symmetries in Superfluid Vortex Dynamics}",
arXiv:1006.0506v1 [cond-mat.other] 2 Jun 2010. The main claim of KS is that a
symmetry argument prevents linear in wavenumber infrared asymptotics of the
interaction vertex and thereby implies locality of the Kelvin wave spectrum
previously obtained by these authors. In the present note we reply to their
arguments. We conclude that there is neither proof of locality nor any
refutation of the possibility of linear asymptotic behavior of interaction
vertices in the texts of KS.
