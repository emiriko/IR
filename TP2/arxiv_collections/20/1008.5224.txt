The negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy centre is a unique defect in diamond
that possesses properties highly suited to many applications, including quantum
information processing, quantum metrology, and biolabelling. Although the
unique properties of the centre have been extensively documented and utilised,
a detailed understanding of the physics of the centre has not yet been
achieved. Indeed there persists a number of points of contention regarding the
electronic structure of the centre, such as the ordering of the dark
intermediate singlet states. Without a sound model of the centre's electronic
structure, the understanding of the system's unique dynamical properties can
not effectively progress. In this work, the molecular model of the defect
centre is fully developed to provide a self consistent model of the complete
electronic structure of the centre. The application of the model to describe
the effects of electric, magnetic and strain interactions, as well as the
variation of the centre's fine structure with temperature, provides an
invaluable tool to those studying the centre and a means to design future
empirical and ab initio studies of this important defect.
