We study the profile of a thin disk configuration as described by an
axisymmetric ideal magnetohydrodynamics steady equilibrium. We consider the
disk like a differentially rotating system dominated by the Keplerian term, but
allowing for a non-zero radial and vertical matter flux. As a result, the
steady state allows for the existence of local peaks for the vertical velocity
of the plasma particles, though it prevents the radial matter accretion rate.
This ideal magnetohydrodynamics scheme is therefore unable to solve the angular
momentum-transport problem, but we suggest that it provides a mechanism for the
generation of matter-jet seeds.
