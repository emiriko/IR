We provide a rigorous mathematical analysis of two communication strategies:
soft decode-and-forward (soft-DF) for relay channels, and soft partial
interference-cancelation (soft-IC) for interference channels. Both strategies
involve soft estimation, which assists the decoding process. We consider LDPC
codes, not because of their practical benefits, but because of their analytic
tractability, which enables an asymptotic analysis similar to random coding
methods of information theory. Unlike some works on the closely-related
demodulate-and-forward, we assume non-memoryless, code-structure-aware
estimation. With soft-DF, we develop {\it simultaneous density evolution} to
bound the decoding error probability at the destination. This result applies to
erasure relay channels. In one variant of soft-DF, the relay applies Wyner-Ziv
coding to enhance its communication with the destination, borrowing from
compress-and-forward. To analyze soft-IC, we adapt existing techniques for
iterative multiuser detection, and focus on binary-input additive white
Gaussian noise (BIAWGN) interference channels. We prove that optimal
point-to-point codes are unsuitable for soft-IC, as well as for all strategies
that apply partial decoding to improve upon single-user detection (SUD) and
multiuser detection (MUD), including Han-Kobayashi (HK).
