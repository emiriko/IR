We have imaged the disk surrounding the nearby (D~73 pc), ~12 Myr, classical
T Tauri binary system V4046 Sgr with the Submillimeter Array (SMA) at an
angular resolution of ~2". We detect a rotating disk in 12CO(2-1) and 13CO(2-1)
emission, and resolve the continuum emission at 1.3 mm. We infer disk gas and
dust masses of ~110 and ~40 Earth masses, respectively. Fits to a power-law
disk model indicate that the molecular disk extends to ~370 AU and is viewed at
an inclination of between ~33 and ~39 degrees for dynamical stellar masses
ranging from 1.8 $M_\odot$ down to 1.5 $M_\odot$ (the range of total mass
previously determined for the central, 2.4 day spectroscopic binary). This
range of disk inclination is consistent with that assumed in deducing the
central binary mass (i.e., 35 degrees), suggesting that the V4046 Sgr binary
system and its circumbinary, molecular disk are coplanar. In light of the
system's age and binarity, the presence of an extensive molecular disk orbiting
V4046 Sgr provides constraints on the timescales of processes related to Jovian
planet formation, and demonstrates that circumbinary Jovian planets potentially
could form around close binary systems.
