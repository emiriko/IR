We present a model of chemical and spectrophotometric evolution of disk
galaxies based on a stochastic self-propagating star formation scenario. The
model incorporates galaxy formation through the process of accretion, chemical
and photometric evolution treatment, based on simple stellar populations (SSP),
and parameterized gas dynamics inside the model. The model reproduces
observational data of a late-type spiral galaxy M33 reasonably well. Promising
test results prove the applicability of the model and the adequate accuracy for
the interpretation of disk galaxy properties.
