This article is the second part of an essay dedicated to lattices freely
generated by posets within a variety. The first part dealt with four easy
varieties while this part is concerned with finitely generated varieties. Here
we present a method of constructing a subdirect product L of a finite family F
of finite lattices, exploiting a set of special elements of L deducted from F.
This method is applied to free lattices generated by posets within finitely
generated varieties, where in the case of the variety of modular lattices, we
elaborate an efficient algorithm to compute the modular lattice M freely
generated by a poset. For some posets of order six, the cardinality of M is
listed.
