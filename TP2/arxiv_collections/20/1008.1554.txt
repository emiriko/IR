The definitions and applications of Radial Distribution Function (RDF) and
Structure Factor (SF) to study properties of aggregate are found in many papers
and books. The approach adopted to calculate the RDF and the SF to determine
the interaction potential between particles of an aggregate is very different
from that adopted to obtain their fractal properties. The difference between
the two approaches will be shown in details here. This article was written to
graduate and postgraduate students of Physics
