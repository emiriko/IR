The dynamical equation of the magnetization has been reconsidered with
enlarging the phase space of the ferromagnetic degrees of freedom to the
angular momentum. The generalized Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation that
includes inertial terms, and the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation, are then
derived in the framework of mesoscopic non-equilibrium thermodynamics theory. A
typical relaxation time $\tau$ is introduced describing the relaxation of the
magnetization acceleration from the inertial regime towards the precession
regime defined by a constant Larmor frequency. For time scales larger than
$\tau$, the usual Gilbert equation is recovered. For time scales below $\tau$,
nutation and related inertial effects are predicted. The inertial regime offers
new opportunities for the implementation of ultrafast magnetization switching
in magnetic devices.
