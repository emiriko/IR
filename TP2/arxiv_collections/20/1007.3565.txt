In the past few years, overwhelming evidence has accrued that a high level of
expression of the protein neuroglobin protects neurons in vitro, in animal
models, and in humans, against cell death associated with hypoxic and amyloid
insult. However, until now, the exact mechanism of neuroglobin's protective
action has not been determined. Using cell biology and biochemical approaches
we demonstrate that neuroglobin inhibits the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis in
vitro and intervenes in activation of pro-caspase 9 by interaction with
cytochrome c. Using systems level information of the apoptotic signalling
reactions we have developed a quantitative model of neuroglobin inhibition of
apoptosis, which simulates neuroglobin blocking of apoptosome formation at a
single cell level. Furthermore, this model allows us to explore the effect of
neuroglobin in conditions not easily accessible to experimental study. We found
that the protection of neurons by neuroglobin is very concentration sensitive.
The impact of neuroglobin may arise from both its binding to cytochrome c and
its subsequent redox reaction, although the binding alone is sufficient to
block pro-caspase 9 activation. These data provides an explanation the action
of neuroglobin in the protection of nerve cells from unwanted apoptosis.
