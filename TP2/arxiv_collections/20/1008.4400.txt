A complete study of the propagation of waves (namely longitudinal density and
temperature waves, longitudinal and transversal velocity waves and heat waves)
in turbulent superfluid helium is made in three situations: a rotating frame, a
thermal counterflow, and the simultaneous combination of thermal counterflow
and rotation. Our analysis aims to obtain as much as possible information on
the tangle of quantized vortices from the wave speed and attenuation factor of
these different waves, depending on their relative direction of propagation
with respect to the rotation vector.
