This article exhibits a particular encoding of logic circuits into a sheaf
formalism. The central result of this article is that there exists strictly
more information available to a circuit designer in this setting than exists in
static truth tables, but less than exists in event-level simulation. This
information is related to the timing behavior of the logic circuits, and
thereby provides a ``bridge'' between static logic analysis and detailed
simulation.
