Approximation in this paper is of vectors on the unit $d$-cube by the
projection of integer lattice points onto the same cube. We define badly
approximable vectors on a rational quadratic variety and show that sets of
these vectors, which are (naturally) indexed by $m \in \QQ$, are winning and
strong winning in the sense of Schmidt games. From the winning property, it
follows that these sets have full Hausdorff dimension and, moreover, so does
their intersection. In most cases, these sets are known to be null sets.
