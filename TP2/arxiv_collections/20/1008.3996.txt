Azimuthal asymmetries in exclusive electroproduction of a real photon from a
longitudinally polarized deuterium target are measured with respect to target
polarization alone and with respect to target polarization combined with beam
helicity and/or beam charge. The asymmetries appear in the distribution of the
real photons in the azimuthal angle $\phi$ around the virtual photon direction,
relative to the lepton scattering plane. The asymmetries arise from the deeply
virtual Compton scattering process and its interference with the Bethe-Heitler
process. The results for the beam-charge and beam-helicity asymmetries from a
tensor polarized deuterium target with vanishing vector polarization are shown
to be compatible with those from an unpolarized deuterium target, which is
expected for incoherent scattering dominant at larger momentum transfer.
Furthermore, the results for the single target-spin asymmetry and for the
double-spin asymmetry are found to be compatible with the corresponding
asymmetries previously measured on a hydrogen target. For coherent scattering
on the deuteron at small momentum transfer to the target, these findings imply
that the tensor contribution to the cross section is small. Furthermore, the
tensor asymmetry is found to be compatible with zero.
