We summarize the results of our comprehensive analytical and numerical
studies of the effects of polarization on the Anderson localization of
classical waves in one-dimensional random stacks. We consider homogeneous
stacks composed entirely of normal materials or metamaterials, and also mixed
stacks composed of alternating layers of a normal material and metamaterial. We
extend the theoretical study developed earlier for the case of normal incidence
[A. A. Asatryan et al, Phys. Rev. B 81, 075124 (2010)] to the case of off-axis
incidence. For the general case where both the refractive indices and layer
thicknesses are random, we obtain the long-wave and short-wave asymptotics of
the localization length over a wide range of incidence angles (including the
Brewster ``anomaly'' angle). At the Brewster angle, we show that the long-wave
localization length is proportional to the square of the wavelength, as for the
case of normal incidence, but with a proportionality coefficient substantially
larger than that for normal incidence. In mixed stacks with only
refractive-index disorder, we demonstrate that p-polarized waves are strongly
localized, while for s-polarization the localization is substantially
suppressed, as in the case of normal incidence. In the case of only thickness
disorder, we study also the transition from localization to delocalization at
the Brewster angle.
