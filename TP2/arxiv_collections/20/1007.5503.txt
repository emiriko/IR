We parametrize quartic commutative algebras over any base ring or scheme
(equivalently finite, flat degree four $S$-schemes), with their cubic
resolvents, by pairs of ternary quadratic forms over the base. This generalizes
Bhargava's parametrization of quartic rings with their cubic resolvent rings
over $\mathbb{Z}$ by pairs of integral ternary quadratic forms, as well as
Casnati and Ekedahl's construction of Gorenstein quartic covers by certain rank
2 families of ternary quadratic forms. We give a geometric construction of a
quartic algebra from any pair of ternary quadratic forms, and prove this
construction commutes with base change and also agrees with Bhargava's explicit
construction over $\mathbb{Z}$.
