In this note I revisit the calculation of partition function of simple one
dimensional systems solvable by Bethe Ansatz. Particularly I show that by the
precise definition and treatment of the partition function the nontrivial
normalization factor proposed in a recent work to give the correct O(1)
corrections to the free energy can be derived in a straightforward manner.
