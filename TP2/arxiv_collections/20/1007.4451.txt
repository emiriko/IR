The dynamical stability of a Julia-Zee solution in the AdS background in a
four dimensional Einstein-Yang-Mills-Higgs theory is studied. We find that the
model with a vanishing scalar field develops a non-zero value for the field at
a certain critical temperature which corresponds to a topological dyon in the
bulk and a topological phase transition at the boundary.
