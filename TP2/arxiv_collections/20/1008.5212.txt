When anisotropy is involved, the wave equation becomes simultaneous partial
differential equations that are not easily solved. Moreover, when the
anisotropy occurs due to both permittivity and permeability, these equations
are insolvable without a numerical or an approximate method. The problem is
essentially due to the fact neither $\e$ nor $\m$ can be extracted from the
curl term, when they are in it. The terms $\na\times {\bf E}$ (or ${\bf H})$
and $\na\times \e{\bf E}$ (or $\;\m{\bf H})$ are practically independent
variables, and $\bf E$ and $\bf H$ are coupled to each other. However, if
Maxwell's equations are manipulated in a different way, new wave equations are
obtained. The obtained equations can be applied in anisotropic, as well as
isotropic, cases. In addition, $\bf E$ and $\bf H$ are decoupled in the new
equations, so the equations can be solved analytically by using tensor Green's
functions.
