Boutloukos et al. (2006) discovered twin-peak quasi-periodic oscillations
(QPOs) in 11 observations of the peculiar Z-source Circinus X-1. Among several
other conjunctions the authors briefly discussed the related estimate of the
compact object mass following from the geodesic relativistic precession model
for kHz QPOs. Neglecting the neutron star rotation they reported the inferred
mass M_0 = 2.2 +/- 0.3 M_\sun. We present a more detailed analysis of the
estimate which involves the frame-dragging effects associated with rotating
spacetimes. For a free mass we find acceptable fits of the model to data for
(any) small dimensionless compact object angular momentum j=cJ/GM^2. Moreover,
quality of the fit tends to increase very gently with rising j. Good fits are
reached when M ~ M_0[1+0.55(j+j^2)]. It is therefore impossible to estimate the
mass without the independent knowledge of the angular momentum and vice versa.
Considering j up to 0.3 the range of the feasible values of mass extends up to
3M_\sun. We suggest that similar increase of estimated mass due to rotational
effects can be relevant for several other sources.
