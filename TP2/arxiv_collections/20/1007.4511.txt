Entanglement in the spatial degrees of freedom of photons is an interesting
resource for quantum information. For practical distribution of such entangled
photons it is desireable to use an optical fiber, which in this case has to
support multiple transverse modes. Here we report the use of a hollow-core
photonic crystal fiber to transport spatially entangled qubits.
