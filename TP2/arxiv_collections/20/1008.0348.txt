Dark Stars (DS) may constitute the first phase of stellar evolution, powered
by dark matter (DM) annihilation. We will investigate here the properties of DS
assuming the DM particle has the required properties to explain the excess
positron and elec- tron signals in the cosmic rays detected by the PAMELA and
FERMI satellites. Any possible DM interpretation of these signals requires
exotic DM candidates, with an- nihilation cross sections a few orders of
magnitude higher than the canonical value required for correct thermal relic
abundance for Weakly Interacting Dark Matter can- didates; additionally in most
models the annihilation must be preferentially to lep- tons. Secondly, we study
the dependence of DS properties on the concentration pa- rameter of the initial
DM density profile of the halos where the first stars are formed. We restrict
our study to the DM in the star due to simple (vs. extended) adiabatic
contraction and minimal (vs. extended) capture; this simple study is sufficient
to illustrate dependence on the cross section and concentration parameter. Our
basic results are that the final stellar properties, once the star enters the
main sequence, are always roughly the same, regardless of the value of boosted
annihilation or concentration parameter in the range between c=2 and c=5:
stellar mass ~ 1000M\odot, luminosity ~ 10^7 L\odot, lifetime ~ 10^6 yrs (for
the minimal DM models considered here; additional DM would lead to more massive
dark stars). However, the lifetime, final mass, and final luminosity of the DS
show some dependence on boost factor and concentration parameter as discussed
in the paper.
