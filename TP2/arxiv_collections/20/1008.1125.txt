In structural mechanics, Nadai's sand hill analogy is the interpretation of
an ultimate torque applied to a given structural member with a magnitude that
is analogously twice the volume of stable sand heap which can be accommodated
on a transverse cross-section basis. Nadai's analogy is accompanied by his
observation of a loose triangular embankment, based on the fact that
gravitating loose earth is stable if inclined just under the angle of repose.
However, Nadai's analysis of stress distribution in a planar sand heap was
found to be inaccurate because the total pressure obtained from Nadai's
solution is greater than the self-weight calculated from the heap geometry.
This raises a question about the validity of his observation in relation to the
analogy. To confirm his criterion, this article presents and corrects the error
found in Nadai's solution by analyzing a radially symmetric stress field for a
wedge-shaped sand heap with the purpose of satisfying both force balance and
Nadai's closure. The fundamental equation was obtained by letting the friction
state vary as a function of angular position and deduce it under the constraint
that the principal stress orientation obeys Nadai's closure. The theoretical
solution sufficiently agreed with the past experimental measurements.
