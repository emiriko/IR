We present an overview of the design of IRIS, an infrared (0.85 - 2.5 micron)
integral field spectrograph and imaging camera for the Thirty Meter Telescope
(TMT). With extremely low wavefront error (<30 nm) and on-board wavefront
sensors, IRIS will take advantage of the high angular resolution of the narrow
field infrared adaptive optics system (NFIRAOS) to dissect the sky at the
diffraction limit of the 30-meter aperture. With a primary spectral resolution
of 4000 and spatial sampling starting at 4 milliarcseconds, the instrument will
create an unparalleled ability to explore high redshift galaxies, the Galactic
center, star forming regions and virtually any astrophysical object. This paper
summarizes the entire design and basic capabilities. Among the design
innovations is the combination of lenslet and slicer integral field units, new
4Kx4k detectors, extremely precise atmospheric dispersion correction, infrared
wavefront sensors, and a very large vacuum cryogenic system.
