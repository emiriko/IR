The mass density of dust particles that form from asteroids and comets in the
interplanetary medium of the solar system is, near 1 AU, comparable to the mass
density of the solar wind. It is mainly contained in particles of micrometer
size and larger. Dust and larger objects are destroyed by collisions and
sublimation and hence feed heavy ions into the solar wind and the solar corona.
Small dust particles are present in large number and as a result of their large
charge to mass ratio deflected by electromagnetic forces in the solar wind. For
nano dust particles of sizes 1 - 10 nm, recent calculations show trapping near
the Sun and outside from about 0.15 AU ejection with velocities close to solar
wind velocity. The fluxes of ejected nano dust are detected near 1AU with the
plasma wave instrument onboard the STEREO spacecraft. Though such electric
signals have been observed during dust impacts before, the interpretation
depends on several different parameters and data analysis is still in progress.
