We present a microscopic discussion of a nano-sized structure which uses the
quantization of energy levels and the physics of single charge Coulomb
interaction to achieve an optimal conversion of heat flow to directed current.
In our structure the quantization of energy levels and the Coulomb blockade
lead to the transfer of quantized packets of energy from a hot source into an
electric conductor to which it is capacitively coupled. The fluctuation
generated transfer of a single energy quantum translates into the directed
motion of a single electron. Thus in our structure the ratio of the charge
current to the heat current is determined by the ratio of the charge quantum to
the energy quantum. An important novel aspect of our approach is that the
direction of energy flow and the direction of electron motion are decoupled.
