The interpretation of the X-ray spectra of X-ray binaries during their hard
states requires a hot, optically thin medium. There are several accretion disc
models in the literature that account for this aspect. However, none is
designed to simultaneously explain the presence of powerful jets detected
during these states. A new quasi-keplerian hot accretion disc solution, a Jet
Emitting disc (JED hereafter), which is part of a global disc-jet MHD structure
producing stationary super-alfv\'enic ejection, is investigated here. Its
radiative and energetic properties are then compared to the observational
constraints found in Cygnus X-1. We solve the disc energy equation by balancing
the local heating term with advection and cooling by synchrotron,
bremsstrahlung and Comptonization processes. The heating term, disc density,
accretion velocity and magnetic field amplitude were taken from published
self-similar models of accretion-ejection structures. Both optically thin and
thick regimes are considered in a one temperature gas supported disc. Three
branches of solutions are found possible at a given radius but we investigate
only the hot, optically thin and geometrically slim solutions. These solutions
give simultaneously, and in a consistent way, the radiative and energetics
properties of the disc-jet system. They are able to very well reproduce the
accretion-ejection properties of Cygnus X-1, namely its X-ray spectral
emission, jet power and jet velocity. About half of the released accretion
power is used to produce two mildly relativistic (v/c~0.5) jets and for a
luminosity of the order of 1\% of the Eddington luminosity, the JED temperature
and optical depth are close to that observed in the hard state Cygnus X-1. The
JEDs properties are in agreement with the observations of the prototypical
black hole binary Cygnus X-1. and are likely to be relevant to the whole class
of microquasars.
