We applied the Floquet scattering-matrix formalism to studying the electronic
transport properties in a mesoscopic Dirac system. Using the method, we
investigate theoretically quantum pumping driven by a series of time-periodic
potentials in graphene monolayer both in the adiabatic and non-adiabatic
regimes. Our numerical results demonstrate that adding harmonic modulated
potentials can break the time reversal symmetry when no voltage bias is applied
to the graphene monolayer. Thus, when the system is pumped with proper dynamic
parameters, these scatterers can produce a nonzero dc pumped current. We also
find that the transmission is anisotropic as the incident angle is changed.
