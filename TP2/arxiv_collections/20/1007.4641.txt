In this paper, we investigate the space of certain weak stability conditions
on the triangulated category of D0-D2-D6 bound states on a smooth projective
Calabi-Yau 3-fold. In the case of a quintic 3-fold, the resulting space is
interpreted as a universal covering space of an infinitesimal neighborhood of
the conifold point in the stringy Kahler moduli space. We then construct the DT
type invariants counting semistable objects in our triangulated category, which
are new curve counting invariants on a Calabi-Yau 3-fold. We also investigate
the wall-crossing formula of our invariants and their interplay with the
Seidel-Thomas twist.
