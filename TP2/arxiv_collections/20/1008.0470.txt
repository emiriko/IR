We construct an exact solution for the spherical gravitational collapse in a
single coordinate patch. To describe the dynamics of collapse, we use a
generalized form of the Painlev\'e-Gullstrand coordinates in the Schwarzschild
spacetime. The time coordinate of the form is the proper time of a free-falling
observer so that we can describe the collapsing star not only outside but also
inside the event horizon in a single coordinate patch. We show the both
solutions corresponding to the gravitational collapse from infinity and from a
finite radius.
