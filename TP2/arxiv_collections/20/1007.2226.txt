Given $p \in (1, 2)$, we study $L^p$-solutions of a multi-dimensional
backward stochastic differential equation with jumps (BSDEJ) whose generator
may not be Lipschitz continuous in $(y,z)-$variables. We show that such a BSDEJ
with a p-integrable terminal data admits a unique $L^p$ solution by
approximating the monotonic generator by a sequence of Lipschitz generators via
convolution with mollifiers and using a stability result.
