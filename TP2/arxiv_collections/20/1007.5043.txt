Direct numerical simulation is used to investigate the decay exponent of
isotropic homogeneous turbulence over a range of Reynolds numbers sufficient to
display both high and low Re number decay behavior. The initial turbulence is
generated by the stirring action of the flow past many small randomly placed
cubes. Stirring occurs at 1/30th of the simulation domain size so that the
low-wavenumber and large scale behavior of the turbulent spectrum is generated
by the fluid and is not imposed. It is shown that the decay exponent in the
resulting turbulence closely matches the theoretical predictions of Saffman
(1967) at both high and low Reynolds numbers. The transition from high Reynolds
number behavior to low Reynolds number behavior occurs relatively abruptly at a
turbulent Reynolds number of around 250.
