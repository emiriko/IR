Translation domains differing in the phase but not in the orientation of the
corresponding order parameter are resolved in two types of multiferroics.
Hexagonal (h-) YMnO$_3$ is a split-order-parameter multiferroic in which
commensurate ferroelectric translation domains are resolved by piezoresponse
force microscopy whereas MnWO$_4$ is a joint-order-parameter multiferroic in
which incommensurate magnetic translation domains are observed by optical
second harmonic generation. The pronounced manifestation of the generally
rather "hidden" translation domains in these multiferroics and the associated
drastic reduction of symmetry emphasize that the presence of translation
domains must not be neglected when discussing the physical properties and
functionalities of multiferroics.
