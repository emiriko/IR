For a Markov chain both the detailed balance condition and the cycle
Kolmogorov condition are algebraic binomials. This remark suggests to study
reversible Markov chains with the tool of Algebraic Statistics, such as toric
statistical models. One of the results of this study in an algebraic
parameterization of reversible Markov transitions and their invariant
probability.
