When it is based on Kac-Peterson form of Affine Weyl Groups, Weyl-Kac
character formula could be formulated in terms of Theta functions and a sum
over finite Weyl groups. We, instead, give a reformulation in terms of Schur
functions which are determined by the so-called Permutation Weights and there
are only a finite number of permutation weights at each and every order of
weight depths . Affine signatures are expressed in terms of an index which by
definition is based on a decomposition of horizontal weights in terms of some
Fundamental Weights.
