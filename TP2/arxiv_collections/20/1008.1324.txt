In this article we briefly present our contributions toward Trading Agent
Competition (TAC); an international forum for promotion of research into the
trading agent problems. Moreover, we present some strategies proposed and used
in the development of our TAC Agent and resultant brief information after its
participation in a real time trading environment. In the end we conclude with
needed improvements and future recommendations.
