We theoretically investigate the scattering of an attosecond electron wave
packet launched by an attosecond pulse under the influence of an infrared laser
field. As the electron scatters inside a spatially extended system, the
dressing laser field controls its motion. We show that this interaction, which
lasts just a few hundreds of attoseconds, clearly manifests itself in the
spectral interference pattern between different quantum pathways taken by the
outgoing electron. We find that the Coulomb-Volkov approximation, a standard
expression used to describe laser-dressed photoionization, cannot properly
describe this interference pattern. We introduce a quasi-classical model, based
on electron trajectories, which quantitatively explains the laser-dressed
photoelectron spectra, notably the laser-induced changes in the spectral
interference pattern.
