Nonaxisymmetric, meridional circulation inside a neutron star, excited by a
glitch and persisting throughout the post-glitch relaxation phase, emits
gravitational radiation. Here, it is shown that the current quadrupole
contributes more strongly to the gravitational wave signal than the mass
quadrupole evaluated in previous work. We calculate the signal-to-noise ratio
for a coherent search and conclude that a large glitch may be detectable by
second-generation interferometers like the Laser Interferometer
Gravitational-Wave Observatory. It is shown that the viscosity and
compressibility of bulk nuclear matter, as well as the stratification
length-scale and inclination angle of the star, can be inferred from a
gravitational wave detection in principle.
