We study theoretically the shift of the superconducting transition
temperature (Tc) under uniaxial compression in beta-type organic
superconductors, beta-(BEDT-TTF)2I3 and beta-(BDA-TTP)2X[X=SbF6,AsF6], in order
to clarify the electron correlation, the spin frustration and the effect of
dimerization. The transfer integrals are calculated by the extended Huckel
method assuming the uniaxial strain and the superconducting state mediated by
the spin fluctuation is solved using Eliashberg's equation with the
fluctuation-exchange approximation. The calculation is carried out on both the
dimerized (one-band) and nondimerized (two-band) Hubbard models. We have found
that (i) the behavior of Tc in beta-(BEDT-TTF)2I3 with a stronger dimerization
is well reproduced by the dimer model, while that in weakly dimerized
beta-BDA-TTP salts is rather well reproduced by the two-band model, and (ii)
the competition between the spin frustration and the effect induced by the
fluctuation is important in these materials, which causes nonmonotonic shift of
Tc against uniaxial compression.
