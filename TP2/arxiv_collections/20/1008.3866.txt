We show that for two initially excited qubits, interacting via dipole forces
and with a common reservoir, entanglement is preceded by the emergence of
quantum and classical correlations. After a time lag, entanglement finally
starts building up, giving rise to a peculiar entangled state, with very small
classical correlations. Different measures of quantum correlations are
discussed, and their dynamics are compared and shown to lead to coincident
values of these quantifiers for several ranges of time.
