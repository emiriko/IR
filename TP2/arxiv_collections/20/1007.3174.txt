On the basis of a nonperturbative scalar model of gluon condensate the model
of glueball is considered. Two scalar fields describe quantum fluctuations of
gauge potential components belonging to a small subgroup $SU(2) \subset SU(3)$
and a coset $SU(3) / SU(2)$ correspondingly. In this consideration
nonperturbative quantum corrections appear. The corrections are connected with
a hidden structure of operators of strongly interacting gauge field. A regular
solution for two scalar fields is obtained. The solution is a ball filled with
quantum fluctuations of SU(3) gauge field. The space distribution of the
dispersion of quantum fluctuations of gauge potential is presented.
