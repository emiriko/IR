We present the evolution of the radio emission from the 2.8-s pulsar of the
double pulsar system PSR J0737-3039A/B. We provide an update on the Burgay et
al. (2005) analysis by describing the changes in the pulse profile and flux
density over five years of observations, culminating in the B pulsar's radio
disappearance in 2008 March. Over this time, the flux density decreases by
0.177 mJy/yr at the brightest orbital phases and the pulse profile evolves from
a single to a double peak, with a separation rate of 2.6 deg/yr. The pulse
profile changes are most likely caused by relativistic spin precession, but can
not be easily explained with a circular hollow-cone beam as in the model of
Clifton & Weisberg (2008). Relativistic spin precession, coupled with an
elliptical beam, can model the pulse profile evolution well. This particular
beam shape predicts geometrical parameters for the two bright orbital phases
which are consistent and similar to those derived by Breton et al. (2008).
However, the observed decrease in flux over time and B's eventual disappearance
cannot be easily explained by the model and may be due to the changing
influence of A on B.
