The origins of the proton spin remain an area of active investigation. The
Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Lab uniquely
provides polarized proton data at high center of mass energies. STAR has
previously reported large transverse single spin asymmetries for inclusive
neutral pion production in the forward direction at square root of s of 200
GeV, measured with a modular Pb-glass calorimeter called the "Forward Pion
Detector" (FPD). Beginning in 2008 (Run 8), STAR's forward calorimetry was
significantly enhanced with the commissioning of the "Forward Meson
Spectrometer" (FMS), which has full azimuthal coverage in the pseudo-rapidity
range 2.5 to 4.2. This detector has extended asymmetry measurements to higher
transverse momentum, and its large areal coverage enables measurements of
higher mass resonances and "jet-like" correlations. STAR also provides
excellent tracking and full azimuthal electromagnetic calorimeter coverage at
mid-rapidity, which facilitates analyses of spin-dependent jet structure. Here
we review recent transverse spin measurements with the STAR detector and also
present an update on some existing analyses.
