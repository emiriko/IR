We investigate the contribution of medium-modified jets and initial state
fluctuations to the asymmetry in charged particle production with respect to
the reaction plane. This asymmetry has been suggested as a compelling signature
of the Chiral Magnetic Effect in QCD and make a study of "conventional"
scenarios for the creation of such charged particle multiplicity fluctuations a
timely endeavor. The different pathlength combinations of jets through the
medium in non-central heavy ion collisions result in finite correlations of
like and different charged particles emitted in the different hemispheres. Our
calculation is based on combining jet events from YaJEM (Yet another Jet Energy
Loss Model) and a bulk medium evolution. It is found that the jet production
probabilities are too small to observe this effect. The influence of initial
state fluctuations on this observable is explored using an event-by-event
(3+1)d hybrid approach that is based on UrQMD (Ultra-relativistic Quantum
Molecular Dynamics) with an ideal hydrodynamic evolution. In this calculation
momentum conservation and elliptic flow are explicitly taken into account. The
asymmetries in the initial state are translated to a final state momentum
asymmetry by the hydrodynamic flow profile. Dependent on the size of the
initial state fluctuations the resulting charged particle asymmetries are in
qualitative agreement with the preliminary STAR results. The multi-particle
correlation as proposed by the PHENIX collaboration can in principle be used to
disentangle the different contributions, however is in practice substantially
affected by the procedure to subtract trivial resonance decay contributions.
