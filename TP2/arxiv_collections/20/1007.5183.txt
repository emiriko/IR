We utilize top polarization in the process e+ e-\rightarrow t\bar{t} at the
ILC with transverse beam polarization to probe interactions of the scalar and
tensor type beyond the standard model and to disentangle their individual
contributions. 90% confidence level limits on the interactions with realistic
integrated luminosity are presented and are found to improve by an order of
magnitude compared to the case when the spin of the top quark is not measured.
Sensitivities of the order of a few times 10^{-3} TeV^{-2} for real and
imaginary parts of both scalar and tensor couplings at \sqrt{s}=500 and 800 GeV
with an integrated luminosity of 500 fb^{-1} and completely polarized beams is
shown to be possible. A powerful model-independent framework for inclusive
measurements is employed to describe the spin-momentum correlations and their
C, P and T properties is presented in a technical appendix.
