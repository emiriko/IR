We demonstrate numerically and experimentally a conjugated gammadion chiral
metamaterial that uniaxially exhibits huge optical activity and circular
dichroism, and gives a negative refractive index. This chiral design provides
smaller unit cell size and larger chirality compared with other published
planar designs. Experiments are performed at GHz frequencies (around 6GHz) and
in good agreement with the numerical simulations.
