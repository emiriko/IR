If the cost function is not too far from the Euclidean cost, then the optimal
map transporting Gaussians restricted to a ball will be regular. \ Similarly,
given any cost function which is smooth in a neighborhood of two points on a
manifold, there are small neighborhoods near each such that a Gaussian
restricted to one is transported smoothly to a Gaussian on the other
