We report on the observation of the region around supernova remnant G65.1+0.6
with the stand-alone MAGIC-I telescope. This region hosts the two bright GeV
gamma-ray sources 1FGL J1954.3+2836 and 1FGL J1958.6+2845. They are identified
as GeV pulsars and both have a possible counterpart detected at about 35 TeV by
the Milagro observatory. MAGIC collected 25.5 hours of good quality data, and
found no significant emission in the range around 1 TeV. We therefore report
differential flux upper limits, assuming the emission to be point-like (<0.1
deg) or within a radius of 0.3 deg. In the point-like scenario, the flux limits
around 1 TeV are at the level of 3 % and 2 % of the Crab Nebula flux, for the
two sources respectively. This implies that the Milagro emission is either
extended over a much larger area than our point spread function, or it must be
peaked at energies beyond 1 TeV, resulting in a photon index harder than 2.2 in
the TeV band.
