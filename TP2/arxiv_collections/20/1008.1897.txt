We have performed microscopic calculations of the Rayleigh scattering cross
section for arbitrary metallic single-walled carbon nanotubes. The focus of our
investigations lies on excitonic effects and their influence on the
characteristic features in a Rayleigh scattering spectrum. Our approach is
based on density matrix theory including tight-binding energies, the
carrier-light coupling as well as the carrier-carrier interaction. Due to the
refractive index contribution to the scattering cross section, we observe
characteristic features in Rayleigh spectra, such as a strong deviation from
the Lorentz peak shape and the larger oscillator strength of the lower-lying
transition $M_{ii}^-$ in the double-peaked structure, independently of the
chiral angle and the diameter of the investigated nanotubes. We observe
excitonic binding energies in the range of $\unit[60-80]{meV}$ for metallic
nanotubes with diameters of $\unit[1.5-2.5]{nm}$. The overlap of the excitonic
transition with the close-by continuum has a significant influence on the peak
shape and a minor influence on the peak intensity ratios. The presented results
are in good agreement with recent experimental data.
