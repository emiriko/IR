There is no universally acknowledged criterion to distinguish brown dwarfs
from planets. Numerous studies have used or suggested a definition based on an
object's mass, taking the ~13-Jupiter mass (M_J) limit for the ignition of
deuterium. Here, we investigate various deuterium-burning masses for a range of
models. We find that, while 13 M_J is generally a reasonable rule of thumb, the
deuterium fusion mass depends on the helium abundance, the initial deuterium
abundance, the metallicity of the model, and on what fraction of an object's
initial deuterium abundance must combust in order for the object to qualify as
having burned deuterium. Even though, for most proto-brown dwarf conditions,
50% of the initial deuterium will burn if the object's mass is ~(13.0 +/-
0.8)M_J, the full range of possibilities is significantly broader. For models
ranging from zero-metallicity to more than three times solar metallicity, the
deuterium burning mass ranges from ~11.0 M_J (for 3-times solar metallicity,
10% of initial deuterium burned) to ~16.3 M_J (for zero metallicity, 90% of
initial deuterium burned).
