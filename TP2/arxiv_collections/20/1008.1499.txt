An application of the tight binding approximation is presented for the
description of electronic structure and interatomic force in magnetic iron,
both pure and containing hydrogen impurities. We assess the simple canonical
d-band description in comparison to a non orthogonal model including s and d
bands. The transferability of our models is tested against known properties
including the segregation energies of hydrogen to vacancies and to surfaces of
iron. In many cases agreement is remarkably good, opening up the way to quantum
mechanical atomistic simulation of the effects of hydrogen on mechanical
properties.
