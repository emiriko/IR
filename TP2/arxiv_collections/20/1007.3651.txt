In this work we investigate the X-ray edge singularity problem realized in
noninteracting quantum dots. We analytically calculate the exponent of the
singularity in the absorption spectrum near the threshold and extend known
analytical results to the whole parameter regime of local level detunings.
Additionally, we highlight the connections to work distributions and to the
Loschmidt echo.
