In this paper, we address the problem of luminescence polarization in the
case of nanostructures characterized by an in-plane shape asymmetry. We develop
a simple semi-qualitative model revealing the mechanism that accounts for the
selective polarization properties of such structures. It shows that they are
not a straightforward consequence of the geometry but are related to it via
valence subband mixing. Our model allows us to predict the degree of
polarization (DOP) dependence on the in-plane dimensions of investigated
structures assuming a predominantly heavy hole character of the valence band
states, simplifying the shape of confining potential and neglecting the
influence of the out-of plane dimension. The energy dependence modeling reveals
the importance of different excited states in subsequent spectral ranges
leading to non-monotonic character of the DOP. The modeling results show good
agreement with the experimental data for an ensemble of InAs/InP quantum dashes
for a set of realistc parameters with the heavy-light hole states separation
being the only adjustable one. All characteristic features are reproduced in
the framework of the proposed model and their origin can be well explained and
understood. We also make some further predictions about the influence of both
the internal characteristics of the nanostructures (e.g. height) and the
external conditions (excitation power, temperature) on the overall DOP.
