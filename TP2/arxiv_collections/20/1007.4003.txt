I discuss black hole evaporation in two different coordinate systems and
argue that the results of the two are compatible once one takes the holographic
principle into account. de Sitter space is then discussed along similar lines.
Finally I make some remarks about smooth initial conditions in GR, which evolve
to space-times with bifurcate horizons, and emphasize the care one must take in
identifying spaces of solutions of General Relativity which belong to the same
quantum theory of gravity. No really new material is presented, but the point
of view I take on all 3 subjects is not widely appreciated.
