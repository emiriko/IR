The purpose of this work is to show that the gravitational interaction is
able to generate mass for all bodies. The condition for this is the existence
of an energy distribution represented by the vacuum or the cosmological
constant term $ \Lambda \, g_{\mu\nu}.$ We review briefly the alternative Higgs
mechanism in order to compare both processes.
