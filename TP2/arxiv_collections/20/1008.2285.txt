We introduce a new parametrization for the two-parameter species sampling
model with {\it finite} but {\it random} number of different species recently
introduced in Gnedin (2010a). We show the reparametrization yields a
representation in terms of generalized Waring mixture of Fisher species
sampling models and derive the structural distribution of the model.
