In [22], it was proved that as long as the integrand has certain properties,
the corresponding It\^o integral can be written as a (parameterized) Lebesgue
integral (or a Bochner integral). In this paper, we show that such a question
can be answered in a more positive and refined way. To do this, we need to
characterize the dual of the Banach space of some vector-valued stochastic
processes having different integrability with respect to the time variable and
the probability measure. The later can be regarded as a variant of the
classical Riesz Representation Theorem, and therefore it will be useful in
studying other problems. Some remarkable consequences are presented as well,
including a reasonable definition of exact controllability for stochastic
differential equations and a condition which implies a Black-Scholes market to
be complete.
