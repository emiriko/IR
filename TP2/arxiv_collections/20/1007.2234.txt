A protocol of quantum energy teleportation is proposed for a one-dimensional
harmonic chain. A coherent-state POVM measurement is performed to coupled
oscillators of the chain in the ground state accompanied by energy infusion to
the system. This measurement consumes a part of ground state entanglement.
Depending on the measurement result, a displacement operation is performed on a
distant oscillator accompanied by energy extraction from the zero-point
fluctuation of the oscillator. We find that the amount of consumed entanglement
is bounded from below by a positive value that is proportional to the amount of
teleported energy.
