There is a general consensus about the fact that the magnetar scenario
provides a convincing explanation for several of the observed properties of the
Anomalous X-ray Pulsars and the Soft Gamma Repeaters. However, the origin of
the emission observed at low energies is still an open issue. We present a
quantitative model for the emission in the optical/infrared band produced by
curvature radiation from magnetospheric charges, and compare results with
current magnetars observations.
