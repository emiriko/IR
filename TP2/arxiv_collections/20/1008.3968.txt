We address the question to what extent the centre-of-mass (COM) separation
can change our view of the many-body problem in quantum chemistry and solid
state physics. It was shown that the many-body treatment based on the
electron-vibrational Hamiltonian is fundamentally inconsistent with the
Born-Handy ansatz so that such a treatment can never respect the COM problem.
Born-Oppenheimer (B-O) approximation reveals some secret: it is a limit case
where the degrees of freedom can be treated in a classical way. Beyond the B-O
approximation they are inseparable in principle. The unique covariant
description of all equations with respect to individual degrees of freedom
leads to new types of interaction: besides the known vibronic (electron-phonon)
one the rotonic (electron-roton) and translonic (electron-translon)
interactions arise. We have proved that due to the COM problem only the
hypervibrations (hyperphonons, i.e. phonons + rotons + translons) have true
physical meaning in molecules and crystals; nevertheless, the use of pure
vibrations (phonons) is justified only in the adiabatic systems. This fact
calls for the total revision of our contemporary knowledge of all non-adiabatic
effects, especially the Jahn-Teller effect and superconductivity. The vibronic
coupling is responsible only for removing of electron (quasi)degeneracies but
for the explanation of symmetry breaking and forming of structure the rotonic
and translonic coupling is necessary.
