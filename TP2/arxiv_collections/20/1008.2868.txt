We describe the identification of single- and few- layer boron nitride. Its
optical contrast is much smaller than that of graphene but even monolayers are
discernable by optimizing viewing conditions. Raman spectroscopy can be used to
confirm BN monolayers. They exhibit an upshift in the fundamental Raman mode by
up to 4 cm-1. The number of layers in thicker crystals can be counted by
exploiting an integer-step increase in the Raman intensity and optical
contrast.
