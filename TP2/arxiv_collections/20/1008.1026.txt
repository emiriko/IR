Single crystals of SrFe2-xPtxAs2 (0 < x < 0.36) were grown using the self
flux solution method and characterized using x-ray crystallography, electrical
transport, magnetic susceptibility, and specific heat measurements. The
magnetic/structural transition is suppressed with increasing Pt concentration,
with superconductivity seen over the range 0.08 < x < 0.36 with a maximum
transition temperature Tc of 16 K at x = 0.16. The shape of the phase diagram
and the changes to the lattice parameters are similar to the effects of other
group VIII elements Ni and Pd, however the higher transition temperature and
extended range of superconductivity suggest some complexity beyond the simple
electron counting picture that has been discussed thus far.
