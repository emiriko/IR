Using a semiclassical model which incorporates tunneling and Coulomb field
effects, the origin of the unexpected low-energy structure (LES) in
above-threshold ionization spectrum observed in recent experiments [C. I. Blaga
et al., Nature Phys. {\bf 5}, 335 (2009) and W. Quanet al., Phys. Rev. Lett.
{\bf 103}, 093001 (2009)] is identified. We show that the LES arises due to an
interplay between multiple forward scattering of an ionized electron and the
electron momentum disturbance by the Coulomb field immediately after the
ionization. The multiple forward scattering is mainly responsible for the
appearance of LES, while the initial disturbance mainly determines the position
of the LES peaks. The scaling laws for the LES parameters, such as the contrast
ratio and the maximal energy, versus the laser intensity and wavelength are
deduced.
