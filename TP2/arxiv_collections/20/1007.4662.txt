The recently formulated framework of anisotropic and dissipative
hydrodynamics (ADHYDRO) is used to describe non-boost-invariant motion of the
fluid created at the early stages of heavy-ion collisions. Very strong initial
asymmetries of pressure are reduced by the entropy production processes. By the
appropriate choice of the form of the entropy source we can reproduce realistic
scenarios for the isotropization expected in heavy-ion collisions. Our previous
results are generalized by including the realistic equation of state as the
limit of the isotropization processes.
