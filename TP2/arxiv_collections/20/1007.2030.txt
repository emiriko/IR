We find a series of possible continuous quantum phase transitions between
fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states at the same filling fraction in
two-component quantum Hall systems. These can be driven by tuning the
interlayer tunneling and/or interlayer repulsion. One side of the transition is
the Halperin (p,p,p-3) Abelian two-component state while the other side is the
non-Abelian Z4 parafermion (Read-Rezayi) state. We predict that the transition
is a continuous transition in the 3D Ising class. The critical point is
described by a Z2 gauged Ginzburg-Landau theory. These results have
implications for experiments on two-component systems at \nu = 2/3 and
single-component systems at \nu = 8/3.
