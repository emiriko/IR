We study natural composite cold dark matter candidates which are pseudo
Nambu-Goldstone bosons (pNGB) in models of dynamical electroweak symmetry
breaking. Some of these can have a significant thermal relic abundance, while
others must be mainly asymmetric dark matter. By considering the thermal
abundance alone we find a lower bound of MW on the pNGB mass when the
(composite) Higgs is heavier than 115 GeV. Being pNGBs, the dark matter
candidates are in general light enough to be produced at the LHC.
