We present a numerical study of forced polymer translocation by using two
separate pore models. Both of them have been extensively used in previous
forced translocation studies. We show that variations in the pore model affect
the forced translocation characteristics significantly in the biologically
relevant pore force, i.e. driving force, range. Details of the model are shown
to change even the obtained scaling relations, which is a strong indication of
strongly out-of-equilibrium dynamics in the computational studies which have
not yet succeeded in addressing the characteristics of the forced translocation
for biopolymers at realistic length scale.
