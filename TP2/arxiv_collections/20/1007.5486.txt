We present measurements of the circular dichroism of optically pumped Rb
vapor near the D1 resonance line. Collisions with the buffer gases $^3$He and
N$_2$ reduce the transparency of the vapor, even when fully polarized. We use
two methods to measure this effect, show that the He results can be understood
from RbHe potential curves, and show how this effect conspires with the
spectral profile of the optical pumping light to increase the laser power
demands for optical pumping of very optically thick samples.
