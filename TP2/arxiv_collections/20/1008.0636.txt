Experiments designed to measure neutrino oscillations also provide major
opportunities for discovering very weakly coupled states. In order to produce
neutrinos, experiments such as LSND collide thousands of Coulombs of protons
into fixed targets, while MINOS and MiniBooNE also focus and then dump beams of
muons. The neutrino detectors beyond these beam dumps are therefore an
excellent arena in which to look for long-lived pseudoscalars or for vector
bosons that kinetically mix with the photon. We show that these experiments
have significant sensitivity beyond previous beam dumps, and are able to
partially close the gap between laboratory experiments and supernovae
constraints on pseudoscalars. Future upgrades to the NuMI beamline and Project
X will lead to even greater opportunities for discovery. We also discuss thin
target experiments with muon beams, such as those available in COMPASS, and
show that they constitute a powerful probe for leptophilic PNGBs.
