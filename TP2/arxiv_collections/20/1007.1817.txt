Deformation-induced lateral migration of a bubble slowly rising near a
vertical plane wall in a stagnant liquid is numerically and theoretically
investigated. In particular, our focus is set on a situation with a short
clearance $c$ between the bubble interface and the wall. Motivated by the fact
that numerically and experimentally measured migration velocities are
considerably higher than the velocity estimated by the available analytical
solution using the Fax\'{e}n mirror image technique for $a/(a+c)\ll 1$ (here
$a$ is the bubble radius), when the clearance parameter $\varepsilon(= c/a)$ is
comparable to or smaller than unity, the numerical analysis based on the
boundary-fitted finite-difference approach solving the Stokes equation is
performed to complement the experiment. The migration velocity is found to be
more affected by the high-order deformation modes with decreasing
$\varepsilon$. The numerical simulations are compared with a theoretical
migration velocity obtained from a lubrication study of a nearly spherical
drop, which describes the role of the squeezing flow within the bubble-wall
gap. The numerical and lubrication analyses consistently demonstrate that when
$\varepsilon\leq 1$, the lubrication effect makes the migration velocity
asymptotically $\mu V_{B1}^2/(25\varepsilon \gamma)$ (here, $V_{B1}$, $\mu$,
and $\gamma$ denote the rising velocity, the dynamic viscosity of liquid, and
the surface tension, respectively).
