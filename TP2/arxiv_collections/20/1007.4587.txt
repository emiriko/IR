We combine results from CDF and D0 on direct searches for the standard model
(SM) Higgs boson H in ppbar collisions at the Fermilab Tevatron at sqrt(s)=1.96
TeV. Compared to the previous Tevatron Higgs search combination more data have
been added, additional new channels have been incorporated, and some previously
used channels have been reanalyzed to gain sensitivity. We use the latest
parton distribution functions and gg to H theoretical cross sections when
comparing our limits to the SM predictions. With up to 5.9 fb-1 of data
analyzed at CDF, and up to 6.7 fb-1 at D0, the 95% C.L. upper limits on Higgs
boson production are factors of 1.56 and 0.68 the values of the SM cross
section for a Higgs boson mass of m_H=115 GeV/c^2 and 165~GeVc^2. We exclude,
at the 95% C.L., a new and larger region at high mass between 158<m_H<175
GeV/c^2.
