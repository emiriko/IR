The Wigner function formalism has been applied to the analysis of elastic
scattering processes. The new element of known formalism is the choice of the
phase space on which the Wigner function is defined. This phase space is
4-dimensional space of canonically conjugate variables - the transverse
momentum of scattered particle and the projection of the vector of the closest
approach of particles in the plane which is perpendicular to the momentum of
initial particle. The exact expression for the mean value of the scattered
particles production area radius through a scattering amplitude has been
obtained.
