Bose-Einstein condensation in the presence of a synthetic spin-momentum
interaction is considered, focusing on the case where a Dirac or Rashba
potential is generated via a tripod scheme. We found that the ground states can
be either plane wave states or superpositions of them, each characterized by
their unique density distributions.
