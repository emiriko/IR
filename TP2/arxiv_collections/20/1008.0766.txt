Spin correlations in the geometrically frustrated RBaCo4O7 compounds, usually
described as an alternating stacking of Kagome and triangular layers on a
hexagonal lattice, have been studied by mean-field approach and by Monte-Carlo
simulations. The behavior of the system was modelled with an isotropic
Heisenberg Hamiltonian as a function of the relevant parameter Jout/Jin,
representing the ratio between exchange integrals inside the Kagome layers,
Jin, and between Kagome and triangular layers, Jout. This ratio can be varied
in real systems by appropriate chemical substitutions. At the mean-field level,
long-range magnetic order with the wave vector at the K-point of symmetry
(k=a*/3+b*/3) has been found for Jout/Jin>0.7. Below this value, the dominant
Fourier modes are completely degenerate in the entire Brillouin zone. The
Monte-Carlo simulations revealed that the long-range ordered configuration
found in the mean-field calculations becomes the ground state of the system for
Jout/Jin>1.5. Below this critical ratio, quasi one-dimensional magnetic
ordering along the c-axis, involving spins of the triangular sublattice was
observed. The correlations in the (ab) plane were found to have a short-range
120o character with correlation length dependent on Jout/Jin.
