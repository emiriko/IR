We analyze the ground state properties of a one-dimensional cold atomic
system in a lattice, where Rydberg excitations are created by an external laser
drive. In the classical limit, the ground state is characterized by a complete
devil's staircase for the commensurate solid structures of Rydberg excitations.
Using perturbation theory and a mapping onto an effective low energy
Hamiltonian, we find a transition of these commensurate solids into a floating
solid with algebraic correlations. For stronger quantum fluctuations the
floating solid eventually melts within a second quantum phase transition and
the ground state becomes paramagnetic.
