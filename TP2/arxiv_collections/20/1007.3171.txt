Some of the asymmetric three qubit $W$ states are used for perfect
teleportation, superdense coding and quantum information splitting. We present
the protocols for the optimal distillation of the asymmetric as well as the
symmetric $W$ states from a single copy of any three qubit $W$ class pure
state.
