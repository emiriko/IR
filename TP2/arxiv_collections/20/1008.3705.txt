Information-theoretic security--widely accepted as the strictest notion of
security--relies on channel coding techniques that exploit the inherent
randomness of propagation channels to strengthen the security of communications
systems. Within this paradigm, we explore strategies to improve secure
connectivity in a wireless network. We first consider the intrinsically secure
communications graph (iS-graph), a convenient representation of the links that
can be established with information-theoretic security on a large-scale
network. We then propose and characterize two techniques--sectorized
transmission and eavesdropper neutralization--which are shown to dramatically
enhance the connectivity of the iS-graph.
