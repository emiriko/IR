We extend the quantum geometric tensor from the state space to the operator
level,and investigate its properties like the additivity for factorizable
models and the splitting of two kinds contributions for the case of stationary
reference states. This operator-quantum-geometric tensor (OQGT) is shown to
reflect the sensitivity of unitary operations against perturbations of multi
parameters. General results for the cases of time evolutions with given
stationary reference states are obtained. By this approach, we get exact
results for the rotated XY models, and show relations between the OQGT and
quantum criticality.
