We present the rms-intensity diagram for black hole transients. Using
observations taken with the Rossi X-ray timing explorer we study the relation
between the root mean square (rms) amplitude of the variability and the net
count-rate during the 2002, 2004 and 2007 outbursts of the black hole X-ray
binary GX 339-4. We find that the rms-flux relation previously observed during
the hard state in X-ray binaries does not hold for the other states, when
different relations apply. These relations can be used as a good tracer of the
different accretion regimes. We identify the hard, soft and intermediate states
in the rms-intensity diagram. Transitions between the different states are seen
to produce marked changes in the rms-flux relation. We find that one single
component is required to explain the ~ 40 per cent variability observed at low
count rates, whereas no or very low variability is associated to the
accretion-disc thermal component.
