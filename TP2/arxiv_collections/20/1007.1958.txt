The practical focus of this work is the dynamical simulation of polarization
transport processes in quantum spin microscopy and spectroscopy. The simulation
framework is built-up progressively, beginning with state-spaces (configuration
manifolds) that are geometrically natural, introducing coordinates that are
algebraically natural; and finally specifying dynamical potentials that are
physically natural; in each respect explicit criteria are given for
"naturality." The resulting framework encompasses Hamiltonian flow (both
classical and quantum), quantum Lindbladian processes, and classical
thermostatic processes. Constructive validation and verification criteria are
given for metric and symplectic flows on classical, quantum, and hybrid
state-spaces, with particular emphasis to tensor network state-spaces. Both
classical and quantum examples are presented, including dynamic nuclear
polarization (DNP). A broad span of applications and challenges is discussed,
ranging from the design and simulation of quantum spin microscopes to the
design and simulation of quantum oracles.
