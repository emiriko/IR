Generation of direct current in zigzag carbon nanotubes due to harmonic
mixing of two coherent electromagnetic waves is being considered. The
electromagnetic waves have commensurate frequencies of omega and two omega. The
rectification of the waves at high frequencies is quite smooth whiles at low
frequencies there are some fluctuations. The nonohmicity observed in the
I-Vcharacteristics is attributed to the nonparabolicity of the electron energy
band which is very strong in carbon nanotubes because of high stark component.
It is observed that the current falls off faster at lower electric field than
the case in superlattice. For omega tau equal to two? the external electric
field strength Emax for the observation of negative differential conductivity
occurs around 1.03x10e6 V/m which is quite weak. It is interesting to note that
the peak of the curve shifts to the left with increasing value of omega tau?
