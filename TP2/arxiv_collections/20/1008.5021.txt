We consider the limiting case for orbital stability of the companions to HR
8799. This case is only consistent with ages for the system of ~100 Myr, not
with the 1 Gyr age proposed from astroseismology. The discrepancy probably
arises because the inclination of the star is smaller than assumed in analyzing
the astroseismology data. Given this young age, the best estimates of the
companion masses place them by a small margin on the planet side of the
division between planets and brown dwarfs.
