On the AdS_5 cone, conformally compactified to R^1xS^3, a quark-diquark model
of light flavor baryons is developed. The system on this manifold is decribed
in terms of a scalar conformal equation, gauged by the field of a D3 brane
whose transversal dimensions have been conformally warpped over R^1xS^3. Such a
system does not result exactly conformally invariant because the gauge
potential slightly modifies the conformal centrifugal barrier of the free
geodesic motion. Thanks to this, the model describes the correct mass ordering
in the P11-S11 pairs through the N spectrum as a combined effect of conformal
symmetry breaking, on the one side, and a parity change of the diquark from a
scalar at low masses, to a pseudoscalar at higher masses, on the other. We
calculate the number of resonances with masses below 2500 MeV needed for the
completeness of the above scheme and find a total of 32 "missing" nucleon and
Delta states. Their absence or presence in the respective spectra relates to
the degree to which conformal symmetry is realized in the lightest flavor
sector. The scheme also allows for the prediction of the dressing function of
an effective instantaneous gluon propagator from the Fourier transform of the
gauge potential. We find a dressing function that is finite in the infrared and
tends to zero at infinity.
