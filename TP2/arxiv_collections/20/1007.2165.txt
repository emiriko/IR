A scheme to evaluate computation fidelities within the one-way model is
developed and explored to understand the role of correlations in the quality of
noisy quantum computations. The formalism is promptly applied to many
computation instances, and unveils that a higher amount of entanglement in the
noisy resource state does not necessarily imply a better computation.
