We report the first demonstration of quantum interference in multimode
interference (MMI) devices and a new complete characterization technique that
can be applied to any photonic device that removes the need for phase stable
measurements. MMI devices provide a compact and robust realization of NxM
optical circuits, which will dramatically reduce the complexity and increase
the functionality of future generations of quantum photonic circuits.
