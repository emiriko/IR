We introduce a modified rack algebra Z[X] for racks X with finite rack rank
N. We use representations of Z[X] into rings, known as rack modules, to define
enhancements of the rack counting invariant for classical and virtual knots and
links. We provide computations and examples to show that the new invariants are
strictly stronger than the unenhanced counting invariant and are not determined
by the Jones or Alexander polynomials.
