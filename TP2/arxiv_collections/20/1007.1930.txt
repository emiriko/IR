We introduce a version of discrete Morse theory for posets. This theory
studies the topology of the order complexes K(X) of h-regular posets X from the
critical points of admissible matchings on X. Our approach is related to R.
Forman's discrete Morse theory for CW-complexes and generalizes Forman and
Chari's results on the face posets of regular CW-complexes. We also introduce a
homological variant of the theory that can be used to study the topology of
triangulable homology manifolds by means of their order triangulations.
