The approach of applying associative processor for decision making problem
was proposed. It focuses on hardware implementations of fuzzy processing
systems, associativity as effective management basis of fuzzy processor. The
structural approach is being developed resulting in a quite simple and compact
parallel associative memory unit (PAMU). The memory cost and speed comparison
of processors with rigid and soft-variable structure is given. Also the example
PAMU flashing is considered.
