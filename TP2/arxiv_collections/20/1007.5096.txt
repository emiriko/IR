Thin films of TiN were sputter-deposited onto Si and sapphire wafers with and
without SiN buffer layers. The films were fabricated into RF coplanar waveguide
resonators, and internal quality factor measurements were taken at millikelvin
temperatures in both the many photon and single photon limits, i.e. high and
low power regimes, respectively. At high power, internal quality factors
($Q_i$'s) higher than $10^7$ were measured for TiN with predominantly a
(200)-TiN orientation. Films that showed significant (111)-TiN texture
invariably had much lower $Q_i$'s, on the order of $10^5$. Our studies show
that the (200)-TiN is favored for growth at high temperature on either bare Si
or SiN buffer layers. However, growth on bare sapphire or Si(100) at low
temperature resulted in primarily a (111)-TiN orientation. Ellipsometry and
Auger measurements indicate that the (200)-TiN growth on the bare Si substrates
is correlated with the formation of a thin, $\approx 2$ nm, layer of SiN during
the pre-deposition procedure. In the single photon regime, $Q_i$ of these films
exceeded $8\times10^5$, while thicker SiN buffer layers led to reduced $Q_i$'s
at low power.
