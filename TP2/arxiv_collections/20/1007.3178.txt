We summarize the top-quark mass measurements from the CDF and DO experiments
at Fermilab. We combine published Run I (1992-1996) measurements with the most
precise published and preliminary Run II (2001-present) measurements using up
to 5.6fb-1 of data. Taking uncertainty correlations properly into account, and
adding in quadrature the statistical and systematic uncertainties, the
resulting preliminary Tevatron average mass of the top quark is M(top) =
173.3+-1.1.
