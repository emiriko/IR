The gamma-ray binaries LS 5039 and LS I +61 303 have been detected by
Cerenkov telescopes at TeV energies, exhibiting periodic behavior correlated
with the orbital period. These gamma-ray binary systems have also been recently
detected by the Fermi Gamma-ray Telescope at GeV energies, and combination of
GeV and TeV observations are providing both, expected and surprising results.
We summarize these results, also considering the multi-frequency scenario, from
the perspective of pulsar systems. We discuss similarities and differences of
models in which pulsar wind/star wind shocks, or pulsar wind zone processes
lead to particles accelerated enough to emit TeV photons. We discuss in detail
the caveats of the current observations for detecting either accretion lines or
pulsations from these objects. We also comment on the possibility for
understanding the GeV to TeV emission from these binaries with a 2-components
contribution to their spectrum. We show that it would be possible to
accommodate both, normal pulsar emission and GeV / TeV fluxes that vary with
orbital phase. We point out several aspects of this idea that are subject to
test with data being currently taken.
