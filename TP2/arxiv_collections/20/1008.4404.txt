We present a measurement of the $WW+WZ$ production cross section observed in
a final state consisting of an identified electron or muon, two jets, and
missing transverse energy. The measurement is carried out in a data sample
corresponding to up to 4.6~fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity at $\sqrt{s} =
1.96$ TeV collected by the CDF II detector. Matrix element calculations are
used to separate the diboson signal from the large backgrounds. The $WW+WZ$
cross section is measured to be $17.4\pm3.3$~pb, in agreement with standard
model predictions. A fit to the dijet invariant mass spectrum yields a
compatible cross section measurement.
