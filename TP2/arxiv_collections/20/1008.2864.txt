A comprehensive analysis of optical second harmonic generation (SHG) on an
incommensurate (IC) magnetically ordered state is presented using multiferroic
MnWO4 as model compound. Two fundamentally different SHG contributions coupling
to the primary IC magnetic order or to secondary commensurate projections of
the IC state, respectively, are distinguished. Whereas the latter can be
described within the formalism of the 122 commensurate magnetic point groups
the former involves a breakdown of the conventional macroscopic symmetry
analysis because of its sensitivity to the lower symmetry of the local
environment in a crystal lattice. Our analysis thus foreshadows the fusion of
the hitherto disjunct fields of nonlinear optics and IC order in
condensed-matter systems.
