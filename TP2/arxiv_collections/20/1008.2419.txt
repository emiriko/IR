We propose a simple complexity indicator of classical Liouvillian dynamics,
namely the separability entropy, which determines the logarithm of an effective
number of terms in a Schmidt decomposition of phase space density with respect
to an arbitrary fixed product basis. We show that linear growth of separability
entropy provides stricter criterion of complexity than Kolmogorov-Sinai
entropy, namely it requires that dynamics is exponentially unstable, non-linear
and non-markovian.
