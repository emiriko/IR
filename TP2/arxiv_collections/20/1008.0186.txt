Using the white noise space setting, we define and study stochastic integrals
with respect to a class of stationary increment Gaussian processes. We focus
mainly on continuous functions with values in the Kondratiev space of
stochastic distributions, where use is made of the topology of nuclear spaces.
We also prove an associated Ito formula.
