We show compatibility with all known experimental constraints of t-b-tau
Yukawa coupling unification in supersymmetric SU(4)_c x SU(2)_L x SU(2)_R which
has non-universal gaugino masses and the MSSM parameter mu < 0. In particular,
the relic neutralino abundance satisfies the WMAP bounds and Delta (g-2)_mu is
in good agreement with the observations. We identify benchmark points for the
sparticle spectra which can be tested at the LHC, including those associated
with gluino and stau coannihilation channels, mixed bino-Higgsino state and the
A-funnel region. We also briefly discuss prospects for testing Yukawa
unification with the ongoing and planned direct detection experiments.
