We consider the homogenization of the Navier-Stokes equation, set in a
channel with a rough boundary, of small amplitude and wavelength $\epsilon$. It
was shown recently that, for any non-degenerate roughness pattern, and for any
reasonable condition imposed at the rough boundary, the homogenized boundary
condition in the limit $\epsilon = 0$ is always no-slip. We give in this paper
error estimates for this homogenized no-slip condition, and provide a more
accurate effective boundary condition, of Navier type. Our result extends those
obtained in previous works, in which the special case of a Dirichlet condition
at the rough boundary was examined.
