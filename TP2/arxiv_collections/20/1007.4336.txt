Wolf-Rayet stars have been identified as objects in their final phase of
massive star evolution. It has been suggested that Wolf-Rayet stars are the
progenitors of long-duration gamma ray bursts in low metallicity environments.
However, this deduction has yet to be proven. Here we report on our initial
results from a VLT/FORS linear spectropolarimetry survey of Wolf-Rayet stars in
the Magellanic Clouds, which is intended to constrain the physical criteria -
such as weaker stellar winds, rapid rotation, and associated asymmetry - of the
collapsar model. Finally, we provide an outlook for polarisation studies with
an extremely large telescope.
