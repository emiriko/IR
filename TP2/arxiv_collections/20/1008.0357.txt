We present an overview of our understanding of electrostatic interactions
between charged macromolecular surfaces mediated by mobile counter- and coions.
The dichotomy between the weak and the strong coupling regimes is described in
detail and the way they engender repulsive and attractive interactions between
nominally equally charged macroions. We also introduce the concept of dressed
counterions in the case of many-component Coulomb fluids that are partially
weakly and partially strongly coupled to local electrostatic fields leading to
non-monotonic interactions between equally charged macroions. The effect of
quenched surface charge disorder on the counterion-mediated electrostatic
interactions is analyzed within the same conceptual framework and shown to lead
to unexpected and extraordinary electrostatic interactions between randomly
charged surfaces with equal mean surface charge densities or even between
effectively neutral macroion surfaces. As a result, these recent developments
challenge some cherished notions of pop culture.
