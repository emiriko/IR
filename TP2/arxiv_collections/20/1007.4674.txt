Probabilities of various final states are determined numerically for a number
of {\ss}- decaying light atoms. In our evaluations of the final state
probabilities we have used the highly accurate atomic wave functions
constructed for each few-electron atom/ion. We also discuss an experimental
possibility to observe negatively charged ions which form during the nuclear
{\ss}+ decays. High order corrections to the results obtained for {\ss}+/-
decays in few-electron atoms with the use of sudden approximation are
considered.
