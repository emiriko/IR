We study the problem of when the collection of the recession cones of a
polyhedral complex forms also a complex. We exhibit an example showing that
this is no always the case. We also show that if the support of the given
polyhedral complex satisfies a Minkowski-Weyl type condition, then the answer
is positive. As a consequence, we obtain a classification theorem for proper
toric schemes over a discrete valuation ring in terms of complete strongly
convex rational polyhedral complexes.
