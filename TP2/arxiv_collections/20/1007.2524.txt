Surface operators in N=2 four-dimensional gauge theories are interesting
half-BPS objects. These operators inherit the connection of gauge theory with
the Liouville conformal field theory, which was discovered by Alday, Gaiotto
and Tachikawa. Moreover it has been proposed that toric branes in the A-model
topological strings lead to surface operators via the geometric engineering. We
analyze the surface operators by making good use of topological string theory.
Starting from this point of view, we propose that the wave-function behavior of
the topological open string amplitudes geometrically engineers the surface
operator partition functions and the Gaiotto curves of corresponding gauge
theories. We then study a peculiar feature that the surface operator
corresponds to the insertion of the degenerate fields in the conformal field
theory side. We show that this aspect can be realized as the geometric
transition in topological string theory, and the insertion of a surface
operator leads to the bubbling of the toric Calabi-Yau geometry.
