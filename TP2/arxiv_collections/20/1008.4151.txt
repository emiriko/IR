We report a measurement of the modification of the effective precession
frequency of polarized 3He atoms in response to a dressing field in a room
temperature cell. The 3He atoms were polarized using the metastability
spin-exchange method. An oscillating dressing field is then applied
perpendicular to the constant magnetic field. Modification of the 3He effective
precession frequency was observed over a broad range of the amplitude and
frequency of the dressing field. The observed effects are compared with
calculations based on quantum optics formalism.
