This article puts forth a process applicable to central force scatterings.
Under certain assumptions, we show that in attractive force fields a high speed
particle with a small mass speeding through space, statistically loses energy
by colliding softly with large masses that move slowly and randomly.
Furthermore, we show that the opposite holds in repulsive force fields: the
small particle statistically gains energy. This effect is small and is mainly
due to asymmetric energy exchange of the transverse (i.e., perpendicular)
collisions. We derive a formula that quantifies this effect (Eq. 12). We then
put this work in a broader statistical context and discuss its consistency with
established results.
