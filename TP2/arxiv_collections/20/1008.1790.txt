In this paper a new intrinsic geometric characterization of the symmetric
square of a curve and of the ordinary product of two curves is given. More
precisely it is shown that the existence on a surface of general type S of
irregularity q of an effective divisor D having self-intersection D^2>0 and
arithmetic genus q implies that S is either birational to a product of curves
or to the second symmetric product of a curve.
