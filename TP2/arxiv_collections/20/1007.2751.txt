We study the correlation between the gamma-ray flux F_g, averaged over the
first 11 months of Fermi survey and integrated above 100 MeV, and the radio
flux density (F_r at 20 GHz) of Fermi sources associated with a radio
counterpart in the AT20G survey. Considering the blazars detected in both
bands, the correlation is highly significant and it is F_g~F_r^0.85+-0.04,
similar for BL Lac and FSRQ sources. However, only a small fraction (~1/15) of
the AT20G radio sources with flat radio spectrum, are detected by Fermi. To
understand if this correlation is real, we examine the selection effects
introduced by the flux limits of the radio and gamma-ray surveys, and the
importance of variability of the gamma-ray flux. We find that the
radio/gamma-ray flux correlation is real, but its slope is steeper than the
observed one, i.e. F_g~F_r^delta with delta in the range 1.25-1.5. The observed
F_g-F_r correlation and the fraction of radio sources detected by Fermi is
reproduced assuming a long term gamma-ray flux variability following a
log-normal probability distribution with standard deviation sigma>0.5
(corresponding to F_g varying by at least a factor 3). Such a variability is
compatible with what observed when comparing, for the sources in common, the
EGRET and the Fermi gamma-ray fluxes (even if the Fermi fluxes are averaged
over ~1 year). Another indication of variability is the non detection of 12 out
of 66 EGRET blazars by Fermi, despite its higher sensitivity.We also study the
strong linear correlation between the gamma-ray and the radio luminosity of the
144 AT20G-Fermi associations with known redshift and show that it is
statistically robust. Two possible implications of these correlations are
discussed: the contribution of blazars to the extragalactic gamma-ray
background and the prediction of blazars that might undergo extremely high
states of gamma-ray emission in the next years.
