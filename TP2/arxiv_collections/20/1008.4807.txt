The inclusive double Pomeron exchange cross section for heavy quark pair
production is calculated for nucleus-nucleus collisions at the LHC. The present
estimate is based on hard diffractive factorization, corrected by absorptive
corrections and nuclear effects. The theoretical uncertainties for nuclear
collisions are investigated and a comparison to other approaches is presented.
The production channels producing a similar final state configuration are
discussed as well.
