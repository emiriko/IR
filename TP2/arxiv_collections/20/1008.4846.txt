By introducing a new entangled state representation, we show that the
Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) mode is just the wave function of the common eigenvector
of the orbital angular momentum and the total photon number operators of 2-d
oscillator, which can be generated by 50:50 beam splitter with the phase
difference phi=Pi/2{\phi} between the reflected and transmitted fields. Based
on this and using the Weyl ordering invariance under similar transforms, the
Wigner representation of LG is directly obtained, which can be considered as
the generalized Wigner transform of Hermite Gaussian modes.
