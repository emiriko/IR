We report on a study of magnetotransport in LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interfaces
characterized by mobilities of the order of several thousands cm$^{2}$/Vs. We
observe Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations that indicate a two-dimensional
character of the Fermi surface. The frequency of the oscillations signals a
multiple sub-bands occupation in the quantum well or a multiple valley
configuration. From the temperature dependence of the oscillation amplitude we
extract an effective carrier mass $m^{*}\simeq1.45$\,$m_{e}$. An electric field
applied in the back-gate geometry increases the mobility, the carrier density
and the oscillation frequency.
