Surface polaritons at a meta-material interface are proposed as qubits. The
SP fields are shown to have low losses, subwavelength confinement and can
demonstrate very small modal volume. These important properties are used to
demonstatre interesting applications in quantum information, i.e., coherent
control of weak fields and large Kerr nonlinearity at the low photon level.
