A biological competition model where the individuals of the same species
perform a two-dimensional Markovian continuous-time random walk and undergo
reproduction and death is studied. The competition is introduced through the
assumption that the reproduction rate depends on the crowding in the
neighborhood. The spatial dynamics corresponds either to normal diffusion
characterized by Gaussian jumps or to superdiffusion characterized by L\'evy
flights. It is observed that in both cases periodic patterns occur for
appropriate parameters of the model, indicating that the general macroscopic
collective behavior of the system is more strongly influenced by the
competition for the resources than by the type of spatial dynamics. However,
some differences arise that are discussed.
