We show that nonreciprocal optical Bloch-like oscillations can emerge in
transversely magnetized waveguide arrays in the presence of an effective index
step between the waveguides. Normal modes of the system are shown to acquire
different wavenumbers in opposite propagation directions. Significant
differences in phase coherence and decoherence between these normal modes are
presented and discussed. Non-reciprocity is established by imposing unequal
vertical refractive index gradients at the substrate/core, and core/cover
interfaces in the presence of transverse magnetization.
