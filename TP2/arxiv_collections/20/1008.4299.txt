We prove generating series formulae for suitable twisted characteristic
classes of symmetric products of a singular complex quasi-projective variety.
More concretely, we study homology Hirzebruch classes for motivic coefficients,
as well as for complexes of mixed Hodge modules. As a special case, we obtain a
generating series formula for the (intersection) homology Hirzebruch classes of
symmetric products. In some cases, the latter yields a similar formula for
twisted homology L-classes generalizing results of Hirzebruch-Zagier and
Moonen. Our methods also apply to the study of Todd classes of (complexes of)
coherent sheaves, as well as Chern classes of (complexes of) constructible
sheaves, generalizing to arbitrary coefficients results of Moonen and resp.
