The entanglement entropy of the integer Quantum Hall states satisfies the
area law for smooth domains with a vanishing topological term. In this paper we
consider polygonal domains for which the area law acquires a constant term that
only depends on the angles of the vertices and we give a general expression for
it. We study also the dependence of the entanglement spectrum on the geometry
and give it a simple physical interpretation.
