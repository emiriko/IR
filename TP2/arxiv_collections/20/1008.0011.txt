This paper considers parallel Gr\"obner bases algorithms on distributed
memory parallel computers with multi-core compute nodes. We summarize three
different Gr\"obner bases implementations: shared memory parallel, pure
distributed memory parallel and distributed memory combined with shared memory
parallelism. The last algorithm, called distributed hybrid, uses only one
control communication channel between the master node and the worker nodes and
keeps polynomials in shared memory on a node. The polynomials are transported
asynchronous to the control-flow of the algorithm in a separate distributed
data structure. The implementation is generic and works for all implemented
(exact) fields. We present new performance measurements and discuss the
performance of the algorithms.
