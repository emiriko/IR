We consider a layered system of fermionic molecules with permanent dipole
moments aligned by an external field. The dipole interactions between fermions
in adjacent layers are attractive and induce inter-layer pairing. Due to
competition for pairing among adjacent layers, the mean-field ground state of
the layered system is a dimerized superfluid, with pairing only between
every-other layer. We construct an effective Ising-XY lattice model that
describes the interplay between dimerization and superfluid phase fluctuations.
In addition to the dimerized superfluid ground state, and high temperature
normal state, at intermediate temperature, we find an unusual dimerized
"pseudogap" state with only short-range phase coherence. We propose light
scattering experiments to detect dimerization.
