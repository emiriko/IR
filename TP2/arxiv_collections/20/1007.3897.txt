We investigate the phenomenology of Effective Supersymmetry (ESUSY) models
wherein electroweak gauginos and third generation scalars have masses up to
about 1~TeV while first and second generation scalars lie in the multi-TeV
range. Such models ameliorate the SUSY flavor and CP problems via a decoupling
solution, while at the same time maintaining naturalness. In our analysis, we
assume independent GUT scale mass parameters for third and first/second
generation scalars and for the Higgs scalars, in addition to m_{1/2}, \tan\beta
and A_0, and require radiative electroweak symmetry breaking as usual. We
analyse the parameter space which is consistent with current constraints, by
means of a Markov Chain Monte Carlo scan. The lightest MSSM particle (LMP) is
mostly, but not always the lightest neutralino, and moreover, the thermal relic
density of the neutralino LMP is frequently very large. These models may
phenomenologically be perfectly viable if the LMP before nucleosynthesis decays
into the axino plus SM particles. Dark matter is then an axion/axino mixture.
At the LHC, the most important production mechanisms are gluino production (for
m_{1/2} ~<700~GeV) and third generation squark production, while SUSY events
rich in b-jets are the hallmark of the ESUSY scenario. We present a set of
ESUSY benchmark points with characteristic features and discuss their LHC
phenomenology.
