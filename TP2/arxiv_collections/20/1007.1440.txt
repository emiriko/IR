The long-range interaction between two atoms and the long-range interaction
between an ion and an electron are compared at small and large intersystem
separations. The vacuum dressed atom formalism is applied and found to provide
a framework for interpretation of the similarities between the two cases. The
van der Waals forces or Casimir-Polder potentials are used to obtain insight
into relativistic and higher multipolar terms.
