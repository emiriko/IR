We demonstrate that a near-dissociation photoassociation resonance can be
used to create a deeply bound molecular sample of ultracold NaCs. To probe the
resulting vibrational distribution of the sample, we use a new technique that
can be applied to any ultracold molecular system. We utilize a tunable pulsed
dye laser to produce efficient spectroscopic scans ($\sim700$ cm$^{-1}$ at a
time) in which we observe the $1^{1} \Sigma^{+}\rightarrow
2^{1}\Sigma^{+}-2^{3}\Pi$ vibrational progression, as well as the dissociation
limit to the Cs 6$^{2}$P$_{3/2}$ asymptote. We assign $1^{1}
\Sigma^{+}$$(\emph{v}$ = 4, 5, 6, 11, 19) vibrational levels in our sample.
