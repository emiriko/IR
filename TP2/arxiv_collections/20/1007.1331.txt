We present new more sensitive high-resolution radio observations of a compact
broad absorption line (BAL) quasar, 1045+352, made with the EVN+MERLIN at 5
GHz. They allowed us to trace the connection between the arcsecond structure
and the radio core of the quasar. The radio morphology of 1045+352 is dominated
by a knotty jet showing several bends. We discuss possible scenarios that could
explain such a complex morphology: galaxy merger, accretion disk instability,
precession of the jet and jet-cloud interactions. It is possible that we are
witnessing an ongoing jet precession in this source due to internal
instabilities within the jet flow, however, a dense environment detected in the
submillimeter band and an outflowing material suggested by the X-ray absorption
could strongly interact with the jet. It is difficult to establish the
orientation between the jet axis and the observer in 1045+352 because of the
complex structure. Nevertheless taking into account the most recent inner radio
structure we conclude that the radio jet is oriented close to the line of sight
which can mean that the opening angle of the accretion disk wind can be large
in this source. We also suggest that there is no direct correlation between the
jet-observer orientation and the possibility of observing BALs.
