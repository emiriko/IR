Universal quantum computation (UQC) using Majorana fermions on a 2D
topological superconducting (TS) medium remains an outstanding open problem.
This is because the quantum gate set that can be generated by braiding of the
Majorana fermions does not include \emph{any} two-qubit gate and also the
single-qubit $\pi/8$ phase gate. In principle, it is possible to create these
crucial extra gates using quantum interference of Majorana fermion currents.
However, it is not clear if the motion of the various order parameter defects
(vortices, domain walls, \emph{etc.}), to which the Majorana fermions are bound
in a TS medium, can be quantum coherent. We show that these obstacles can be
overcome using a semiconductor quantum wire network in the vicinity of an
$s$-wave superconductor, by constructing topologically protected two-qubit
gates and any arbitrary single-qubit phase gate in a topologically unprotected
manner, which can be error corrected using magic state distillation. Thus our
strategy, using a judicious combination of topologically protected and
unprotected gate operations, realizes UQC on a quantum wire network with a
remarkably high error threshold of $0.14$ as compared to $10^{-3}$ to $10^{-4}$
in ordinary unprotected quantum computation.
