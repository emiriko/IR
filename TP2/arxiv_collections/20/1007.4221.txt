This paper presents an analysis of building blocks propagation in
Quantum-Inspired Genetic Algorithm, which belongs to a new class of
metaheuristics drawing their inspiration from both biological evolution and
unitary evolution of quantum systems. The expected number of quantum
chromosomes matching a schema has been analyzed and a random variable
corresponding to this issue has been introduced. The results have been compared
with Simple Genetic Algorithm. Also, it has been presented how selected binary
quantum chromosomes cover a domain of one-dimensional fitness function.
