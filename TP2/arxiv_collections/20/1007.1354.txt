The Casimir energy for the transverse oscillations of a piecewise uniform
closed string is calculated. In its simplest version the string consists of two
parts I and II having in general different tension and mass density, but is
always obeying the condition that the velocity of sound is equal to the
velocity of light. The model, first introduced by Brevik and Nielsen in 1990,
possesses attractive formal properties implying that it becomes easily
regularizable by several methods, the most powerful one being the contour
integration method. We also consider the case where the string is divided into
2N pieces, of alternating type-I and type-II material. The free energy at
finite temperature, as well as the Hagedorn temperature, are found. Finally, we
make some remarks on the relationship between this kind of theory and the
theory of quantum star graphs, recently considered by Fulling et al.
