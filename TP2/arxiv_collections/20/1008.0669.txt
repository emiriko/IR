The stability analysis introduced by Lyapunov and extended by Oseledec is an
excellent tool to describe the character of nonlinear n-dimensional flows by n
global exponents if these flows are stable in time. However, there are two main
shortcomings: (a) The local exponents fail to indicate the origin of
instability where trajectories start to diverge. Instead, their time evolution
contains a much stronger chaos than the trajectories, which is only eliminated
by integrating over a long time. Therefore, shorter time intervals cannot be
characterized correctly, which would be essential to analyse changes of chaotic
character as in transients. (b) Moreover, although Oseledec uses an n
dimensional sphere around a point x to be transformed into an n dimensional
ellipse in first order, this local ellipse has yet not been evaluated. The aim
of this contribution is to eliminate these two shortcomings. Problem (a)
disappears if the Oseledec method is replaced by a frame with a 'constraint' as
performed by Rateitschak and Klages (RK) [Phys. Rev. E 65 036209 (2002)]. The
reasons why this method is better will be illustrated by comparing different
systems. In order to analyze shorter time intervals, integrals between
consecutive Poincare points will be evaluated. The local problems (b) will be
solved analytically by introducing the symmetric 'Jacobian deformation
ellipsoid' and its orthogonal submatrix, which enable to search in the full
phase space for extreme local separation exponents. These are close to the RK
exponents but need no time integration of the RK frame. Finally, four sets of
local exponents are compared: Oseledec frame, RK frame, Jacobian deformation
ellipsoid and its orthogonal submatrix.
