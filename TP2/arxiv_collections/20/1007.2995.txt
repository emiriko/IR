We generate squeezed state of light at 860 nm with a monolithic optical
parametric oscillator. The optical parametric oscillator consists of a
periodically poled KTiOPO_4 crystal, both ends of which are spherically
polished and mirror-coated. We achieve both phase matching and cavity resonance
by controlling only the temperature of the crystal. We observe up to -8.0 dB of
squeezing with the bandwidth of 142 MHz. Our technique makes it possible to
drive many monolithic cavities simultaneously by a single laser. Hence our
monolithic optical parametric oscillator is quite suitable to
continuous-variable quantum information experiments where we need a large
number of highly squeezed light beams.
