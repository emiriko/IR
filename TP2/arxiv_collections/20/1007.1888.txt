In this note we discuss a supersymmetric (SUSY) D4 x Z5 model which leads to
vanishing reactor mixing angle theta_13=0 and maximal atmospheric mixing
theta_23=pi/4 in the lepton sector at leading order (LO), due to the
preservation of non-trivial distinct D4 subgroups in the charged lepton and
neutrino sectors, respectively. The solar mixing angle theta_12 remains
undetermined and is expected to be of order one. Since right-handed charged
leptons transform as singlets under D4, the charged lepton mass hierarchy can
be naturally accounted for. The model predicts inverted mass hierarchy for
neutrinos. Additionally, we show that, unlike in most of the other models of
this type, all vacuum expectation values (VEVs) of gauge singlets (flavons) can
be fixed through mass parameters of the superpotential. Next-to-leading order
(NLO) corrections to lepton masses and mixings are calculated and shown to be
under control, especially the corrections to theta_23=pi/4 and theta_13=0 are
of the order of the generic expansion parameter epsilon = 0.04 and arise
dominantly from the charged lepton sector.
