This is our reply to "Critical remarks on Finslerian modifications of gravity
and cosmology by Zhe Chang and Xin Li", Sergiu I. Vacaru, Phys. Lett. B 690
(2010) 224. It is pointed out that the Finslerian modifications of gravity and
cosmology (Zhe Chang and Xin Li, Phys. Lett. B 676 (2009) 173; {\it ibid} 668
(2008) 453) is a suggestion on the generalization of Einstein's gravity and
cosmology, but not a proof for theorems in geometry. False or true of the
theory should be tested by experiments or observations. We show that the
arguments of Sergiu I. Vacaru were based a wrong logic. A personal claim can
not be used to prove any other theory be wrong. To get the claim: {\it "we may
construct more "standard" physical Finsler classical/quantum gravity theories
for metric compatible connections like the Cartan d-connection"}, Sergiu I.
Vacaru should complete a consistent presentation at least. We suggest Sergiu I.
Vacaru to make some predictions on gravity and cosmoligy using his {\it
"standard" physical Finsler classical/quantum gravity theories} as we did, and
compare them with astronomical observations. By the way, we should say that it
is still really far from a theory of quantum gravity.
