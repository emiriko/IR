This paper describes the concept and the beginning of an experimental
investigation of whether it is possible to directly detect dark energy density
on earth using atom interferometry. The concept is to null out the
gravitational force using a double interferometer. This research provides a
non-astronomical path for research on dark energy. The application of this
method to other hypothetical weak forces and fields is also discussed. In the
the final section I discuss the advantages of carrying out a dark energy
density search in a satellite in earth orbit where more precise nulling of
gravitational forces can be achieved.
