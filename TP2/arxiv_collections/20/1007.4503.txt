Graphene is considered to be a promising material for future electronics. The
envisaged transistor applications often rely on precision cutting of graphene
sheets with nanometer accuracy. In this letter we demonstrate graphene-based
quantum dots created by using atomic force microscopy (AFM) with tip-assisted
electrochemical etching. This lithography technique provides resolution of
about 20 nm, which can probably be further improved by employing sharper tips
and better humidity control. The behavior of our smallest dots in magnetic
field has allowed us to identify the charge neutrality point and distinguish
the states with one electron, no charge and one hole left inside the quantum
dot.
