In this paper, a time varying resistive circuit realising the action of an
active three segment piecewise linear flux controlled memristor is proposed.
Using this as the nonlinearity, a driven Chua's circuit is implemented. The
phenomenon of chaotic beats in this circuit is observed for a suitable choice
of parameters. The memristor acts as a chaotically time varying resistor
(CTVR), switching between a less conductive OFF state and a more conductive ON
state. This chaotic switching is governed by the dynamics of the driven Chua's
circuit of which the memristor is an integral part. The occurrence of beats is
essentially due to the interaction of the memristor aided self oscillations of
the circuit and the external driving sinusoidal forcing. Upon slight
tuning/detuning of the frequencies of the memristor switching and that of the
external force, constructive and destructive interferences occur leading to
revivals and collapses in amplitudes of the circuit variables, which we refer
as chaotic beats. Numerical simulations and Multisim modelling as well as
statistical analyses have been carried out to observe as well as to understand
and verify the mechanism leading to chaotic beats.
