Matrix element reweighting is a powerful experimental technique widely
employed to maximize the amount of information that can be extracted from a
collider data set. We present a procedure that allows to automatically evaluate
the weights for any process of interest in the standard model and beyond. Given
the initial, intermediate and final state particles, and the transfer functions
for the final physics objects, such as leptons, jets, missing transverse
energy, our algorithm creates a phase-space mapping designed to efficiently
perform the integration of the squared matrix element and the transfer
functions. The implementation builds up on MadGraph, it is completely
automatized and publicly available. A few sample applications are presented
that show the capabilities of the code and illustrate the possibilities for new
studies that such an approach opens up.
