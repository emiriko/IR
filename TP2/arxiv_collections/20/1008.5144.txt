Studies of electronic charge transport through semiconductor double quantum
dots rely on a conventional "hole" model of transport in the three-electron
regime. We show that experimental measurements of charge transport through a Si
double quantum dot in this regime cannot be fully explained using the
conventional picture. Using a Hartree-Fock (HF) formalism and relevant HF
energy parameters extracted from transport data in the multiple-electron
regime, we identify a novel spin-flip cotunneling process that lifts a singlet
blockade.
