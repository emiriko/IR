A significant limitation of practical quantum key distribution (QKD) setups
is currently their limited operational range. It has recently been emphasized
(X. Ma, C.-H. F. Fung, and H.-K. Lo., Phys. Rev. A, 76:012307, 2007) that
entanglement-based QKD systems can tolerate higher channel losses than systems
based on weak coherent laser pulses (WCP), in particular when the source is
located symmetrically between the two communicating parties, Alice and Bob. In
the work presented here, we experimentally study this important advantage by
implementing different entanglement-based QKD setups on a 144~km free-space
link between the two Canary Islands of La Palma and Tenerife. We established
three different configurations where the entangled photon source was placed at
Alice's location, asymmetrically between Alice and Bob and symmetrically in the
middle between Alice and Bob, respectively. The resulting quantum channel
attenuations of 35~dB, 58~dB and 71~dB, respectively, significantly exceed the
limit for WCP systems. This confirms that QKD over distances of 300~km and even
more is feasible with entangled state sources placed in the middle between
Alice and Bob.
