In this paper the theory of 2-Variable Boolean Operation (2-VBO) has been
discussed on a pair of n-bit strings. 2-VBO serves to bring out the relation
between numbers which when plot on a 2-D surface form interesting patterns;
patterns that may be fixed, periodic, chaotic or complex. Some of these
patterns represent natural fractals. This paper also provides mathematical
analysis corresponding to each of the obtained patterns, which would aid to
understanding their formation. 2-VBO is an attempt towards the production and
classification of patterns which represent various mathematical models and
naturally occurring phenomena.
