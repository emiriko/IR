We present the first results on the black hole candidate XTE J1752-223 from
the Gas Slit Camera (GSC) on-board the Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image (MAXI) on
the International Space Station. Including the onset of the outburst reported
by the Proportional Counter Array on-board the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer on
2009 October 23, the MAXI/GSC has been monitoring this source approximately 10
times per day with a high sensitivity in the 2-20 keV band. XTE J1752-223 was
initially in the low/hard state during the first 3 months. An anti-correlated
behavior between the 2-4 keV and 4-20 keV bands were observed around January
20, 2010, indicating that the source exhibited the spectral transition to the
high/soft state. A transient radio jet may have been ejected when the source
was in the intermediate state where the spectrum was roughly explained by a
power-law with a photon index of 2.5-3.0. The unusually long period in the
initial low/hard state implies a slow variation in the mass accretion rate, and
the dramatic soft X-ray increase may be explained by a sudden appearance of the
accretion disk component with a relatively low innermost temperature (0.4-0.7
keV). Such a low temperature might suggest that the maximum accretion rate was
just above the critical gas evaporation rate required for the state transition.
