Cobalt silicide (CoSi2) islands have been formed by the deposition of thin
films (~0.1 to 0.3 nm) of cobalt on clean Si(111) and Si(100) substrates in
ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) followed by annealing to ~880 degrees C. Conducting
atomic force microscopy has been performed on these islands to characterize and
measure their current-voltage (I-V) characteristics. Current-voltage curves
were analyzed using thermionic emission theory to obtain the Schottky barrier
heights and ideality factors between the silicide islands and the silicon
substrates. Current-voltage measurements were performed ex situ for samples
("passivated surfaces") where the silicon surface surrounding the islands was
passivated with a native oxide. Other samples ("clean surfaces") remained in
UHV while I-V curves were recorded. By comparing barrier heights and ideality
factors for islands on both surfaces, the effects of the non-passivated
surfaces on conduction were studied. The clean surface barrier heights were
found to be ~0.2 to 0.3 eV below barrier heights measured from similar islands
on passivated surfaces. The reduced Schottky barrier is mainly attributed to
Fermi level pinning by non-passivated surface states of the clean silicon
surface. However, the measured barrier heights of the clean surface islands are
equivalent on both Si(111) and Si(100), suggesting that the non-passivated
surfaces are influenced by cobalt impurities. Furthermore, the barrier heights
of islands on the clean surfaces are lower than due to Fermi level pinning
alone and the additional barrier height lowering is primarily attributed to
spreading resistance effects. Schottky barrier inhomogeneity may also cause
additional barrier height lowering and non-ideality in the contacts. The clean
surface barrier heights decreased and the ideality factors increased with
decreasing temperature, which is attributed to the temperature variation of the
Fermi level.
