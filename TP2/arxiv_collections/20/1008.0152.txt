CASCADE is a full hadron level Monte Carlo event generator for ep, \gamma p
and p\bar{p} and pp processes, which uses the CCFM evolution equation for the
initial state cascade in a backward evolution approach supplemented with off -
shell matrix elements for the hard scattering. A detailed program description
is given, with emphasis on parameters the user wants to change and variables
which completely specify the generated events.
