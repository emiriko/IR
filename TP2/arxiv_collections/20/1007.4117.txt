The short distance behavior of baryon-baryon potentials defined through
Nambu-Bethe-Salpeter wave functions is investigated using the operator product
expansion. In a previous analysis of the nucleon-nucleon case, corresponding to
the SU(3) channels $27_s$ and $\overline{10}_a$, we argued that the potentials
have a repulsive core. A new feature occurs for the case of baryons made up of
three flavors: manifestly asymptotically attractive potentials appear in the
singlet and octet channels. Attraction in the singlet channel was first
indicated by quark model considerations, and recently been found in numerical
lattice simulations. The latter have however not yet revealed asymptotic
attraction in the octet channels; we give a speculative explanation for this
apparent discrepancy.
