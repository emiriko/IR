For many quantum information implementations with trapped ions, effective
shuttling operations are important. Here we discuss the efficient separation
and recombination of ions in surface ion trap geometries. The maximum speed of
separation and recombination of trapped ions for adiabatic shuttling operations
depends on the secular frequencies the trapped ion experiences in the process.
Higher secular frequencies during the transportation processes can be achieved
by optimising trap geometries. We show how two different arrangements of
segmented static potential electrodes in surface ion traps can be optimised for
fast ion separation or recombination processes. We also solve the equations of
motion for the ion dynamics during the separation process and illustrate
important considerations that need to be taken into account to make the process
adiabatic.
