Spatially resolved relaxation of non-equilibrium quasiparticles in a
superconductor at ultra-low temperatures was experimentally studied. It was
found that the quasiparticle injection through a tunnel junction results in
modification of the shape of I-V characteristic of a remote `detector'
junction. The effect depends on temperature, injection current and proximity to
the injector. The phenomena can be understood in terms of creation of
quasiparticle charge and energy disequilibrium characterized by two different
length scales $\Lambda_{Q^{\ast}}$ $\sim5$ $\mu$m and $\Lambda_{T^{\ast}}\sim$
$40$ $\mu$m. The findings are in good agreement with existing phenomenological
models, while more elaborated microscopic theory is mandatory for detailed
quantitative comparison with experiment. The results are of fundamental
importance for understanding electron transport phenomena in various
nanoelectronic circuits.
