Bellman's optimality principle has been of enormous importance in the
development of whole branches of applied mathematics, computer science, optimal
control theory, economics, decision making, and classical physics. Examples are
numerous: dynamic programming, Markov chains, stochastic dynamics, calculus of
variations, and the brachistochrone problem. Here we show that Bellman's
optimality principle is violated in a teleportation problem on a quantum
network. This implies that finding the optimal fidelity route for teleporting a
quantum state between two distant nodes on a quantum network with bi-partite
entanglement will be a tough problem and will require further investigation.
