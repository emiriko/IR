The energy and structure of planar Bloch domain walls with opposite
directions (right- and left-handed) and different paths of magnetization vector
rotation have been systemized. The theory covers arbitrary oriented plates of
cubic m3m symmetry magnetically ordered medium with negative anisotropy. The
general approach is created and applied to most plates typically used in the
experiments.
