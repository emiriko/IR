We provide generating functions for the perturbative massive string spectrum
which are covariant with respect to the SO(9) little group, and which contain
all the representation theoretic content of the spectrum. Generating functions
for perturbative bosonic, Type II, Heterotic and Type I string theories are
presented, and generalizations are discussed.
