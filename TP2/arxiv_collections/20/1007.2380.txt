In order to characterise non-equilibrium growth processes, we study the
behaviour of global quantities that depend in a non-trivial way on two
different times. We discuss the dynamical scaling forms of global correlation
and response functions and show that the scaling behaviour of the global
response can depend on how the system is perturbed. On the one hand we derive
exact expressions for systems characterised by linear Langevin equations (as
for example the Edwards-Wilkinson and the noisy Mullins-Herring equations), on
the other hand we discuss the influence of non-linearities on the scaling
behaviour of global quantities by integrating numerically the
Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation. We also discuss global fluctuation-dissipation
ratios and how to use them for the characterisation of non-equilibrium growth
processes.
