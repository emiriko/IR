We present experimental demonstration of phase conjugation using nonlinear
metamaterial elements. Active split-ring resonators loaded with varactor diodes
are demonstrated theoretically to act as phase-conjugating or time-reversing
discrete elements when parametrically pumped and illuminated with appropriate
frequencies. The metamaterial elements were fabricated and shown experimentally
to produce a time reversed signal. Measurements confirm that a discrete array
of phase-conjugating elements act as a negatively-refracting time reversal RF
lens only 0.12$\lambda$ thick.
