The statistical distribution of energies among particles responsible for long
Gamma Ray Burst (GRB) emission is analyzed in light of recent results of the
Fermi Observatory. The allsky flux, $F_{\gamma}$, recorded by the Gamma Ray
Burst Monitor (GBM) is shown, despite its larger energy range, to be not
significantly larger than that reported by the Burst and Transient Explorer
(BATSE), suggesting a relatively small flux in the 3 - 30 MeV energy range. The
present-day energy input rate in $\gamma$-rays recorded by the GBM from long
GRB is found, assuming star-formation rates in the literature, to be $\dot
W(0)=0.5 F_{\gamma} H/c = 5 \times 10^{42}\ \rm{erg/Mpc^3 yr}$. The Large Area
Telescope (LAT) fluence, when observed, is about 5-10\% per decade of the
total, in good agreement with the predictions of saturated, non-linear shock
acceleration.
  The high-energy component of long GRBs, as measured by Fermi, is found to
contain only $\sim 10^{-2.5}$ of the energy needed to produce ultrahigh-energy
cosmic rays (UHECR) above 4 Eev, assuming the latter to be extragalactic, when
various numerical factors are carefully included, if the cosmic ray source
spectrum has a spectral index of -2. The observed $\gamma$-ray fraction of the
required UHECR energy is even smaller if the source spectrum is softer than
$E^{-2}$.
  The AMANDA II limits rule out such a GRB origin for UHECR if much more than
$10^{-2}$ of the cosmic ray energy goes into neutrinos that are within, and
simultaneous with, the $\gamma$-ray beam.
  It is suggested that "orphan" neutrinos out of the $\gamma$-ray beam might be
identifiable via orphan afterglow { or other wide angle signatures of GRB in
lieu of coincidence with prompt $\gamma$-rays}, and it is recommended that
feasible single neutrino trigger criteria be established to search for such
coincidences.
