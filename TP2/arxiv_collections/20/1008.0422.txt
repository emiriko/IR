Massive SFR are characterized by intense ionizing fluxes, strong stellar
winds and supernovae explosions, all of which have important effects on the
surrounding media, on the star-formation (SF) process and on the evolution of
YSOs and their disks. We present a multiband study of the massive young cluster
NGC6611 and M16, to study how OB stars affect the early stellar evolution and
the SF. We search for evidence of triggered SF by OB stars in NGC6611 on a
large spatial scale (~10 pc) and how the efficiency of disks photoevaporation
depends on the central stars mass. We assemble a multiband catalog with
photometric data, from B band to 8.0micron, and X-ray data obtained with 2 new
and 1 archival ACIS-I observation. We select the stars with disks from IR
photometry and disk-less from X-ray emission, both in NGC6611 and the outer
region of M16. We study induced photoevaporation searching for the spatial
variation of disk frequency for distinct stellar mass ranges. The triggering of
SF by OB stars has been investigated by deriving the history of SF across the
nebula. We find evidence of sequential SF in the Eagle Nebula going from the SE
(2.6 Myrs) to the NW (0.3 Myrs), with the median age of ~1 Myear. We observe a
drop of the disk frequency close to OB stars (up to an average distance of 1
pc), without effects at larger distances. Furthermore, disks are more frequent
around low-mass stars (<1 M(solar)) than in high-mass stars, regardless of the
distance from OB stars. The SF chronology in M16 does not support the
hypothesis of a large-scale SF triggered by OB stars in NGC6611. Instead, we
speculate that it was triggered by the encounter (~3 Myrs ago) with a giant
molecular shell created ~6 Myrs ago.
