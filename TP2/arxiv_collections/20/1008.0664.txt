Quantum effects due to particle creation on a classical sudden singularity
have been investigated in a previous work. The conclusion was that quantum
effects do not lead to the avoidance nor the modification of the sudden future
singularity. In this paper, we investigate quantum corrections coming from
conformal anomaly near the sudden future singularity. We conclude that when the
equation of state is chosen to be $p=-\rho-A\rho^\alpha$, the conformal anomaly
can transform the sudden singularity in the singularity of type III for any
$\alpha> 1/2$ and in the singularity of the type I (the big rip) or the big
crunch for $1/2<\alpha<3/2$.
