We investigate the detection of entanglement in $n$-partite quantum states.
We obtain practical separability criteria to identify genuinely entangled and
non-separable mixed quantum states. No numerical optimization or eigenvalue
evaluation is needed, and our criteria can be evaluated by simple computations
involving components of the density matrix. We provide examples in which our
criteria perform better than all known separability criteria. Specifically, we
are able to detect genuine $n$-partite entanglement which has previously not
been identified. In addition, our criteria can be used in today's experiment.
