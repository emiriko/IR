Very little is known about magnetic fields of extrasolar planets and brown
dwarfs. We use the energy flux scaling law presented by Christensen et al.
(2009) to calculate the evolution of average magnetic fields in extrasolar
planets and brown dwarfs under the assumption of fast rotation, which is
probably the case for most of them. We find that massive brown dwarfs of about
70 M_Jup can have fields of a few kilo-Gauss during the first few hundred
Million years. These fields can grow by a factor of two before they weaken
after deuterium burning has stopped. Brown dwarfs with weak deuterium burning
and extrasolar giant planets start with magnetic fields between ~100G and ~1kG
at the age of a few Myr, depending on their mass. Their magnetic field weakens
steadily until after 10Gyr it has shrunk by about a factor of 10. We use
observed X-ray luminosities to estimate the age of the known extrasolar giant
planets that are more massive than 0.3M_Jup and closer than 20pc. Taking into
account the age estimate, and assuming sun-like wind-properties and radio
emission processes similar to those at Jupiter, we calculate their radio flux
and its frequency. The highest radio flux we predict comes out as 700mJy at a
frequency around 150MHz for $\tau$Boob, but the flux is below 60mJy for the
rest. Most planets are expected to emit radiation between a few Mhz and up to
100MHz, well above the ionospheric cutoff frequency.
