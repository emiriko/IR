We prove recursive formulas for the Taylor coefficients of cusp forms, such
as Ramanujan's Delta function, at points in the upper half-plane. This allows
us to show the non-vanishing of all Taylor coefficients of Delta at CM points
of small discriminant as well as the non-vanishing of certain Poincar\'e
series. At a "generic" point all Taylor coefficients are shown to be non-zero.
Some conjectures on the Taylor coefficients of Delta at CM points are stated.
