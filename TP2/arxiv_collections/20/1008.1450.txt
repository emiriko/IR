Modulated reheating scenario is one of the most attractive models that
predict possible detections of not only the primordial non-Gaussianity but also
the tensor fluctuation through future CMB observations such as the Planck
satellite, the PolarBeaR and the LiteBIRD satellite experiments. We study the
baryonic-isocurvature fluctuations in the Affleck-Dine baryogenesis with the
modulated reheating scenario. We show that the Affleck-Dine baryogenesis can be
consistent with the modulated reheating scenario with respect to the current
observational constraint on the baryonic-isocurvature fluctuations.
