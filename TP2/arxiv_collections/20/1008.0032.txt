A detailed knowledge of the gap structure for the Fe-pnictide superconductors
is still rather rudimentary, with several conflicting reports of either nodes,
deep gap minima, or fully isotropic gaps on the Fermi surface sheets, both in
the $k_{x}-k_{y}$ plane and along the c-axis. In this paper we present
considerations for electronic Raman scattering which can help clarify the gap
structure and topology using different light scattering geometries. Using
density functional calculations for the Raman vertices, it is shown that the
location of the gap minima may occur on loops stretching over a portion of the
c-axis in Ba(Fe$_{0.94}$Co$_{0.06})_{2}$As$_2$.
