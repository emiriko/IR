The exact relations for strongly interacting Fermi gasses, recently derived
by Tan, are shown to first order in the loop expansion to also apply to dilute
Bose gasses. A simple thermodynamic argument is put forward to support their
validity. As an application, the second-order correction to the depletion of
the condensate is determined to logarithmic accuracy.
