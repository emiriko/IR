We consider an ensemble of interacting charged particles on the line
consisting of two species of particles with charge ratio 2 : 1 in the presence
of the harmonic oscillator potential. The system is assumed to be at
temperature corresponding to \beta = 1 and the sum of the charges is fixed. We
investigate the distribution of the number as well as the spatial density of
each species of particle in the limit as the total charge increases to \infty.
These results will follow from the fact that the system of particles forms a
Pfaffian point process. We produce the skew-orthogonal polynomials necessary to
simplify the related matrix kernels.
