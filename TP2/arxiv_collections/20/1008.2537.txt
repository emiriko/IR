2 years worth of archival FERMI-LAT data was used to search for the gamma-ray
emission from the Andromeda galaxy. The data show no noticeable elliptical
image. Subsequent on-off source aperture photometry analysis using a CO image
template show a 7 sigma excess in the number of on-source apertures in
comparison to the off-source apertures, yielding a flux of (4.95+/-0.71)x10-8
photons cm-2 s-1 for E>100 MeV.
