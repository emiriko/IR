We propose a method for constructing Yukawa terms for noncommutative SO(10)
and E6 GUTs, when these GUTs are formulated within the enveloping-algebra
formalism. The most general noncommutative Yukawa term that we propose
contains, at first order in thetamunu, the most general BRS invariant Yukawa
contribution whose only dimensionful parameter is the noncommutativity
parameter. This noncommutative Yukawa interaction is thus renormalisable at
first order in thetamunu.
