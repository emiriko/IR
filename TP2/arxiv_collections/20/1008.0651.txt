We present a compilation of the geometry measures acquired using optical and
IR spectroscopy and optical spectropolarimetry to probe the explosion geometry
of Type Ia SNe. Polarization measurements are sensitive to asymmetries in the
plane of the sky, whereas line profiles in nebular phase spectra are expected
to trace asymmetries perpendicular to the plane of the sky. The combination of
these two measures can overcome their respective projection effects, completely
probing the 3D structures of these events. For 9 normal Type Ia SNe, we find
that the polarization of \ion{Si}{2} $\lambda 6355$ at 5 days before maximum
($p_{Si\,II}$) is well correlated with its velocity evolution ($\dot{\rm
v}_{Si\,II}$), implying $\dot{\rm v}_{Si\,II}$ is predominantly due to the
asymmetry of the SNe. We find only a weak correlation between the polarization
of \ion{Si}{2} and the reported velocities (${\rm v}_{neb}$) for peak emission
of optical \ion{Fe}{2} and \ion{Ni}{2} lines in nebular spectra. Our sample is
biased, with polarization measurements being only available for normal SNe
which subsequently exhibited positive (i.e. redshifted) ${\rm v}_{neb}$. In
unison these indicators are consistent with an off-centre delayed detonation,
in which the outer layers are dominated by a spherical oxygen layer, mixed with
an asymmetric distribution of intermediate mass elements. The combination of
spectroscopic and spectropolarimetric indicators suggests a single geometric
configuration for normal Type Ia SNe, with some of the diversity of observed
properties arising from orientation effects.
