The electrostatic interaction between metal spheres is an influential
component in the assembly of many nanoscale materials in chemistry. Here we
derive a method to calculate the energy and polarizations of metal spheres in
arbitrary configurations to an arbitrary multipole order. This helps provide
insight into the preferred configurations of charged metal particles and
demonstrates the sensitivity of electrostatic interactions to configuration
geometry.
