We propose a feasible scheme to cool down a mechanical resonator (MR) in a
three-mirror cavity optomechanical system with controllable external optical
drives. Under the Born-Oppenheimer (BO) approximation, the whole dynamics of
the mechanical resonator and cavities is reduced to that of a time-dependent
harmonic oscillator, whose effective frequency can be controlled through the
optical driving fields. The fast cooling of the MR can be realized by
controlling the amplitude of the optical drives. Significantly, we further show
that the ground-state cooling may be achieved via the three-mirror cavity
optomechanical system without the resolved sideband condition.
