We study the relative strength of classical and quantum correlations, as
measured by discord, for two-qubit states. Quantum correlations appear only in
the presence of classical correlations, while the reverse is not always true.
We identify the family of states that maximize the discord for a given value of
the classical correlations and show that the largest attainable discord for
mixed states is greater than for pure states. The difference between discord
and entanglement is emphasized by the remarkable fact that these states do not
maximize entanglement and are, in some cases, even separable. Finally, by
random generation of density matrices uniformly distributed over the whole
Hilbert space, we quantify the frequency of the appearance of quantum and
classical correlations for different ranks.
