We report on the development of an GRPCs (Glass Resistive Plate chambers)
Semi- Digital hadron calorimeter for the future International Linear Collider
(ILC).Two types of GRPCs (small and 1m2) were tested in PS beam at CERN.
Detector performances are presented here in terms of efficiency, pad
multiplicity, homogeneity and stability in time.
