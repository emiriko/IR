A generalized version of the valence-bond Monte Carlo method is used to study
ground state properties of the 1+1 dimensional quantum $Q$-state Potts models.
For appropriate values of $Q$ these models can be used to describe interacting
chains of non-Abelian anyons --- quasiparticle excitations of certain exotic
fractional quantum Hall states.
