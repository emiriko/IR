We define Frobenius incidence varieties by means of the incidence relation of
Frobenius images of linear subspaces in a fixed vector space over a finite
field, and investigate their properties such as supersingularity, Betti numbers
and unirationality. These varieties are variants of the Deligne-Lusztig
varieties. We then study the lattices associated with algebraic cycles on them.
We obtain a positive-definite lattice of rank 84 that yields a dense sphere
packing from a 4-dimensional Frobenius incidence variety in characteristic 2.
