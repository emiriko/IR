We make a detailed assessment of which form of the dipole operator to use in
calculating high order harmonic generation within the framework of the strong
field approximation, and look specifically at the role the form plays in the
inclusion of multielectron effects perturbatively with regard to the
contributions of the highest occupied molecular orbital. We focus on how these
corrections affect the high-order harmonic spectra from aligned homonuclear and
heteronuclear molecules, exemplified by $\mathrm{N}_2$ and CO, respectively,
which are isoelectronic. We find that the velocity form incorrectly finds zero
static dipole moment in heteronuclear molecules. In contrast, the length form
of the dipole operator leads to the physically expected non-vanishing
expectation value for the dipole operator in this case. Furthermore, the so
called "overlap" integrals, in which the dipole matrix element is computed
using wavefunctions at different centers in the molecule, are prominent in the
first-order multielectron corrections for the velocity form, and should not be
ignored. Finally, inclusion of the multielectron corrections has very little
effect on the spectrum. This suggests that relaxation, excitation and the
dynamic motion of the core are important in order to describe multielectron
effects in molecular high-order high harmonic generation.
