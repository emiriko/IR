Stochastic Einstein equations are considered when 3D space metric
$\gamma_{ij}$ are stochastic functions. The probability density for the
stochastic quantities is connected with the Perelman's entropy functional. As
an example, the Friedman Universe is considered. It is shown that for the
Friedman Universe the dynamical evolution is not changed. The connection
between general relativity and Ricci flows is discussed.
