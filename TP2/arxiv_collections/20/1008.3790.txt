Although the influence of magnetic fields is regarded as vital in the star
formation process, only a few magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations have been
performed on this subject within the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH)
method. This is largely due to the unsatisfactory treatment of non-vanishing
divergence of the magnetic field. Recently smoothed particle
magnetohydrodynamics (SPMHD) simulations based on Euler potentials have proven
to be successful in treating MHD collapse and fragmentation problems, however
these methods are known to have some intrinsical difficulties. We have
performed SPMHD simulations based on a traditional approach evolving the
magnetic field itself using the induction equation. To account for the
numerical divergence, we have chosen an approach that subtracts the effects of
numerical divergence from the force equation, and additionally we employ
artificial magnetic dissipation as a regularization scheme. We apply this
realization of SPMHD to a widely known setup, a variation of the 'Boss &
Bodenheimer standard isothermal test case', to study the impact of the magnetic
fields on collapse and fragmentation. In our simulations, we concentrate on
setups, where the initial magnetic field is parallel to the rotation axis. We
examine different field strengths and compare our results to other findings
reported in the literature. We are able to confirm specific results found
elsewhere, namely the delayed onset of star formation for strong fields,
accompanied by the tendency to form only single stars. We also find that the
'magnetic cushioning effect', where the magnetic field is wound up to form a
'cushion' between the binary, aids binary fragmentation in a case, where
previously only formation of a single protostar was expected.
