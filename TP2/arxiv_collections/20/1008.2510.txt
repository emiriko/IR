It is shown that having degenerate ground states over the domain of the
wavefunction of a system is a sufficient condition for a quantum system to act
as a measuring apparatus for the system. Measurements are then instances of
spontaneous symmetry breaking to one of these ground states, induced by
environmental perturbations. Together with non-Boolean holism this constitutes
an optimal formulation of quantum mechanics that does not imply non-locality.
