We show that in a sufficiently strong magnetic field the QCD vacuum may
undergo a transition to a new phase where charged $\rho^\pm$ mesons are
condensed. In this phase the vacuum behaves as an anisotropic inhomogeneous
superconductor which supports superconductivity along the axis of the magnetic
field. In the directions transverse to the magnetic field the superconductivity
is absent. The magnetic-field-induced anisotropic superconductivity -- which is
realized in the cold vacuum, i.e. at zero temperature and density -- is a
consequence of a nonminimal coupling of the $\rho$ mesons to the
electromagnetic field. The onset of the superconductivity of the charged
$\rho^\pm$ mesons should also induce an inhomogeneous superfluidity of the
neutral $\rho^0$ mesons. We also argue that due to simple kinematical reasons a
strong enough magnetic field makes the lifetime of the $\rho$ mesons longer by
closing the main channels of the strong decays of the $\rho$ mesons into
charged pions.
