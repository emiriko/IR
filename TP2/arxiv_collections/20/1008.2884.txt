We report on the comparison between three absolute gravimeters that took
place in April 2010 at Laboratoire National de M\'etrologie et d'Essais. The
three instruments (FG5#209 from METAS, Switzerland, IMGC-02 from INRIM, Italy,
and CAG from LNE-SYRTE, France) rely on different methods: optical and atomic
interferometry. We discuss their differences as well as their similarities. We
compare their measurements of the gravitational acceleration in 4 points of the
same pillar, in the perspective of an absolute determination of g for a watt
balance experiment
