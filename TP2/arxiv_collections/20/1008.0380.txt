Higher dimensional theories which address some of the problematic issues of
the Standard Model(SM) naturally involve some form of $D=4+n$-dimensional
Lorentz invariance violation (LIV). In such models the fundamental physics
which leads to, e.g., field localization, orbifolding, the existence of brane
terms and the compactification process all can introduce LIV in the higher
dimensional theory while still preserving 4-d Lorentz invariance. In this
paper, attempting to capture some of this physics, we extend our previous
analysis of LIV in 5-d UED-type models to those with 5-d warped extra
dimensions. To be specific, we employ the 5-d analog of the SM Extension of
Kostelecky et. al. ~which incorporates a complete set of operators arising from
spontaneous LIV. We show that while the response of the bulk scalar, fermion
and gauge fields to the addition of LIV operators in warped models is
qualitatively similar to what happens in the flat 5-d UED case, the gravity
sector of these models reacts very differently than in flat space.
Specifically, we show that LIV in this warped case leads to a non-zero bulk
mass for the 5-d graviton and so the would-be zero mode, which we identify as
the usual 4-d graviton, must necessarily become massive. The origin of this
mass term is the simultaneous existence of the constant non-zero $AdS_5$
curvature and the loss of general co-ordinate invariance via LIV in the 5-d
theory. Thus warped 5-d models with LIV in the gravity sector are not
phenomenologically viable.
