Light curves from the Kepler Mission contain valuable information on the
nature of the phenomena producing the transit-like signals. To assist in
exploring the possibility that they are due to an astrophysical false positive,
we describe a procedure (BLENDER) to model the photometry in terms of a "blend"
rather than a planet orbiting a star. A blend may consist of a background or
foreground eclipsing binary (or star-planet pair) whose eclipses are attenuated
by the light of the candidate and possibly other stars within the photometric
aperture. We apply BLENDER to the case of Kepler-9, a target harboring two
previously confirmed Saturn-size planets (Kepler-9b and Kepler-9c) showing
transit timing variations, and an additional shallower signal with a 1.59-day
period suggesting the presence of a super-Earth-size planet. Using BLENDER
together with constraints from other follow-up observations we are able to rule
out all blends for the two deeper signals, and provide independent validation
of their planetary nature. For the shallower signal we rule out a large
fraction of the false positives that might mimic the transits. The false alarm
rate for remaining blends depends in part (and inversely) on the unknown
frequency of small-size planets. Based on several realistic estimates of this
frequency we conclude with very high confidence that this small signal is due
to a super-Earth-size planet (Kepler-9d) in a multiple system, rather than a
false positive. The radius is determined to be 1.64 (+0.19/-0.14) R(Earth), and
current spectroscopic observations are as yet insufficient to establish its
mass.
