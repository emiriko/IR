A TPM (trusted platform module) is a chip present mostly on newer
motherboards, and its primary function is to create, store and work with
cryptographic keys. This dedicated chip can serve to authenticate other devices
or to protect encryption keys used by various software applications. Among
other features, it comes with a True Random Number Generator (TRNG) that can be
used for cryptographic purposes. This random number generator consists of a
state machine that mixes unpredictable data with the output of a one way hash
function. According the specification it can be a good source of unpredictable
random numbers even without having to require a genuine source of hardware
entropy. However the specification recommends collecting entropy from any
internal sources available such as clock jitter or thermal noise in the chip
itself, a feature that was implemented by most manufacturers. This paper will
benchmark the random number generator of several TPM chips from two
perspectives: the quality of the random bit sequences generated, as well as the
output bit rate.
