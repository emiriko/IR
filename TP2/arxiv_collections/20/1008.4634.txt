The gravitational attraction of the Galactic centre leads to the centrifugal
acceleration of the Solar system barycentre. It results in secular aberration
drift which displaces the position of the distant radio sources. The effect
should be accounted for in high-precision astrometric reductions as well as by
the corresponding update of the ICRS definition.
