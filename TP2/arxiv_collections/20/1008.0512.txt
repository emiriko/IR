In Part I of this series we presented the general ideas of applying
group-algebraic methods for describing quantum systems. The treatment was there
very "ascetic" in that only the structure of a locally compact topological
group was used. Below we explicitly make use of the Lie group structure. Basing
on differential geometry enables one to introduce explicitly representation of
important physical quantities and formulate the general ideas of quasiclassical
representation and classical analogy.
