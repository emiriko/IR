The unified generalized non-local quantum kinetic and hydrodynamic theory is
applied for mathematical modeling of objects in the giant scale diapason from
the galaxy and Universe scale to atom structures. The principle of universal
antigravitation is considered from positions of the Newtonian theory of
gravitation and non-local kinetic theory. It is found that explanation of
Hubble effect in the Universe and peculiar features of the rotational speeds of
galaxies need not in introduction of new essence like dark matter and dark
energy. The origin of difficulties consists in total Oversimplification
following from principles of local physics and reflects the general
shortcomings of the local kinetic transport theory.
