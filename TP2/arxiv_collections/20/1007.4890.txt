As energy proportional computing gradually extends the success of DVFS
(Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling) to the entire system, DVFS control
algorithms will play a key role in reducing server clusters' power consumption.
The focus of this paper is to provide accurate cluster-level DVFS control for
power saving in a server cluster. To achieve this goal, we propose a request
tracing approach that online classifies the major causal path patterns of a
multi-tier service and monitors their performance data as a guide for accurate
DVFS control. The request tracing approach significantly decreases the time
cost of performance profiling experiments that aim to establish the empirical
performance model. Moreover, it decreases the controller complexity so that we
can introduce a much simpler feedback controller, which only relies on the
single-node DVFS modulation at a time as opposed to varying multiple CPU
frequencies simultaneously. Based on the request tracing approach, we present a
hybrid DVFS control system that combines an empirical performance model for
fast modulation at different load levels and a simpler feedback controller for
adaption. We implement a prototype of the proposed system, called PowerTracer,
and conduct extensive experiments on a 3-tier platform. Our experimental
results show that PowerTracer outperforms its peer in terms of power saving and
system performance.
