Gilbert Strang posited that a permutation matrix of bandwidth $w$ can be
written as a product of $N < 2w$ permutation matrices of bandwidth 1. A proof
employing a greedy ``parallel bubblesort'' algorithm on the rows of the
permutation matrix is detailed and further points of interest are elaborated.
