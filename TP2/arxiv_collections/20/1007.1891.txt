We describe how to compute numerically in the complex plain a set of
Generalized Harmonic Polylogarithms (GHPLs) with square roots in the weights,
using the C++/GiNaC numerical routines of Vollinga and Weinzierl. As an
example, we provide the numerical values of the NLO electroweak light-fermion
corrections to the Higgs boson production in gluon fusion in the case of
complex W and Z masses.
