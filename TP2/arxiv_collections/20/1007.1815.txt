We find locally free resolutions of length one for all semi-stable sheaves
supported on curves of multiplicity five in the complex projective plane. In
some cases we also find geometric descriptions of these sheaves by means of
extensions. We give natural stratifications for their moduli spaces and we
describe the strata as certain quotients modulo linear algebraic groups. In
most cases we give concrete descriptions of these quotients as fibre bundles.
