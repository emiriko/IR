We present observations of seven transits and seven eclipses of the
transiting planet system HD 189733 taken with Spitzer IRAC at 8 microns. We use
a new correction for the detector ramp variation with a double-exponential
function. Our main findings are: (1) an upper limit on the variability of the
day-side planet flux of 2.7% (68% confidence); (2) the most precise set of
transit times measured for a transiting planet, with an average accuracy of 3
seconds; (3) a lack of transit-timing variations, excluding the presence of
second planets in this system above 20% of the mass of Mars in low-order
mean-motion resonance at 95% confidence; (4) a confirmation of the planet's
phase variation, finding the night side is 64% as bright as the day side, as
well as an upper limit on the night-side variability of 17% (68% confidence);
(5) a better correction for stellar variability at 8 micron causing the phase
function to peak 3.5 hrs before secondary eclipse, confirming that the
advection and radiation timescales are comparable at the 8 micron photosphere;
(6) variation in the depth of transit, which possibly implies variations in the
surface brightness of the portion of the star occulted by the planet, posing a
fundamental limit on non-simultaneous multi-wavelength transit absorption
measurements of planet atmospheres; (7) a measurement of the infrared
limb-darkening of the star, in agreement with stellar atmosphere models; (8) an
offset in the times of secondary eclipse of 69 sec, which is mostly accounted
for by a 31 sec light travel time delay and 33 sec delay due to the shift of
ingress and egress by the planet hot spot; this confirms that the phase
variation is due to an offset hot spot on the planet; (9) a retraction of the
claimed eccentricity of this system due to the offset of secondary eclipse; and
(10) high precision measurements of the parameters of this system.
