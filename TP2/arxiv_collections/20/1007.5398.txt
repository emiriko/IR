We study quantum transport and scattering of massless Dirac fermions by
spatially localized static magnetic fields. The employed model describes in a
unified manner the effects of orbital magnetic fields, Zeeman and exchange
fields in topological insulators, and the pseudo-magnetic fields caused by
strain or defects in monolayer graphene. The general scattering theory is
formulated, and for radially symmetric fields, the scattering amplitude and the
total and transport cross sections are expressed in terms of phase shifts. As
applications, we study ring-shaped magnetic fields (including the Aharanov-Bohm
geometry) and scattering by magnetic dipoles.
