"Magnetic ferroelectric" has been found in a wide range of spiral magnets.
However, these materials all suffer from low critical temperatures, which are
usually below 40 K, due to strong spin frustration. Recently, CuO has been
found to be multiferroic at much higher ordering temperature ($\sim$ 230K). To
clarify the origin of the high ordering temperature in CuO, we investigate the
structural, electronic and magnetic properties of CuO via first-principles
methods. We find that CuO has very special nearly commensurate spiral magnetic
structure, which is stabilized via the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. The
spin frustration in CuO is relatively weak, which is one of the main reasons
that the compound have high ordering temperature. We propose that high $T_c$
magnetic ferroelectric materials can be found in double sublattices of magnetic
structures similar to that of CuO.
