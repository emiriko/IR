We demonstrate, through simulation, that a simple centre surround receptive
field of vision is capable of exhibiting stochastic resonance. We also show
that this could be used to model the nature of contrast sensitivity enhancement
of human vision, through stochastic resonance, observed in psychophysical
experiments.
