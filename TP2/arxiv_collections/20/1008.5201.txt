In this work, based on the assumption of two-quark structure of the scalars,
the charmless hadronic $B_c \to SP, SV$ decays(here, $S$, $P$, and $V$ denote
the light scalar, pseudoscalar, and vector mesons, respectively) are
investigated by employing the perturbative QCD(pQCD) factorization
approach.From our numerical evaluations and phenomenological analysis, we find
that (a) the pQCD predictions for the {\it CP}-averaged branching ratios(BRs)
of the considered $B_c$ decays vary in the range of $10^{-5}$ to $10^{-8}$,
which will be tested in the ongoing LHCb and forthcoming Super-B experiments,
while the {\it CP}-violating asymmetries for these modes are absent naturally
in the standard model because only one type tree operator is involved; %% (b)
analogous to $B \to K^* \eta^{(\prime)}$ decays, $Br(B_c \to \kappa^+ \eta)
\sim 5 \times Br(B_c \to \kappa^+ \eta^\prime)$ in the pQCD approach, which can
be understood by the constructive and destructive interference between the
$\eta_q$ and $\eta_s$ contributions to the $B_c \to \kappa^+ \eta$ and $B_c \to
\kappa^+ \eta^\prime$ decays, however, $Br(B_c \to K_0^*(1430) \eta)$ is
approximately equal to $Br(B_c \to K_0^*(1430) \eta')$ in both scenarios
because the factorizable contributions from $\eta_s$ term play the dominant
role in the considered two channels; %% (c) if $a_0(980)$ and $\kappa$ are the
$q\bar q$ bound states, the pQCD predicted BRs for $B_c \to a_0(980) (\pi,
\rho)$ and $B_c \to \kappa K^{(*)}$ decays will be in the range of $10^{-6}
\sim 10^{-5}$, which are within the reach of the LHCb experiments and could be
measured in the near future; and %% (d) for the $a_0(1450)$ and $K_0^*(1430)$
channels, the BRs for $B_c \to a_0(1450) (\pi, \rho)$ and $B_c \to K_0^*(1430)
K^{(*)}$ modes in the pQCD approach are found to be $(5 \sim 47) \times
10^{-6}$ and $(0.7 \sim 36) \times 10^{-6}$, respectively.
