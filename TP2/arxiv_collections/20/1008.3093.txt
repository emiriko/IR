Kasraoui, Stanton and Zeng, and Kim, Stanton and Zeng introduced certain
$q$-analogues of Laguerre and Charlier polynomials. The moments of these
orthogonal polynomials have combinatorial models in terms of crossings in
permutations and set partitions. The aim of this article is to prove simple
formulas for the moments of the $q$-Laguerre and the $q$-Charlier polynomials,
in the style of the Touchard-Riordan formula (which gives the moments of some
$q$-Hermite polynomials, and also the distribution of crossings in matchings).
Our method mainly consists in the enumeration of weighted Motzkin paths, which
are naturally associated with the moments. Some steps are bijective, in
particular we describe a decomposition of paths which generalises a previous
construction of Penaud for the case of the Touchard-Riordan formula. There are
also some non-bijective steps using basic hypergeometric series, and continued
fractions or, alternatively, functional equations.
