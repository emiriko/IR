We present a search for the standard model Higgs boson produced in
association with a Z boson in 4.2 fb^-1 of p-pbar collisions, collected with
the D0 detector at the Fermilab Tevatron at sqrt(s) = 1.96 TeV. Selected events
contain one reconstructed Z to llbb candidate and at least two jets, including
at least one b-tagged jet. In the absence of an excess over the background
expected from other standard model processes, limits on the ZH cross section
multiplied by the branching ratios are set. The limit at M_H = 115 GeV is a
factor of 5.9 larger than the standard model prediction.
