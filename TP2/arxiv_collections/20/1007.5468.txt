We report direct measurements of the potential barriers and electronic
coupling between nanowire segments within a sketch-based oxide nanotransistor
(SketchFET) device. Near room temperature, switching is governed by thermally
activation across a potential barrier controlled by the nanowire gate. Below
T=150 K, a crossover to quantum field emission is observed that is sensitive to
structural phase transitions in the SrTiO3 layer. This direct measurement of
the source-drain and gate-drain energy barriers is crucial for the development
of room-temperature logic and memory elements and low-temperature quantum
devices.
