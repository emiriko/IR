Theoretical studies in gravitational wave astronomy often require the
calculation of Fisher Information Matrices and Likelihood functions, which in a
direct approach entail the costly step of computing gravitational waveforms.
Here I describe an alternative technique that sidesteps the need to compute
full waveforms, resulting in significant computational savings. I describe how
related techniques can be used to speed up Bayesian inference applied to real
gravitational wave data.
