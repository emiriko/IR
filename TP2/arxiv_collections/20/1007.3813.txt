Our investigations on porous Si show that on increase of pressure it
undergoes crystalline phase transitions instead of pressure induced
amorphization - claimed earlier, and the amorphous phase appears only on
release of pressure. This amorphous phase, when subjected to higher pressures,
transforms reversibly to a higher coordinated primitive hexagonal phase showing
a kind of memory effect which may be the only example of its kind in the
elemental solids. First principles calculations and thermodynamic arguments
help understand these observations.
