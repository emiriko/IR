Flavour changing neutral currents are absent at tree level in the Standard
Model (SM) and are highly suppressed at higher orders due the
Glashow-Iliopoulos-Maiani mechanism. Hence, any evidence of such currents
related to the top quark will definitely signal new physics beyond the SM. In
this work we will discuss how an electron-positron collider can contribute to
the field after the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has collected at least 100
fb^{-1} of integrated luminosity operating at sqrt{s} = 14 TeV.
