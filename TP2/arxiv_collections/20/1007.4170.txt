The stochastic dynamics of heavy quarks in the fireball produced in heavy-ion
collisions is followed through numerical simulations based on the Langevin
equation. The modification of the final p_T spectra (R_AA) of c and b quarks,
hadrons and single-electrons with respect to pp collisions is studied. The
transport coefficients are evaluated treating separately the contribution of
soft and hard collisions. The initial heavy-quark spectra are generated
according to NLO-pQCD, accounting for nuclear effects through recent nPDFs. The
evolution of the medium is obtained from the output of two hydro-codes (ideal
and viscous). The heavy-quark fragmentation into hadrons and their final
semileptonic decays are implemented according to up to date experimental data.
A comparison with RHIC data for non-photonic electron spectra is given.
