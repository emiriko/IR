Quantum-mechanical principles can be used to process information (QIP). In
one approach, linear arrays of trapped, laser cooled ion qubits (two-level
quantum systems) are confined in segmented multi-zone electrode structures. The
ion trap approach to QIP requires trapping and control of numerous ions in
electrode structures with many trapping zones. I investigated microfabrication
of structures to trap, transport and couple large numbers of ions. Using 24Mg+
I demonstrated loading and transport between zones in microtraps made of boron
doped silicon. This thesis describes the fundamentals of ion trapping, the
characteristics of silicon-based traps amenable to QIP work and apparatus to
trap ions and characterize traps. Microfabrication instructions appropriate for
nonexperts are included. Ion motional heating was measured. <<>> Using MEMs
techniques I built a Si micro-mechanical oscillator and demonstrated a method
to reduce the kinetic energy of its lowest order mechanical mode via capacitive
coupling to a driven radio frequency (RF) oscillator. Cooling resulted from a
RF capacitive force, phase shifted relative to the cantilever motion. The
technique was demonstrated by cooling the 7 kHz fundamental mode from room
temperature to 45 K. <<>> I also discuss an implementation of the semiclassical
quantum Fourier transform (QFT) using three beryllium ion qubits. The QFT is a
crucial step in a number of quantum algorithms including Shor's algorithm, a
quantum approach to integer factorization which is exponentially faster than
the fastest known classical factoring algorithm. This demonstration
incorporated the key elements of a scalable ion-trap architecture for QIP.
