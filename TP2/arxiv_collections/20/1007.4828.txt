We introduce moduli spaces of quasi-admissible hyperelliptic covers with at
worst A and D singularities. The stability conditions for these moduli spaces
depend on two parameters describing allowable singularities. By varying these
parameters, we interpolate between the stacks of stable limits of A and D
singularities and the quotients of the versal deformation spaces of A and D
singularities by a natural $\mathbb{G}_m$ action.
