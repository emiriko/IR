The behavior of persistent current in a mesoscopic cylinder threaded by an
Aharonov-Bohm flux $\phi$ is carefully investigated within a Hartree-Fock mean
field approach. We examine the combined effect of second-neighbor hopping
integral and Hubbard correlation on the enhancement of persistent current in
presence of disorder. A significant change in current amplitude is observed
compared to the traditional nearest-neighbor hopping model and the current
amplitude becomes quite comparable to experimental realizations. Our analysis
is found to exhibit several interesting results which have so far remained
unaddressed.
