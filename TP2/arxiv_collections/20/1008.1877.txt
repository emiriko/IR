Consistent supercurrent multiplets are naturally associated with linearized
off-shell supergravity models. In arXiv:1002.4932 we presented the hierarchy of
such supercurrents which correspond to all the models for linearized 4D N = 1
supergravity classified a few years ago. Here we analyze the correspondence
between the most general supercurrent given in arXiv:1002.4932 and the one
obtained eight years ago in hep-th/0110131 using the superfield Noether
procedure. We apply the Noether procedure to the general N = 1 supersymmetric
nonlinear sigma-model and show that it naturally leads to the so-called
S-multiplet, revitalized in arXiv:1002.2228.
