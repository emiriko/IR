We consider a quantum memory scheme based on the conversion of a signal pulse
into a long-lived spin coherence via stimulated off-resonant Raman process. For
a storing medium consisting of alkali atoms, we have calculated the
Autler-Townes resonance structure created by a strong control field. By taking
into account the upper hyperfine states of the D1 optical transition, we show
important deviations from the predictions of the usual three-level
Lambda-scheme approximation and we demonstrate an enhancement of the process
for particular detunings of the control. We estimate the memory efficiency one
can obtain using this configuration.
