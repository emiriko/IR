Perturbative unitarization from non-linear effects is thought to deplete the
gluon density for transverse momenta below the saturation scale. Such effects
also modify the distribution of gluons produced in heavy-ion collisions in
transverse impact parameter space. I discuss some of the consequences for the
initial conditions for hydrodynamic models of heavy-ion collisions and for hard
``tomographic'' probes. Also, I stress the importance of realistic modelling of
the fluctuations of the valence sources for the small-x fields in the impact
parameter plane. Such models can now be combined with solutions of
running-coupling Balitsky-Kovchegov evolution to obtain controlled predictions
for initial conditions at the LHC.
