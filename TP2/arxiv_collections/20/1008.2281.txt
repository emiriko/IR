The recent theory developments and latest experimental results on
heavy-flavour production in Deep Inelastic Scattering and at hadron colliders
are summarized. Models of heavy quarkonia production, non-perturbative
corrections to fragmentation, theory of heavy-hadron production in heavy-ion
collisions, and interpretation of new exotic hadrons are discussed. Progress in
event generators development is reported. Most recent experimental results from
HERA and e+e- colliders as well as from proton-(anti)proton and heavy ion
experiments are presented and the role of charm and beauty quarks in the
analyses of the proton structure is stressed.
