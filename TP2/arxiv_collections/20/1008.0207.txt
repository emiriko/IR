The WITCH experiment (Weak Interaction Trap for CHarged particles) will
search for exotic interactions by investigating the beta-neutrino angular
correlation via the measurement of the recoil energy spectrum after beta decay.
As a first step the recoil ions from the beta-minus decay of 124In stored in a
Penning trap have been detected. The evidence for the detection of recoil ions
is shown and the properties of the ion cloud that forms the radioactive source
for the experiment in the Penning trap are presented.
