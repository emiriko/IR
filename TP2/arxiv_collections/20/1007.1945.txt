Charm production in deep inelastic scattering has been measured with the ZEUS
detector at HERA using an integrated luminosity of 120 pb^{-1}. The hadronic
decay channels D^{+} -> K^{0}_{S} pi^{+}, Lambda_{c}^{+} -> p K^{0}_{S} and
Lambda_{c}^{+} -> Lambda pi^{+}, and their charge conjugates, were
reconstructed. The presence of a neutral strange hadron in the final state
reduces the combinatorial background and extends the measured sensitivity into
the low transverse momentum region. The kinematic range is 0 < p_{T}(D^{+},
Lambda_{c}^{+}) < 10 GeV, |eta(D^{+}, Lambda_{c}^{+})| < 1.6, 1.5 < Q^{2} <
1000 GeV^{2} and 0.02 < y < 0.7. Inclusive and differential cross sections for
the production of D^{+} mesons are compared to next-to-leading-order QCD
predictions. The fraction of c quarks hadronising into Lambda_{c}^{+} baryons
is extracted.
