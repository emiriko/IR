In this report we study the problem of minimising deterministic automata over
finite and infinite words. Deterministic finite automata are the simplest
devices to recognise regular languages, and deterministic Buchi, Co-Buchi, and
parity automata play a similar role in the recognition of \omega-regular
languages. While it is well known that the minimisation of deterministic finite
and weak automata is cheap, the complexity of minimising deterministic Buchi
and parity automata has remained an open challenge. We establish the
NP-completeness of these problems. A second contribution of this report is the
introduction of relaxed minimisation of deterministic finite automata. Like
hyper-minimisation, relaxed minimisation allows for some changes in the
language of the automaton: We seek a smallest automaton that, when used as a
monitor, provides a wrong answer only a bounded number of times in any run of a
system. We argue that minimisation of finite automata, hyper-minimisation,
relaxed minimisation, and the minimisation of deterministic Buchi (or Co-Buchi)
automata are operations of increasing reduction power, as the respective
equivalence relations on automata become coarser from left to right. When we
allow for minor changes in the language, relaxed minimisation can therefore be
considered as a more powerful minimisation technique than hyper-minimisation
from the perspective of finite automata. From the perspective of Buchi and
Co-Buchi automata, we gain a cheap algorithm for state-space reduction that
also turns out to be beneficial for further heuristic or exhaustive state-space
reductions put on top of it.
