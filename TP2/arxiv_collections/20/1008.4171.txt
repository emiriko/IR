The Selex experiment measured several billion charged hadron tracks with a
high precision magnetic momentum spectrometer and high precision RICH velocity
spectrometer. We have analyzed these data to simultaneously measure the masses
of all the long lived charged hadrons and anti-hadrons from the pi to the Omega
using the same detector and technique. The statistical precision achievable
with this data sample is more than adequate for 0.1% mass measurements
  We have used these measurements to develop and understand the systematic
effects of a RICH as a precision velocity spectrometer with the goal of
measuring 10 masses with precision ranging from 100 KeV for the lightest to
1000 KeV for the heaviest. This requires controlling the radius measurement of
RICH rings to the ~10^{-4} level. Progress in the mass measurements and the
required RICH analysis techniques developed are discussed.
