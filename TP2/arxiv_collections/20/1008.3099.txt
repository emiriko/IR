Given two positive integers $n$ and $k$ and a parameter $t\in (0,1)$, we
choose at random a vector subspace $V_{n}\subset
\mathbb{C}^{k}\otimes\mathbb{C}^{n}$ of dimension $N\sim tnk$. We show that the
set of $k$-tuples of singular values of all unit vectors in $V_n$ fills
asymptotically (as $n$ tends to infinity) a deterministic convex set $K_{k,t}$
that we describe using a new norm in $\R^k$.
  Our proof relies on free probability, random matrix theory, complex analysis
and matrix analysis techniques. The main result result comes together with a
law of large numbers for the singular value decomposition of the eigenvectors
corresponding to large eigenvalues of a random truncation of a matrix with high
eigenvalue degeneracy.
