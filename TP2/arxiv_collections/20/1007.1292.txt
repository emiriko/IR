A $d$-angulation is a planar map with faces of degree $d$. We present for
each integer $d\geq 3$ a bijection between the class of $d$-angulations of
girth $d$ (i.e., with no cycle of length less than $d$) and a class of
decorated plane trees. Each of the bijections is obtained by specializing a
"master bijection" which extends an earlier construction of the first author.
Our construction unifies known bijections by Fusy, Poulalhon and Schaeffer for
triangulations ($d=3$) and by Schaeffer for quadrangulations ($d=4$). For
$d\geq 5$, both the bijections and the enumerative results are new. We also
extend our bijections so as to enumerate \emph{$p$-gonal $d$-angulations}
($d$-angulations with a simple boundary of length $p$) of girth $d$. We thereby
recover bijectively the results of Brown for simple $p$-gonal triangulations
and simple $2p$-gonal quadrangulations and establish new results for $d\geq 5$.
A key ingredient in our proofs is a class of orientations characterizing
$d$-angulations of girth $d$. Earlier results by Schnyder and by De Fraysseix
and Ossona de Mendez showed that simple triangulations and simple
quadrangulations are characterized by the existence of orientations having
respectively indegree 3 and 2 at each inner vertex. We extend this
characterization by showing that a $d$-angulation has girth $d$ if and only if
the graph obtained by duplicating each edge $d-2$ times admits an orientation
having indegree $d$ at each inner vertex.
