In this paper, we calculate the branching ratios for $B^+\to D_s^+\eta,
B^+\to D_s^+\eta^{\prime}$, $B^+\to D_s^{*+}\eta$ and $ B^+\to
D_s^{*+}\eta^{\prime}$ decays by employing the perturbative QCD (pQCD)
factorization approach. Under the two kinds of $\eta-\eta^{\prime}$ mixing
schemes, the quark-flavor mixing scheme and the singlet-octet mixing scheme, we
find that the calculated branching ratios are consistent with the currently
available experimental upper limits. We also considered the so called
"$f_{D_s}$ puzzle", by using two groups of parameters about the $D^{(*)}_s$
meson decay constants, that is $f_{D_s}=241$ MeV, $f_{D^*_s}=272$ MeV and
$f_{D_s}=274$ MeV, $f_{D^*_s}=312$ MeV, to calculate the branching ratios for
the considered decays. We find that the results change $30\%$ by using these
two different groups of paramters.
