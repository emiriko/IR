In this paper, we present a class of rotating solutions in Gauss--Bonnet
gravity in the presence of cosmological constant and conformally invariant
Maxwell field and study the effects of the nonlinearity of the Maxwell source
on the properties of the spacetimes. These solutions may be interpret as black
brane solutions with inner and outer event horizons provide that the mass
parameter $m$ is greater than an extremal value $m_{ext}$, an extreme black
brane if $m=m_{ext}$ and a naked singularity otherwise. We investigate the
conserved and thermodynamics quantities for asymptotically flat and
asymptotically $AdS$ with flat horizon. We also show that the conserved and
thermodynamic quantities of these solutions satisfy the first law of
thermodynamics.
