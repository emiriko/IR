Feature based steganalysis, an emerging branch in information forensics, aims
at identifying the presence of a covert communication by employing the
statistical features of the cover and stego image as clues/evidences. Due to
the large volumes of security audit data as well as complex and dynamic
properties of steganogram behaviours, optimizing the performance of
steganalysers becomes an important open problem. This paper is focussed at fine
tuning the performance of six promising steganalysers in this field, through
feature selection. We propose to employ Markov Blanket-Embedded Genetic
Algorithm (MBEGA) for stego sensitive feature selection process. In particular,
the embedded Markov blanket based memetic operators add or delete features (or
genes) from a genetic algorithm (GA) solution so as to quickly improve the
solution and fine-tune the search. Empirical results suggest that MBEGA is
effective and efficient in eliminating irrelevant and redundant features based
on both Markov blanket and predictive power in classifier model. Observations
show that the proposed method is superior in terms of number of selected
features, classification accuracy and computational cost than their existing
counterparts.
