We show that it is possible to perturb arbitrary vacuum asymptotically flat
spacetimes to new ones having exactly the same energy and linear momentum, but
with center of mass and angular momentum equal to any preassigned values
measured with respect to a fixed affine frame at infinity. This is in contrast
to the axisymmetric situation where a bound on the angular momentum by the mass
has been shown to hold for black hole solutions. Our construction involves
changing the solution at the linear level in a shell near infinity, and
perturbing to impose the vacuum constraint equations. The procedure involves
the perturbation correction of an approximate solution which is given
explicitly.
