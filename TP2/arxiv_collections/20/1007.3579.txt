We discuss the effect of a secondary component of the superconducting order
parameter on the superfluid density in the cuprates. If we assume a main
$d_{x^2-y^2}$ gap, the most stable realization of a mixed order parameter has a
time-reversal breaking $d_{x^2-y^2}+ \imath d_{xy}$ symmetry. In this state the
nodes are removed and the temperature dependence of the superfluid density
changes from the linear behavior of a pure d-wave to a more rounded shape at
low temperature. The latter is compatible with the behavior experimentally
observed in the in-plane magnetic field penetration depth of optimally doped
$La_{2-x}Sr_xCuO_2$ and $YBa_2Cu_3O_{7-\delta}$.
