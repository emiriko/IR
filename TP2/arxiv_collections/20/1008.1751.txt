We study a variant of the well known Maxwell model for viscoelastic fluids,
namely we consider the Maxwell fluid with viscosity and relaxation time
depending on the pressure. Such a model is relevant for example in modelling
behaviour of some polymers and geomaterials. Although it is experimentally
known that the material moduli of some viscoelastic fluids can depend on the
pressure, most of the studies concerning the motion of viscoelastic fluids do
not take such effects into account despite their possible practical
significance in technological applications. Using a generalized Maxwell model
with pressure dependent material moduli we solve a simple boundary value
problem and we demonstrate interesting non-classical features exhibited by the
model.
