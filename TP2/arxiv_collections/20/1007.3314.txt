The Weierstrass random walk is a paradigmatic Markov chain giving rise to a
L\'evy-type superdiffusive behavior. It is well known that Special Relativity
prevents the arbitrarily high velocities necessary to establish a
superdiffusive behavior in any process occurring in Minkowski spacetime,
implying, in particular, that any relativistic Markov chain describing
spacetime phenomena must be essentially Gaussian. Here, we introduce a simple
relativistic extension of the Weierstrass random walk and show that there must
exist a transition time $t_c$ delimiting two qualitative distinct dynamical
regimes: the (non-relativistic) superdiffusive L\'evy flights, for $ t < t_c$,
and the usual (relativistic) Gaussian diffusion, for $t>t_c$. Implications of
this crossover between different diffusion regimes are discussed for some
explicit examples. The study of such an explicit and simple Markov chain can
shed some light on several results obtained in much more involved contexts.
