We demonstrate how most of the light $J^{P}=0^{+}$ spectrum below
$2.0\,\mathrm{GeV}$ and their decays can be consistently described by the
unitarized quark model incorporating the chiral constraints of Adler zeros and
taking SU(3) breaking effects into account. These resonances appear as poles in
the complex $s$ plane in a unified picture as $q\bar{q}$ states strongly
dressed by hadron loops. Through the large $N_c$ analysis, these resonances are
found to naturally separate into two kinds: $\sigma, \kappa, f_0(980),
a_0(980)$ are dynamically generated and run away from the real axis as $N_c$
increases, while the others move towards the $q\bar q $ seeds. In this picture,
the line shape of $a_0(980)$ is produced by a broad pole below the $K\bar{K}$
threshold, and exhibits characteristics similar to the $\sigma$ and $\kappa$.
