In this paper, instead of invoking Dark Energy, we try and fit various
cosmological observations with a large Gpc scale under-dense region (Void)
which is modeled by a Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi metric that at large distances
becomes a homogeneous FLRW metric. We improve on previous analyses by allowing
for nonzero overall curvature, accurately computing the distance to the
last-scattering surface and the observed scale of the Baryon Acoustic peaks,
and investigating important effects that could arise from having nontrivial
Void density profiles. We mainly focus on the WMAP 7-yr data (TT and TE),
Supernova data (SDSS SN), Hubble constant measurements (HST) and Baryon
Acoustic Oscillation data (SDSS and LRG). We find that the inclusion of a
nonzero overall curvature drastically improves the goodness of fit of the Void
model, bringing it very close to that of a homogeneous universe containing Dark
Energy, while by varying the profile one can increase the value of the local
Hubble parameter which has been a challenge for these models. We also try to
gauge how well our model can fit the large-scale-structure data, but a
comprehensive analysis will require the knowledge of perturbations on LTB
metrics. The model is consistent with the CMB dipole if the observer is about
15 Mpc off the centre of the Void. Remarkably, such an off-center position may
be able to account for the recent anomalous measurements of a large bulk flow
from kSZ data. Finally we provide several analytical approximations in
different regimes for the LTB metric, and a numerical module for CosmoMC, thus
allowing for a MCMC exploration of the full parameter space.
