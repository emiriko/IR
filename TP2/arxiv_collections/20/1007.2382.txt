A tilted spinning mirror rapidly steers the line of sight of the electron
Bernstein wave (EBW) emission radiometer at the Mega Amp Spherical Tokamak
(MAST). In order to resist high mechanical stresses at rotation speeds of up to
12,000 rpm and to avoid eddy current induced magnetic braking, the mirror
consists of a glass-reinforced nylon substrate of a special self-balanced
design, coated with a reflecting layer. By completing an angular scan every
2.5-10ms, it allows one to characterize with good time resolution the
Bernstein-extraordinary-ordinary mode-conversion efficiency as a function of
the view angles. Angular maps of conversion efficiency are directly related to
the magnetic pitch angle at the cutoff layer for the ordinary mode. Hence,
measurements at various frequencies provide the safety factor profile at the
plasma edge. Initial measurements and indications of the feasibility of the
diagnostic are presented. Moreover, angular scans indicate the best launch
conditions for EBW heating.
