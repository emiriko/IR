In this work we study the dynamics of free 3D relativistic Gaussian wave
packets with different spin polarization. We analyze the connection between the
symmetry of initial state and the dynamical characteristics of moving particle.
The corresponding solutions of Dirac equation having different types of
symmetry were evaluated analytically and numerically and after that the
electron probability densities, as well as, the spin densities were visualized.
The average values of velocity of the packet center and the average spin were
calculated analytically, and the parameters of transient Zitterbewegung in
different directions were obtained. These results can be useful for the
interpretation of future experiments with trapped ions.
