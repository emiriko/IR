We study the quantum phase transitions of a model that describes the
interconversion of interacting bosonic atoms and molecules. Using a classical
analysis, we identify a threshold coupling line separating a molecular phase
and a mixed phase. Through studies of the energy gap, von Neumann entanglement
entropy, and fidelity, we give evidence that this line is associated to a
boundary line in the ground-state phase diagram of the quantum system.
