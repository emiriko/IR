We found that hot alcoholic beverages were effective in inducing
superconductivity in FeTe$_{0.8}$S0$_{.2}$. Heating FeTe$_{0.8}$S0$_{.2}$
compound in various alcoholic beverages enhances the superconducting properties
compared to pure water-ethanol mixture as a control. Heating with red wine for
24 hours leads to the largest shielding volume fraction of 62.4% and the
highest zero resistivity temperature of 7.8 K. Some components present in
alcoholic beverages, other than water and ethanol, have the ability to induce
superconductivity in FeTe$_{0.8}$S0$_{.2}$ compound.
