Spin transistors and spin Hall effects have been two separate leading
directions of research in semiconductor spintronics which seeks new paradigms
for information processing technologies. We have brought the two directions
together to realize an all-semiconductor spin Hall effect transistor. Our
scheme circumvents semiconductor-ferromagnet interface problems of the original
Datta-Das spin transistor concept and demonstrates the utility of the spin Hall
effects in microelectronics. The devices use diffusive transport and operate
without electrical current, i.e., without Joule heating in the active part of
the transistor. We demonstrate a spin AND logic function in a semiconductor
channel with two gates. Our experimental study is complemented by numerical
Monte Carlo simulations of spin-diffusion through the transistor channel.
