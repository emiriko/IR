Topological defects can affect the physical properties of graphene in
unexpected ways. Harnessing their influence may lead to enhanced control of
both material strength and electrical properties. Here we present a new class
of topological defects in graphene composed of a rotating sequence of
dislocations that close on themselves, forming grain boundary loops that either
conserve the number of atoms in the hexagonal lattice or accommodate
vacancy/interstitial reconstruction, while leaving no unsatisfied bonds. One
grain boundary loop is observed as a "flower" pattern in scanning tunneling
microscopy (STM) studies of epitaxial graphene grown on SiC(0001). We show that
the flower defect has the lowest energy per dislocation core of any known
topological defect in graphene, providing a natural explanation for its growth
via the coalescence of mobile dislocations.
