Recently, it was predicted that an RKKY-type interaction between adatoms in
graphene can drive an ordering transition to a state with broken sublattice
symmetry (arXiv:1004.3678). In this state, due to Bragg scattering of electron
waves on the sublattice modulation, a gap opens up at the Dirac point (DP).
Here we investigate the effect of ordering on the transport properties, finding
that upon transition from disordered state to an ordered state the conductivity
is increased (reduced) at energies away (near) DP. This behavior can be
understood as a result of coherent Bragg scattering in the ordered state. The
conductivity change can serve as a direct signature of adatom ordering.
