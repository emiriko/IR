Preliminary results are presented concerning static properties of a small
Josephson junction under the influence of strong microwave radiation. We
discuss the correspondence between a Brownian particle moving in a periodic
potential and superconducting phase difference in a small Josephson junction.
Next, we describe an experimental method of determining the amplitude of
microwave current flowing across the junction. Typical examples of static
characteristics of the junction are presented, including its dynamical
resistance as a function of microwave power. We discuss also the influence of
an external magnetic field on the junction dynamics and show that in this case
the one-dimensional Stewart-McCumber model becomes insufficient.
