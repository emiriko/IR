Attempts to achieve "top kill" of actively flowing oil wells by insertion of
dense drilling "muds", i.e., slurries of dense minerals, from above will fail
if the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in the gravity-driven counterflow produces
turbulence that breaks up the denser fluid into small droplets. Here we
estimate the droplet size to be sub-mm for fast flows and suggest the addition
of a shear-thickening polymer to suppress turbulence. Laboratory experiments
show a progression from droplet formation to complete turbulence suppression at
the relevant high velocities, illustrating rich new physics accessible by using
a shear-thickening liquid in gravity driven counter-streaming flows.
