The dilute Kondo compound, Th_{1-x}U_{x}Ru_{2}Si_{2} (TURS), displays
non-Fermi liquid behavior but no zero-point entropy; it thus appears to elude
description by known single-ion models. It may also provide a clue to the
underlying local degrees of freedom in its dense counterpart, URu_{2}Si_{2}.
Here we use high-resolution magnetization studies to cross-check the
thermodynamic consistency of previous experiments. Measurements of the
field-dependence of the temperature-scale, T_F(H), associated with Fermi liquid
behavior probes the nature of the underlying impurity fixed point. We find that
T_F(H) grows linearly with applied field, in contrast to the quadratic form
expected for the two-channel Kondo model. We use a scaling argument to show
that the observed behavior of T_F(H) is consistent with the absence of
zero-point entropy, suggesting novel impurity behavior in this material. More
generally, we suggest the field-magnetization as a probe of single-ion physics
and make predictions for its behavior in other actinide compounds.
