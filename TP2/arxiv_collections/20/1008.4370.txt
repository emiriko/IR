For decoding non-binary low-density parity check (LDPC) codes,
logarithm-domain sum-product (Log-SP) algorithms were proposed for reducing
quantization effects of SP algorithm in conjunction with FFT. Since FFT is not
applicable in the logarithm domain, the computations required at check nodes in
the Log-SP algorithms are computationally intensive. What is worth, check nodes
usually have higher degree than variable nodes. As a result, most of the time
for decoding is used for check node computations, which leads to a bottleneck
effect. In this paper, we propose a Log-SP algorithm in the Fourier domain.
With this algorithm, the role of variable nodes and check nodes are switched.
The intensive computations are spread over lower-degree variable nodes, which
can be efficiently calculated in parallel. Furthermore, we develop a fast
calculation method for the estimated bits and syndromes in the Fourier domain.
