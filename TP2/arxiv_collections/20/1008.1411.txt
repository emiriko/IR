A gauge system is a classical field theory where among the fields there are
connections in a principal G-bundle over the space-time manifold and the
classical action is either invariant or transforms appropriately with respect
to the action of the gauge group. The lectures are focused on the path integral
quantization of such systems. Here two main examples of gauge systems are
Yang-Mills and Chern-Simons.
