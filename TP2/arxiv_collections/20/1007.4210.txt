We present a density functional theory investigation of strained
Ca$_{0.5}$Sr$_{0.5}$TiO$_3$. We have determined the structure and polarization
for a number of arrangements of Ca and Sr in a 2$\times$2$\times$2 supercell.
The a and b lattice vectors are strained to match the lattice constants of the
rotated Si(001) face. To set the context for the CSTO study, we also include
simulations of the Si(001) constrained structures for CaTiO$_3$ and SrTiO$_3$.
Our primary findings are that all Ca$_{0.5}$Sr$_{0.5}$TiO$_3$ structures
examined except one are ferroelectric, exhibiting polarizations ranging from
0.08 C/m$^2$ for the lowest energy configuration to about 0.26 C/m$^2$ for the
higher energy configurations. We find that the configurations with larger
polarizations have lower c/a ratios. The net polarization of the cell is the
result of Ti-O ferroelectric displacements regulated by A-site cations.
