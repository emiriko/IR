We report on the initial analysis of Herschel/HIFI carbon monoxide (CO)
observations of the Martian atmosphere performed between 11 and 16 April 2010.
We selected the (7-6) rotational transitions of the isotopes ^{13}CO at 771 GHz
and C^{18}O at 768 GHz in order to retrieve the mean vertical profile of
temperature and the mean volume mixing ratio of carbon monoxide. The derived
temperature profile agrees within less than 5 K with general circulation model
(GCM) predictions up to an altitude of 45 km, however, show about 12-15 K lower
values at 60 km. The CO mixing ratio was determined as 980 \pm 150 ppm, in
agreement with the 900 ppm derived from Herschel/SPIRE observations in November
2009.
