We investigate singlet scalar dark matter (DM) candidate in a left-right
symmetric gauge model with two Higgs bidoublets (2HBDM) in which the
stabilization of the DM particle is induced by the discrete symmetries P and
CP. According to the observed DM abundance, we predict the DM direct and
indirect detection cross sections for the DM mass range from 10 GeV to 500 GeV.
We show that the DM indirect detection cross section is not sensitive to the
light Higgs mixing and Yukawa couplings except the resonance regions. The
predicted spin-independent DM-nucleon elastic scattering cross section is found
to be significantly dependent on the above two factors. Our results show that
the future DM direct search experiments can cover the most parts of the allowed
parameter space. The PAMELA antiproton data can only exclude two very narrow
regions in the 2HBDM. It is very difficult to detect the DM direct or indirect
signals in the resonance regions due to the Breit-Wigner resonance effect.
