We consider moduli spaces of quilted strips with markings and their
compactifications. Using the theory of moment maps of toric varieties we
identify the compactified moduli spaces with certain graph associahedra. We
demonstrate how these moduli spaces govern the combinatorics of A-infinity
n-modules, which are natural generalizations of A-infinity modules (n=1) and
bimodules (n=2).
