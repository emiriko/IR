A minimal design for a molecular swimmer is proposed that is a based on a
mechanochemical propulsion mechanism. Conformational changes are induced by
electrostatic actuation when specific parts of the molecule temporarily acquire
net charges through catalyzed chemical reactions involving ionic components.
The mechanochemical cycle is designed such that the resulting conformational
changes would be sufficient for achieving low Reynolds number propulsion. The
system is analyzed within the recently developed framework of stochastic
swimmers to take account of the noisy environment at the molecular scale. The
swimming velocity of the device is found to depend on the concentration of the
fuel molecule according to the Michaelis-Menten rule in enzymatic reactions.
