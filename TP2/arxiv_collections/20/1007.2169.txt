In this paper we intend to provide an indirect method to detect Jovian
planets by studying near infrared emission spectra originating in the
protoplanetary disks around T Tauri stars. Our idea is to investigate whether a
massive planet could induce any observable effect on the spectral lines
emerging in the disks atmosphere. As a tracer molecule we propose CO, which is
excited in the ro-vibrational fundamental band in the disk atmosphere to a
distance of ~2-3 AU (depending on the stellar mass) where terrestrial planets
are thought to form. The synthetic molecular spectral line profiles were
calculated by an own developed semi-analytical double layer disk model. 2D gas
dynamics were incorporated in the calculation of synthetic spectral lines. We
demonstrate that a massive planet embedded in a protoplanetary disk strongly
influences the originally circular Keplerian gas dynamics. The perturbed motion
of the gas can be detected by comparing the CO line profiles in emission, which
is emerge from planet-bearing to those of planet-free disk models. The planet
signal has two major characteristics: a permanent line profile asymmetry, and
short timescale variability correlated with the orbital phase of the giant
planet. We have found that the strength of the asymmetry depends on the
physical parameters of the star-planet-disk system, such as the disk
inclination angle, the planetary and stellar masses, the orbital distance, and
the size of the disk inner cavity. The permanent line profile asymmetry is
caused by a disk in an eccentric state in the gap opened by the giant planet.
However, the variable component is a consequence of the local dynamical
perturbation by the orbiting giant planet. We show that a forming giant planet,
still embedded in the protoplanetary disk, can be detected using contemporary
or future high-resolution near-IR spectrographs like VLT/CRIRES and ELT/METIS.
