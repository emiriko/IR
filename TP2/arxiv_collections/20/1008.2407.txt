We discuss phenomenology in a new TeV scale model which would explain
neutrino oscillation, dark matter, and baryon asymmetry of the Universe
simultaneously by the dynamics of the extended Higgs sector and TeV-scale
right-handed neutrinos. Tiny neutrino masses are generated at the three-loop
level due to the exact $Z_2$ symmetry, by which the stability of the dark
matter candidate is guaranteed. The model provides various discriminative
predictions in Higgs phenomenology, which can be tested at the Large Hadron
Collider and the International Linear Collider.
