This paper studies the Laplacian spectral characterization of some graph
products. We consider a class of connected graphs: $\mathscr{G}={G :
|EG|\leq|VG|+1}$, and characterize all graphs $G\in\mathscr{G}$ such that the
products $G\times K_m$ are $L$-DS graphs. The main result of this paper states
that, if $G\in\mathscr{G}$, except for $C_{6}$ and $\Theta_{3,2,5}$, is $L$-DS
graph, so is the product $G\times K_{m}$. In addition, the $L$-cospectral
graphs with $C_{6}\times K_{m}$ and $\Theta_{3,2,5}\times K_{m}$ have been
found.
