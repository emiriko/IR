We compute the shift in the frequency of the spin resonance in a solid that
rotates in the field of a circularly polarized electromagnetic wave. Electron
spin resonance, nuclear magnetic resonance, and ferromagnetic resonance are
considered. We show that contrary to the case of the rotating LC circuit, the
shift in the frequency of the spin resonance has strong dependence on the
symmetry of the receiver. The shift due to rotation occurs only when rotational
symmetry is broken by the anisotropy of the gyromagnetic tensor, by the shape
of the body, or by magnetocrystalline anisotropy. General expressions for the
resonance frequency and power absorption are derived and implications for
experiment are discussed.
