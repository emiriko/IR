A new model for neutrino oscillations is introduced, in which mass-like
behavior is seen at high energies, but various behavior can be predicted at low
energies. The model employs no neutrino masses, but instead relies on the
Lorentz-violating parameters a and c. Oscillations into antineutrinos and
sterile neutrinos are also considered.
