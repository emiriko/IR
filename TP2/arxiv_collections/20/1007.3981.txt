BP Psc is a remarkable emission-line field star that is orbited by a dusty
disk and drives a parsec-scale system of jets. We report the detection by the
Chandra X-ray Observatory of a weak X-ray point source coincident with the
centroids of optical/IR and submillimeter continuum emission at BP Psc. As the
star's photosphere is obscured throughout the visible and near-infrared, the
Chandra X-ray source likely represents the first detection of BP Psc itself.
The X-rays most likely originate with magnetic activity at BP Psc and hence can
be attributed either to a stellar corona or to star-disk interactions. The log
of the ratio of X-ray to bolometric luminosity (log(L_X/L_{bol}) lies in the
range -5.8 to -4.2. This is smaller than log(L_X/L_{bol}) ratios typical of
low-mass, pre-main sequence stars, but is well within the log(L_X/L_{bol})
range observed for rapidly-rotating (FK Com-type) G giant stars. Hence, the
Chandra results favor an exotic model wherein the disk/jet system of BP Psc is
the result of its very recently engulfing a companion star or giant planet, as
the primary star ascended the giant branch.
