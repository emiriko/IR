We show that equations governing pulsations of superfluid neutron stars can
be splitted into two sets of weakly coupled equations, one describing the
superfluid modes and another one -- the normal modes. The coupling parameter s
is small, |s| ~ 0.01-0.05, for realistic equations of state. Already an
approximation s=0 is sufficient to calculate the pulsation spectrum within the
accuracy of a few percents. Our results indicate, in particular, that emission
of gravitational waves from superfluid pulsation modes is suppressed in
comparison to that from normal modes. The proposed approach allows to
drastically simplify modeling of pulsations of superfluid neutron stars.
