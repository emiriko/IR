The flow of superfluid helium at very low temperatures around an oscillating
microsphere is known to be unstable slightly above the critical velocity. The
flow pattern switches intermittently between potential flow and turbulence.
From time series recorded at constant temperature and driving force the
statistical properties of the switching phenomenon are discussed. Based on our
recent understanding of the critical velocity vc of oscillatory superflows,
i.e., v_c = sqrt(kappa omega), where kappa is the circulation quantum and omega
is the oscillation frequency, the analysis is being refined now. From the
exponential distribution of the lifetimes of the turbulent phases quantitative
information on the vortex density L can be inferred such as the distribution
and the width of the fluctuations of L. The phases of potential flow show a
Rayleigh distribution of the excess oscillation amplitude above the amplitude
at turbulent flow. The rms value is found to scale as omega^{-3/2}.
