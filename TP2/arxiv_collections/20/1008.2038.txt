Multi-Species entanglement, defined for a many-particle system as the
entanglement between different species of particles, is shown to exist in the
thermodynamic limit of the system size going to infinity. This macroscopic
entanglement, as it can exhibit singular behavior, is capable of tracking
quantum phase transitions. The entanglement between up and down spins has been
analytically calculated for the one-dimensional Ising model in a transverse
magnetic field. As the coupling strength is varied, the first derivative of the
entanglement shows a jump discontinuity and the second derivative diverges near
the quantum critical point.
