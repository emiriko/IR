This is a study of the one-dimensional elementary cellular automaton rule 54
in the new formalism of "flexible time". We derive algebraic expressions for
groups of several cells and their evolution in time. With them we can describe
the behaviour of simple periodic patterns like the ether and gliders in an
efficient way. We use that to look into their behaviour in detail and find
general formulas that characterise them.
