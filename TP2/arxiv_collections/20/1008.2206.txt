We study the potential to observe CP-violating effects in SUSY stop cascade
decay chains at the LHC. Asymmetries composed by triple products of momenta of
the final state particles are sensitive to CP-violating effects. Due to large
boosts that dilute the asymmetries, these can be difficult to observe. If all
particle masses in a cascade decay are known, it may be possible to reconstruct
all momenta in the decay chains on an event-by-event basis even when we have
missing momentum due to a stable LSP. After the reconstruction, the non-diluted
CP-violating signal can be recovered and gets significantly enhanced so that an
observation may become feasible. A fully hadronic study has been completed to
define the areas of the mSUGRA parameter space that may yield a 3-sigma
observation with 500 fb^(-1) at the LHC.
