Sampled semantics of timed automata is a finite approximation of their dense
time behavior. While the former is closer to the actual software or hardware
systems with a fixed granularity of time, the abstract character of the latter
makes it appealing for system modeling and verification. We study one aspect of
the relation between these two semantics, namely checking whether the system
exhibits some qualitative (untimed) behaviors in the dense time which cannot be
reproduced by any implementation with a fixed sampling rate. More formally, the
\emph{sampling problem} is to decide whether there is a sampling rate such that
all qualitative behaviors (the untimed language) accepted by a given timed
automaton in dense time semantics can be also accepted in sampled semantics. We
show that this problem is decidable.
