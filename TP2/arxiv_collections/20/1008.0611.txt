For most theories which parametrize modifications of General Relativity,
including those which violate the equivalence principle, gravitational redshift
tests typically offer weaker constraints on such test parameters than do
precision measurements of the universality of free fall (UFF) and local Lorentz
invariance (LLI). Although redshift anomalies are often linked with violations
of UFF or LLI, they do not have to be. We offer a simple model in which
particle masses anomalously vary with the gravitational potential. This
generates gravitational redshift anomalies unconstrained by existing tests of
UFF or LLI. We propose new experiments to limit such effects.
