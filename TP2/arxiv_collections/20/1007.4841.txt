Our paper Phys. Rev. D \textbf{79}, 093002 (2009), in which it was shown the
paramagnetic behavior of photons propagating in magnetized vacuum, is
criticized in Phys. Rev. D \textbf{81}, 105019, (2010) and even claimed that
the photon has a diamagnetic component. Here it is shown that such criticism is
inadequate and that the alleged "perpendicular component" is due to a mistake
in differentiating a vanishing term with regard to the magnetic field $B$, or
either by mistaking the derivative of a scalar product as that of a dyadic
product. A discussion on the physical side of the problem is also made.
