We investigate the cleaving behavior of LiFeAs and determine its surface
electronic structure by detailed density functional calculations. We show that
due to the neutral surface of LiFeAs after cleaving, barely any influence of
the surface on the electronic states is present. Therefore the data of surface
sensitive probes such as angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES)
represent to a high degree the bulk electronic structure. This we highlighted
by a direct comparison of the calculations to ARPES spectra.
