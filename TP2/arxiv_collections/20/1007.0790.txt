We evaluate the dressed Polyakov loop for hot quark matter in strong magnetic
field. To compute the finite temperature effective potential, we use the
Polyakov extended Nambu-Jona Lasinio model with eight-quark interactions taken
into account. The bare quark mass is adjusted in order to reproduce the
physical value of the vacuum pion mass. Our results show that the dressed
Polyakov loop is very sensitive to the strenght of the magnetic field, and it
is capable to capture both the deconfinement crossover and the chiral
crossover. Besides, we compute self-consistently the phase diagram of the
model. We find a tiny split of the two aforementioned crossovers as the
strength of the magnetic field is increased. Concretely, for the largest value
of magnetic field investigated here, $eB=19 m_\pi^2$, the split is of the order
of $10\%$. A qualitative comparison with other effective models and recent
Lattice results is also performed.
