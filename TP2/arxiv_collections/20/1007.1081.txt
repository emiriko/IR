In this paper, we formulate the geometric Bogomolov conjecture for abelian
varieties, and give some partial answers to it. In fact, we insist in a main
theorem that under some degeneracy condition, a closed subvariety of an abelian
variety does not have a dense subset of small points if it is a non-special
subvariety. The key of the proof is the study of the minimal dimension of the
components of a canonical measure on the tropicalization of the closed
subvariety. Then we can apply the tropical version of equidistribution theory
due to Gubler. This article includes an appendix by Walter Gubler. He shows
that the minimal dimension of the components of a canonical measure is equal to
the dimension of the abelian part of the subvariety. We can apply this result
to make a further contribution to the geometric Bogomolov conjecture.
