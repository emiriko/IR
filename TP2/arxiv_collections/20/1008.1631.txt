In this paper we investigate the electron-phonon contribution to the
resistivity of suspended single layer graphene. In-plane as well as flexural
phonons are addressed in different temperature regimes. We focus on the
intrinsic electron-phonon coupling due to the interaction of electrons with
elastic deformations in the graphene membrane. The competition between screened
deformation potential vs fictitious gauge field coupling is discussed, together
with the role of tension in the suspended flake. In the absence of tension,
flexural phonons dominate the phonon contribution to the resistivity at any
temperature $T$ with a $T^{5/2}_{}$ and $T^{2}_{}$ dependence at low and high
temperatures, respectively. Sample-specific tension suppresses the contribution
due to flexural phonons, yielding a linear temperature dependence due to
in-plane modes. We compare our results with recent experiments.
