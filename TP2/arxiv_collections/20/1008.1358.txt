The possibility of direct observation of Nonlinear Landau-Zener tunnelling
effect with a device consisting of two waveguide arrays connected with a tilted
reduced refractive index barrier is discussed. Numerical simulations on this
realistic setup are interpreted via simplified double well system and different
asymmetric tunnelling scenarios were predicted just varying injected beam
intensity.
