We address the issue of nuclear attenuation in nucleon and pion knockout
reactions. A selection of results from a model based on a relativistic
multiple-scattering approximation is presented. We show transparency
calculations for pion electroproduction on several nuclei, where data are in
very good agreement with calculations including color transparency. Secondly,
we discuss the density dependence of reactions involving one or double proton
knockout. The latter reaction succeeds in probing the high density regions in
the deep interior of the nucleus.
