We study the couplings of a CP-even neutral Higgs boson h in a model
containing one scalar SU(2)_L doublet, one real triplet, and one complex
triplet with hypercharge 1. Because the two triplets contribute to the rho
parameter with opposite signs, the triplet vacuum expectation values can be
sizable. We show that (i) the hWW and hZZ couplings can be larger than the
corresponding values in the Standard Model, and (ii) the ratio of the WW and ZZ
couplings of h can be different than the corresponding ratio in the Standard
Model. Neither of these results can occur in models containing only Higgs
doublets. We also compute the rates for gg --> h --> WW and gg --> h --> ZZ and
find that, for reasonable parameter values and M_h ~ 140-180 GeV, the hadron
collider rate for gg --> h --> WW (ZZ) can be up to 20% (5 times) larger than
in the Standard Model. We discuss implications for Higgs coupling extraction at
the LHC.
