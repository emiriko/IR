Nonlocality and quantum entanglement constitute two special features of
quantum systems of paramount importance in quantum information theory (QIT).
Essentially regarded as identical or equivalent for many years, they constitute
different concepts. Describing nonlocality by means of the maximal violation of
two Bell inequalities, we study both entanglement and nonlocality for two and
three spins in the XY model. Our results shed a new light into the description
of nonlocality and the possible information-theoretic task limitations of
entanglement in an infinite quantum system.
