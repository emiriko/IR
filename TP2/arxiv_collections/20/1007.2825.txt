In this paper we investigate the approximation properties of kernel
interpolants on manifolds. The kernels we consider will be obtained by the
restriction of positive definite kernels on $\R^d$, such as radial basis
functions (RBFs), to a smooth, compact embedded submanifold $\M\subset \R^d$.
For restricted kernels having finite smoothness, we provide a complete
characterization of the native space on $\M$. After this and some preliminary
setup, we present Sobolev-type error estimates for the interpolation problem.
Numerical results verifying the theory are also presented for a one-dimensional
curve embedded in $\R^3$ and a two-dimensional torus.
