We report on quantum simulations of relativistic scattering dynamics using
trapped ions. The simulated state of a scattering particle is encoded in both
the electronic and vibrational state of an ion, representing the discrete and
continuous components of relativistic wave functions. Multiple laser fields and
an auxiliary ion simulate the dynamics generated by the Dirac equation in the
presence of a scattering potential. Measurement and reconstruction of the
particle wave packet enables a frame-by-frame visualization of the scattering
processes. By precisely engineering a range of external potentials we are able
to simulate text book relativistic scattering experiments and study Klein
tunneling in an analogue quantum simulator. We describe extensions to solve
problems that are beyond current classical computing capabilities.
