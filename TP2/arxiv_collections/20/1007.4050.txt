We study the quantum phase transitions (QPTs) in the Kitaev spin model on a
triangle-honeycomb lattice. In addition to the ordinary topological QPTs
between Abelian and non-Abelian phases, we find new QPTs which can occur
between two phases belonging to the same topological class, namely, either two
non-Abelian phases with the same Chern number or two Abelian phases with the
same Chern number. Such QPTs result from the singular behaviors of the nonlocal
spin-spin correlation functions at the critical points.
