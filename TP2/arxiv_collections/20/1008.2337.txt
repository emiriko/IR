This paper aims to compare rational Chebyshev (RC) and Hermite functions (HF)
collocation approach to solve the Volterra's model for population growth of a
species within a closed system. This model is a nonlinear integro-differential
equation where the integral term represents the effect of toxin. This approach
is based on orthogonal functions which will be defined. The collocation method
reduces the solution of this problem to the solution of a system of algebraic
equations. We also compare these methods with some other numerical results and
show that the present approach is applicable for solving nonlinear
integro-differential equations.
