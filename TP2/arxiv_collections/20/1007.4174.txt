The Galactic Center is a prominent source in X-rays and gamma-rays and the
study of its high-energy emission is crucial in understanding the physical
phenomena taking place in its dense and extreme environment, phenomena that are
possibly common to other galactic nuclei. However this emission is also very
complex and consists of both thermal and non thermal radiation produced by
compact and extended sources, surrounded by more diffuse components. In spite
of the fundamental advances obtained in the last ten years with Chandra,
XMM-Newton, INTEGRAL, HESS and Suzaku several questions remain open to
investigations. I will review here the main results and the open issues on the
high-energy diagnostic of the galactic nuclear activity.
