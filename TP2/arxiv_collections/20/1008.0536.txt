The radio, optical, X-ray and gamma-ray nebulae that surround many pulsars
are thought to arise from synchrotron and inverse Compton emission. The energy
powering this emission, as well as the magnetic fields and relativistic
particles, are supplied by a "wind" driven by the central object. The inner
parts of the wind can be described using the equations of MHD, but these break
down in the outer parts, when the density of charge carriers drops below a
critical value. This paper reviews the wave properties of the inner part
(striped wind), and uses a relativistic two-fluid model (cold electrons and
positrons) to re-examine the nonlinear electromagnetic modes that propagate in
the outer parts. It is shown that in a radial wind, two solutions exist for
circularly polarised electromagnetic modes. At large distances one of them
turns into a freely expanding flow containing a vacuum wave, whereas the other
decelerates, corresponding to a confined flow.
