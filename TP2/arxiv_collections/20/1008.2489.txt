We understand the dynamics of the world around us as by associating pairs of
events, where one event has some influence on the other. These pairs of events
can be aggregated into a web of memories representing our understanding of an
episode of history. The events and the associations between them need not be
directly experienced-they can also be acquired by communication. In this paper
we take a network approach to study the dynamics of memories of history. First
we investigate the network structure of a data set consisting of reported
events by several individuals and how associations connect them. We focus our
measurement on degree distributions, degree correlations, cycles (which
represent inconsistencies as they would break the time ordering) and community
structure. We proceed to model effects of communication using an agent-based
model. We investigate the conditions for the memory webs of different
individuals to converge to collective memories, how groups where the
individuals have similar memories (but different from other groups) can form.
Our work outlines how the cognitive representation of memories and social
structure can co-evolve as a contagious process. We generate some testable
hypotheses including that the number of groups is limited as a function of the
total population size.
