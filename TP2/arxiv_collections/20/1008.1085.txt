We investigate the minimal number of links and knots in complete partite
graphs. We provide exact values or bounds on the minimal number of links for
all complete partite graphs with all but 4 vertices in one partition, or with 9
vertices in total. In particular, we find that the minimal number of links for
$K_{4,4,1}$ is 74. We also provide exact values or bounds on the minimal number
of knots for all complete partite graphs with 8 vertices.
