We consider electrons on a two-leg triangular ladder at half-filling and in
an orbital magnetic field. In a two-band regime in the absence of the field,
the electronic system remains conducting for weak interactions since there is
no four-fermion Umklapp term. We find that in the presence of the orbital field
there is a four-fermion Umklapp and it is always relevant for repulsive
interactions. Thus in this special ladder, the combination of the orbital
magnetic field and interactions provides a mechanism to drive metal-insulator
transition already at weak coupling. We discuss properties of the possible
resulting phases C0S2 and various C0S1 and C0S0.
