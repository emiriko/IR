We investigate the temperature and pressure dependences of the electrical
resistivity for bcc and hcp Fe using the low-order variational approximation
and theoretical transport spectral functions calculated from first principles
linear response linear-muffin-tin-orbital method in the generalized-gradient
approximation. The calculated values are in close agreement with available
experimental data, and show strong increase with temperature and decrease with
pressure. We also discuss the behavior of the electrical resistivity for the
bcc -> hcp phase transition.
