We study the magnitude of $D$-components in a generic supersymmetric field
theory. There exists $F$-component whose vacuum expectation value is comparable
to or bigger than that of $D$-component, in the absence of Fayet-Iliopoulos
term, the large hierarchy in the charge spectrum and strongly interacting
higher-dimensional couplings in the K\"ahler potential, if contributions from
other terms than $F$ and $D$-terms are negligible.
