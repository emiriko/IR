Multicell joint processing has been proven to be very efficient in overcoming
the interference-limited nature of the cellular paradigm. However, for reasons
of practical implementation global multicell joint decoding is not feasible and
thus clusters of cooperating Base Stations have to be considered. In this
context, intercluster interference has to be mitigated in order to harvest the
full potential of multicell joint processing. In this paper, four scenarios of
intercluster interference are investigated, namely a) global multicell joint
processing, b) interference alignment, c) resource division multiple access and
d) cochannel interference allowance. Each scenario is modelled and analyzed
using the per-cell ergodic sum-rate capacity as a figure of merit. In this
process, a number of theorems are derived for analytically expressing the
asymptotic eigenvalue distributions of the channel covariance matrices. The
analysis is based on principles from Free Probability theory and especially
properties in the R and Stieltjes transform domain.
