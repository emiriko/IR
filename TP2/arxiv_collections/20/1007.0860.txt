In this paper we propose a model-independent method to extract the resonance
parameters on the lattice directly from the Euclidean 2-point correlation
functions of the field operators at finite times. The method is tested in case
of the two-point function of the Delta-resonance, calculated at one loop in
Small Scale Expansion. Further, the method is applied to a 1+1-dimensional
model with two coupled Ising spins and the results are compared with earlier
ones obtained by using Luescher's approach.
