The first string excited state can be observed as a resonance in dijet
invariant mass distributions at the LHC, if the scenario of low-scale string
with large extra dimensions is realized. A distinguished property of the dijet
resonance by string excited states from that the other "new physics" is that
many almost degenerate states with various spin compose a single resonance
structure. It is examined that how we can obtain evidences of low-scale string
models through the analysis of angular distributions of dijet events at the
LHC. Some string resonance states of color singlet can obtain large mass shifts
through the open string one-loop effect, or through the mixing with closed
string states, and the shape of resonance structure can be distorted. Although
the distortion is not very large (10% for the mass squared), it might be able
to observe the effect at the LHC, if gluon jets and quark jets could be
distinguished in a certain level of efficiency.
