The genetic code maps the sixty-four nucleotide triplets (codons) to twenty
amino-acids. Some argue that the specific form of the code with its twenty
amino-acids might be a 'frozen accident' because of the overwhelming effects of
any further change. Others see it as a consequence of primordial biochemical
pathways and their evolution. Here we examine a scenario in which evolution
drives the emergence of a genetic code by selecting for an amino-acid map that
minimizes the impact of errors. We treat the stochastic mapping of codons to
amino-acids as a noisy information channel with a natural fitness measure.
Organisms compete by the fitness of their codes and, as a result, a genetic
code emerges at a supercritical transition in the noisy channel, when the
mapping of codons to amino-acids becomes nonrandom. At the phase transition, a
small expansion is valid and the emergent code is governed by smooth modes of
the Laplacian of errors. These modes are in turn governed by the topology of
the error-graph, in which codons are connected if they are likely to be
confused. This topology sets an upper bound - which is related to the classical
map-coloring problem - on the number of possible amino-acids. The suggested
scenario is generic and may describe a mechanism for the formation of other
error-prone biological codes, such as the recognition of DNA sites by proteins
in the transcription regulatory network.
