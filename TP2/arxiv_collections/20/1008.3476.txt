Metallicity is one of four free parameters typically considered when fitting
isochrones to the cluster sequence. Unfortunately, this parameter is often
ignored or assumed to be solar in most papers. Hence an unknown bias is
introduced in the estimation of the other three cluster parameters (age,
reddening and distance). Furthermore, studying the metallicity of open clusters
allows us not only to derive the Galactic abundance gradient on a global scale,
but also to trace the local solar environment in more detail. In a series of
three papers, we investigate the current status of published metallicities for
open clusters from widely different photometric and spectroscopic methods. A
detailed comparison of the results allows us to establish more reliable
photometric calibrations and corrections for isochrone fitting techniques. Well
established databases such as WEBDA help us to perform a homogeneous analysis
of available measurements for a significant number of open clusters. The
literature was searched for [Fe/H] estimates on the basis of photometric
calibrations in any available filter system. On the basis of results published
by Tadross, we demonstrate the caveats of the calibration choice and its
possible impact. In total, we find 406 individual metallicity values for 188
open clusters within 64 publications. The values were, finally, unweightedly
averaged. Our final sample includes [Fe/H] values for 188 open clusters.
Tracing the solar environment within 4000x4000 pc**2 we identify a patchy
metallicity distribution as an extension to the Local Bubble that significantly
influences the estimation of the Galactic metallicity gradient, even on a
global scale. In addition, further investigations of more distant open clusters
are clearly needed to obtain a more profound picture at Galactocentric
distances beyond 10 000 pc.
