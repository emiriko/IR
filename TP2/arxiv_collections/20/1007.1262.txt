The turbulent magnetic diffusivity in the solar convection zone is one of the
most poorly constrained ingredients of mean-field dynamo models. This lack of
constraint has previously led to controversy regarding the most appropriate set
of parameters, as different assumptions on the value of turbulent diffusivity
lead to radically different solar cycle predictions. Typically, the dynamo
community uses double step diffusivity profiles characterized by low values of
diffusivity in the bulk of the convection zone. However, these low diffusivity
values are not consistent with theoretical estimates based on mixing-length
theory -- which suggest much higher values for turbulent diffusivity. To make
matters worse, kinematic dynamo simulations cannot yield sustainable magnetic
cycles using these theoretical estimates. In this work we show that magnetic
cycles become viable if we combine the theoretically estimated diffusivity
profile with magnetic quenching of the diffusivity. Furthermore, we find that
the main features of this solution can be reproduced by a dynamo simulation
using a prescribed (kinematic) diffusivity profile that is based on the
spatiotemporal geometric-average of the dynamically quenched diffusivity. Here,
we provide an analytic fit to the dynamically quenched diffusivity profile,
which can be used in kinematic dynamo simulations. Having successfully
reconciled the mixing-length theory estimated diffusivity profile with
kinematic dynamo models, we argue that they remain a viable tool for
understanding the solar magnetic cycle.
