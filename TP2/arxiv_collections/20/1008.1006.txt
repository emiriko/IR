The main purpose of this work is to define planar self-intersection local
time by an alternative approach which is based on an almost sure pathwise
approximation of planar Brownian motion by simple, symmetric random walks. As a
result, Brownian self-intersection local time is obtained as an almost sure
limit of local averages of simple random walk self-intersection local times. An
important tool is a discrete version of the Tanaka--Rosen--Yor formula; the
continuous version of the formula is obtained as an almost sure limit of the
discrete version. The author hopes that this approach to self-intersection
local time is more transparent and elementary than other existing ones.
