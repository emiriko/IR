We present a study of the entanglement properties of Gaussian cluster states,
proposed as a universal resource for continuous-variable quantum computing. A
central aim is to compare mathematically-idealized cluster states defined using
quadrature eigenstates, which have infinite squeezing and cannot exist in
nature, with Gaussian approximations which are experimentally accessible.
Adopting widely-used definitions, we first review the key concepts, by
analysing a process of teleportation along a continuous-variable quantum wire
in the language of matrix product states. Next we consider the bipartite
entanglement properties of the wire, providing analytic results. We proceed to
grid cluster states, which are universal for the qubit case. To extend our
analysis of the bipartite entanglement, we adopt the entropic-entanglement
width, a specialized entanglement measure introduced recently by Van den Nest M
et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 97 150504 (2006), adapting their definition to the
continuous-variable context. Finally we add the effects of photonic loss,
extending our arguments to mixed states. Cumulatively our results point to key
differences in the properties of idealized and Gaussian cluster states. Even
modest loss rates are found to strongly limit the amount of entanglement. We
discuss the implications for the potential of continuous-variable analogues of
measurement-based quantum computation.
