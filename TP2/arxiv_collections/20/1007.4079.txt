The formation scenario for massive stars is still under discussion. To
further constrain current theories, it is vital to spatially resolve the
structures from which material accretes onto massive young stellar objects
(MYSOs). Due to the small angular extent of MYSOs, one needs to overcome the
limitations of conventional thermal infrared imaging, regarding spatial
resolution, in order to get observational access to the inner structure of
these objects.We employed mid - infrared interferometry, using the MIDI
instrument on the ESO /VLTI, to investigate the Kleinmann - Wright Object, a
massive young stellar object previously identified as a Herbig Be star
precursor. Dispersed visibility curves in the N- band (8 - 13 {\mu}m) have been
obtained at 5 interferometric baselines. We show that the mid - infrared
emission region is resolved. A qualitative analysis of the data indicates a non
- rotationally symmetric structure, e.g. the projection of an inclined disk. We
employed extensive radiative transfer simulations based on spectral energy
distribution fitting. Since SED - only fitting usually yields degenerate
results, we first employed a statistical analysis of the parameters provided by
the radiative transfer models. In addition, we compared the ten best - fitting
self - consistent models to the interferometric observations. Our analysis of
the Kleinmann - Wright Object suggests the existence of a circumstellar disk of
0.1M\odot at an intermediate inclination of 76\circ, while an additional dusty
envelope is not necessary for fitting the data. Furthermore, we demonstrate
that the combination of IR interferometry with radiative transfer simulations
has the potential to resolve ambiguities arising from the analysis of spectral
energy distributions alone.
