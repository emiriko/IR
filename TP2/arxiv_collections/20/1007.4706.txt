We consider here 6-regular plane graphs whose faces have size 1, 2 or 3. In
Section 2 a practical enumeration method is given that allowed us to enumerate
them up to 53 vertices. Subsequently, in Section 3 we enumerate all possible
symmetry groups of the spheres that showed up. In Section 4 we introduce a new
Goldberg-Coxeter construction that takes a 6-regular plane graph G0, two
integers k and l and returns two 6-regular plane graphs.
  Then in the final section, we consider the notions of zigzags and central
circuits for the considered graphs. We introduced the notions of tightness and
weak tightness for them and we prove an upper bound on the number of zigzags
and central circuits of such tight graphs. We also classify the tight and
weakly tight graphs with simple zigzags or central circuits.
