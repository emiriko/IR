The remarkable detection of a spatial variation in the fine-structure
constant, alpha, from quasar absorption systems must be independently confirmed
by complementary searches. In this letter, we discuss how terrestrial
measurements of time-variation of the fundamental constants in the laboratory,
meteorite data, and analysis of the Oklo nuclear reactor can be used to
corroborate the spatial variation seen by astronomers. Furthermore, we show
that spatial variation of the fundamental constants may be observable as
spatial anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background, the accelerated
expansion (dark energy), and large-scale structure of the Universe.
