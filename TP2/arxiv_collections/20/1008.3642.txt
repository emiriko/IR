GALPROP is a numerical code for calculating the galactic propagation of
relativistic charged particles and the diffuse emissions produced during their
propagation. The code incorporates as much realistic astrophysical input as
possible together with latest theoretical developments and has become a de
facto standard in astrophysics of cosmic rays. We present GALPROP WebRun, a
service to the scientific community enabling easy use of the freely available
GALPROP code via web browsers. In addition, we introduce the latest GALPROP
version 54, available through this service.
