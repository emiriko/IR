The heavy-Fermion liquid with short-range antiferromagnetic correlations is
carefully considered in the two-dimensional Kondo-Heisenberg lattice model. As
the ratio of the local Heisenberg superexchange $J_{H}$ to the Kondo coupling
$J_{K}$ increases, Lifshitz transitions are anticipated, where the topology of
the Fermi surface (FS) of the heavy quasiparticles changes from a hole-like
circle to four kidney-like pockets centered around $(\pi ,\pi)$. In-between
these two limiting cases, a first-order quantum phase transition is identified
at $J_{H}/J_{K}=0.1055$ where a small circle begins to emerge within the large
deformed circle. When $J_{H}/J_{K}=0.1425$, the two deformed circles intersect
each other and then decompose into four kidney-like Fermi pockets via a
second-order quantum phase transition. As $J_{H}/J_{K}$ increases further, the
Fermi pockets are shifted along the direction ($\pi,\pi$) to ($\pi/2,\pi/2$),
and the resulting FS is consistent with the FS obtained recently using the
quantum Monte Carlo cluster approach to the Kondo lattice system in the
presence of the antiferrmagnetic order.
