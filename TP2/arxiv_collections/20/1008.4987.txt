Based on the low energy effective Hamiltonian with naive factorization, we
calculate the branching ratios(BRs) and CP asymmetries (CPAs) for the twenty
three double charm decays $B/B_s \to D^{(*)}_{(s)} D^{(*)}_{(s)}$ in both the
standard model (SM) and the minimal supergravity (mSUGRA) model. Within the
considered parameter space, we find that (a) the theoretical predictions for
the BRs, CPAs and the polarization fractions in the SM and the mSUGRA model are
all consistent with the currently available data within $\pm 2\sigma$ errors;
(b) For all the considered decays, the supersymmetric contributions in the
mSUGRA model are very small, less than $7\%$ numerically. It may be difficult
to observe so small SUSY contributions even at LHC.
