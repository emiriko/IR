A model for the onset of the reduction in SRF cavity quality factor, the
so-called Q-drop, at high accelerating electric fields is presented. Breakdown
of the surface barrier against magnetic flux penetration at the cavity equator
is considered to be the critical event that determines the onset of Q-drop. The
worst case of triangular grooves with low field of first flux penetration Hp,
as analyzed previously by Buzdin and Daumens, [1998 Physica C 294: 257], was
adapted. This approach incorporates both the geometry of the groove and local
contamination via the Ginzburg-Landau parameter kappa, so the proposed model
allows new comparisons of one effect in relation to the other. The model
predicts equivalent reduction of Hp when either roughness or contamination were
varied alone, so smooth but dirty surfaces limit cavity performance about as
much as rough but clean surfaces do. When in combination, contamination
exacerbates the negative effects of roughness and vice-versa. To test the model
with actual data, coupons were prepared by buffered chemical polishing and
electropolishing, and stylus profilometry was used to obtain distributions of
angles. From these data, curves for surface resistance generated by simple flux
flow as a function of magnetic field were generated by integrating over the
distribution of angles for reasonable values of kappa. This showed that
combined effects of roughness and contamination indeed reduce the Q-drop onset
field by ~30%, and that that contamination contributes to Q-drop as much as
roughness. The latter point may be overlooked by SRF cavity research, since
access to the cavity interior by spectroscopy tools is very difficult, whereas
optical images have become commonplace. The model was extended to fit cavity
test data, which indicated that reduction of the superconducting gap by
contaminants may also play a role in Q-drop.
