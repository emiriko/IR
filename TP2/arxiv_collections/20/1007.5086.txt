Scanning tunneling spectroscopic studies of $Ba(Fe_{1-x}Co_x)_2As_2$ (x =
0.06, 0.12) single crystals reveal direct evidence for predominantly two-gap
superconductivity. These gaps decrease with increasing temperature and vanish
above the superconducting transition $T_c$. The two-gap nature and the slightly
doping- and energy-dependent quasiparticle scattering interferences near the
wave-vectors $(\pm \pi, 0)$ and $(0, \pm \pi)$ are consistent with
sign-changing $s$-wave superconductivity. The excess zero-bias conductance and
the large gap-to-$T_c$ ratios suggest dominant unitary impurity scattering.
