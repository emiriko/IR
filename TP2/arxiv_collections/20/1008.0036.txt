We investigate the periodic Anderson model with attractive interactions by
means of dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). Using a continuous-time quantum
Monte Carlo impurity solver, we study the competition between the superfluid
state and the paramagnetic Kondo insulating state, and determine the phase
diagram. At the chemical potential-induced phase transition from the Kondo
insulating state to the superfluid state, a low-energy peak characteristic of
the superfluid state appears inside the hybridization gap. We also address the
effect of the confining potential in optical lattice systems by means of
real-space DMFT calculations.
