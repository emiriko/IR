According to recent experimental evidence, the architecture of a promoter,
defined as the number, strength and regulatory role of the operators that
control the promoter, plays a major role in determining the level of
cell-to-cell variability in gene expression. These quantitative experiments
call for a corresponding modeling effort that addresses the question of how
changes in promoter architecture affect noise in gene expression in a
systematic rather than case-by-case fashion. In this article, we make such a
systematic investigation, based on a simple microscopic model of gene
regulation that incorporates stochastic effects. In particular, we show how
operator strength and operator multiplicity affect this variability. We examine
different modes of transcription factor binding to complex promoters
(cooperative, independent, simultaneous) and how each of these affects the
level of variability in transcription product from cell-to-cell. We propose
that direct comparison between in vivo single-cell experiments and theoretical
predictions for the moments of the probability distribution of mRNA number per
cell can discriminate between different kinetic models of gene regulation.
