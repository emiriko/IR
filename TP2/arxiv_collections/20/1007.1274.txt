Context awareness is the most important research area in ubiquitous
computing. In particular, for smart home, context awareness attempts to bring
the best services to the home habitants. However, the implementation in the
real environment is not easy and takes a long time from building the scratch.
Thus, to support the implementation in the real smart home, it is necessary to
demonstrate that thing can be done in the simulator in which context
information can be created by virtual sensors instead of physical sensors. In
this paper, we propose ISS, an Interactive Smart home Simulator system aiming
at controlling and simulating the behavior of an intelligent house. The
developed system aims to provide architects, designers a simulation and useful
tool for understanding the interaction between environment, people and the
impact of embedded and pervasive technology on in daily life. In this research,
the smart house is considered as an environment made up of independent and
distributed devices interacting to support user's goals and tasks. Therefore,
by using ISS, the developer can realize the relationship among virtual home
space, surrounded environment, use and home appliances.
