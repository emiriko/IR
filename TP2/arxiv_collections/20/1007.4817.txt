In this work, considering a numerical procedure developed to solve a system
of coupled nonlinear complex differential equations, which describes the
solitons propagation in dielectric optical fibers, we optimize the numerical
processing time, in relation to the relaxation parameter of the procedure, for
relevant groups of values of the dielectric variables of the optic fiber.
Key-words: optical soliton, processing time, optimization.
