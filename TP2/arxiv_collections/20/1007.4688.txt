The spatial fluctuations of deformation are studied in creep in the Andrade's
power-law and the logarithmic phases, using paper samples. Measurements by the
Digital Image Correlation technique show that the relative strength of the
strain rate fluctuations increases with time, in both creep regimes. In the
Andrade creep phase characterized by a power law decay of the strain rate
$\epsilon_t \sim t^{-\theta}$, with $\theta \approx 0.7$, the fluctuations obey
$\Delta \epsilon_t \sim t^{-\gamma}$, with $\gamma \approx 0.5$. The local
deformation follows a data collapse appropriate for an absorbing
state/depinning transition. Similar behavior is found in a crystal plasticity
model, with a jamming or yielding phase transition.
