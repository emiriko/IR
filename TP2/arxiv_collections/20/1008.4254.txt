We study vector functions of ${\mathbb R}^n$ into itself, which are of the
form $x \mapsto g(|x|)x\,,$ where $g : (0,\infty) \to (0,\infty) $ is a
continuous function and call these radial functions. In the case when $g(t) =
t^c$ for some $c \in {\mathbb R}\,,$ we find upper bounds for the distance of
image points under such a radial function. Some of our results refine recent
results of L. Maligranda and S. Dragomir. In particular, we study
quasiconformal mappings of this simple type and obtain norm inequalities for
such mappings.
