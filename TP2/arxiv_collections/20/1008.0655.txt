Vector boson plus jet production is interesting for Higgs search, beyond the
Standard Model physics and provides standard candles for calibration. This is
complementary to inclusive jet production measurements which provide precision
tests of perturbative QCD. A multitude of W/Z plus heavy and light flavour jet
measurements in ppbar collisions at a centre of mass energy of sqrt{s}=1.96TeV
is discussed. Next-to-Leading order perturbative QCD predictions and various
models are compared to the measurements.
