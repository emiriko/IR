Let $\D=\D_1\setminus \Dc_2$, where $\D_1$ and $\D_2$ are two smooth bounded
pseudoconvex domains in $\C^n, n\geq 3,$ such that $\Dc_2\subset \D_1.$ Assume
that the $\dbar$-Neumann operator of $\D_1$ is compact and the interior of the
Levi-flat points in the boundary of $\D_2$ is not empty (in the relative
topology). Then we show that the Hankel operator on $\D$ with symbol $\phi,
H^{\D}_{\phi},$ is compact for every $\phi\in C(\Dc)$ but the $\dbar$-Neumann
operator on $\D$ is not compact.
