The recently observed event excess in MiniBooNE anti-neutrino data is in
agreement with the LSND evidence for electron anti-neutrino appearance. We
propose an explanation of these data in terms of a (3+1) scheme with a sterile
neutrino including non-standard neutrino interactions (NSI) at neutrino
production and detection. The interference between oscillations and NSI
provides a source for CP violation which we use to reconcile different results
from neutrino and anti-neutrino data. Our best fit results imply NSI at the
level of a few percent relative to the standard weak interaction, in agreement
with current bounds. We compare the quality of the NSI fit to the one obtained
within the (3+1) and (3+2) pure oscillation frameworks. We also briefly comment
on using NSI (in an effective two-flavour framework) to address a possible
difference in neutrino and anti-neutrino results from the MINOS experiment.
