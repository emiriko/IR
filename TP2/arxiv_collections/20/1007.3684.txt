In this paper, we extend Gibbs's approach of quasi-equilibrium thermodynamic
processes, and calculate the microscopic expression of entropy for general
non-equilibrium thermodynamic processes. Also, we analyze the formal structure
of thermodynamic relation in non-equilibrium thermodynamic processes.
