We study termination time and recurrence time in programs with unbounded
recursion, which are either randomized or operate on some statistically
quantified inputs. As the underlying formal model for such programs we use
probabilistic pushdown automata (pPDA) which are equivalent to probabilistic
recursive state machines. We obtain tail bounds for the distribution of
termination time for pPDA. We also study the recurrence time for probabilistic
recursive programs that are not supposed to terminate (such as system daemons,
network servers, etc.). Typically, such programs react to certain requests
generated by their environment, and hence operate in finite request-service
cycles. We obtain bounds for the frequency of long request-service cycles.
