Thin films buckle easily and form wrinkled states in regions of well defined
size. The extent of a wrinkled region is typically assumed to reflect the zone
of in-plane compressive stresses prior to buckling, but recent experiments on
ultrathin sheets have shown that wrinkling patterns are significantly longer
and follow different scaling laws than those predicted by standard buckling
theory. Here we focus on a simple setup to show the striking differences
between near-threshold buckling and the analysis of wrinkle patterns in very
thin films, which are typically far from threshold.
