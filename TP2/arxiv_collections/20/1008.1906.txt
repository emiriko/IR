Structural operational semantics (SOS) is a technique for defining
operational semantics for programming and specification languages. Because of
its intuitive appeal and flexibility, SOS has found considerable application in
the study of the semantics of concurrent processes. It is also a viable
alternative to denotational semantics in the static analysis of programs and in
proving compiler correctness. Recently it has been applied in emerging areas
such as probabilistic systems and systems biology.
