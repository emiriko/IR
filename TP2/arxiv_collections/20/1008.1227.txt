XMS is a multi-channel wide-field spectrograph designed for the prime focus
of the 3.5m Calar-Alto telescope. The instrument is composed by four quadrants,
each of which contains a spectrograph channel. An innovative mechanical design
-at concept/preliminary stage- has been implemented to: 1) Minimize the
separation between the channels to achieve maximal filling factor; 2) Cope with
the very constraining space and mass overall requirements; 3) Achieve very
tight alignment tolerances; 4) Provide lens self-centering under large
temperature excursions; 5) Provide masks including 4000 slits (edges thinner
than 100\mu). An overview of this extremely challenging mechanical design is
here presented.
