For over 25 years, a solution has existed to Einstein's vacuum equation that
describes a space-time with two Kerr black holes. First formulated by Kramer
and Neugebauer (KN) in 1980 [1], this solution has been extensively researched
by many, with many and varied implications. One of which is causality
violation.
