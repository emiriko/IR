We propose a scheme of optical pumping by which a system of atoms coupled to
harmonic oscillators is driven to an entangled steady state through the atomic
spontaneous emission. It is shown that the optical pumping can be tailored so
that the many-body atomic state asymptotically reaches an arbitrary stabilizer
state regardless of the initial state. The proposed scheme can be suited to
various physical systems. In particular, the ion-trap realization is well
within current technology.
