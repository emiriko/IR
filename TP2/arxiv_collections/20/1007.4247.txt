In this short review on stellar convection dynamics I address the following,
currently very topical, issues: (1) the surface effects of the Reynolds
stresses and nonadiabaticity on solar-like pulsation frequencies, and (2)
oscillation mode lifetimes of stochastically excited oscillations in red giants
computed with different time-dependent convection formulations.
