The temperature dependence of the mobility in suspended graphene samples is
investigated. In clean samples, flexural phonons become the leading scattering
mechanism at temperature $T \gtrsim 10\,\,$K, and the resistivity increases
quadratically with $T$. Flexural phonons limit the intrinsic mobility down to a
few $\text{m}^2/\text{Vs}$ at room $T$. Their effect can be eliminated by
applying strain or placing graphene on a substrate.
