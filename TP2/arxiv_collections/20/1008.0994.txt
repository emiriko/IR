We obtain local unitary invariant polynomials for N qubit quantum state from
first principles. A basic unit of entanglement, referred to as negativity font,
is defined as a two by two matrix of probability amplitudes that determines the
negative eigen value of a four by four submatrix of partially transposed state
operator. Transformation properties of determinants of negativity fonts under
local unitary (LU) transformations are exploited to obtain multi qubit
invariants written in terms of such determinants.
