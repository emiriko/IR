Topological aspects of graphene are reviewed focusing on the massless Dirac
fermions with/without magnetic field. Doubled Dirac cones of graphene are
topologically protected by the chiral symmetry. The quantum Hall effect of the
graphene is described by the Berry connection of a manybody state by the filled
Landau levels which naturally possesses non-Abelian gauge structures. A generic
principle of the topologically non trivial states as the bulk-edge
correspondence is applied for graphene with/without magnetic field and explain
some of the characteristic boundary phenomena of graphene.
