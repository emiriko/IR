In two-way relay channels, bitwise XOR and symbol-level superposition coding
are two popular network-coding based relaying schemes. However, neither of them
can approach the capacity bound when the channels in the broadcast phase are
asymmetric. In this paper, we present a new physical layer network coding
(PLNC) scheme, called \emph{superimposed XOR}. The new scheme advances the
existing schemes by specifically taking into account the channel asymmetry as
well as information asymmetry in the broadcast phase. We obtain its achievable
rate regions over Gaussian channels when integrated with two known time control
protocols in two-way relaying. We also demonstrate their average maximum
sum-rates and service delay performances over fading channels. Numerical
results show that the proposed superimposed XOR achieves a larger rate region
than both XOR and superposition and performs much better over fading channels.
We further deduce the boundary of its achievable rate region of the broadcast
phase in an explicit and analytical expression. Based on these results, we then
show that the gap to the capacity bound approaches zero at high signal-to-noise
ratio.
