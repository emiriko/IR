Field Programmable Gate Array technology (FPGA) is a highly configurable
option for implementing many sophisticated signal processing tasks in Software
Defined Radios (SDRs). Those types of radios are realized using highly
configurable hardware platforms. Convolutional codes are used in every robust
digital communication system and Viterbi algorithm is employed in wireless
communications to decode the convolutional codes. Such decoders are complex and
dissipate large amount of power. In this paper, a low power-reconfigurable
Viterbi decoder for WiMAX receiver is described using a VHDL code for FPGA
implementation. The proposed design is implemented on Xilinx Virtex-II Pro,
XC2vpx30 FPGA using the FPGA Advantage Pro package provided by Mentor Graphics
and ISE 10.1 by Xilinx.
