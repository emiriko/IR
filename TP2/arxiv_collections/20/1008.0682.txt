We report a Cu K-edge resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) study of
orbital excitations in KCuF3 . By performing the polarization analysis of the
scattered photons, we disclose that the excitation between the eg orbitals and
the excitations from t2g to eg exhibit distinct polarization dependence. The
polarization dependence of the respective excitations is interpreted based on a
phenomenological consideration of the symmetry of the RIXS process that yields
a necessary condition for observing the excitations. In addition, we show that
the orbital excitations are dispersionless within our experimental resolution.
