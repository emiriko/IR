We investigate the magnetic dichotomy between Ap/Bp and other A-type stars by
carrying out a deep spectropolarimetric study of Am and HgMn stars. Using the
NARVAL spectropolarimeter at the Telescope Bernard Lyot (Observatoire du Pic du
Midi, France), we obtained high-resolution circular polarisation spectroscopy
of 12 Am stars and 3 HgMn stars. Using Least Squares Deconvolution (LSD), no
magnetic field is detected in any of the 15 observed stars. Uncertaintiies as
low as 0.3 G (respectively 1 G) have been reached for surface-averaged
longitudinal magnetic field measurements for Am (respectively HgMn) stars.
Associated with the results obtained previously for Ap/Bp stars, our study
confirms the existence of a magnetic dichotomy among A-type stars. Our data
demonstrate that there is at least one order of magnitude difference in field
strength between Zeeman detected stars (Ap/Bp stars) and non Zeeman detected
stars (Am and HgMn stars). This result confirms that the
spectroscopically-defined Ap/Bp stars are the only A-type stars harbouring
detectable large-scale surface magnetic fields.
