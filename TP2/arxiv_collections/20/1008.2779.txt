In the present paper we extend to the massive case the procedure of
divergences subtraction, previously introduced for the massless nonlinear sigma
model (D=4). Perturbative expansion in the number of loops is successfully
constructed. The resulting theory depends on the Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking
parameter v, on the mass m and on the radiative correction parameter \Lambda.
Fermions are not considered in the present work. SU(2) X SU(2) is the group
used.
