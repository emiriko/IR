We present a grid of LTE atmospheric models and synthetic spectra that cover
the spectral class range from mid-G to mid-K, and luminosity classes from V to
III, that is dense in Teff sampling (Delta Teff=62.5 K), for stars of solar
metallicity and moderately metal poor scaled solar abundance ([A/H]=0.0 and
-0.5). All models have been computed with two choices of atomic line list: a)
the "big" line lists of Kurucz (1992) that best reproduce the broad-band solar
blue and near UV flux level, and b) the "small" lists of Kurucz & Peytremann
(1975) that provide the best fit to the high resolution solar blue and near-UV
spectrum. We compare our model SEDs to a sample of stars carefully selected
from the large catalog of uniformly re-calibrated spectrophotometry of
Burnashev (1985) with the goal of determining how the quality of fit varies
with stellar parameters, especially in the historically troublesome blue and
near-UV bands. We confirm that our models computed with the "big" line list
recover the derived Teff values of the PHOENIX NextGen grid, but find that the
models computed with the "small" line list provide greater internal
self-consistency among different spectral bands, and closer agreement with the
empirical Teff scale of Ramirez & Melendez (2005), but not to the
interferometrically derived Teff values of Baines et al. (2010). We find no
evidence that the near UV band discrepancy between models and observations for
Arcturus (alpha Boo) reported by Short & Hauschildt (2003 and 2009) is
pervasive, and that Arcturus may be peculiar in this regard.
