The IceCube Observatory is a kilometer-cube neutrino telescope under
construction at the South Pole and planned to be completed in early 2011. When
completed it will consist of 5,160 Digital Optical Modules (DOMs) which detect
Cherenkov radiation from the charged particles produced in neutrino
interactions and by cosmic ray initiated atmospheric showers. IceCube
construction is currently 90% complete. A selection of the most recent
scientific results are shown here. The measurement of the anisotropy in arrival
direction of galactic cosmic rays will also be presented and discussed.
