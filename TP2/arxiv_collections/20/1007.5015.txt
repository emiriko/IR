We have experimentally and theoretically shown that the circularly polarized
beam bearing singly charged optical vortex propagating through a uniaxial
crystal can be split after focusing into the radially and azimuthally polarized
beams in vicinity of the focal area provided that the polarization handedness
and the vortex topological charge have opposite signs. Quality of the
polarization structure can reach unity.
