An ensemble of nuclear spin-pairs under certain conditions is known to
exhibit singlet state life-times much longer than other non-equilibrium states.
This property of singlet state can be exploited in quantum information
processing for efficient initialization of quantum registers. Here we describe
a general method of initialization and experimentally demonstrate it with two-,
three-, and four-qubit nuclear spin registers.
