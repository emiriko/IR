This paper summarizes our recent results on tidal interaction in high mass
X-ray binaries and symbiotic stars. We demonstrate that the giant in symbiotic
stars with orbital periods <1200 d are co-rotating (synchronized). The
symbiotics MWC 560 and CD-4314304 probably have high orbital eccentricity. The
giants in symbiotic binaries rotate faster than the field giants, likely their
rotation is accelerated by the tidal force of the white dwarf.
  The giant/supergiant High mass X-ray binaries with orbital periods <40 d are
synchronized. However the Be/X-ray binaries are not synchronized. In the
Be/X-ray binaries the circumstellar disks are denser and smaller than those in
isolated Be stars, probably truncated by the orbiting neutron star.
