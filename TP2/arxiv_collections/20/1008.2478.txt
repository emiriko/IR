We have measured K-shell x-ray spectra of highly ionized argon and phosphorus
following charge exchange with molecular hydrogen at low collision energy in an
electron beam ion trap using an x-ray calorimeter array with $\sim$6 eV
resolution. We find that the emission at the high-end of the Lyman series is
greater by a factor of 2 for phosphorus than for argon, even though the
measurement was performed concurrently and the atomic numbers are similar. This
does not agree with current theoretical models and deviates from the trend
observed in previous measurements.
