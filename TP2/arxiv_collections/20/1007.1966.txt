Tau neutrino and antineutrino interactions with nucleons in large underground
or under ice detectors will be important signals of astrophysical and
atmospheric sources of neutrinos. We present here a theoretical update of the
deep inelastic scattering contribution to the tau neutrino and antineutrino
charged current cross sections with isoscalar nucleon targets and proton
targets for incident neutrinos and antineutrinos in the energy range from 10
GeV to 10 TeV. Next-to-leading order quantum chromodynamic corrections, target
mass corrections and heavy quark effects are included. Uncertainties in the
cross section associated with the structure functions a low momentum transfers,
the input parton distribution functions, scale dependence and flavor number
scheme are discussed.
