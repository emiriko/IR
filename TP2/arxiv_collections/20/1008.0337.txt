We demonstrate a new method to directly manipulate the state of individual
two-level systems (TLS) in phase qubits. It allows one to characterize the
coherence properties of TLS using standard microwave pulse sequences, while the
qubit is used only for state readout. We apply this method to measure the
temperature dependence of TLS coherence for the first time. The energy
relaxation time $T_1$ is found to decrease quadratically with temperature for
the two TLS studied in this work, while their dephasing time measured in Ramsey
and spin-echo experiments is found to be $T_1$ limited at all temperatures.
