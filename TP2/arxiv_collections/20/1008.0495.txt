CoRoT has allowed a quantitative leap for the solar-like-star seismology
thanks to 5-month-long uninterrupted timeseries of high-precision photometric
data. Kepler is also starting to deliver similar data. Now, several F and G
main-sequence stars have been analyzed. The techniques developed to interpret
light curves directly inherit from the experience got on the Sun with
helioseismology. I describe in this review the methods currently used to
analyze these light curves. First, these data provide an accurate determination
of the stellar rotation rate. This is possible thanks to the magnetic activity
of stars. The power spectra of light curves put also constraints on the stellar
granulation, which can be directly compared to 3-D stellar atmosphere models;
this shows still unexplained discrepancies. I then detailed a standard method
for extracting p-mode characteristics (frequency, amplitude and lifetime).
CoRoT has revealed unexpected short life times for F stars. Last, I also
discuss errors and biases of mode frequencies, especially the ones due to the
simplified description of the rotation generally used.
