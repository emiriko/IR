When the Standard Model is considered as an effective low-energy theory,
higher dimensional interaction terms appear in the Lagrangian. Dimension-six
terms have been enumerated in the classical article by Buchmueller and Wyler
[3]. Although redundance of some of those operators has been already noted in
the literature, no updated complete list has been published to date. Here we
perform their classification once again from the outset. Assuming baryon number
conservation, we find 15 + 19 + 25 = 59 independent operators (barring flavour
structure and Hermitian conjugations), as compared to 16 + 35 + 29 = 80 in
Ref.[3]. The three summed numbers refer to operators containing 0, 2 and 4
fermion fields. If the assumption of baryon number conservation is relaxed, 4
new operators arise in the four-fermion sector.
