In this article we introduce an ordinary differential equation associated to
the one parameter family of Calabi-Yau varieties which is mirror dual to the
universal family of smooth quintic three folds. It is satisfied by seven
functions written in the $q$-expansion form and the Yukawa coupling turns out
to be rational in these functions. This is a generalization of the Ramanujan
differential equation satisfied by three Eisenstein series.
