In the paper, a vibration damping system powered by harvested energy with
implementation of the so-called SSDV (synchronized switch damping on voltage
source) technique is designed and investigated. In the semi-passive approach,
the piezoelectric element is intermittently switched from open-circuit to
specific impedance synchronously with the structural vibration. Due to this
switching procedure, a phase difference appears between the strain induced by
vibration and the resulting voltage, thus creating energy dissipation. By
supplying the energy collected from the piezoelectric materials to the
switching circuit, a new low-power device using the SSDV technique is proposed.
Compared with the original self-powered SSDI (synchronized switch damping on
inductor), such a device can significantly improve its performance of vibration
control. Its effectiveness in the single-mode resonant damping of a composite
beam is validated by the experimental results.
