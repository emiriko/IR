We study 8-dimensional Riemannian manifolds that admit a PSU(3)-structure. We
classify these structures by their intrinsic torsion and characterize the
corresponding classes via differential equations. Moreover, we consider a
connection defined by a 3- and a 4-form that preserves the underlying
structure. Finally, we discuss the geometry of these manifolds relatively to
the holonomy algebra of this connection.
