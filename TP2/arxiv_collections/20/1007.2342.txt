Parametric amplification of quantum fluctuations constitutes a fundamental
mechanism for spontaneous symmetry breaking. In our experiments, a spinor
condensate acts as a parametric amplifier of spin modes, resulting in a twofold
spontaneous breaking of spatial and spin symmetry in the amplified clouds. Our
experiments permit a precise analysis of the amplification in specific spatial
Bessel-like modes, allowing for the detailed understanding of the double
symmetry breaking. On resonances that create vortex-antivortex superpositions,
we show that the cylindrical spatial symmetry is spontaneously broken, but
phase squeezing prevents spin-symmetry breaking. If, however, nondegenerate
spin modes contribute to the amplification, quantum interferences lead to
spin-dependent density profiles and hence spontaneously-formed patterns in the
longitudinal magnetization.
