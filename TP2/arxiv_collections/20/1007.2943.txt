Recent results from CDF Collaboration favor a large CP asymmetry in
$B_s\rightarrow K^-\pi^+$ decay, while the Standard Model prediction is very
small. Moreover, the measurement of its branching ratio is lower than the
Standard Model prediction based on the QCD factorization. We compute the
gluino-mediated supersymmetry contributions to $B_{s}\to
K^{(*)-}\pi^{+}$,$K^{(*)-}\rho^{+}$ decays in the frame of the mass insertion
method, and find that for $\frac{m^2_{\tilde{g}}}{m^2_{\tilde{q}}}\leq2$, the
theoretical predictions including the LR and RL mass insertion contributions
are compatible with the measurements of $B_s\to K^-\pi^+$ decay and
$B^0-\bar{B}^0$ mixing within $2\sigma$ ranges. Using the constrained LR and RL
mass insertion parameter spaces, we explore the supersymmetry mass insertion
effects on the branching ratios, the direct CP asymmetries and the polarization
fractions in $B_{s}\to K^{*-}\pi^+, K^{-}\rho^+, K^{*-}\rho^+$ decays. We find
the constrained LR and RL insertions can provide sizable contributions to the
branching ratios of $B_{s}\to K^{*-}\pi^{+}$,$K^{(*)-}\rho^{+}$ as well as the
direct CP asymmetry and the longitudinal polarization of $B_{s}\to
K^{*-}\rho^{+}$ decay without conflict with all related data within $2\sigma$
ranges.
  Near future experiments at Fermi Lab and CERN LHC-b can test our predictions
and shrink/reveal the mass insertion parameter spaces.
