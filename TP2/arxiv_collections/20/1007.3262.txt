We have measured the redshift evolution of the density of Lyman limit systems
(LLS) in the intergalactic medium over the redshift range 0 < z < 6. We have
used two new quasar samples to (1) improve coverage at z ~ 1, with GALEX grism
spectrograph observations of 50 quasars with 0.8 < z_em < 1.3, and (2) extend
coverage to z ~ 6, with Keck ESI spectra of 25 quasars with 4.17 < z_em < 5.99.
Using these samples together with published data, we find that the number
density of LLS per unit redshift, n(z), can be well fit by a simple evolution
of the form n(z) = n_3.5 [(1+z)/4.5]^gamma, with n_3.5 = 2.80 +/- 0.33 and
gamma = 1.94^(+0.36)_(-0.32) for the entire range 0 < z < 6. We have also
reanalyzed the evolution of damped Lyman alpha systems (DLAs) in the redshift
range 4 < z < 5 using our high-redshift quasar sample. We find a total of 17
DLAs and sub-DLAs, which we have analyzed in combination with published data.
The DLAs with log (HI column density) > 20.3 show the same redshift evolution
as the LLS. When combined with previous results, our DLA sample is also
consistent with a constant Omega_DLA= 9 x 10^(-4) from z = 2 to z = 5. We have
used the LLS number density evolution to compute the evolution in the mean free
path of ionizing photons. We find a smooth evolution to z ~ 6, very similar in
shape to that of Madau, Haardt & Rees (1999) but about a factor of two higher.
Recent theoretical models roughly match to the z < 6 data but diverge from the
measured power law at z > 6 in different ways, cautioning against extrapolating
the fit to the mean free path outside the measured redshift range.
