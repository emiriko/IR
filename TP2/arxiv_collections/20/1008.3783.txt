We present recent results from charmonium and open charm production at the
LHCb experiment at CERN, Geneva. We concentrate on studies for the measurement
of the cross section pp ->JPsi+X in its decay channel with two muons, showing
the agreement of the simulation with the data in few key distributions. We also
show the reconstructed modes of D0->K-pi+, D0 K-pi+pi0, LambdaC+ -> p K-pi+ and
D+ ->Ks0 pi+ and their prospects.
