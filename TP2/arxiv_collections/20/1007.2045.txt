The new integrable quantum spin model is proposed. The model has a biaxial
magnetic anisotropy of alternating coupling between spins together with
multiple spin interactions. Our model gives the possibility to exactly find
thermodynamic characteristics of the considered spin chain. The ground state of
the model can reveal spontaneous values of the total magnetic and
antiferromagnetic moments, caused by multiple spin couplings. Also, in the
ground state, depending on the strength of multiple spin couplings, our model
manifests several quantum critical points, some of which are governed by the
external magnetic field.
