'Water In Star-forming regions with Herschel' (WISH) is a key programme
dedicated to studying the role of water and related species during the
star-formation process and constraining the physical and chemical properties of
young stellar objects. The Heterodyne Instrument for the Far-Infrared (HIFI) on
the Herschel Space Observatory observed three deeply embedded protostars in the
low-mass star-forming region NGC1333 in several H2-16O, H2-18O, and CO
transitions. Line profiles are resolved for five H16O transitions in each
source, revealing them to be surprisingly complex. The line profiles are
decomposed into broad (>20 km/s), medium-broad (~5-10 km/s), and narrow (<5
km/s) components. The H2-18O emission is only detected in broad 1_10-1_01 lines
(>20 km/s), indicating that its physical origin is the same as for the broad
H2-16O component. In one of the sources, IRAS4A, an inverse P Cygni profile is
observed, a clear sign of infall in the envelope. From the line profiles alone,
it is clear that the bulk of emission arises from shocks, both on small (<1000
AU) and large scales along the outflow cavity walls (~10 000 AU). The H2O line
profiles are compared to CO line profiles to constrain the H2O abundance as a
function of velocity within these shocked regions. The H2O/CO abundance ratios
are measured to be in the range of ~0.1-1, corresponding to H2O abundances of
~10-5-10-4 with respect to H2. Approximately 5-10% of the gas is hot enough for
all oxygen to be driven into water in warm post-shock gas, mostly at high
velocities.
