A paradigm model is suggested for describing the diffusive limit of
trajectories of two Lorentz disks moving in a finite horizon periodic
configuration of smooth, strictly convex scatterers and interacting with each
other via elastic collisions. For this model the diffusive limit of the two
trajectories is a mixture of joint Gaussian laws (analogous behavior is
expected for the mechanical model of two Lorentz disks).
