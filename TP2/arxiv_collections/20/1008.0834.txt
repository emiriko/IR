We investigate a method to solve a class of Schr{\"o}dinger equation
eigenvalue problems numerically to very high precision $P$ (from thousands to a
million of decimals). The memory requirement, and the number of high precision
algebraic operations, of the method scale essentially linearly with $P$ when
only eigenvalues are computed. However, since the algorithms for multiplying
high precision numbers scale at a rate between $P^{1.6}$ and $P\,\log
P\,\log\log P$, the time requirement of our method increases somewhat faster
than $P^2$.
