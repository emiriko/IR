This article deals with the numerical approximation of effective coefficients
in stochastic homogenization of discrete linear elliptic equations. The
originality of this work is the use of a well-known abstract spectral
representation formula to design and analyze effective and computable
approximations of the homogenized coefficients. In particular, we show that
information on the edge of the spectrum of the generator of the environment
viewed by the particle projected on the local drift yields bounds on the
approximation error, and conversely. Combined with results by Otto and the
first author in low dimension, and results by the second author in high
dimension, this allows us to prove that for any dimension, there exists an
explicit numerical strategy to approximate homogenized coefficients which
converges at the rate of the central limit theorem.
