We present the results of electrical resistivity, ac specific heat, magnetic
susceptibility, X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray magnetic circular
dichroism (XMCD) of the ternary iron arsenide EuFe2As2 single crystal under
pressure. Applying pressure leads to a continuous suppression of the
antiferromagnetism associated with Fe moments and the antiferromagnetic
transition temperature becomes zero in the vicinity of a critical pressure Pc
~2.5-2.7 GPa. Pressure-induced re-entrant superconductivity, which is highly
sensitive to the homogeneity of the pressure, only appears in the narrow
pressure region in the vicinity of Pc due to the competition between
superconductivity and the antiferromagnetic ordering of Eu2+ moments. The
antiferromagnetic state of Eu2+ moments changes to the ferromagnetic state
above 6 GPa. We also found that the ferromagnetic order is suppressed with
further increasing pressure, which is connected with a valence change of Eu
ions.
