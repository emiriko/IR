A subset $S$ of a finite abelian group, written additively, is called
zero-sumfree if the sum of the elements of each non-empty subset of $S$ is
non-zero. We investigate the maximal cardinality of zero-sumfree sets, i.e.,
the (small) Olson constant. We determine the maximal cardinality of such sets
for several new types of groups; in particular, $p$-groups with large rank
relative to the exponent, including all groups with exponent at most five.
These results are derived as consequences of more general results, establishing
new lower bounds for the cardinality of zero-sumfree sets for various types of
groups. The quality of these bounds is explored via the treatment, which is
computer-aided, of selected explicit examples. Moreover, we investigate a
closely related notion, namely the maximal cardinality of minimal zero-sum
sets, i.e., the Strong Davenport constant. In particular, we determine its
value for elementary $p$-groups of rank at most $2$, paralleling and building
on recent results on this problem for the Olson constant.
