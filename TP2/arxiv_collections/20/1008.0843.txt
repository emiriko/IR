Strategies to optimally discriminate between quantum states are critical in
quantum technologies. We present an experimental demonstration of minimum error
discrimination between entangled states, encoded in the polarization of pairs
of photons. Although the optimal measurement involves projecting onto entangled
states, we use a result of Walgate et al. to design an optical implementation
employing only local polarization measurements and feed-forward, which performs
at the Helstrom bound. Our scheme can achieve perfect discrimination of
orthogonal states and minimum error discrimination of non-orthogonal states.
Our experimental results show a definite advantage over schemes not using
feed-forward.
