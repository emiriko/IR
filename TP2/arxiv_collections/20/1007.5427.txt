We present a new analytical solution of the Einstein field equations
describing a wormhole shell of zero thickness joining two
Lema{\i}tre-Tolman-Bondi universes, with no radial accretion. The material on
the shell satisfies the energy conditions and, at late times, the shell becomes
comoving with the dust-dominated cosmic substratum.
