Recent results have shown that the performance of bit-interleaved coded
modulation (BICM) using convolutional codes in nonfading channels can be
significantly improved when the interleaver takes a trivial form (BICM-T),
i.e., when it does not interleave the bits at all. In this paper, we give a
formal explanation for these results and show that BICM-T is in fact the
combination of a TCM transmitter and a BICM receiver. To predict the
performance of BICM-T, a new type of distance spectrum for convolutional codes
is introduced, analytical bounds based on this spectrum are developed, and
asymptotic approximations are also presented. It is shown that the minimum
distance of the code is not the relevant optimization criterion for BICM-T.
Optimal convolutional codes for different constrain lengths are tabulated and
asymptotic gains of about 2 dB are obtained. These gains are found to be the
same as those obtained by Ungerboeck's one-dimensional trellis coded modulation
(1D-TCM), and therefore, in nonfading channels, BICM-T is shown to be
asymptotically as good as 1D-TCM.
