In this paper we investigate the electrodynamic surface properties of bare
strange quark stars. The surfaces of such objects are characterized by the
formation of ultra-high electric surface fields which might be as high as $\sim
10^{19}$ V/cm. These fields result from the formation of electric dipole layers
at the stellar surfaces. We calculate the increase in gravitational mass
associated with the energy stored in the electric dipole field, which turns out
to be only significant if the star possesses a sufficiently strong {\em net}
electric charge distribution. In part two of the paper, we explore the
intriguing possibility of what happens when the electron layer (sphere) rotates
with respect to the stellar strange matter body. We find that in this event
magnetic fields can be generated which, for moderate effective rotational
frequencies between the electron layer and the stellar body, agree with the
magnetic fields inferred for several Central Compact Objects (CCOs). These
objects could thus be comfortably interpreted as strange stars whose electron
atmospheres rotate at frequencies that are moderately different ($\sim 10$ Hz)
from the rotational frequencies of the strange star itself.
