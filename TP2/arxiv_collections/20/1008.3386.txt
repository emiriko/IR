The physical mechanisms and timescales that determine the morphological
signatures and the quenching of star formation of typical (~L*) elliptical
galaxies are not well understood. To address this issue, we have simulated the
formation of a group of galaxies with sufficient resolution to track the
evolution of gas and stars inside about a dozen galaxy group members over
cosmic history. Galaxy groups, which harbor many elliptical galaxies in the
universe, are a particularly promising environment to investigate morphological
transformation and star formation quenching, due to their high galaxy density,
their relatively low velocity dispersion, and the presence of a hot intragroup
medium. Our simulation reproduces galaxies with different Hubble morphologies
and, consequently, enables us to study when and where the morphological
transformation of galaxies takes place. The simulation does not include
feedback from active galactic nuclei showing that it is not an essential
ingredient for producing quiescent, red elliptical galaxies in galaxy groups.
Ellipticals form, as suspected, through galaxy mergers. In contrast with what
has often been speculated, however, these mergers occur at z>1, before the
merging progenitors enter the virial radius of the group and before the group
is fully assembled. The simulation also shows that quenching of star formation
in the still star-forming elliptical galaxies lags behind their morphological
transformation, but, once started, is taking less than a billion years to
complete. As long envisaged the star formation quenching happens as the
galaxies approach and enter the finally assembled group, due to quenching of
gas accretion and (to a lesser degree) stripping. A similar sort is followed by
unmerged, disk galaxies, which, as they join the group, are turned into the
red-and-dead disks that abound in these environments.
