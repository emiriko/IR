The origin of the shallow decay segment in gamma-ray burst's (GRB) early
light curves remains a mystery, especially those cases with a long-lived
plateau followed by an abrupt falloff. In this paper, we propose a mechanism to
understand the origin of the abrupt falloff after plateau by considering
solidification of newborn quark stars with latent heat released as energy
injection to GRB afterglow. We estimate the total latent heat released during
the phase transition of quark stars from liquid to solid states, to be order of
~ 10^{51}ergs, which is comparable to the emission energy in the shallow decay
segment. We also estimate the time scale of radiating the latent heat through
thermal photon emission, and find that the time scale agrees with observations.
Based on our estimation, we analyze the process of energy injection to GRB
afterglow. We show that the steady latent heat of quark star phase transition
would continuously inject into GRB afterglow in a form similar to that of a
Poyntingflux- dominated outflow and naturally produce the shallow decay phase
and the abrupt falloff after plateau. We conclude that the latent heat of quark
star phase transition would be an important contribution to the shallow decay
radiation in GRB afterglow, and would explain the general features of GRB light
curves (including the plateau), if pulsar-like stars are really (solid) quark
stars.
