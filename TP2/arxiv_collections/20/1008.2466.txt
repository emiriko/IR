Imaging hadronic calorimeters with scintillator readout use small
scintillator tiles individually read out by silicon photomultipliers to achieve
the necessary granularity needed for sophisticated reconstruction algorithms at
future collider detectors. For a second generation prototype of the CALICE
analog HCAL new, 3 mm thick scintillator tiles with an embedded wavelength
shifting fiber and new photon sensor from CPTA are being fabricated. The
availability of blue-sensitive SiPMs also allows fiberless coupling of the
photon sensor to the tile, a technique requiring modified geometries to achieve
a high degree of response uniformity. We discuss results from test bench and
from test beam measurements of different scintillator tile geometries as well
as prospects for fiberless coupling of photon sensors.
