We study the pair production of charged gauge bosons at the LHC in a
noncommutative extension of the standard model. We use angular distributions in
the decays of the gauge bosons to partially reconstruct polarized cross
sections. We use this, together with CP considerations, to construct more
sensitive observables that allow to separate space-time from space-space
noncommutativities.
