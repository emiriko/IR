The most recent measurements at Tevatron of the charge asymmetry in
top-antitop quark pair production reduce the discrepancy with the Standard
Model from 2sigma to 1.7sigma, and open a little window, at 95% C.L., for
negative contributions to the charge asymmetry beyond the SM. We update our
analysis for colour octet gauge bosons or axigluons in flavour universal and
flavour non universal scenarios. We review other possible models and make an
educated guess on their parameter space allowed by the new measurements.
Finally, we comment on the prospects to measure the charge asymmetry at the
LHC.
