We constrain the chameleonic Sunyaev--Zel'dovich (CSZ) effect in the Coma
cluster from measurements of the Coma radial profile presented in the WMAP
7-year results. The CSZ effect arises from the interaction of a scalar (or
pseudoscalar) particle with the cosmic microwave background in the magnetic
field of galaxy clusters. We combine this radial profile data with SZ
measurements towards the centre of the Coma cluster in different frequency
bands, to find Delta T_{SZ,RJ}(0)=-400+/-40 microKelvin and Delta T_{CSZ}^{204
GHz}(0)=-20+/-15 microKelvin (68% CL) for the thermal SZ and CSZ effects in the
cluster respectively. The central value leads to an estimate of the photon to
scalar (or pseudoscalar) coupling strength of g = (5.2 - 23.8) x 10^{-10}
GeV^{-1}, while the 95% confidence bound is estimated to be g < (8.7 - 39.4) x
10^{-10} GeV^{-1}.
