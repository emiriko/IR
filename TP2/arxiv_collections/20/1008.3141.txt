The decays D^0 -> gamma gamma, $mu^+ mu^- are highly suppressed in the
Standard Model (SM) with the lion's share of the rate coming from long distance
dynamics; D^0 -> mu^+ mu^- is driven predominantly by D^0 -> gamma gamma ->
mu^+ mu^-. Their present experimental bounds are small, yet much larger than SM
predictions. New Physics models like the Littlest Higgs models with T parity
(LHT) can induce even large indirect CP violation in D^0 transitions. One would
guess that LHT has a `fighting chance' to affect these D^0 -> gamma gamma, mu^+
mu^- rates in an observable way. We have found LHT contributions can be much
larger than short distance SM amplitude by orders of magnitude. Yet those can
barely compete with the long distance SM effects. If D^0 -> gamma gamma, mu^+
mu^- modes are observed at greatly enhanced rates, LHT scenarios will not be
candidates for generating such signals. LHT-like frameworks will not yield
larger D^0 rightarrow gamma gamma/mu^+ mu^- rates as they are constrained by B
and K rare decays.
