The equation of state (EOS) of the solar interior is accurately and smoothly
determined from \textit{ab initio} simulations named quantum Langevin molecular
dynamics (QLMD) in the pressure range of $58 \leq P \leq 4.6\times10^5$ Mbar at
the temperature range of $1 \leq T \leq 1500$ eV. The central pressure is
calculated, and compared with other models. The effect of heavy elements such
as carbon and oxygen on the EOS is also discussed.
