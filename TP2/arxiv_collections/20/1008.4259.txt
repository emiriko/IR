A q-modified version of the central limit theorem due to Umarov et al.
affirms that q-Gaussians are attractors under addition and rescaling of certain
classes of strongly correlated random variables. The proof of this theorem
rests on a nonlinear q-modified Fourier transform. By exhibiting an invariance
property we show that this Fourier transform does not have an inverse. As a
consequence, the theorem falls short of achieving its stated goal.
