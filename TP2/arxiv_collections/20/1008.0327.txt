Skew polynomial rings over finite fields ([7] and [10]) and over Galois rings
([8]) have been used to study codes. In this paper, we extend this concept to
finite chain rings. Properties of skew constacyclic codes generated by monic
right divisors of $x^n-\lambda$, where $\lambda$ is a unit element, are
exhibited. When $\lambda^2=1$, the generators of Euclidean and Hermitian dual
codes of such codes are determined together with necessary and sufficient
conditions for them to be Euclidean and Hermitian self-dual. Of more interest
are codes over the ring $\mathbb{F}_{p^m}+u\mathbb{F}_{p^m}$. The structure of
all skew constacyclic codes is completely determined. This allows us to express
generators of Euclidean and Hermitian dual codes of skew cyclic and skew
negacyclic codes in terms of the generators of the original codes. An
illustration of all skew cyclic codes of length~2 over
$\mathbb{F}_{3}+u\mathbb{F}_{3}$ and their Euclidean and Hermitian dual codes
is also provided.
