Imaging ellipsometry studies of graphene on SiO2/Si and crystalline GaAs are
presented. We demonstrate that imaging ellipsometry is a powerful tool to
detect and characterize graphene on any flat substrate. Variable angle
spectroscopic ellipsometry is used to explore the dispersion of the optical
constants of graphene in the visible range with high lateral resolution. In
this way the influence of the substrate on graphene's optical properties can be
investigated
