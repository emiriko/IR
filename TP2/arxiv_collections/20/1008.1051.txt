We consider a generalization of the Gabriel graph, the witness Gabriel graph.
Given a set of vertices P and a set of witnesses W in the plane, there is an
edge ab between two points of P in the witness Gabriel graph GG-(P,W) if and
only if the closed disk with diameter ab does not contain any witness point
(besides possibly a and/or b). We study several properties of the witness
Gabriel graph, both as a proximity graph and as a new tool in graph drawing.
