The Fermi Large Area Telescope, in collaboration with several groups from the
radio community, have had marvellous success at uncovering new gamma-ray
millisecond pulsars (MSPs). In fact, MSPs now make up a sizable fraction of the
total number of known gamma-ray pulsars. The MSP population is characterized by
a variety of pulse profile shapes, peak separations, and radio-to-gamma phase
lags, with some members exhibiting nearly phase-aligned radio and gamma-ray
light curves (LCs). The MSPs' short spin periods underline the importance of
including special relativistic effects in LC calculations, even for emission
originating from near the stellar surface. We present results on modelling and
classification of MSP LCs using standard pulsar model geometries.
