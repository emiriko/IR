Large ground-based telescopes equipped with adaptive optics (AO) systems have
ushered in a new era of high-resolution infrared photometry and astrometry.
Relative astrometric accuracies of <0.2 mas have already been demonstrated from
infrared images with spatial resolutions of 55-95 mas resolution over 10-20''
fields of view. Relative photometric accuracies of 3% and absolute photometric
accuracies of 5%-20% are also possible. I will review improvements and current
limitations in astrometry and photometry with adaptive optics of crowded
stellar fields. These capabilities enable experiments such as measuring orbits
for brown dwarfs and exoplanets, studying our Galaxy's supermassive black hole
and its environment, and identifying individual stars in young star clusters,
which can be used test the universality of the initial mass function.
