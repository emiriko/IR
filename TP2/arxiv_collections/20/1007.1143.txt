Seven years of pulse time-of-arrival measurements have been collected from
observations of the young pulsar PSR B2334+61 using the Nanshan radio telescope
of Urumqi Observatory. A phase-connected solution has been obtained over the
whole data span, 2002 August to 2009 August. This includes a very large glitch
that occurred between 2005 August 26 and September 8 (MJDs 53608 and 53621).
The relative increase in rotational frequency for this glitch,
$\Delta\nu_{g}/\nu~\sim~20.5\times10^{-6}$, is the largest ever seen. Although
accounting for less than 1\% of the glitch, there were two well-defined
exponential decay terms with time constants of 21 and 147 days respectively.
There was also a large long-term increase in the spindown rate with
$\Delta\dot\nu_p/\dot\nu \sim 0.011$ at the time of the glitch. A highly
significant oscillation with a period of close to one year is seen in the
post-glitch residuals. It is very unlikely that this can be accounted for by a
pulsar position error or proper motion -- it appears to result from effects
interior to the neutron star. Implications of these results for pulsar glitch
models are discussed.
