We show that coherent multiple light scattering, or diffuse light
propagation, in a disordered atomic medium, prepared at ultra-low temperatures,
can be be effectively delayed in the presence of a strong control field
initiating a stimulated Raman process. On a relatively short time scale, when
the atomic system can preserve its configuration and effects of atomic motion
can be ignored, the scattered signal pulse, diffusely propagating via multiple
coherent scattering through the medium, can be stored in the spin subsystem
through its stimulated Raman-type conversion into spin coherence. We
demonstrate how this mechanism, potentially interesting for developing quantum
memories, would work for the example of a coherent light pulse propagating
through an alkali-metal atomic vapor under typical conditions attainable in
experiments with ultracold atoms.
