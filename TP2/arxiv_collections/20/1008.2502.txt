We investigate the effects of the dynamic bosonic fluctuations on the Fermi
surface reconstruction in two dimensions as a model for the underdoped
cuprates. At energies larger than the boson energy $\omega_b$, the dynamic
nature of the fluctuations is not important and the quasi-particle dispersion
exhibits the shadow feature like that induced by a static long range order. At
lower energies, however, the shadow feature is pushed away by the finite
$\omega_b$. The detailed low energy features are determined by the bare
dispersion and the coupling of quasi-particles to the dynamic fluctuations. We
present how these factors reconstruct the Fermi surface to produce the Fermi
arcs or the Fermi pockets, or their coexistence. Our principal result is that
the dynamic nature of the fluctuations, without invoking a
yet-to-be-established translational symmetry breaking hidden order, can produce
the Fermi pocket centered away from the $(\pi/2,\pi/2)$ towards the zone center
which may coexist with the Fermi arcs. This is discussed in comparison with the
experimental observations.
