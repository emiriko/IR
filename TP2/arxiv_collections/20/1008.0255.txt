The implementation of exclusive diffractive production of Higgs boson and
dijets in the FPMC (Forward Physics Monte Carlo) framework is presented
following the models by Khoze, Martin, Ryskin and Cudell, Dechambre, Hernandez
and Ivanov. The predictions of the models are compared to the CDF measurement
of exclusive jets and the uncertainties on the Higgs boson and jet production
cross sections at the LHC are discussed.
