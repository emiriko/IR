We show that there is a straightforward algorithm to determine if the
polyhedron guaranteed to exist by Alexandrov's gluing theorem is a degenerate
flat polyhedron, and to reconstruct it from the gluing instructions. The
algorithm runs in O(n^3) time for polygons whose gluings are specified by n
labels.
