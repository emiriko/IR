A well known result of P. Flandrin states that a Gaussian uniquely maximizes
the integral of the Wigner distribution over every centered disc in the phase
plane. While there is no difficulty in generalizing this result to
higher-dimensional poly-discs, the generalization to balls is less obvious. In
this note we provide such a generalization.
