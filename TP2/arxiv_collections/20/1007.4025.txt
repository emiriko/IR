We extend our previous result on the nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation to the
nonlinear Schrodinger equation with the focusing cubic nonlinearity in three
dimensions, for radial data of energy at most slightly above that of the ground
state. We prove that the initial data set splits into nine nonempty, pairwise
disjoint regions which are characterized by the distinct behaviors of the
solution for large time: blow-up, scattering to 0, or scattering to the family
of ground states generated by the phase and scaling freedom. Solutions of this
latter type form a smooth center-stable manifold, which contains the ground
states and separates the phase space locally into two connected regions
exhibiting blow-up and scattering to 0, respectively. The special solutions
found by Duyckaerts and Roudenko appear here as the unique one-dimensional
unstable/stable manifolds emanating from the ground states. In analogy with the
Klein-Gordon case, the proof combines the hyperbolic dynamics near the ground
states with the variational structure away from them. The main technical
ingredient in the proof is a "one-pass" theorem which precludes "almost
homoclinic orbits", i.e., those solutions starting in, then moving away from,
and finally returning to, a small neighborhood of the ground states. The main
new difficulty compared with the Klein-Gordon case is the lack of finite
propagation speed. We need the radial Sobolev inequality for the error estimate
in the virial argument. Another major difference from the Klein-Gordon case is
the need to control two modulation parameters.
