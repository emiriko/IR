In this paper, the electronic band structures and its transport properties in
the gapped graphene superlattices, with one-dimensional (1D) periodic
potentials of square barriers, are systematically investigated. It is found
that a zero averaged wave-number (zero-$\overline{k}$ ) gap is formed inside
the gapped graphene-based superlattices, and the condition for obtaining such a
zero-$\overline{k}$ gap is analytically presented. The properties of this
zero-$\overline{k}$ gap including its transmission, conductance and Fano factor
are studied in detail. Finally it is revealed that the properties of the
electronic transmission, conductance and Fano factor near the
zero-$\overline{k}$ gap are very insensitive to the structural disorder for the
finite graphene-based periodic-barrier systems.
