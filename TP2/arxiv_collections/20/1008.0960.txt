Radiative capture reactions for low energy protons have been theoretically
studied for Ni and Cu isotopes using the microscopic optical model. The optical
potential has been obtained in the folding model using different microscopic
interactions with the nuclear densities from Relativistic Mean Field
calculations. The calculated total cross sections as well as the cross sections
for individually low lying levels have been compared with measurements
involving stable nuclear targets. Rates for the rapid proton capture process
have been evaluated for astrophysically important reactions.
