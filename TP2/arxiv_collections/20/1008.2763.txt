With the assumptions that dark matter consists of an electroweak triplet and
that the gauge couplings unify at a high scale, we identify robust
phenomenological trends of possible matter contents at the TeV scale. In
particular, we expect new colored states within the LHC reach that can have
Yukawa couplings lambda to quarks and the Higgs. We investigate the collider
signatures that are characteristic of all such models by adopting the model
with the simplest matter content as a benchmark. The lambda couplings are
constrained by flavor/CP physics. In the largest portion of the allowed
parameter space the new colored particles are stable on collider time scales,
hence appearing as R-hadrons, for which there is discovery potential at the
early LHC (sqrt{s}=7 TeV, 1 fb^(-1)). Flavor/CP constraints nevertheless do
allow a sizable range of lambda where the new colored particles decay promptly,
providing a new Higgs production channel with a cross-section governed by the
strong interaction. Studying the case of h to WW, we show that it is possible
for the Higgs production from this new channel to be discovered before that
from the Standard Model at the LHC.
