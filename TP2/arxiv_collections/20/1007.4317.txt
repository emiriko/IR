A novel mechanism for explaining the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the
universe is considered. We assume that the universe starts from completely
symmetric state and then, as it cools down, it undergoes a quantum-phase
transition which in turn causes an asymmetry between matter and anti-matter.
The mechanism does not require the baryon number violating interactions or CP
violation at a microscopic level. Our analysis of the matter-antimatter
asymmetry is in the context of conspicuous experimental results obtained in the
condensed-matter physics.
