A generalization of Arnold's strange duality to invertible polynomials in
three variables by the first author and A.Takahashi includes the following
relation. For some invertible polynomials $f$ the Saito dual of the reduced
monodromy zeta function of $f$ coincides with a formal "root" of the reduced
monodromy zeta function of its Berglund-H\"ubsch transpose $f^T$. Here we give
a geometric interpretation of "roots" of the monodromy zeta function and
generalize the above relation to all non-degenerate invertible polynomials in
three variables and to some polynomials in an arbitrary number of variables in
a form including "roots" of the monodromy zeta functions both of $f$ and $f^T$.
