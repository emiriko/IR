We present recent results on the vector meson-vector meson and vector
meson-baryon interaction using a unitary approach based on the hidden-gauge
Lagrangians. For the vector-vector case we find that 11 states get dynamically
generated, corresponding to poles of the scattering matrices on the second
Riemann sheet. In the vector-baryon sector we also find 9 states dynamically
generated from the vector-baryon octet interaction and 10 from the
vector-baryon decuplet interaction. We also report on baryon states found from
the interaction of two mesons and a baryon.
