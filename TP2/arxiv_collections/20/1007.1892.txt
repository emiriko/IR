In this study, we investigate the structure of the polar alkali-Strontium
diatomic molecules as possible candidates for the realization of samples of new
species of ultracold polar molecules. Using a quantum chemistry approach based
on Effective Core Potentials and Core Polarization Potentials, we model these
systems as effective three valence electron systems, allowing for calculation
of electronic properties with Full Configuration Interaction. The potential
curve and the permanent dipole moment of the $^2\Sigma^+$ ground state are
determined as functions of the internuclear distances for LiSr, NaSr, KSr,
RbSr, and CsSr molecules. These molecules are found to exhibit a significant
permanent dipole moment, though smaller than those of the alkali-Rb molecules.
