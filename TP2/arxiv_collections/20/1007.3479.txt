In this paper we study the structure of cohomology spaces for the Frobenius
kernels of unipotent and parabolic algebraic group schemes and of their quantum
analogs. Given a simple algebraic group $G$, a parabolic subgroup $P_J$, and
its unipotent radical $U_J$, we determine the ring structure of the cohomology
ring $H^\bullet((U_J)_1,k)$. We also obtain new results on computing
$H^\bullet((P_J)_1,L(\lambda))$ as an $L_J$-module where $L(\lambda)$ is a
simple $G$-module with high weight $\lambda$ in the closure of the bottom
$p$-alcove. Finally, we provide generalizations of all our results to the
quantum situation.
