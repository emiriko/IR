The lifetimes for the high spin levels of the yrast band of $^{110}$Cd has
been measured. The estimated B(E2) values decrease with increase in angular
momentum. This is the characteristic of Anti magnetic rotation as reported in
$^{106,108}$Cd. However, alignment behavior of $^{110}$Cd is completely
different from its even-even neighbors. A model based on classical particle
plus rotor has been used to explore the underlying systematics and develop a
self consistent picture for the observed behavior of these isotopes.
