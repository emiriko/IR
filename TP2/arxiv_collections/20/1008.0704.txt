We have studied nucleation dynamics of the Ising model in scale-free networks
with degree distribution $P(k)\sim k^{-\gamma}$ by using forward flux sampling
method, focusing on how the network topology would influence the nucleation
rate and pathway. For homogeneous nucleation, the new phase clusters grow from
those nodes with smaller degree, while the cluster sizes follow a power-law
distribution. Interestingly, we find that the nucleation rate $R_{Hom}$ decays
exponentially with the network size $N$, and accordingly the critical nucleus
size increases linearly with $N$, implying that homogeneous nucleation is not
relevant in the thermodynamic limit. These observations are robust to the
change of $\gamma$ and also present in random networks. In addition, we have
also studied the dynamics of heterogeneous nucleation, wherein $w$ impurities
are initially added, either to randomly selected nodes or to targeted ones with
largest degrees. We find that targeted impurities can enhance the nucleation
rate $R_{Het}$ much more sharply than random ones. Moreover, $\ln
(R_{Het}/R_{Hom})$ scales as $w^{\gamma-2/\gamma-1}$ and $w$ for targeted and
random impurities, respectively. A simple mean field analysis is also present
to qualitatively illustrate above simulation results.
