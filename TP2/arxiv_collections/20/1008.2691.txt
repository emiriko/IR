Currently there is a common belief that the explanation of superconductivity
phenomenon lies in understanding the mechanism of the formation of electron
pairs. Paired electrons, however, cannot form a superconducting condensate
spontaneously. These paired electrons perform disorderly zero-point
oscillations and there are no force of attraction in their ensemble. In order
to create a unified ensemble of particles, the pairs must order their
zero-point fluctuations so that an attraction between the particles appears. As
a result of this ordering of zero-point oscillations in the electron gas,
superconductivity arises. This model of condensation of zero-point oscillations
creates the possibility of being able to obtain estimates for the critical
parameters of elementary superconductors, which are in satisfactory agreement
with the measured data. On the another hand, the phenomenon of superfluidity in
He-4 and He-3 can be similarly explained, due to the ordering of zero-point
fluctuations. It is therefore established that both related phenomena are based
on the same physical mechanism.
