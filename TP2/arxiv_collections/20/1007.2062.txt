We investigate a recently developed scheme for quantized charge pumping based
on single-parameter modulation. The device was realized in an AlGaAl-GaAs gated
nanowire. It has been shown theoretically that non-adiabaticity is
fundamentally required to realize single-parameter pumping, while in previous
multi-parameter pumping schemes it caused unwanted and less controllable
currents. In this paper we demonstrate experimentally the constructive and
destructive role of non-adiabaticity by analysing the pumping current over a
broad frequency range.
