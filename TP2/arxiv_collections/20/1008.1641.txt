By idealizing a general mapping as a series of local affine ones, we derive
approximately transformed material parameters necessary to control solid
elastic waves within classical elasticity theory. The transformed elastic
moduli are symmetric, and can be used with Navier's equation to manipulate
elastic waves. It is shown numerically that the method can provide a powerful
tool to control elastic waves in solids in case of high frequency or small
material gradient. Potential applications can be anticipated in nondestructive
testing, structure impact protection, petroleum exploration and seismology.
