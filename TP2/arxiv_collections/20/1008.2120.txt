In this article we prove the absence of relativistic effects in leading order
for the ground-state energy according to Brown-Ravenhall operator. We obtain
this asymptotic result for negative ions and for systems with the number of
electrons proportional to the nuclear charge. In the case of neutral atoms the
analogous result was obtained earlier by Cassanas and Siedentop [4].
