Development of distributed systems is a difficult task. Declarative
programming techniques hold a promising potential for effectively supporting
programmer in this challenge. While Datalog-based languages have been actively
explored for programming distributed systems, Prolog received relatively little
attention in this application area so far. In this paper we present a
Prolog-based programming system, called DAHL, for the declarative development
of distributed systems. DAHL extends Prolog with an event-driven control
mechanism and built-in networking procedures. Our experimental evaluation using
a distributed hash-table data structure, a protocol for achieving Byzantine
fault tolerance, and a distributed software model checker - all implemented in
DAHL - indicates the viability of the approach.
