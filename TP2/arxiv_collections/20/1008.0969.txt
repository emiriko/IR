We present a model of dissipative transport in the fractional quantum Hall
regime. Our model takes account of tunneling through saddle points in the
effective potential for excitations created by impurities. We predict the
temperature range over which activated behavior is observed and explain why
this range nearly always corresponds to around a factor two in temperature in
both integer quantum Hall and fractional quantum Hall systems. We identify the
ratio of the gap observed in the activated behavior and the temperature of the
inflection point in the Arrhenius plot as an important diagnostic for
determining the importance of tunneling in real samples.
