We present here the Data Explorer tool developed at the ASI Science Data
Center (ASDC). This tool is designed to provide an efficient and user-friendly
way to display information residing in several catalogs stored in the ASDC
servers, to cross-correlate this information and to download/analyze data via
our scientific tools and/or external services. Our database includes GRB
catalogs (such as Swift and Beppo-SAX), which can be queried through the Data
Explorer. The GRB fields can be viewed in multiwavelength and the data can be
analyzed or retrieved.
