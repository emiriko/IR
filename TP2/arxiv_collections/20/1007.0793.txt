We present and analyze a protocol for quantum steganography where the sender
(Alice) encodes her steganographic information into the error syndromes of the
perfect (five-qubit) quantum error-correcting code, and sends it to the
receiver (Bob) over a depolarizing channel. Alice and Bob share a classical
secret key, and hide quantum information in such a way that to an eavesdropper
(Eve) without access to the secret key, the quantum message looks like an
innocent codeword with a typical sequence of quantum errors. We calculate the
average rate of key consumption, and show how the protocol improves in
performance as information is spread over multiple codeword blocks. Alice and
Bob utilize different encodings to optimize the average number of
steganographic bits that they can send to each other while matching the error
statistics of the depolarizing channel.
