We explore the O(N)-invariant Non-Linear Sigma Model (NLSM) in a different
perturbative regime from the usual relativistic-free-field one, by using
non-canonical basic commutation relations adapted to the underlying O(N)
symmetry of the system, which also account for the non-trivial (non-flat)
geometry and topology of the target manifold.
