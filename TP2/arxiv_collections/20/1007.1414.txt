We provide asymptotic results and develop high frequency statistical
procedures for time-changed L\'evy processes sampled at random instants. The
sampling times are given by first hitting times of symmetric barriers whose
distance with respect to the starting point is equal to $\varepsilon$. This
setting can be seen as a first step towards a model for tick-by-tick financial
data allowing for large jumps. For a wide class of L\'evy processes, we
introduce a renormalization depending on $\varepsilon$, under which the L\'evy
process converges in law to an $\alpha$-stable process as $\varepsilon$ goes to
$0$. The convergence is extended to moments of hitting times and overshoots. In
particular, these results allow us to construct consistent estimators of the
time change and of the Blumenthal-Getoor index of the underlying L\'evy
process. Convergence rates and a central limit theorem are established under
additional assumptions.
