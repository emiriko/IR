We report dissipative surface solitons forming at the interface between a
semi-infinite lattice and a homogeneous Kerr medium. The solitons exist due to
balance between amplification in the near-surface lattice channel and
two-photon absorption. The stable dissipative surface solitons exist in both
focusing and defocusing media, when propagation constants of corresponding
states fall into a total semi-infinite and or into one of total finite gaps of
the spectrum (i.e. in a domain where propagation of linear waves is inhibited
for the both media). In a general situation, the surface solitons form when
amplification coefficient exceeds threshold value. When a soliton is formed in
a total finite gap there exists also the upper limit for the linear gain.
