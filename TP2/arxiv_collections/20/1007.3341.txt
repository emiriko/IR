The paper proposes a method for measuring available bandwidth, based on
testing network packets of various sizes (Variable Packet Size method, VPS).
The boundaries of applicability of the model have been found, which are based
on the accuracy of measurements of packet delays, also we have derived a
formula of measuring the upper limit of bandwidth. The computer simulation has
been performed and relationship between the measurement error of available
bandwidth and the number of measurements has been found. Experimental
verification with the use of RIPE Test Box measuring system has shown that the
suggested method has advantages over existing measurement techniques. Pathload
utility has been chosen as an alternative technique of measurement, and to
ensure reliable results statistics by SNMP agent has been withdrawn directly
from the router.
