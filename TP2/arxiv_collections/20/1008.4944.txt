The GALFACTS project is using the L-band seven feed array receiver system on
the Arecibo telescope to carry out an imaging spectro-polarimetric survey of
the 30% of the sky visible from Arecibo. GALFACTS observations will create
full-Stokes image cubes at an angular resolution of 3.5', with several thousand
spectral channels covering 1225 - 1525 MHz, and band-averaged sensitivity of 90
uJy, allowing sensitive imaging of polarized radiation and Faraday Rotation
Measure from both diffuse emission and against a high density grid of
extragalactic sources. GALFACTS will be a major observational advance in
imaging of the polarized radiation from the Milky Way and will provide a rich
new database for exploration of the magnetic field of the Galaxy and the
properties of the magneto-ionic medium.
