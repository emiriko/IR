The mass spectrum of heavy pseudoscalar mesons, described as quark-antiquark
bound systems, is considered within the Bethe-Salpeter formalism with
momentum-dependent masses of the constituents. This dependence is found by
solving the Schwinger-Dyson equation for quark propagators in rainbow-ladder
approximation. Such an approximation is known to provide both a fast
convergence of numerical methods and accurate results for lightest mesons.
However, as the meson mass increases, the method becomes less stable and
special attention must be devoted to details of numerical means of solving the
corresponding equations. We focus on the pseudoscalar sector and show that our
numerical scheme describes fairly accurately the $\pi$, $K$, $D$, $D_s$ and
$\eta_c$ ground states. Excited states are considered as well. Our calculations
are directly related to the future physics programme at FAIR.
