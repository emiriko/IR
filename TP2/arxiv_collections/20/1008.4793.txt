We have measured $p_t$-dependent two-particle number correlations on azimuth
and pseudorapidity for eleven centralities of $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 62$ and 200~GeV
Au-Au collisions at STAR. 2D fits to these angular correlations isolate the
azimuth quadrupole amplitude, denoted $2 v_2^2 \{ 2D \} ( p_t )$, from
localized same-side correlations. Event-plane $v_2 ( p_t )$ measurements within
the STAR TPC acceptance can be expressed as a sum of the azimuth quadrupole and
the quadrupole component of the same-side peak. $v_2 \{ 2D \} ( p_t )$ can be
transformed to reveal quadrupole $p_t$ spectra which are approximately
described by a fixed transverse boost and universal L\'evy form nearly
independent of centrality. A parametrization of $v_2 \{ 2D \} ( p_t )$ can be
factored into centrality and $p_t$-dependent pieces with a simple $p_t$
dependence above 0.75 GeV/c. Results from STAR are compared to published data
and model predictions.
