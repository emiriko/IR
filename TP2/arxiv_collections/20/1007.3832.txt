Grand unified theories of fundamental forces predict that magnetic monopoles
are inevitable in the Universe because the second homotopy group of the order
parameter manifold is $\mathbb{Z}$. We point out that monopoles can annihilate
in pairs due to an influence of Alice strings. As a consequence, a monopole
charge is charactarized by $\mathbb{Z}_2$ rather than $\mathbb{Z}$ if the
Universe can accommodate Alice strings, which is the case of certain grand
unified theories.
