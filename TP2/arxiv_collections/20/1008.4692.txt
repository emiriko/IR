We investigate a nonlinear localization microscopy method based on Rabi
oscillations of single emitters. We demonstrate the fundamental working
principle of this new technique using a cryogenic far-field experiment in which
subwavelength features smaller than $\lambda$/10 are obtained. Using Monte
Carlo simulations, we show the superior localization accuracy of this method
under realistic conditions and a potential for higher acquisition speed or a
lower number of required photons as compared to conventional linear schemes.
The method can be adapted to other emitters than molecules and allows for the
localization of several emitters at different distances to a single measurement
pixel.
