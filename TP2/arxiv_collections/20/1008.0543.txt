The near threshold structure of the unbound N=7 isotones 10Li and 9He has
been investigated using proton removal and breakup from intermediate energy (35
MeV/nucleon) secondary beams of 11Be and 14,15B. The coincident detection of
the beam velocity 9Li and 8He fragments and neutrons permitted the relative
energy of the in-flight decay of 10Li and 9He to be reconstructed. Both systems
were found to exhibited virtual s-wave strength near threshold together with a
higher-lying resonance.
