We compare theoretical and experimental predictions of two main classes of
models addressing fermion mass hierarchies and flavour changing neutral
currents (FCNC) effects in supersymmetry: Froggatt-Nielsen (FN) U(1) gauged
flavour models and Nelson-Strassler/extra dimensional models with hierarchical
wave functions for the families. We show that whereas the two lead to identical
predictions in the fermion mass matrices, the second class generates a stronger
suppression of FCNC effects. We prove that, whereas at first sight the FN setup
is more constrained due to anomaly cancelation conditions, imposing unification
of gauge couplings in the second setup generates conditions which precisely
match the mixed anomaly constraints in the FN setup. Finally, we provide an
economical extra dimensional realisation of the hierarchical wave functions
scenario in which the leptonic FCNC can be efficiently suppressed due to the
strong coupling (CFT) origin of the electron mass.
