Two-particle two-hole contributions to electromagnetic response functions are
computed in a fully relativistic Fermi gas model. All one-pion exchange
diagrams that contribute to the scattering amplitude in perturbation theory are
considered, including terms for pionic correlations and meson-exchange currents
(MEC). The pionic correlation terms diverge in an infinite system and thus are
regularized by modification of the nucleon propagator in the medium to take
into account the finite size of the nucleus. The pionic correlation
contributions are found to be of the same order of magnitude as the MEC.
