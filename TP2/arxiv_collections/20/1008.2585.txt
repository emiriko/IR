This paper presents a detailed study of the scattering polarization profiles
formed under partial frequency redistribution (PRD) in two thermal models of
the solar atmosphere. Particular attention is given to understanding the
influence of several atmospheric parameters on the emergent fractional linear
polarization profiles. The shapes of these $Q/I$ profiles are interpreted in
terms of the anisotropy of the radiation field, which in turn depends on the
source function gradient that sets the angular variation of the specific
intensity. We define a suitable frequency integrated anisotropy factor for PRD
that can be directly related to the emergent linear polarization. We show that
complete frequency redistribution is a good approximation to model weak
resonance lines. We also show that the emergent linear polarization profiles
can be very sensitive to the thermal structure of the solar atmosphere and, in
particular, to spatial variations of the damping parameter.
