We present results from spectral and temporal analyses of Suzaku and RXTE
observations of the high mass X-ray binary LMC X-4. Using the full 13 years of
available RXTE/ASM data, we apply the ANOVA and Lomb normalized Periodogram
methods to obtain an improved superorbital period measurement of 30.32 +/- 0.04
days. The phase-averaged X-ray spectra from Suzaku observations during the high
state of the superorbital period can be modeled in the 0.6--50 keV band as the
combination of a power-law with Gamma ~ 0.6 and a high-energy cutoff at ~ 25
keV, a blackbody with kT_BB ~ 0.18 keV, and emission lines from Fe K_alpha, O
VIII, and Ne IX (X Lyalpha). Assuming a distance of 50 kpc, The source has
luminosity L_X ~ 3 x 10^38 ergs s^-1 in the 2--50 keV band, and the luminosity
of the soft (blackbody) component is L_BB ~ 1.5 x 10^37 ergs s^-1. The energy
resolved pulse profiles show single-peaked soft (0.5-1 keV) and hard (6-10 keV)
pulses but a more complex pattern of medium (2-10 keV) pulses;
cross-correlation of the hard with the soft pulses shows a phase shift that
varies between observations. We interpret these results in terms of a picture
in which a precessing disk reprocesses the hard X-rays and produces the
observed soft spectral component, as has been suggested for the similar sources
Her X-1 and SMC X-1.
