We report on low-energy electron microscopy imaging of ferroelectric domains
with submicron resolution. Periodic strips of 'up' and 'down'-polarized
ferroelectric domains in bismuth ferrite -a room temperature multiferroic-
serve as a model system to compare low-energy electron microscopy with the
established piezoresponse force microscopy. The results confirm the possibility
of full-field imaging of ferroelectric domains with short acquisition times by
exploiting the sensitivity of ultraslow electrons to small variations of the
electric potential near surfaces in the "mirror" operation mode.
