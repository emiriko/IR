Mirror dark matter offers a framework to explain the existing dark matter
direct detection experiments. Here we confront this theory with the most recent
experimental data, paying attention to the various known systematic
uncertainties, in quenching factor, detector resolution, galactic rotational
velocity and velocity dispersion. We perform a detailed analysis of the DAMA
and CoGeNT experiments assuming a negligible channeling fraction and find that
the data can be fully explained within the mirror dark matter framework. We
also show that the mirror dark matter candidate can explain recent data from
the CDMS/Ge, EdelweissII and CRESSTII experiments and we point out ways in
which the theory can be further tested in the near future.
