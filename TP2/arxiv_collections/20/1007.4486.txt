By means of the offered analytical method the determinant relation for a
phase velocities of elastic waves for an arbitrary propagation directions in a
piezoelectric crystal are received. The phase velocities of three normal
elastic waves for the crystal of LiNbO3 are calculated. Results of this
calculation for each of waves are presented graphically in the form of the
cards allowing easily to define phase velocities in any given direction in
crystal.
