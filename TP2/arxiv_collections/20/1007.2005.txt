In this paper some important inequalities are revisited. First, as
motivation, we give another proof of the Hardy's inequality applying convenient
vector fields as introduced by Mitidieri, see [6]. Then, we investigate a
particular case of the Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg's inequality. Finally, we
study the Rellic's inequality.
