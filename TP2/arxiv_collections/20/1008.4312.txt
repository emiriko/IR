We announce the discovery of a new low-mass, pre-main sequence eclipsing
binary, MML 53. Previous observations of MML 53 found it to be a pre-main
sequence spectroscopic multiple associated with the 15-22 Myr Upper Centaurus
Lupus cluster. We identify the object as an eclipsing binary for the first time
through the analysis of multiple seasons of time series photometry from the
SuperWASP transiting planet survey. Re-analysis of a single archive spectrum
shows MML 53 to be a spatially unresolved triple system of young stars which
all exhibit significant lithium absorption. Two of the components comprise an
eclipsing binary with period, P = 2.097891(6) +- 0.000005 and mass ratio,
q~0.8. Here, we present the analysis of the discovery data.
