This paper deals with the index reduction problem for the class of
quasi-regular DAE systems. It is shown that any of these systems can be
transformed to a generically equivalent first order DAE system consisting of a
single purely algebraic (polynomial) equation plus an under-determined ODE
(that is, a semi-explicit DAE system of differentiation index 1) in as many
variables as the order of the input system. This can be done by means of a
Kronecker-type algorithm with bounded complexity.
