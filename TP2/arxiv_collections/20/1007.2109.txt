The work developed in the paper concerns the multivariate fractional Brownian
motion (mfBm) viewed through the lens of the wavelet transform. After recalling
some basic properties on the mfBm, we calculate the correlation structure of
its wavelet transform. We particularly study the asymptotic behavior of the
correlation, showing that if the analyzing wavelet has a sufficient number of
null first order moments, the decomposition eliminates any possible long-range
(inter)dependence. The cross-spectral density is also considered in a second
part. Its existence is proved and its evaluation is performed using a von
Bahr-Essen like representation of the function $\sign(t) |t|^\alpha$. The
behavior of the cross-spectral density of the wavelet field at the zero
frequency is also developed and confirms the results provided by the asymptotic
analysis of the correlation.
