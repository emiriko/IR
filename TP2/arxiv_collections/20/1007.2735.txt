On the base of the most qualitative GOES satellites data for the period AD
1980-2009 and multiple regression model the "synthetic" series of the monthly
numbers of soft X-ray flares (separately for the classes C, M, X and total
numbers) were built for the epoch AD 1968-2009. The earlier parts of the series
before AD 1980 were derived on the base of the mentioned model . The monthly
numbers of radio bursts at four frequencies (29-33, 609, 8800 and 15400 MHz)
and the radio flux at 2800 MHz (F10.7) are used as factors. The relationships
are very strong (correlation coefficients R are from 0.79 to 0.93 and
Snedekor-Fisher's F parameter is in the range of 2.5-7). The earlier GOES X-ray
data (AD 1975-1979) and the older SOLRAD satellite data (AD 1968-1974) are not
enough certain, which suggests a probable reduction effect because of the low
instrumental sensitivity. It has also been found that the relatively weak
sunspot Zurich cycle No 20 is essentially richer of flares of the strongest
class X than the next three cycles No 21-23.
