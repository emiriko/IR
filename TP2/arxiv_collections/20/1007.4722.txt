Interior to the gaseous envelopes of Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, there are
high-density cores with masses larger than 10 Earth masses. According to the
conventional sequential accretion hypothesis, such massive cores are needed for
the onset of efficient accretion of their gaseous envelopes. However, Jupiter's
gaseous envelope is more massive and core may be less massive than those of
Saturn. In order to account for this structural diversity and the super-solar
metallicity in the envelope of Jupiter and Saturn, we investigate the
possibility that they may have either merged with other gas giants or consumed
several Earth-mass proto-planetary embryos during or after the rapid accretion
of their envelope. In general, impinging sub-Earth-mass planetesimals
disintegrate in gas giants' envelopes deposit heavy elements well outside the
cores and locally suppress the convection. Consequently, their fragments
sediment to promote the growth of cores. Through a series of numerical
simulations, we show that it is possible for colliding super-Earth-mass embryos
to reach the cores of gas giants. Direct parabolic collisions also lead to the
coalescence of gas giants and merging of their cores. In these cases, the
energy released from the impact leads to vigorous convective motion throughout
the envelope and the erosion of the cores. This dichotomy contributes to the
observed dispersion in the internal structure and atmospheric composition
between Jupiter and Saturn and other gas giant planets and elsewhere.
