High-pressure electrical resistivity measurements up to 3.0GPa have been
performed on EuFe2As2 single crystals with residual resistivity ratios RRR=7
and 15. At ambient pressure, a magnetic / structural transition related to
FeAs-layers is observed at T0 =190K and 194K for samples with RRR=7 and 15,
respectively. Application of hydrostatic pressure suppresses T0, and then
induces similar superconducting behavior in the samples with different RRR
values. However, the critical pressure 2.7GPa, where T0=0, for the samples with
RRR=15 is slightly but distinctly larger than 2.5GPa for the samples with
RRR=7.
