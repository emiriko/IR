There is much debate on how public participation and expertise can be brought
together in collaborative knowledge environments. One of the experiments
addressing the issue directly is Citizendium. In seeking to harvest the
strengths (and avoiding the major pitfalls) of both user-generated wiki
projects and traditional expert-approved reference works, it is a wiki to which
anybody can contribute using their real names, while those with specific
expertise are given a special role in assessing the quality of content. Upon
fulfillment of a set of criteria like factual and linguistic accuracy, lack of
bias, and readability by non-specialists, these entries are forked into two
versions: a stable (and thus citable) approved "cluster" (an article with
subpages providing supplementary information) and a draft version, the latter
to allow for further development and updates. We provide an overview of how
Citizendium is structured and what it offers to the open knowledge communities,
particularly to those engaged in education and research. Special attention will
be paid to the structures and processes put in place to provide for transparent
governance, to encourage collaboration, to resolve disputes in a civil manner
and by taking into account expert opinions, and to facilitate navigation of the
site and contextualization of its contents.
