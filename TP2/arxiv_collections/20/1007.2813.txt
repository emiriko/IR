A state where spin currents exist in the absence of external fields has
recently been proposed to describe the superconducting state of metals. It is
proposed here that such a state also describes the ground state of aromatic
molecules. It is argued that this point of view provides a more natural
explanation for the large diamagnetic susceptibilities and NMR shifts observed
in these molecules than the conventional viewpoint, and it provides a unified
description of aromatic molecules and superconductors as sought by F. London. A
six-atom ring model is solved by exact diagonalization and parameters in the
model where a ground state spin current exists are found. We suggest that this
physics plays a key role in biological matter.
