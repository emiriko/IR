Wiseman and co-workers (Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 140402, 2007) proposed a
distinction between the nonlocality classes of Bell's nonlocality, steering and
entanglement based on whether or not an overseer trusts each party in a
bipartite scenario where they are asked to demonstrate entanglement. Here we
extend that concept to the multipartite case and derive inequalities that
progressively test for those classes of nonlocality, with different thresholds
for each level. This framework includes the three classes of nonlocality above
in special cases and introduces a family of others.
