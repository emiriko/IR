There exist power contrast in even and odd multipoles of WMAP power spectrum
at low and intermediate multipole range. This anomaly is explicitly associated
with the angular power spectrum, which are heavily used for cosmological model
fitting. Having noted this, we have investigated whether even(odd) multipole
data set is consistent with the WMAP concordance model. Our investigation shows
WMAP concordance model does not make a good fit for even(odd) multipole data
set, and there exist tension between two data subsets. Noting tension is
highest in primordial power spectrum parameters, we have additionally
considered a running spectral index, but find tension increases to even a
higher level. We believe these parametric tensions may be indications of
unaccounted contamination or imperfection of the model.
