We consider the evaluation of approximate top-k queries from relations with
a-priori unknown values. Such relations can arise for example in the context of
expensive predicates, or cloud-based data sources. The task is to find an
approximate top-k set that is close to the exact one while keeping the total
processing cost low. The cost of a query is the sum of the costs of the entries
that are read from the hidden relation. A novel aspect of this work is that we
consider prior information about the values in the hidden matrix. We propose an
algorithm that uses regression models at query time to assess whether a row of
the matrix can enter the top-k set given that only a subset of its values are
known. The regression models are trained with existing data that follows the
same distribution as the relation subjected to the query. To evaluate the
algorithm and to compare it with a method proposed previously in literature, we
conduct experiments using data from a context sensitive Wikipedia search
engine. The results indicate that the proposed method outperforms the baseline
algorithms in terms of the cost while maintaining a high accuracy of the
returned results.
