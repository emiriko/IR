We study the dynamical percolation transition of the geometrical clusters in
the two-dimensional Ising model when it is subjected to a pulsed field below
the critical temperature. The critical exponents are independent of the
temperature and pulse width and are different from the (static) percolation
transition associated with the thermal transition. For a different model that
belongs to the Ising universality class, the exponents are found to be same,
confirming that the behavior is a common feature of the Ising class. These
observations, along with a universal critical Binder cumulant value,
characterize the dynamical percolation of the Ising universality class.
