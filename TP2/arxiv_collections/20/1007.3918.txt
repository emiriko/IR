We establish the dominant effect of anisotropic weak localization (WL) in
three dimensions associated with a propagative Fermi surface, on the
conductivity correction in heavily nitrogen doped ultrananocrystalline diamond
(UNCD) films based on magneto-resistance studies at low temperatures. Also, low
temperature electrical conductivity can show weakly localized transport in 3D
combined with the effect of electron-electron interactions in these materials,
which is remarkably different from the conductivity in 2DWL or strong
localization regime. The corresponding dephasing time of electronic
wavefunctions in these systems described as ~ T^-p with p < 1, follows a
relatively weak temperature dependence compared to the generally expected
nature for bulk dirty metals having $p \geq 1$. The temperature dependence of
Hall (electron) mobility together with an enhanced electron density has been
used to interpret the unusual magneto-transport features and show delocalized
electronic transport in these n-type UNCD films, which can be described as
low-dimensional superlattice structures.
