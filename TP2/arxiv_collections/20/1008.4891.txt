We study a shot noise of a wide channel gated high-frequency transistor at
temperature of 4.2K near pinch-off. In this regime, a transition from the
metallic to the insulating state is expected to occur, accompanied by the
increase of the partition noise. The dependence of the noise spectral density
on current is found to be slightly nonlinear. At low currents, the differential
Fano factor is enhanced compared to the universal value 1/3 for metallic
diffusive conductors. We explain this result by the effect of thermal
fluctuations in a nonlinear regime near pinch-off, without calling for the
enhanced partition noise.
