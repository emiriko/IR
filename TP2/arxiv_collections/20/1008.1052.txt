We introduce a new approach to the subject of grand unification which allows
the GUT scale to be small, \lesssim 200 TeV, so that it is within the reach of
{\em conceivable} laboratory accelerated colliding beam devices. Central to the
approach is a novel abstraction of the heterotic string symmetry group physics
ideas to render baryon number violating effects small enough to have escaped
detection to date.
