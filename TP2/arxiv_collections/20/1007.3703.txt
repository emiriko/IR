Previous studies suggest that the planet-forming disks around very-low-mass
stars/brown dwarfs may be flatter than those around more massive stars, in
contrast to model predictions of larger scale heights for gas-disks around
lower-mass stars. We conducted a statistically robust study to determine
whether there is evidence for stellar-mass-dependent disk structure in
planet-forming disks. We find a statistically significant difference in the
Spitzer/IRAC color distributions of disks around very-low-mass and low-mass
stars all belonging to the same star-forming region, the Chamaeleon I
star-forming region. We show that self consistently calculated disk models
cannot fit the median spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the two groups.
These SEDs can be only explained by flatter disk models, consistent with the
effect of dust settling in disks. We find that relative to the disk structure
predicted for flared disks the required reduction in disk scale height is
anti-correlated with the stellar mass, i.e. disks around lower-mass stars are
flatter. Our results show that the initial and boundary conditions of planet
formation are stellar-mass-dependent, an important finding that must be
considered in planet formation models.
