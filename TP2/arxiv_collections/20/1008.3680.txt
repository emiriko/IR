In this paper, we characterize several properties of commutative notherian
local rings in terms of the left perpendicular category of the category of
finitely generated modules of finite projective dimension. As an application we
prove that a local ring is regular if (and only if) there exists a strong test
module for projectivity having finite projective dimension. We also obtain
corresponding results with respect to a semidualizing module.
