The recently synthesized layered nickelate La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_8$, with its
cuprate-like NiO$_2$ layers, seemingly requires a Ni1 ($d^8$)+2Ni2 ($d^9$)
charge order, together with strong correlation effects, to account for its
insulating behavior. Using density functional methods including strong
intra-atomic repulsion (Hubbard U), we obtain an insulating state via a new
mechanism: {\it without charge order}, Mott insulating behavior arises based on
quantum coupled, spin-aligned Ni2-Ni1-Ni2 $d_{z^2}$ states across the trilayer
(rather than based on atomic states), with antiferromagnetic ordering within
layers. The weak and frustrated magnetic coupling between cells may account for
the small spin entropy that is removed at the N\'eel transition at 105 K and
the lack of any diffraction peak at the N\'eel point.
