The magnetic properties of a variety of materials with promise for
technological applications have been described by models in which fermions are
coupled to local moment spins. Monte Carlo studies of such models usually
ignore electron-electron interactions, even though the energy scale
corresponding to these interactions may be comparable to or larger than other
relevant energy scales. In this work we add on-site interactions between
fermions to the double exchange model which we study with a Monte Carlo scheme
in which temporal fluctuations of local moment spins are fully accounted for
and electron-electron interactions are treated at a mean field level. We show
that when the number of fermions is considerably less than the number of local
moments even moderate interactions can lead to significant enhancement of
ferromagnetism and the Curie temperature.
