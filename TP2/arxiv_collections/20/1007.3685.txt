As a result of a new improved fit to old bubble chamber data of the dominant
axial C_5^A nucleon-to-Delta form factor, and due to the relevance of this form
factor for neutrino induced coherent pion production, we re-evaluate our model
predictions in Phys. Rev. D79, 013002 (2009) for different observables of the
latter reaction. Central values for the total cross sections increase by 20% to
30%, while differential cross sections do not change their shape appreciably.
Furthermore, we also compute the uncertainties on total, differential and flux
averaged cross sections induced by the errors in the determination of C_5^A.
Our new results turn out to be compatible within about 1 sigma with the former
ones. Finally, we stress the existing tension between the recent experimental
determination of the sigma(CC coh \pi^+)/sigma(NC coh \pi^0) ratio by the
SciBooNE Collaboration and the theoretical predictions.
