In this article we present studies of the near threshold pp-->ppK+K- reaction
in view of the K+K- final state interaction. The investigations include
analysis of both the low-energy K+K- invariant mass distributions measured by
COSY-11 collaboration at excess energies of Q = 10 MeV and Q = 28 MeV and the
near threshold excitation function for the pp-->ppK+K- reaction. As a result of
these studies we have estimated the K+K- scattering length more precise
compared to the previous analysis based only on the analysis of the
differential cross sections.
