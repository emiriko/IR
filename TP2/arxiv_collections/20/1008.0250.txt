We assumed that significant enlargement of the functional properties of the
family of quaternary ZrCuSiAs-like pnictide-oxides, often called also as 1111
phases, which are known now first of all as parent phases for new FeAs
superconductors, may be achieved by replacement of nonmagnetic ions by magnetic
ions in semiconducting ZrCuSiAs-like phases. We checked this assumption by
means of first-principles FLAPW-GGA calculations using a wide-band-gap
semiconductor YZnAsO doped with Mn, Fe, and Co as an example. Our main finding
is that substitution of Mn, Fe, and Co for Zn leads to drastic transformations
of electronic and magnetic properties of the parent material: as distinct from
the non-magnetic YZnAsO, the examined doped phases YZn0.89Mn0.11AsO,
YZn0.89Fe0.11AsO, and YZn0.89Co0.11AsO behave as a magnetic semiconductor, a
magnetic half-metal or as a magnetic gapless semi-metal, respectively.
