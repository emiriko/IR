Recently nonparametric functional model with functional responses has been
proposed within the functional reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (fRKHS)
framework. Motivated by its superior performance and also its limitations, we
propose a Gaussian process model whose posterior mode coincide with the fRKHS
estimator. The Bayesian approach has several advantages compared to its
predecessor. Firstly, the multiple unknown parameters can be inferred together
with the regression function in a unified framework. Secondly, as a Bayesian
method, the statistical inferences are straightforward through the posterior
distributions. We also use the predictive process models adapted from the
spatial statistics literature to overcome the computational limitations, thus
extending the applicability of this popular technique to a new problem.
Modifications of predictive process models are nevertheless critical in our
context to obtain valid inferences. The numerical results presented demonstrate
the effectiveness of the modifications.
