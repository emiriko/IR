The ratio of the static matter structure factor measured in experiments on
coherent X-ray scattering to the static structure factor measured in
experiments on neutron scattering is considered. It is shown theoretically that
this ratio in the long-wavelength limit is equal to the nucleus charge at
arbitrary thermodynamic parameters of a pure substance (the system of nuclei
and electrons, where interaction between particles is pure Coulomb) in a
disordered equilibrium state. This result is the exact relation of the quantum
statistical mechanics. The experimental verification of this relation can be
done in the long wavelength X-ray and neutron experiments.
