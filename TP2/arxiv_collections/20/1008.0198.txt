Based on the known physics of the excitonic superfluid or 111 state of the
quantum Hall \nu=1/2+1/2 bilayer, we create a simple trial wavefunction ansatz
for constructing a low energy branch of (Goldstone) excitations by taking the
overall ground state and boosting one layer with respect to the other. This
ansatz works extremely well for any interlayer spacing. For small d this is
simply the physics of the Goldstone mode, whereas for large d this is a
reflection of composite fermion physics. We find hints that certain aspects of
composite fermion physics persist to low d whereas certain aspects of Goldstone
mode physics persist to high d. Using these results we show nonmonotonic
behavior of the Goldstone mode velocity as a function of d.
