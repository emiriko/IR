We present generating functions for extensions of multiplicative invariants
of wreath symmetric products of orbifolds presented as the quotient by the
locally free action of a compact, connected Lie group in terms of orbifold
sector decompositions. Particularly interesting instances of these product
formulas occur for the Euler and Euler--Satake characteristics, which we
compute for a class of weighted projective spaces. This generalizes results
known for global quotients by finite groups to all closed, effective orbifolds.
We also describe a combinatorial approach to extensions of multiplicative
invariants using decomposable functors that recovers the formula for the
Euler--Satake characteristic of a wreath product of a global quotient orbifold.
