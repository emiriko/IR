Entanglement in topological phases of matter has so far been investigated
through the perspective of their ground-state wave functions. In contrast, we
demonstrate that the \emph{excitations} of fractional quantum Hall (FQH)
systems also contain information to identify the system's topological order.
Entanglement spectrum of the FQH quasihole (QH) excitations is shown to
differentiate between the conformal field theory (CFT) sectors, based on the
relative position of the QH with respect to the entanglement cut. For
Read-Rezayi model states, as well as Coulomb interaction eigenstates, the
counting of the QH entanglement levels in the thermodynamic limit matches
exactly the CFT counting, and sector changes occur as non-Abelian quasiholes
successively cross the entanglement cut.
