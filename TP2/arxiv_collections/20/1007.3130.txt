Arguing about the equilibrium distribution of continuous-time Markov chains
can be vital for showing properties about the underlying systems. For example
in biological systems, bistability of a chemical reaction network can hint at
its function as a biological switch. Unfortunately, the state space of these
systems is infinite in most cases, preventing the use of traditional steady
state solution techniques. In this paper we develop a new approach to tackle
this problem by first retrieving geometric bounds enclosing a major part of the
steady state probability mass, followed by a more detailed analysis revealing
state-wise bounds.
