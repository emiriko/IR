The study of strongly correlated quantum gases in two dimensions has
important ramifications for understanding many intriguing pheomena in solid
materials, such as high-$T_{c}$ superconductivity and the fractional quantum
Hall effect. However, theoretical methods are plagued by the existence of
significant quantum fluctuations. Here, we present two- and three-body exact
solutions for both fermions and bosons trapped in a two-dimensional harmonic
potential, with an arbitrary $s$-wave scattering length. These few-particle
solutions link in a natural way to the high-temperature properties of
many-particle systems via a quantum virial expansion. As a concrete example,
using the energy spectrum of few fermions, we calculate the second and third
virial coefficients of a strongly interacting Fermi gas in two dimensions, and
consequently investigate its high-temperature thermodynamics. Our thermodynamic
results may be useful for ongoing experiments on two-dimensional Fermi gases.
These exact results also provide an unbiased benchmark for quantum Monte Carlo
simulations of two-dimensional Fermi gases at high temperatures.
