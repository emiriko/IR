Physical processes resulting in the anomalous (cubic) dependence of the
small-angle IR scattering intensity from near-surface layers of mechanically
polished silicon and germanium wafers on the photoexcitation power were
revealed. It was shown that extended linear defects and dislocations in the
damaged region contribute predominantly to carrier scattering.
