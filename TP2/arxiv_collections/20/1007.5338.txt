One consequence of the application of superconductivity to accelerator
construction is that the power consumption of accelerators will become much
smaller. This raises the old possibility of using high energy protons to make
neutrons which are then absorbed by fertile uranium or thorium to make a
fissionable material like plutonium that can be burned in a nuclear reactor.
The Energy Doubler/Saver being constructed at Fermilab is to be a
superconducting accelerator that will produce 1000 GeV protons. The expected
intensity of about $10^{12}$ protons per second corresponds to a beam power of
about 0.2 MW. The total power requirements of the Doubler will be about 20 MW
of which the injector complex will use approximately 13 MW, and the
refrigeration of the superconducting magnets will use about 7 MW. Thus the beam
power as projected is only a few orders of magnitude less than the accelerator
power. But each 1000 GeV proton will produce about 60,000 neutrons in each
nuclear cascade shower that is releaseq in a block of uranium, and then most of
these neutrons will be absorbed to produce 60,000 plutonium a toms. Each of
these when burned will Subsequently release about 0.2 GeV of fission energy to
make a total energy of 12,000 GeV (20 ergs) for each 1000 GeV proton. Inasmuch
as megawatts are involved, it appears to be worthwhile to consider the cost of
making the protons to see if there could be an overall energy production.
