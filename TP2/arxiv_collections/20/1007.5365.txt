We present electronic structure calculations, electrical resistivity data and
the first specific heat measurements in the normal and superconducting states
of quasi-one-dimensional M2Mo6Se6 (M = Tl, In, Rb). Rb2Mo6Se6 undergoes a
metal-insulator transition at ~170K: electronic structure calculations indicate
that this is likely to be driven by the formation of a dynamical charge density
wave. However, Tl2Mo6Se6 and In2Mo6Se6 remain metallic down to low temperature,
with superconducting transitions at Tc = 4.2K and 2.85K respectively. The
absence of any metal-insulator transition in these materials is due to a larger
in-plane bandwidth, leading to increased inter-chain hopping which suppresses
the density wave instability. Electronic heat capacity data for the
superconducting compounds reveal an exceptionally low density of states DEF =
0.055 states eV^-1 atom^-1, with BCS fits showing 2Delta/kBTc >= 5 for
Tl2Mo6Se6 and 3.5 for In2Mo6Se6. Modelling the lattice specific heat with a set
of Einstein modes, we obtain the approximate phonon density of states F(w).
Deconvolving the resistivity for the two superconductors then yields their
electron-phonon transport coupling function a^2F(w). In Tl2Mo6Se6 and
In2Mo6Se6, F(w) is dominated by an optical "guest ion" mode at ~5meV and a set
of acoustic modes from ~10-30meV. Rb2Mo6Se6 exhibits a similar spectrum;
however, the optical phonon has a lower intensity and is shifted to ~8meV.
Electrons in Tl2Mo6Se6 couple strongly to both sets of modes, whereas In2Mo6Se6
only displays significant coupling in the 10-18meV range. Although pairing is
clearly not mediated by the guest ion phonon, we believe it has a beneficial
effect on superconductivity in Tl2Mo6Se6, given its extraordinarily large
coupling strength and higher Tc compared to In2Mo6Se6.
