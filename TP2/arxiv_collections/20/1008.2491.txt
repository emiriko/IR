The LHC in Geneva is already operating at a total energy of $7 TeV$ and
hopefully after a pause in 2012, it will attain its full capacity of $14 TeV$
in 2013. These are the highest energies achieved todate in any accelerator. It
is against this backdrop that it is worthwhile to revisit very high energy
collisions of Fermions (Cf. also \cite{bgspp}). We will in fact examine their
behaviour at such energies.
