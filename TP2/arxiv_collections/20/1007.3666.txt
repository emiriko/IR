We present integral field spectroscopy in the near infrared (NIR) of He 2-10
and NGC 5253, two well known nearby dwarf irregular galaxies showing high
star-formation rates. Our data provide an unprecedented detailed view of the
interstellar medium and star formation in these galaxies, allowing us to obtain
spatially resolved information from the NIR emission and absorption line
tracers. We study the spatial distribution and kinematics of different
components of the interstellar medium (ISM) mostly through the Bracket series
lines, the molecular hydrogen spectrum, [FeII] emission, and CO absorptions.
Although the ISM is mostly photo-excited, as derived by the [FeII]/Bry and H2
line ratios, some regions corresponding to non-thermal radio sources show a
[FeII]/Bry excess due to a significant contribution of SN driven shocks. In He
2-10 we find that the molecular gas clouds, as traced by CO(2-1) and H2
infrared line, show consistent morphologies and velocities when studied with
the two different tracers. Moreover, there is a clear association with the
youngest super star clusters as traced by the ionized gas. In the same galaxy
we observe a cavity depleted of gas, which is surrounded by some of the most
active regions of star formation, that we interpret as a signature of
feedback-induced star formation from older episodes of star formation. Finally,
we measured high turbulence in the ISM of both galaxies, sigma~30-80 km/s,
driven by the high star-formation activity.
