Using molecular dynamics simulations, we study the effect of pressure on the
binding propensity of small RNAs by calculating the free energy barrier
corresponding to the looped out conformations of unmatched base, which
presumably acts as the binding sites for ligands. We find that the free energy
associated with base looping out increases monotonically as the pressure is
increased. Furthermore, we calculate the mean first passage time of
conformational looping out of the base bulge using the diffusion of reaction
coordinate associated with the base flipping on the underlying free energy
surface. We find that the mean first passage time associated with bulge looping
out increases slowly upon increasing pressures $P$ upto $2$~kbar but changes
dramatically for $P>2$~kbar. Finally, we discuss our results in the light of
the role of hydration shell of water around RNA.
