Relativistic coupled-cluster (RCC) calculations have been performed to
estimate the electromagnetic forbidden transition probabilities, oscillator
strengths and lifetimes of many low-lying states of five times ionized
molybdenum (Mo VI). Contributions from the Breit interaction up to the first
order of perturbation have been examined. Our results are in good agreement
with the available other reported theoretical and experimental results. A long
lifetime about 4.9854 s of the first excited state, 4d $^2D_{5/2}$, has been
predicted which can be a very useful criteria in the doping process of thin
films. Correlations trends from various RCC terms to the transition amplitude
calculations are discussed.
