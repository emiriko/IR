The publicly available package for an automated dipole subtraction,
AutoDipole, is extended to include the SUSY dipoles in the MSSM. All fields in
the SM and the MSSM are available. The code is checked against the analytical
expressions for a simple process. The extended package makes it possible to
compute the QCD NLO corrections to SUSY multi-parton processes like the stop
pair production plus jets at the LHC.
