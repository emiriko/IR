We explore the possibility of detecting many-body entanglement using
time-of-flight (TOF) momentum correlations in ultracold atomic fermi gases. In
analogy to the vacuum correlations responsible for Bekenstein-Hawking black
hole entropy, a partitioned atomic gas will exhibit particle-hole correlations
responsible for entanglement entropy. The signature of these momentum
correlations might be detected by a sensitive TOF type experiment.
