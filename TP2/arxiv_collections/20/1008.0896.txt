We demonstrate a miniature self-injection locked DFB laser using resonant
optical feedback from a high-Q crystalline whispering gallery mode resonator.
The linewidth reduction factor is greater than 10,000, with resultant
instantaneous linewidth less than 200 Hz. The minimal value of the Allan
deviation for the laser frequency stability is 3x10^(-12) at the integration
time of 20 us. The laser possesses excellent spectral purity and good long term
stability.
