Associators were introduced by Drinfel'd in as a monodromy representation of
a KZ equation. Associators can be briefly described as formal series in two
non-commutative variables satisfying three quations. These three equations
yield a large number of algebraic relations between the coefficients of the
series, a situation which is particularly interesting in the case of the
original Drinfel'd associator, whose coefficients are multiple zetas values. In
the first part of this paper, we work out these algebraic relations among
multiple zeta values by direct use of the defining relations of associators.
While well-known for the first two relations, the algebraic relations we obtain
for the third (pentagonal) relation, which are algorithmically explicit
although we do not have a closed formula, do not seem to have been previously
written down. The second part of the paper shows that if one has an explicit
basis for the bar-construction of the moduli space of genus zero Riemann
surfaces with 5 marked points at one's disposal, then the task of writing down
the algebraic relations corresponding to the pentagon relation becomes
significantly easier and more economical compared to the direct calculation
above. We also discuss the explicit basis described by Brown and Gangl, which
is dual to the basis of the enveloping algebra of the braids Lie algebra.
