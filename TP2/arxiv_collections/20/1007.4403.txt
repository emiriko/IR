That static electric and magnetic fields can store momentum may be
perplexing, but is necessary to ensure total conservation of momentum. Simple
situations in which such field momentum is transferred to nearby bodies and
point charges have often been considered for pedagogical purposes, normally
assuming vacuum surroundings. If dielectric media are involved, however, the
analysis becomes more delicate, not least since one encounters the
electromagnetic energy-momentum problem in matter, the `Abraham-Minkowski
enigma', of what the momentum is of a photon in matter. We analyze the momentum
balance in three nontrivial examples obeying azimuthal symmetry, showing how
the momentum conservation is satisfied as the magnetic field decays and
momentum is transferred to bodies present. In the last of the examples, that of
point charge outside a dielectric sphere in an infinite magnetic field, we find
that not all of the field momentum is transferred to the nearby bodies; a part
of the momentum appears to vanish as momentum flux towards infinity. We discuss
this and other surprising observations which can be attributed to the
assumption of magnetic fields of infinite extent. We emphasize how formal
arguments of conserved quantities cannot determine which energy-momentum tensor
is more "correct", and each of our conservation checks may be performed equally
well in the Minkowski or Abraham framework.
