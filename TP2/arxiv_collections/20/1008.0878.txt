High penetration levels of distributed photovoltaic(PV) generation on an
electrical distribution circuit present several challenges and opportunities
for distribution utilities. Rapidly varying irradiance conditions may cause
voltage sags and swells that cannot be compensated by slowly responding utility
equipment resulting in a degradation of power quality. Although not permitted
under current standards for interconnection of distributed generation,
fast-reacting, VAR-capable PV inverters may provide the necessary reactive
power injection or consumption to maintain voltage regulation under difficult
transient conditions. As side benefit, the control of reactive power injection
at each PV inverter provides an opportunity and a new tool for distribution
utilities to optimize the performance of distribution circuits, e.g. by
minimizing thermal losses. We discuss and compare via simulation various design
options for control systems to manage the reactive power generated by these
inverters. An important design decision that weighs on the speed and quality of
communication required is whether the control should be centralized or
distributed (i.e. local). In general, we find that local control schemes are
capable for maintaining voltage within acceptable bounds. We consider the
benefits of choosing different local variables on which to control and how the
control system can be continuously tuned between robust voltage control,
suitable for daytime operation when circuit conditions can change rapidly, and
loss minimization better suited for nighttime operation.
