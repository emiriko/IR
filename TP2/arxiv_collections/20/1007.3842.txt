Complex quantum trajectories, which were first obtained from a modified de
Broglie-Bohm quantum mechanics, demonstrate that Born's probability axiom in
quantum mechanics originates from dynamics itself. We show that a normalisable
probability density can be defined for the entire complex plane, though there
may be regions where the probability is not locally conserved. Examining this
for some simple examples such as the harmonic oscillator, we also find why
there is no appreciable complex extended motion in the classical regime.
