The underlying dynamics for the electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings from
humans but especially epilepsy patients are usually not completely known.
However, the ictal activity is claimed to be characterized by synchronous
oscillations in the brain voltages in the literature. These time dependent
interdependencies (synchronization, coupling) between the EEG voltages from
epileptogenic and non epileptogenic brain sites of nineteen focal epileptic
patients are investigated in this work. It is found that strong
synchronizationdesynchronization events occur in alternation during most of the
investigated seizures. Thus, these seizures are detected with considerable
sensitivity (71 of the 79 seizures).
