Face numbers of triangulations of simplicial complexes were studied by
Stanley by use of his concept of a local $h$-vector. It is shown that a
parallel theory exists for cubical subdivisions of cubical complexes, in which
the role of the $h$-vector of a simplicial complex is played by the (short or
long) cubical $h$-vector of a cubical complex, defined by Adin, and the role of
the local $h$-vector of a triangulation of a simplex is played by the (short or
long) cubical local $h$-vector of a cubical subdivision of a cube. The cubical
local $h$-vectors are defined in this paper and are shown to share many of the
properties of their simplicial counterparts. Generalizations to subdivisions of
locally Eulerian posets are also discussed.
