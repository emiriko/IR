We study the dependence of the plasmon dispersion relation of graphene on
applied uniaxial strain. Besides electron correlation at the RPA level, we also
include local field effects specific for the honeycomb lattice. As a
consequence of the two-band character of the electronic band structure, we find
two distinct plasmon branches. We recover the square-root behavior of the
low-energy branch, and find a nonmonotonic dependence of the strain-induced
modification of its stiffness, as a function of the wavevector orientation with
respect to applied strain.
