We compare effects of decoherence and detection inefficiency on entangled
coherent states (ECSs) and entangled photon pairs (EPPs), both of which are
known to be particularly useful for quantum information processing (QIP). When
decoherence effects caused by photon losses are heavy, the ECSs outperform the
EPPs as quantum channels for teleportation both in fidelities and in success
probabilities. On the other hand, when inefficient detectors are used, the
teleportation scheme using the ECSs suffers undetected errors that result in
the degradation of fidelity, while this is not the case for the teleportation
scheme using the EPPs. Our study reveals the merits and demerits of the two
types of entangled states in realizing practical QIP under realistic
conditions.
