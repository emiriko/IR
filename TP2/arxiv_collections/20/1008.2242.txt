We draw attention to some tune problems in constructions of the quantum-field
operators for spins 1/2 and 1. They are related to the existence of
negative-energy and acausal solutions of relativistic wave equations.
Particular attention is paid to the chiral theories, and to the method of the
Lorentz boosts.
