The loss in superconducting microwave resonators at low-photon number and low
temperatures is not well understood but has implications for achievable
coherence times in superconducting qubits. We have fabricated single-layer
resonators with a high quality factor by patterning a superconducting aluminum
film on a sapphire substrate. Four resonator geometries were studied with
resonant frequencies ranging from 5 to 7 GHz: a quasi-lumped element resonator,
a coplanar strip waveguide resonator, and two hybrid designs that contain both
a coplanar strip and a quasi-lumped element. Transmitted power measurements
were taken at 30 mK as a function of frequency and probe power. We find that
the resonator loss, expressed as the inverse of the internal quality factor,
decreases slowly over four decades of photon number in a manner not merely
explained by loss from a conventional uniform spatial distribution of two-level
systems in an oxide layer on the superconducting surfaces of the resonator.
