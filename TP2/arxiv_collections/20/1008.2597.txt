We numerically study dynamical properties of the one-component Gaussian Core
Model in the supercooled states. We find that nucleation is suppressed as
density increases. Concomitantly the system exhibits glassy slow dynamics
characterized by the two-step and stretched exponential relaxation of the
density correlation as well as drastic increase of the relaxation time. It is
found that violation of the Stokes-Einstein relation is weaker and the
non-Gaussian parameter is smaller than typical model glass formers, implying
weaker dynamic heterogeneities. Besides, agreement of simulation data with the
prediction of mode-coupling theory is exceptionally good, indicating that the
nature of slow dynamics of this ultra-soft particle fluid is mean-field-like.
This fact may be understood as the consequences of multiple overlaps of the
constituent particles at high densities.
