A compact model for the effect of parasitic internal fringe capacitance on
threshold voltage in high-K gate dielectric SOI MOSFETs is developed. Our model
includes the effects of the gate dielectric permittivity, spacer oxide
permittivity, spacer width, gate length and width of MOS structure. A simple
expression for parasitic internal fringe capacitance from the bottom edge of
the gate electrode is obtained and the charges induced in the source and drain
regions due to this capacitance are considered. We demonstrate an increase in
surface potential along the channel due to these charges resulting in a
decrease in the threshold voltage with increase in gate dielectric
permittivity. The accuracy of the results obtained using our analytical model
is verified using 2-D device simulations.
