It is shown that for any given quantum system evolving unitarily with the
Hamiltonian, $\hat{H} = \hat{\bf p}^2/(2m) + U({\bf q})$, [bold letters denote
$D$-dimensional ($D \geqslant 3$) vectors] and with a sufficiently smooth
potential $U({\bf q})$, there exits a classical ensemble with the Hamilton
function, $\mathrsfs{H} ({\bf p}, {\bf q}) = {\bf p}^2/(2m) + U^{(\infty)}
({\bf q})$, where the potential $U^{(\infty)}({\bf q})$ coincides with $U({\bf
q})$ for almost all ${\bf q}$ (i.e., $U^{(\infty)}$ can be different from $U$
only on a measure zero set), such that the square modulus of the wave function
in the coordinate (momentum) representation approximately equals the coordinate
(momentum) distribution of the classical ensemble within an arbitrary given
accuracy. Furthermore, the trajectories of this classical ensemble, generally
speaking, need not coincide with the trajectories obtained from de
Broglie--Bohmian mechanics. Consequences of this result are discussed.
