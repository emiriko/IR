We survay our recent results on fractional gravity theory. It is also
provided the Main Theorem on encoding of geometric data (metrics and
connections in gravity and geometric mechanics) into solitonic hierarchies. Our
approach is based on Caputo fractional derivative and nonlinear connection
formalism.
