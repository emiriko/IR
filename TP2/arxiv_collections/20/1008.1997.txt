In standard models of baryogenesis and of dark matter, the mechanisms which
generate the densities in both sectors are unrelated to each other. In this
paper we explore models which generate the baryon asymmetry through the dark
matter sector, simultaneously relating the baryon asymmetry to the dark matter
density. In the class of models we explore, a dark matter asymmetry is
generated in the hidden sector through a first order phase transition. Within
the hidden sector, it is easy to achieve a sufficiently strong first order
phase transition and large enough $CP $ violation to generate the observed
asymmetry. This can happen above or below the electroweak phase transition, but
in both cases significantly before the dark matter becomes non-relativistic. We
study examples where the Asymmetric Dark Matter density is then transferred to
the baryons both through perturbative and non-perturbative communication
mechanisms, and show that in both cases cosmological constraints are satisfied
while a sufficient baryon asymmetry can be generated.
