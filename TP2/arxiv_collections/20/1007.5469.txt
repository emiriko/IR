In ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions, the Fourier decomposition of the
relative azimuthal angle, \Delta \phi, distribution of particle pairs yields a
large cos(3\Delta \phi) component, extending out to large rapidity separations
\Delta \eta >1. This component captures a significant portion of the ridge and
shoulder structures in the \Delta \phi distribution, which have been observed
after contributions from elliptic flow are subtracted. An average finite
triangularity due to event-by-event fluctuations in the initial matter
distribution, followed by collective flow, naturally produces a cos(3\Delta
\phi) correlation. Using ideal and viscous hydrodynamics, and transport theory,
we study the physics of triangular (v_3) flow in comparison to elliptic (v_2),
quadrangular (v_4) and pentagonal (v_5) flow. We make quantitative predictions
for v_3 at RHIC and LHC as a function of centrality and transverse momentum.
Our results for the centrality dependence of v_3 show a quantitative agreement
with data extracted from previous correlation measurements by the STAR
collaboration. This study supports previous results on the importance of
triangular flow in the understanding of ridge and shoulder structures.
Triangular flow is found to be a sensitive probe of initial geometry
fluctuations and viscosity.
