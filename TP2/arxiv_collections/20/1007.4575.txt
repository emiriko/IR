Using the QCD spectral sum rule approach we investigate different currents
with $J^{PC}=1^{++}$, which could be associated with the $X(3872)$ meson. Our
results indicate that, with a four-quark or molecular structure, it is very
difficult to explain the narrow width of the state unless the quarks have a
special color configuration.
