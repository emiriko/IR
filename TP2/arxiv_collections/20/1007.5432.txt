We calculate the diamagnetic susceptibility in zero external magnetic field
above the phase transition from ferromagnetic phase to phase of coexistence of
ferromagnetic order and unconventional superconductivity. For this aim we use
generalized Ginzburg-Landau free energy of unconventional ferromagnetic
superconductor with spin-triplet electron pairing. A possible application of
the result to some intermetallic compounds is briefly discussed.
