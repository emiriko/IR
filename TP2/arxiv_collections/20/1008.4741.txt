The extended nebulae formed as pulsar winds expand into their surroundings
provide information about the composition of the winds, the injection history
from the host pulsar, and the material into which the nebulae are expanding.
Observations from across the electromagnetic spectrum provide constraints on
the evolution of the nebulae, the density and composition of the surrounding
ejecta, the geometry of the central engines, and the long-term fate of the
energetic particles produced in these systems. Such observations reveal the
presence of jets and wind termination shocks, time-varying compact emission
structures, shocked supernova ejecta, and newly formed dust. Here I provide a
broad overview of the structure of pulsar wind nebulae, with specific examples
from observations extending from the radio band to very-high-energy gamma-rays
that demonstrate our ability to constrain the history and ultimate fate of the
energy released in the spin-down of young pulsars.
