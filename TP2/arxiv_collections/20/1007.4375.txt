We perform quantitative spectral analysis on the Born equation, an integral
equation for electromagnetic scattering that descends from the Maxwell
equations. We establish norm bounds for the Green operator associated with the
Born equation, thereby providing numerical tools for error estimates of the
Born approximation to light scattering problems.
