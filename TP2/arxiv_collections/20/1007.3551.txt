We have computed phase diagrams for rotating spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates
with long-range magnetic dipole-dipole interactions. Spin textures including
vortex sheets, staggered half-quantum- and skyrmion vortex lattices and higher
order topological defects have been found. These systems exhibit both
superfluidity and magnetic crystalline ordering and they could be realized
experimentally by imparting angular momentum in the condensate.
