Because scaling symmetries of the Euler-Lagrange equations are generally not
variational symmetries of the action, they do not lead to conservation laws.
Instead, an extension of Noether's theorem reduces the equations of motion to
evolutionary laws that prove useful, even if the transformations are not
generalized symmetries of the equations of motion. In the case of scaling,
symmetry leads to a scaling evolutionary law, a first-order equation in terms
of scale invariants, linearly relating kinematic and dynamic degrees of
freedom.
  This scaling evolutionary law appears in dynamical and in static systems.
Applied to dynamical central-force systems, the scaling evolutionary equation
leads to generalized virial laws, which linearly connect the kinetic and
potential energies. Applied to barotropic hydrostatic spheres, the scaling
evolutionary equation linearly connects the gravitational and internal energy
densities. This implies well-known properties of polytropes, describing
degenerate stars and chemically homogeneous non-degenerate stellar cores.
