The intensity of TeV atmospheric muons and neutrinos depends on the
temperature in the stratosphere. We show that the energy-dependence in the 100
TeV range of the correlation with temperature is sensitive to the fraction of
muons and neutrinos from decay of charmed hadrons. We discuss the prospects for
using the temperature effect as observed in gigaton neutrino detectors to
measure the charm contribution.
