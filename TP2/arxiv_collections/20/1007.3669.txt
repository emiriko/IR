We study, by means of mean field calculations and Monte Carlo simulations of
a lattice-gas model, the distribution of adhesion sites of a bilayer membrane
and a supporting flat surface. Our model accounts for the many-body character
of the attractive interactions between adhesion points induced by the membrane
thermal fluctuations. We show that while the fluctuation-mediated interactions
alone are not sufficient to allow the formation of aggregation domains, they
greatly reduce the strength of the direct interactions required to facilitate
cluster formation. Specifically, for adhesion molecules interacting via a short
range attractive potential, the strength of the direct interactions required
for aggregation is reduced by about a factor of two to below the thermal energy
$k_BT$.
