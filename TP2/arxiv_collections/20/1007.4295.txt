We identify 231 objects in the newly released Cycle 0 dataset from the Kepler
Mission as double-eclipse, detached eclipsing binary systems with Teff < 5500 K
and orbital periods shorter than ~32 days. We model each light curve using the
JKTEBOP code with a genetic algorithm to obtain precise values for each system.
We identify 95 new systems with both components below 1.0 M_sun and eclipses of
at least 0.1 magnitudes, suitable for ground-based follow-up. Of these, 14 have
periods less than 1.0 day, 52 have periods between 1.0 and 10.0 days, and 29
have periods greater than 10.0 days. This new sample of main-sequence,
low-mass, double-eclipse, detached eclipsing binary candidates more than
doubles the number of previously known systems, and extends the sample into the
completely heretofore unexplored P > 10.0 day period regime. We find
preliminary evidence from these systems that the radii of low-mass stars in
binary systems decrease with period. This supports the theory that binary
spin-up is the primary cause of inflated radii in low-mass binary systems,
although a full analysis of each system with radial-velocity and multi-color
light curves is needed to fully explore this hypothesis. As well, we present 7
new transiting planet candidates that do not appear among the recently released
list of 706 candidates by the Kepler team, nor in the Kepler False Positive
Catalog, along with several other new and interesting systems. We also present
novel techniques for the identification, period analysis, and modeling of
eclipsing binaries.
