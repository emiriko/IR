We present a calculation of the two-loop bottom-sbottom-gluino contributions
to Higgs boson production via gluon fusion in the MSSM. The calculation is
based on an asymptotic expansion in the masses of the supersymmetric particles,
which are assumed to be much heavier than the bottom quark and the Higgs
bosons. We obtain explicit analytic results that allow for a straightforward
identification of the dominant contributions in the NLO bottom corrections. We
emphasize the interplay between the calculations of the masses and the
production cross sections of the Higgs bosons, discussing sensible choices of
renormalization scheme for the parameters in the bottom/sbottom sector.
