We present a technique to synthesise telluric absorption and emission
features both for in-situ wavelength calibration and for their removal from
astronomical spectra. While the presented technique is applicable for a wide
variety of optical and infrared spectra, we concentrate in this paper on
selected high-resolution near-infrared spectra obtained with the CRIRES
spectrograph to demonstrate its performance and limitation. We find that
synthetic spectra reproduce telluric absorption features to about 2%, even
close to saturated line cores. Thus, synthetic telluric spectra could be used
to replace the observation of telluric standard stars, saving valuable
observing time. This technique also provides a precise in-situ wavelength
calibration, especially useful for high-resolution near-infrared spectra in the
absence of other calibration sources.
