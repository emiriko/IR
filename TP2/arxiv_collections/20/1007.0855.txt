A multi-particle extension of the Arnol'd Cat Hamiltonian system is defined
and examined. We propose to compute its Alicki-Fannes quantum dynamical
entropy, to validate (or disprove) the validity of the decoherence approach to
quantum chaos. A first set of numerical experiments is presented and discussed.
