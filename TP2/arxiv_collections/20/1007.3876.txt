We present a construction of semi-classical states for P\"oschl-Teller
potentials based on a supersymmetric quantum mechanics approach. The parameters
of these "coherent" states are points in the classical phase space of these
systems. They minimize a special uncertainty relation. Like standard coherent
states they resolve the identity with a uniform measure. They permit to
establish the correspondence (quantization) between classical and quantum
quantities. Finally, their time evolution is localized on the classical phase
space trajectory.
