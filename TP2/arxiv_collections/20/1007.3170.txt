We present results from the first two quarters of a survey to search for
pulsations in compact stellar objects with the Kepler spacecraft. The survey
sample and the various methods applied in its compilation are described, and
spectroscopic observations are presented to separate the objects into accurate
classes. From the Kepler photometry we clearly identify nine compact pulsators,
and a number of interesting binary stars. Of the pulsators, one shows the
strong, rapid pulsations typical for a V361 Hya type sdB variable (sdBV), seven
show long-period pulsations characteristic of V1093 Her type sdBVs, and one
shows low-amplitude pulsations with both short and long periods. We derive
effective temperatures and surface gravities for all the subdwarf B stars in
the sample and demonstrate that below the boundary region where hybrid sdB
pulsators are found, all our targets are pulsating. For the stars hotter than
this boundary temperature a low fraction of strong pulsators (<10 per cent) is
confirmed. Interestingly, the short-period pulsator also shows a low-amplitude
mode in the long-period region, and several of the V1093 Her pulsators show low
amplitude modes in the short-period region, indicating that hybrid behaviour
may be common in these stars, also outside the boundary temperature region
where hybrid pulsators have hitherto been found.
