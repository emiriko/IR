This volume contains the papers presented at the first international workshop
on Logics for Component Configuration (LoCoCo 2010) which was associated with
the International Conference on Theory and Applications of Satisfiability
Testing (SAT 2010) as part of the Federated Logic Conference (FLoC 2010), and
which took place on July 10, 2010 in Edinburgh, UK.
  Modern software distributions are based on the notion of components, which
denote units of independent development and deployment. Components provide the
necessary flexibility when organizing a complex software distribution, but also
are a challenge when it comes to selecting components from a large repository
of possible choices, and configuring these components according to user needs,
resource constraints, and interdependencies with other components. Representing
and solving configuration problems is a hot topic of great importance for many
application domains. Some well-known examples of complex systems of components
are Free and Open Source software distributions like GNU/Linux, or Eclipse
plugins. The LoCoCo workshop has a focus on logic-based methods for specifying
and solving complex configuration problems for software components. The goal
was to bring together both researchers and practitioners active in the area of
component configuration of software systems, using different modeling and
solving techniques, such as constraint and logic programing, description
logics, satisfiability and its extensions.
