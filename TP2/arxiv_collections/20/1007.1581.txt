A new numerical code, based upon a mixed FEM-Runge-Kutta method, is used for
the analysis and design of plane 2-D smart structures. The code is applied to
the study of arbitrarily shaped PEM plates, based on a weak formulation of
their governing equations, [17]. The optimal parameters needed to synthesize
appropriate electric networks are computed, and the overall performances of
such plates are investigated. Two examples are studied: firstly, a simple case
is used to test the main features of the code; secondly, a more complex PEM
plate is designed and analyzed by means of the proposed numerical approach.
