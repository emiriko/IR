Random surface deviations in a reflector antenna reduce the aperture
efficiency. This communication presents a method for estimating the mean
surface deviation of a parabolic reflector from a set of measured points. The
proposed method takes into account systematic measurement errors, such as the
offset between the origin of reference frame and the vertex of the surface, and
the misalignment between the surface rotation axis and the measurement axis.
The results will be applied to perform corrections to the surface of one of the
30 m diameter radiotelescopes at the Instituto Argentino de Radioastronom\'ia
(IAR).
