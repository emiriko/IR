Recently, Li \textit{et al.} have concentrated on Kleinberg's navigation
model with a certain total length constraint $\Lambda = cN$, where $N$ is the
number of total nodes and $c$ is a constant. Their simulation results for the
1- and 2-dimensional cases indicate that the optimal choice for adding extra
long-range connections between any two sites seems to be $\alpha=d+1$, where
$d$ is the dimension of the lattice and $\alpha$ is the power-law exponent. In
this paper, we prove analytically that for the 1-dimensional large networks,
the optimal power-law exponent is $\alpha=2$ Further, we study the impact of
the network size and provide exact solutions for time cost as a function of the
power-law exponent $\alpha$. We also show that our analytical results are in
excellent agreement with simulations.
