Spectral observations of classical T Tauri stars show a wide range of line
profiles, many of which reveal signs of matter inflow and outflow. Halpha is
the most commonly observed line profile due to its intensity, and it is highly
dependent on the characteristics of the surrounding environment of these stars.
Our aim is to analyze how the Halpha line profile is affected by the various
parameters of our model which contains both the magnetospheric and disk wind
contributions to the Halpha flux. We used a dipolar axisymmetric stellar
magnetic field to model the stellar magnetosphere and a modified Blandford &
Payne model was used in our disk wind region. A three-level atom with continuum
was used to calculate the required Hydrogen level populations. We use the
Sobolev approximation and a ray-by-ray method to calculate the integrated line
profile. Through an extensive study of the model parameter space, we have
investigated the contribution of many of the model parameters on the calculated
line profiles. Our results show that the Halpha line is strongly dependent on
the densities and temperatures inside the magnetosphere and the disk wind
region. The bulk of the flux comes, most of the time, from the magnetospheric
component for standard classical T Tauri stars parameters, but the disk wind
contribution becomes more important as the mass accretion rate, the
temperatures and densities inside the disk wind increase. We have also found
that most of the disk wind contribution to the Halpha line is emitted at the
innermost region of the disk wind. Models that take into consideration both
inflow and outflow of matter are a necessity to fully understand and describe
classical T Tauri stars.
