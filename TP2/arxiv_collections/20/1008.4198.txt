In this paper, we introduce a class of new generalized super Bell polynomials
on a superspace, explore their properties, and show that they are a natural and
effective tool to systematically investigate integrability of supersymmetric
equations. The connections between the super Bell polynomials and super
bilinear representation, bilinear B\"{a}cklund transformation, Lax pair and
infinite conservation laws of supersymmetric equations are established. We take
supersymmetric KdV equation and supersymmetric sine-Gordon equation to
illustrate this procedure.
