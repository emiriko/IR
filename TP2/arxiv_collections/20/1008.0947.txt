Black hole is called optimal if information content is minimal at the
University region, consisting of usual substance and one(n) black hole(s).
Optimal black hole mass does not depend on the mass of the Universe region.
Optimal black holes can exist when at least the two types of substance are
available in the Universe: with non-linear and linear correspondence between
information content and mass. Information content of optimal black hole is
proportional to squared coefficient correlating information content with mass
in usual substance and in inverse proportion to coefficient correlating
information content with black hole mass. Concentration of mass in optimal
black hole minimizes information content in the system "usual substance - black
holes". Minimal information content of the Universe consisting of optimal black
holes only is twice as less as information content available of the Universe of
the same mass filled with usual substance only. Under the radiation temperature
T \approx 1E + 12 K the mass of optimal black holes that emerged in the systems
"radiation - black hole" is equal to the mass of optimal black holes that
emerged in the systems "hydrogen (protons) - black hole".
