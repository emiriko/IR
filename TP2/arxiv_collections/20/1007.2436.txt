The physics of quantum dots is succinctly depicted by the {\it Universal
Hamiltonian}, where only zero mode interactions are included. In the case where
the latter involve charging and isotropic spin-exchange terms, this would lead
to a non-Abelian action. Here we address an Ising spin-exchange interaction,
which leads to an Abelian action. The analysis of this simplified yet
non-trivial model shed some light on a more general case of charge and spin
entanglement. We present a calculation of the tunneling density of states and
of the dynamic magnetic susceptibility. Our results are amenable to
experimental study and may allow for an experimental determination of the
exchange interaction strength.
