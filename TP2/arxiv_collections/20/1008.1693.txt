A detailed investigation of the electronic - and magneto - transport
properties of Nd0.8Sr0.2MnO3 with the variation of grain size (down to 42 nm)
is presented here. Interestingly, we observe that the ferromagnetic insulating
state is suppressed and a metallic state is stabilized as the grain size of the
sample is reduced. As a result, metal insulator transition is observed in this
low doped manganite which is insulating in nature in its bulk form.
Destabilization of polaronic order in the ferromagnetic insulating state due to
enhanced surface disorder on grain size reduction has been attributed to this
effect. A phenomenological model has been proposed to represent the concept of
destabilization of polaron formation in the surface region of the nano grains.
Resistivity and magnetoresistance data have been carefully analyzed employing
different suitable models. Electrical third harmonic resistance has been
measured to directly probe the electrical nonlinearity in the samples.
