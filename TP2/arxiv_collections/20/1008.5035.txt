It is shown that if a function defined on the segment [-1,1] has sufficiently
good approximation by partial sums of the Legendre polynomial expansion, then,
given the function's Fourier coefficients $c_n$ for some subset of
$n\in[n_1,n_2]$, one may approximately recover them for all $n\in[n_1,n_2]$. As
an application, a new approach to factoring of integers is given.
