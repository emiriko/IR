The INTEGRAL satellite has revealed a major population of supergiant High
Mass X-ray Binaries in our Galaxy, revolutionizing our understanding of binary
systems and their evolution. This population, constituted of a compact object
orbiting around a massive and luminous supergiant star, exhibits unusual
properties, either being extremely absorbed, or showing very short and intense
flares. An intensive set of multi-wavelength observations has led us to reveal
their nature, and to show that these systems are wind-fed accretors, closely
related to massive star-forming regions. In this paper I describe the
characteristics of these sources, showing that this newly revealed population
is closely linked to the evolution of active and massive OB stars with a
compact companion. The last section emphasizes the formation and evolution of
such High Mass X-ray Binaries hosting a supergiant star.
