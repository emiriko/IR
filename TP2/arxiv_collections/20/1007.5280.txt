The conductance of two Anderson impurity models, one with two-fold and
another with four-fold degeneracy, representing two types of quantum dots, is
calculated using a world-line quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) method. Extrapolation
of the imaginary time QMC data to zero frequency yields the linear conductance,
which is then compared to numerical renormalization group results in order to
assess its accuracy. We find that the method gives excellent results at low
temperature (T<Tk) throughout the mixed valence and Kondo regimes, but it is
unreliable for higher temperature.
