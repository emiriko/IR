We probe the physical conditions in high redshift galaxies, specifically, the
Damped Lyman-alpha Systems (DLAs) using neutral carbon (CI) fine structure
lines and molecular hydrogen (H2). We report five new detections of CI and
analyze the CI in an additional 2 DLAs with previously published data. We also
present one new detection of H2 in a DLA. We present a new method of analysis
that simultaneously constrains \emph{both} the volume density and the
temperature of the gas, as opposed to previous studies that a priori assumed a
gas temperature. We use only the column density of CI measured in the fine
structure states and the assumption of ionization equilibrium in order to
constrain the physical conditions in the gas. We present a sample of 11 CI
velocity components in 6 DLAs and compare their properties to those derived by
the global CII* technique. The resulting median values for this sample are:
<n(HI)> = 69 cm^{-3}, <T> = 50 K, and <log(P/k)> = 3.86 cm^{-3} K, with
standard deviations, sigma_{n(HI)} = 134 cm^{-3}, sigma_T = 52 K, and
sigma_{log(P/k)} = 3.68 cm^{-3} K. This can be compared with the integrated
median values for the same DLAs : <n(HI)> = 2.8 cm^{-3}, <T> = 139 K, and
<log(P/k)> = 2.57 cm^{-3} K, with standard deviations sigma_{n(HI)} = 3.0
cm^{-3}, sigma_T = 43 K, and sigma_{log(P/k)} = 0.22 cm^{-3} K. Interestingly,
the pressures measured in these high redshift CI clouds are similar to those
found in the Milky Way. We conclude that the CI gas is tracing a
higher-density, higher-pressure region, possibly indicative of post-shock gas
or a photodissociation region on the edge of a molecular cloud. We speculate
that these clouds may be direct probes of the precursor sites of star formation
in normal galaxies at high redshift.
