We present measurements of electromagnetically induced transparency with an
ensemble of donor- bound electrons in low-doped n-GaAs. We used optical
transitions from the Zeeman-split electron spin states to a bound trion state
in samples with optical densities of 0.3 and 1.0. The electron spin dephasing
time T* \approx 2 ns was limited by hyperfine coupling to fluctuating nuclear
spins. We also observe signatures of dynamical nuclear polarization, but find
these effects to be much weaker than in experiments that use electron spin
resonance and related experiments with quantum dots.
