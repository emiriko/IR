Large-amplitude dynamics of axial and triaxial quadrupole deformation in
24,26Mg, 24Ne, and 28Si is investigated on the basis of the quadrupole
collective Hamiltonian constructed with use of the constrained
Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov plus the local quasiparticle random phase approximation
method. The calculation reproduces well properties of the ground rotational
bands, and beta and gamma vibrations in 24Mg and 28Si. The gamma-softness in
the collective states of 26Mg and 24Ne are discussed. Contributions of the
neutrons and protons to the transition properties are also analyzed in
connection with the large-amplitude quadrupole dynamics.
