We present here a study about the stability of Ion-Temperature-Gradient drift
turbulence in the Quasi-Single-Helicity regime of RFX-mod Reversed Field Pinch
(RFP) using the TRB fluid electrostatic turbulence code. Our results suggest
that present-days RFP plasmas are marginally stable against this kind of
turbulence. The onset of the instability may be envisaged for close future
regimes, in the presence of hotter plasmas with sharper internal transport
barriers.
