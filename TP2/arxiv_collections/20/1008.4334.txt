We describe the formation of deposition patterns that are observed in many
different experiments where a three-phase contact line of a volatile
nanoparticle suspension or polymer solution recedes. A dynamical model based on
a long-wave approximation predicts the deposition of irregular and regular line
patterns due to self-organised pinning-depinning cycles corresponding to a
stick-slip motion of the contact line. We analyze how the line pattern
properties depend on the evaporation rate and solute concentration.
