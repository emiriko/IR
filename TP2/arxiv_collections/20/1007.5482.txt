We report on double-differential inclusive cross-sections of the production
of secondary protons, charged pions, and deuterons, in the interactions with a
5% nuclear interaction length thick stationary carbon target, of proton and
pion beams with momentum from \pm 3 GeV/c to \pm 15 GeV/c. Results are given
for secondary particles with production angles between 20 and 125 degrees.
Cross-sections on carbon nuclei are compared with cross-sections on beryllium,
copper, tantalum and lead nuclei.
