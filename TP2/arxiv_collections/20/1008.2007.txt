We have measured the impact of atomic hydrogen adsorption on the electronic
transport properties of graphene sheets as a function of hydrogen coverage and
initial, pre-hydrogenation field-effect mobility. Our results are compatible
with hydrogen adsorbates inducing intervalley mixing by exerting a short-range
scattering potential. The saturation coverages for different devices are found
to be proportional to their initial mobility, indicating that the number of
native scatterers is proportional to the saturation coverage of hydrogen. By
extrapolating this proportionality, we show that the field-effect mobility can
reach $1.5 \times 10^4$ cm$^2$/V sec in the absence of the hydrogen-adsorbing
sites. This affinity to hydrogen is the signature of the most dominant type of
native scatterers in graphene-based field-effect transistors on SiO$_2$.
