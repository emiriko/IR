Heat-capacity, X-ray diffraction, and resistivity measurements on a
high-quality BaFe$_{2}$As$_{2}$ sample show an evolution of the
magneto-structural transition with successive annealing periods. After a 30-day
anneal the resistivity in the (ab) plane decreases by more than an order of
magnitude, to 12 $\mu\Omega$cm, with a residual resistance ratio $\sim$36; the
heat-capacity anomaly at the transition sharpens, to an overall width of less
than K, and shifts from 135.4 to 140.2 K. The heat-capacity anomaly in both the
as-grown sample and after the 30-day anneal shows a hysteresis of $\sim$0.15 K,
and is unchanged in a magnetic field $\mu_{0}$H = 14 T. The X-ray and
heat-capacity data combined suggest that there is a first order jump in the
structural order parameter. The entropy of the transition is reported.
