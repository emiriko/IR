Direct photon spectra are calculated within a transport+hydrodynamics hybrid
approach, in which the high-density part of the transport evolution has been
replaced by a 3+1-dimensional hydrodynamic calculation. We study the effects of
changing the parameters of the two interfaces between the transport- and
hydrodynamic descriptions on the resulting direct photon spectra.
