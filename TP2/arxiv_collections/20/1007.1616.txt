Quantum key distribution (QKD) relies on quantum and classical procedures in
order to achieve the growing of a secret random string -the key- known only to
the two parties executing the protocol. Limited intrinsic efficiency of the
protocol, imperfect devices and eavesdropping produce errors and information
leakage from which the set of measured signals -the raw key- must be stripped
in order to distill a final, information theoretically secure, key. The key
distillation process is a classical one in which basis reconciliation, error
correction and privacy amplification protocols are applied to the raw key. This
cleaning process is known as information reconciliation and must be done in a
fast and efficient way to avoid cramping the performance of the QKD system.
Brassard and Salvail proposed a very simple and elegant protocol to reconcile
keys in the secret-key agreement context, known as Cascade, that has become the
de-facto standard for all QKD practical implementations. However, it is highly
interactive, requiring many communications between the legitimate parties and
its efficiency is not optimal, imposing an early limit to the maximum tolerable
error rate. In this paper we describe a low-density parity-check reconciliation
protocol that improves significantly on these problems. The protocol exhibits
better efficiency and limits the number of uses of the communications channel.
It is also able to adapt to different error rates while remaining efficient,
thus reaching longer distances or higher secure key rate for a given QKD
system.
