We consider nonlinear control systems of the so-called generalized triangular
form (GTF) with time-varying and periodic dynamics which linearly depends on
some external disturbances. Our purpose is to construct a feedback controller
which provides the global input-to-state stability of the corresponding
closed-loop w.r.t. the disturbances. To do this, we combine the method proposed
in the earlier work \cite{pavlichkov_ge_2009} devoted the the global asymptotic
stabilization of the GTF systems without disturbances with the ISS theory for
time-varying systems proposed in \cite{wang}. Following this pattern we
construct a feedback which provides the properties of uniform global stability
and asymptotic gain w.r.t the disturbances. Then we obtain the semi-uniform ISS
of the closed-loop system.
