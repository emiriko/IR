We obtain a general formula for the distribution of sizes of "static
avalanches", or shocks, in generic mean-field glasses with
replica-symmetry-breaking saddle points. For the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK)
spin-glass it yields the density rho(S) of the sizes of magnetization jumps S
along the equilibrium magnetization curve at zero temperature. Continuous
replica-symmetry breaking allows for a power-law behavior rho(S) ~ 1/(S)^tau
with exponent tau=1 for SK, related to the criticality (marginal stability) of
the spin-glass phase. All scales of the ultrametric phase space are implicated
in jump events. Similar results are obtained for the sizes S of static jumps of
pinned elastic systems, or of shocks in Burgers turbulence in large dimension.
In all cases with a one-step solution, rho(S) ~ S exp(-A S^2). A simple
interpretation relating droplets to shocks, and a scaling theory for the
equilibrium analog of Barkhausen noise in finite-dimensional spin glasses are
discussed.
