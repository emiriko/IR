In this script handbook, we collect the basic (and partially upgraded) PHP
scripts used for building the AMIDAS website
(http://pisrv0.pit.physik.uni-tuebingen.de/darkmatter/amidas/), an online
interactive simulation/data analysis system for direct Dark Matter detection
experiments and phenomenology. In this (1.73205) version, we add more materials
and improve the scripts for offering a more convenient, comfortable and
user-friendly environment on interactive scientific computing websites. Some
basic, often used commands of (X)HTML, CSS, JavaScript, HTML DOM, and PHP are
also given in Appendix. Online demonstrations and downloadable template scripts
are given on http://www.tir.tw/iswb/ss2012/templates.php.
