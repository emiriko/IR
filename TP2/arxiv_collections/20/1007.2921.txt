The framework of third quantization - canonical quantization in the Liouville
space - is developed for open many-body bosonic systems. We show how to
diagonalize the quantum Liouvillean for an arbitrary quadratic n-boson
Hamiltonian with arbitrary linear Lindblad couplings to the baths and, as an
example, explicitly work out a general case of a single boson.
