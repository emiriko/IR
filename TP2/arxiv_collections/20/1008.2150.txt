Among the theories beyond the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics
Supersymmetry (SUSY) provides an excellent dark matter (DM) candidate, the
neutralino. One clear prediction of cosmology is the annihilation cross section
of DM particles, assuming them to be a thermal relic from the early universe.
In most of the parameter space of Supersymmetry the annihilation cross section
is too small compared with the prediction of cosmology. However, for large
values of the tan beta parameter the annihilation through s-channel
pseudoscalar Higgs exchange yields the correct relic density in practically the
whole range of possible SUSY masses up to the few TeV range. The required
values of tan beta are typically around 50, i.e. of the order of top and bottom
mass ratio, which happens to be also the range allowing for Yukawa unification
in a Grand Unified Theory with gauge coupling unification. For such large
values of tan beta the associated production of the heavier Higgses, which is
enhanced by tan beta squared, becomes three orders of magnitude larger than the
production of a simlar SM-like Higgs and could be observable as one of the
first hints of new physics at the LHC.
