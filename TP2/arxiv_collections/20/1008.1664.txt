We show that parametric context-sensitive L-systems with affine geometry
interpretation provide a succinct description of some of the most fundamental
algorithms of geometric modeling of curves. Examples include the
Lane-Riesenfeld algorithm for generating B-splines, the de Casteljau algorithm
for generating Bezier curves, and their extensions to rational curves. Our
results generalize the previously reported geometric-modeling applications of
L-systems, which were limited to subdivision curves.
