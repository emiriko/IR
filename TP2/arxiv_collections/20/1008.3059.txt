We analyze the RXTE observations of the 2009 outburst of H~1743-322, as well
as the observations of the previous five outbursts for comparison. The
hardness-intensity diagram (HID) shows a complete counter-clockwise q-track for
the 2009 outburst and, interestingly, the track falls in} between a huge one in
2003, with a complete transition to high/soft state, and that of} the failed
outburst in 2008. It leaves the low/hard state but does not reach the leftmost
edge of the overall HID. While the lowest hardness (6--19 keV/3--6 keV) values}
in the HID is about 0.3--0.4 for the 2009 outburst, similar to the ``failed
state transition" seen in the persistent black hole XRB Cyg X-1, the timing
analysis shows that a transition to the high soft state occurred. During the
low/hard state of the 2009 outburst, the inner radius of the accretion disk is
found to be closer to the central black hole and have an anti-correlation with
the disk temperature. These results may be understood as the reprocessing} of
the hot corona on the disk's} soft X-rays, which can lead to an underestimation
of the inner radius of the accretion disk. In the luminosity diagram of the
corona versus the disk, the tracks of the outbursts} in 2003 and 2009 cross the
line which represents a roughly equal contribution to the entire emission from
the thermal and the non-thermal components;} the track of the 2008 outburst has
the turn-over falling} on this line. This may be indicative of an emission
balance between the corona and the disk, which prevents the state transition
from going further than the low/hard state.
