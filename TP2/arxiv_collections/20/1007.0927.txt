Nanoparticles tethered with DNA strands are promising building blocks for
bottom-up nanotechnology, and a theoretical understanding is important for
future development. Here we build on approaches developed in polymer physics to
provide theoretical descriptions for the equilibrium clustering and dynamics,
as well as the self-assembly kinetics of DNA-linked nanoparticles. Striking
agreement is observed between the theory and molecular modeling of DNA tethered
nanoparticles.
