The present paper concludes our investigation on the QCD equation of state
with 2+1 staggered flavors and one-link stout improvement. We extend our
previous study [JHEP 0601:089 (2006)] by choosing even finer lattices. Lattices
with $N_t=6,8$ and 10 are used, and the continuum limit is approached by
checking the results at $N_t=12$. A Symanzik improved gauge and a stout-link
improved staggered fermion action is utilized. We use physical quark masses,
that is, for the lightest staggered pions and kaons we fix the $m_\pi/f_K$ and
$m_K/f_K$ ratios to their experimental values. The pressure, the interaction
measure, the energy and entropy density and the speed of sound are presented as
functions of the temperature in the range $100 ...1000 \textmd{MeV}$. We give
estimates for the pion mass dependence and for the contribution of the charm
quark. We compare our data to the equation of state obtained by the "hotQCD"
collaboration.
