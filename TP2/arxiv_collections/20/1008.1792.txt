Topological phase transitions between a conventional insulator and a state of
matter with topological properties have been proposed and observed in mercury
telluride - cadmium telluride quantum wells. We show that a topological state
can be induced in such a device, initially in the trivial phase, by irradiation
with microwave frequencies, without closing the gap and crossing the phase
transition. We show that the quasi-energy spectrum exhibits a single pair of
helical edge states. The velocity of the edge states can be tuned by adjusting
the intensity of the microwave radiation. We discuss the necessary experimental
parameters for our proposal. This proposal provides an example and a proof of
principle of a new non-equilibrium topological state, Floquet topological
insulator, introduced in this paper.
