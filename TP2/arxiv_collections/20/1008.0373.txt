The failure of Einstein's co-authored "EPR" attempt to show the
incompleteness of quantum theory is demonstrated directly for spatial degrees
of freedom using only elementary notions. A GHZ construction is realized in the
position properties of three particles whose quantum waves are distributed over
three two-chambered boxes. The same system is modeled more realistically using
three spatially separated, singly ionized hydrogen molecules.
