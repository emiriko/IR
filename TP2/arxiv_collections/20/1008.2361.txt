Mode splittings produced by uniform rotation and a particular form of
differential rotation are computed for two-dimensional rotating 10 Mo ZAMS
stellar models. The change in the character of the mode splitting is traced as
a function of uniform rotation rate, and it is found that only relatively slow
rotation rates are required before the mode splitting becomes asymmetric about
the azimuthally symmetric (m=0) mode. Increased rotation produces a
progressively altered pattern of the individual modes with respect to each
other. Large mode splittings begin to overlap with the mode splittings produced
by different radial and latitudinal modes at relatively low rotation rates. The
mode splitting pattern for the differentially rotating stars we model is
different than that for uniformly rotating stars, making the mode splitting a
possible discriminant of the internal angular momentum distribution if one
assumes the formidable challenge of mode identification can be overcome.
