Photoionization of an atom $A$, in the presence of a neighboring atom $B$,
can proceed via resonant excitation of $B$ with subsequent energy transfer to
$A$ through two-center electron-electron correlation. We demonstrate that this
two-center mechanism can strongly outperform direct photoionization at
nanometer internuclear distances and possesses characteristic features in its
time development and the spectrum of emitted electrons.
