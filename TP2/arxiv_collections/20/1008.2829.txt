Based on the branching fractions of J/psi(psi(2S))-> VP from different
collaborations, the pseudoscalar mixing is extensively discussed with a well
established phenomenological model. The mixing angle is determined to be -14
degree by fitting to the new world average if only quark content is considered.
After taking into account the gluonic content in eta and eta prime
simultaneously, the investigation shows that eta favors only consisting of
light quarks, while the gluonic content of eta prime is Z_{eta
prime}^2=0.30\pm0.24.
