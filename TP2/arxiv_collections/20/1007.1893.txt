Some general Lorentz covariant operators, associated to the so-called \Theta
(or \Xi)-relativistic diffusions and making sense in any Lorentzian manifold,
have been introduced by Franchi and Le Jan [Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 60 (2007)
187-251], Franchi and Le Jan [Curvature diffusions in general relativity
(2010). Unpublished manuscript]. Only a few examples have been studied so far.
We provide in this work some nonexplosion criteria for these diffusions, which
can be used in generic cases.
