We confirm that the evidence for the Waldmeier effect WE1 (the
anti-correlation between rise times of sunspot cycles and their strengths) and
the related effect WE2 (the correlation between rise rates of cycles and their
strengths) is found in different kinds of sunspot data. We explore whether
these effects can be explained theoretically on the basis of the flux transport
dynamo models of sunspot cycles. Two sources of irregularities of sunspot
cycles are included in our model: fluctuations in the poloidal field generation
process and fluctuations in the meridional circulation. We find WE2 to be a
robust result which is produced in different kinds of theoretical models for
different sources of irregularities. The Waldmeier effect WE1, on the other
hand, arises from fluctuations in the meridional circulation and is found only
in the theoretical models with reasonably high turbulent diffusivity which
ensures that the diffusion time is not more than a few years.
