The idea of functional programming has played a big role in shaping today's
landscape of mainstream programming languages. Another concept that dominates
the current programming style is Dijkstra's structured programming. Both
concepts have been successfully married, for example in the programming
language Scala. This paper proposes how the same can be achieved for structured
programming and PURELY functional programming via the notion of LINEAR SCOPE.
One advantage of this proposal is that mainstream programmers can reap the
benefits of purely functional programming like easily exploitable parallelism
while using familiar structured programming syntax and without knowing concepts
like monads. A second advantage is that professional purely functional
programmers can often avoid hard to read functional code by using structured
programming syntax that is often easier to parse mentally.
