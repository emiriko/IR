Motivated by recent experiments with confined binary liquid mixtures near
demixing, we study the universal critical properties of a system, which belongs
to the Ising universality class, in the film geometry. We employ periodic
boundary conditions in the two lateral directions and fixed boundary conditions
on the two confining surfaces, such that one of them has a spatially
homogeneous adsorption preference while the other one exhibits a laterally
alternating adsorption preference, resembling locally a single chemical step.
By means of Monte Carlo simulations of an improved Hamiltonian, so that the
leading scaling corrections are suppressed, numerical integration, and
finite-size scaling analysis we determine the critical Casimir force and its
universal scaling function for various values of the aspect ratio of the film.
In the limit of a vanishing aspect ratio the critical Casimir force of this
system reduces to the mean value of the critical Casimir force for laterally
homogeneous ++ and +- boundary conditions, corresponding to the surface spins
on the two surfaces being fixed to equal and opposite values, respectively. We
show that the universal scaling function of the critical Casimir force for
small but finite aspect ratios displays a linear dependence on the aspect ratio
which is solely due to the presence of the lateral inhomogeneity. We also
analyze the order-parameter profiles at criticality and their universal scaling
function which allows us to probe theoretical predictions and to compare with
experimental data.
