We study weak anti-localization (WAL) effect in topological insulator Bi2Te3
thin films at low temperatures. Two-dimensional WAL effect associated with
surface carriers is revealed in the tilted magnetic field dependence of
magneto-conductance. Our data demonstrates that the observed WAL is robust
against deposition of non-magnetic Au impurities on the surface of the thin
films. But it is quenched by deposition of magnetic Fe impurities which destroy
the pi Berry's phase of the topological surface states. The magneto-conductance
data of a 5 nm Bi2Te3 film suggests that a crossover from symplectic to unitary
classes is observed with the deposition of Fe impurities.
