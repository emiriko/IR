We observe that the various formulations of the operational semantics of
Constraint Handling Rules proposed over the years fall into a spectrum ranging
from the analytical to the pragmatic. While existing analytical formulations
facilitate program analysis and formal proofs of program properties, they
cannot be implemented as is. We propose a novel operational semantics, which
has a strong analytical foundation, while featuring a terminating execution
model. We prove its soundness and completeness with respect to existing
analytical formulations and we provide an implementation in the form of a
source-to-source transformation to CHR with rule priorities.
