We study an exactly solvable model of $D(D_3)$ non-Abelian anyons on a
one-dimensional lattice with a free coupling parameter in the Hamiltonian. For
certain values of the coupling parameter level crossings occur, which divide
the ground-state phase diagram into four regions. We obtain explicit
expressions for the ground-state energy in each phase, for both closed and open
chain boundary conditions. For the closed chain case we show that chiral phases
occur which are characterised by non-zero ground-state momentum.
