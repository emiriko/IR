The space-time evolution of the (1+1)-dimensional viscous hydrodynamics with
an initial quark-gluon plasma (QGP) produced in ultrarelativistic heavy ion
collisions is studied numerically. The particle-emitting sources undergo a
crossover transition from the QGP to hadronic gas. We take into account a usual
shear viscosity for the strongly coupled QGP as well as the bulk viscosity
which increases significantly in the crossover region. The two-pion
Hanbury-Brown-Twiss (HBT) interferometry for the viscous hydrodynamic sources
is performed. The HBT analyses indicate that the viscosity effect on the
two-pion HBT results is small if only the shear viscosity is taken into
consideration in the calculations. The bulk viscosity leads to a larger
transverse freeze-out configuration of the pion-emitting sources, and thus
increases the transverse HBT radii. The results of the longitudinal HBT radius
for the source with Bjorken longitudinal scaling are consistent with the
experimental data.
