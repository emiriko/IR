Estimation of the operational risk capital under the Loss Distribution
Approach requires evaluation of aggregate (compound) loss distributions which
is one of the classic problems in risk theory. Closed-form solutions are not
available for the distributions typically used in operational risk. However
with modern computer processing power, these distributions can be calculated
virtually exactly using numerical methods. This paper reviews numerical
algorithms that can be successfully used to calculate the aggregate loss
distributions. In particular Monte Carlo, Panjer recursion and Fourier
transformation methods are presented and compared. Also, several closed-form
approximations based on moment matching and asymptotic result for heavy-tailed
distributions are reviewed.
