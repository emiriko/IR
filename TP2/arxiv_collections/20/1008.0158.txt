We have investigated spin Hall effects in 4$d$ and 5$d$ transition metals,
Nb, Ta, Mo, Pd and Pt, by incorporating the spin absorption method in the
lateral spin valve structure; where large spin current preferably relaxes into
the transition metals, exhibiting strong spin-orbit interactions. Thereby
nonlocal spin valve measurements enable us to evaluate their spin Hall
conductivities. The sign of the spin Hall conductivity changes systematically
depending on the number of $d$ electrons. This tendency is in good agreement
with the recent theoretical calculation based on the intrinsic spin Hall
effect.
