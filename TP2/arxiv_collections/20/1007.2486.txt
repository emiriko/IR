The transmission of evanescent waves in a gain-compensated perfect lens is
discussed. In particular, the impact of gain saturation is included in the
analysis, and a method for calculating the fields of such nonlinear systems is
developed. Gain compensation clearly improves the resolution; however, a number
of nonideal effects arise as a result of gain saturation. The resolution
associated with the lens is strongly dependent on the saturation constant of
the active medium.
