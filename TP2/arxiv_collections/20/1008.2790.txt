We perform randomized benchmarking on neutral atomic quantum bits (qubits)
confined in an optical lattice. Single qubit gates are implemented using
microwaves, resulting in a measured error per randomized computational gate of
1.4(1) x 10^-4 that is dominated by the system T2 relaxation time. The results
demonstrate the robustness of the system, and its viability for more advanced
quantum information protocols.
