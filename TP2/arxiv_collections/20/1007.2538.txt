In this work we consider a quantum variation of the usual Aharonov-Bohm
effect with two solenoids sufficiently close one to the other so that
(external) electron cannot propagate between two solenoids but only around both
solenoids. Here magnetic field (or classical vector potential of the
electromagnetic field) acting at quantum propagating (external) electron
represents the quantum mechanical average value or statistical mixture. It is
obtained by wave function of single (internal, quantum propagating within some
solenoid wire) electron (or homogeneous ensemble of such (internal) electrons)
representing a quantum superposition with two practically non-interfering
terms. All this implies that phase difference and interference shape
translation of the quantum propagating (external) electron represent the
quantum mechanical average value or statistical mixture. On the other hand we
consider a classical analogy and variation of the usual Aharonov-Bohm effect in
which Aharonov-Bohm solenoid is used for the primary coil inside secondary
large coil in the remarkable classical Faraday experiment of the
electromagnetic induction.
