A number of recent developments have led to simulations of an inverse
cyclotron for cooling intense muon beams for neutrino factories and muon
colliders. Such a device could potentially act as a novel beam cooling
mechanism for muons, and it would be significantly smaller and cheaper than
other cooling channel designs. Realistic designs are still being explored, but
the first simulations of particle tracking in the inverse cyclotron, with
accumulation in the cyclotron core, have been done with electrostatic
simulations in the particle-in-cell code VORPAL. We present an overview of the
muon inverse cyclotron concept and recent simulation results.
