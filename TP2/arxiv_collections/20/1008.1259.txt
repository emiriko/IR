We present measurements of the V and I band magnitudes of red clump stars in
15 nearby galaxies obtained from recently published homogenous HST photometry.
Supplementing these results with similar data for another 8 galaxies available
in the literature the populational effects on the V and I band magnitudes of
red clump stars were investigated. Comparing red clump magnitudes with the
I-band magnitude of the TRGB in a total sample of 23 galaxies possessing very
different environments we demonstrate that population effects strongly affect
both the V and I band magnitude of red clump stars in a complex way. Our
empirical results basically confirm the theoretical results of Girardi and
Salaris, and show that optical (VI) photometry of red clump stars is not an
accurate method for the determination of distances to nearby galaxies at the
present moment, as long as the population effects are not better calibrated,
both empirically and theoretically. Near infrared photometry is a much better
way to measure galaxy distances with red clump stars given its smaller
sensitivity to population effects.
