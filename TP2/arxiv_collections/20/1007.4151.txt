A d-wave holographic superconductor is studied under a constant magnetic
field by perturbation method, we obtain both droplet and triangular vortex
lattice solution. The results are the same as the s-wave holographic
superconductor. The non-Abelian holographic superconductor with $p+ip$-wave
background is also studied under magnetic field, unlike the d-wave and s-wave
models, we find that the non-Abelian model has only droplet solution.
