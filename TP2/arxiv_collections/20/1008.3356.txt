We present the first search for pair production of isolated jets of charged
leptons in association with a large imbalance in transverse energy in ppbar
collisions using 5.8 fb^-1 of integrated luminosity collected by the D0
detector at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider. No excess is observed above
Standard Model background, and the result is used to set upper limits on the
production cross section of pairs of supersymmetric chargino and neutralino
particles as a function of "dark-photon" mass, where the dark photon is
produced in the decay of the lightest supersymmetric particle.
