We introduce a novel optimization method to design the first examples of
photonic quasicrystals with substantial, complete photonic band gaps (PBGs):
that is, a range of frequencies over which electromagnetic wave propagation is
forbidden for all directions and polarizations. The method can be applied to
photonic quasicrystals with arbitrary rotational symmetry; here, we illustrate
the results for 5- and 8-fold symmetric quasicrystals. The optimized band gaps
are highly isotropic, which may offer advantages over photonic crystals for
certain applications.
