For a discrete memoryless channel with non-causal state information available
only at the encoder, it is well-known that Gelfand-Pinsker coding achieves its
capacity. In this paper, we analyze Gelfand-Pinsker coding scheme and capacity
to bring out further understandings. We show that Gelfand-Pinsker capacity is
equal to the interference-free capacity. Thus the capacity of a channel with
non-causal state information available only at the encoder is the same as if
the state information is also available at the decoder. Furthermore, the
capacity-achieving conditional input distributions in these two cases are the
same. This lets us connect the studied channel with state to the multiple
access channel (MAC) with correlated sources and show that under certain
conditions, the receiver can decode both the message and the state information.
This dual decoding can be obtained in particular if the state sequences come
from a known codebook with rate satisfying a simple constraint. In such a case,
we can modify Gelfand-Pinsker coding by pre-building multiple codebooks of
input sequences $X^n$, each codebook is for a given state sequence $S^n$, upon
generating the auxiliary $U^n$ sequences. The modified Gelfand-Pinsker coding
scheme achieves the capacity of the MAC with degraded message set and still
allows for decoding of just the message at any state information rate. We then
revisit dirty-paper coding for the Gaussian channel to verify our analysis and
modified coding scheme.
