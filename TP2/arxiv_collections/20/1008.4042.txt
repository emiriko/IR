We have investigated the electrodynamic properties of High-Tc strip-lines
made by ion irradiation, in order to evaluate the potentialities of such a
technology for RSFQ superconductor digital electronic. SQUID loops of different
length and width have been fabricated by ion bombardment of 70 nm thick films
through e-beam lithographied shadow masks, and measured at different
temperatures. The voltage modulations have been recorded by direct injection of
a control current in the SQUIDs arms. The corresponding line inductances have
been measured and compared with 3D simulations. A quantitative agreement has
been obtained leading to typical values of 0.4 pH/microns without ground plane.
