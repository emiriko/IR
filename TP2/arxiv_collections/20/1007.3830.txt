In this paper we study the stochastic partial differential systems of
divergence type with $C^1$ space domains in $\bR^d$. Existence and uniqueness
results are obtained in terms of Sobolev spaces with weights so that we allow
the derivatives of the solution to blow up near the boundary. The coefficients
of the systems are only measurable and are allowed to blow up near the
boundary.
