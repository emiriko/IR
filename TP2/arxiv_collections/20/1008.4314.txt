We propose that the logarithmic term in the entanglement entropy computed in
a conformal field theory for a $(d-2)$-dimensional round sphere in Minkowski
spacetime is identical to the logarithmic term in the entanglement entropy of
extreme black hole. The near-horizon geometry of the latter is $H_2\times
S_{d-2}$. For a scalar field this proposal is checked by direct calculation. We
comment on relation of this and earlier calculations to the ``brick wall''
model of 't Hooft. The case of generic 4d conformal field theory is discussed.
