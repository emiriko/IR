We find a significant number of massive and compact galaxies in clusters from
the ESO Distant Clusters Survey (EDisCS) at 0.4<z<1. They have similar stellar
masses, ages, sizes and axial ratios to local z~0.04 compact galaxies in WINGS
clusters, and to z=1.4-2 massive and passive galaxies found in the general
field. If non-BCG cluster galaxies of all densities, morphologies and spectral
types are considered, the median size of EDisCS galaxies is only a factor 1.18
smaller than in WINGS. We show that for morphologically selected samples, the
morphological evolution taking place in a significant fraction of galaxies
during the last Gyrs may introduce an apparent, spurious evolution of size with
redshift, which is actually due to intrinsic differences in the selected
samples. We conclude that the median mass-size relation of cluster galaxies
does not evolve significantly from z~0.7 to z~0.04. In contrast, the masses and
sizes of BCGs and galaxies with M*>4x10^11 Msun have significantly increased by
a factor of 2 and 4, respectively, confirming the results of a number of recent
works on the subject. Our findings show that progenitor bias effects play an
important role in the size-growth paradigm of massive and passive galaxies.
