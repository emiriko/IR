This paper asks a new question: how can we control the collective behavior of
self-organized multi-agent systems? We try to answer the question by proposing
a new notion called 'Soft Control', which keeps the local rule of the existing
agents in the system. We show the feasibility of soft control by a case study.
Consider the simple but typical distributed multi-agent model proposed by
Vicsek et al. for flocking of birds: each agent moves with the same speed but
with different headings which are updated using a local rule based on the
average of its own heading and the headings of its neighbors. Most studies of
this model are about the self-organized collective behavior, such as
synchronization of headings. We want to intervene in the collective behavior
(headings) of the group by soft control. A specified method is to add a special
agent, called a 'Shill', which can be controlled by us but is treated as an
ordinary agent by other agents. We construct a control law for the shill so
that it can synchronize the whole group to an objective heading. This control
law is proved to be effective analytically and numerically. Note that soft
control is different from the approach of distributed control. It is a natural
way to intervene in the distributed systems. It may bring out many interesting
issues and challenges on the control of complex systems.
