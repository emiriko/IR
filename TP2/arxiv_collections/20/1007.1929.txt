We employ Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the two-time density
autocorrelation function for the two-dimensional Coulomb glass. We find that
the nonequilibrium relaxation properties of this highly correlated disordered
system can be described by a full aging scaling ansatz. The scaling exponents
are non-universal, and depend on temperature and charge density.
