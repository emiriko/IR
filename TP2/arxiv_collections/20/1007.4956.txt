Fermilab operates the world's most intense antiproton source. Recently
proposed experiments can use those antiprotons either parasitically during
Tevatron Collider running or after the Tevatron Collider finishes in about
2011. For example, the annihilation of 8 GeV antiprotons might make the world's
most intense source of tagged D^0 mesons, and thus the best near-term
opportunity to study charm mixing and search for new physics via its
CP-violation signature. Other possible precision measurements include
properties of the X(3872) and the charmonium system. An experiment using a
Penning trap and an atom interferometer could make the world's first
measurement of the gravitational force on antimatter. These and other potential
measurements using antiprotons could yield a broad physics program at Fermilab
in the post-Tevatron era.
