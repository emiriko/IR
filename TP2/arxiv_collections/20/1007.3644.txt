It is now feasible to host basic web services on a smart phone due to the
advances in wireless devices and mobile communication technologies. The market
capture of mobile web services also has increased significantly, in the past
years. While the applications are quite welcoming, the ability to provide
secure and reliable communication in the vulnerable and volatile mobile ad-hoc
topologies is vastly becoming necessary. Even though a lot of standardized
security specifications like WS-Security, SAML exist for web services in the
wired networks, not much has been analyzed and standardized in the wireless
environments. In this paper we give our analysis of adapting some of the
security standards, especially WS-Security to the cellular domain, with
performance statistics. The performance latencies are obtained and analyzed
while observing the performance and quality of service of our Mobile Host.
