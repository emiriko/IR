A new crystal growth technique for single-crystals of REFeAsO (RE = La, Ce,
Pr, Nd, Sm, Gd, and Tb) using NaI/KI as flux is presented. Crystals with a size
up to 300 $\mu$m were isolated for single-crystal X-ray diffraction
measurements. Lattice parameters were determined by LeBail fits of X-ray powder
data against LaB6 standard. A consistent set of structural data is obtained and
interpreted in a hard-sphere model. Effective radii for the rare-earth metal
atoms for REFeAsO are deduced. The relation of the intra- and inter-plane
distances of the arsenic atoms is identified as limiter of the phase formation,
and its influence on Tc is discussed.
