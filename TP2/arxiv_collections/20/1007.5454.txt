The use of piezoelectric substrates enables a dynamic observation of strain
dependent properties of functional materials. Based on studies with
La1.85Sr0.15CuO4 we extended this approach to the iron arsenic superconductors
represented by BaFe2-xCoxAs2 to investigate strain driven changes in detail. We
demonstrate that epitaxial thin films can be prepared on
(001)Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)0.72Ti0.28O3 substrates using pulsed laser deposition. The
structural as well as the electric properties of the grown films were
characterized in detail. A reversible shift of the superconducting transition
of 0.44 K for La1.85Sr0.15CuO4 and 0.2 K for BaFe1.8Co0.2As2 was observed
applying a biaxial strain of 0.022% and 0.017% respectively.
