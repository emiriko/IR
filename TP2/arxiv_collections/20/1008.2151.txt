The properties of the relativistic alpha fragments produced in interactions
of 84^Kr at around 1 A GeV in nuclear emulsion are investigated. The
experimental results are compared with the similar results obtained from
various projectiles with emulsion interactions at different energies. The
total, partial nuclear cross-sections and production rates of alpha
fragmentation channels in relativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions and their
dependence on the mass number and initial energy of the incident projectile
nucleus are investigated. The yields of multiple alpha fragments emitted from
the interactions of projectile nuclei with the nuclei of light, medium and
heavy target groups of emulsion-detector are discussed and they indicate that
the projectile-breakup mechanism seems to be free from the target mass number.
It is found that the multiplicity distributions of alpha fragments are well
described by the Koba-Nielsen-Olesen (KNO) scaling presentation. The mean
multiplicities of the freshly produced newly created charged secondary
particles, normally known as shower and secondary particles associated with
target in the events where the emission of alpha fragments were accompanied by
heavy projectile fragments having Z value larger than 4 seem to be constant as
the alpha fragments multiplicity increases, and exhibit a behavior independent
of the alpha fragments multiplicity.
