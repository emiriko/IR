We report on extragalactic sources detected in a 455 square-degree map of the
southern sky made with data at a frequency of 148 GHz from the Atacama
Cosmology Telescope 2008 observing season. We provide a catalog of 157 sources
with flux densities spanning two orders of magnitude: from 15 to 1500 mJy.
Comparison to other catalogs shows that 98% of the ACT detections correspond to
sources detected at lower radio frequencies. Three of the sources appear to be
associated with the brightest cluster galaxies of low redshift X-ray selected
galaxy clusters. Estimates of the radio to mm-wave spectral indices and
differential counts of the sources further bolster the hypothesis that they are
nearly all radio sources, and that their emission is not dominated by
re-emission from warm dust. In a bright (>50 mJy) 148 GHz-selected sample with
complete cross-identifications from the Australia Telescope 20 GHz survey, we
observe an average steepening of the spectra between 5, 20, and 148 GHz with
median spectral indices of $\alpha_{\rm 5-20} = -0.07 \pm 0.06$, $\alpha_{\rm
20-148} = -0.39 \pm0.04$, and $\alpha_{\rm 5-148} = -0.20 \pm 0.03$. When the
measured spectral indices are taken into account, the 148 GHz differential
source counts are consistent with previous measurements at 30 GHz in the
context of a source count model dominated by radio sources. Extrapolating with
an appropriately rescaled model for the radio source counts, the Poisson
contribution to the spatial power spectrum from synchrotron-dominated sources
with flux density less than 20 mJy is $C^{\rm Sync} = (2.8 \pm 0.3) \times
10^{-6} \micro\kelvin^2$.
