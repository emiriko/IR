With this contribution we would like to remember Chandra M. R. Kintala who
passed away in November 2009. We will give short overviews of his CV and his
contributions to the field of theoretical and applied computer science and,
given the opportunity, will attempt to present the current state of limited
nondeterminism and limited resources for machines. Finally, we will briefly
touch on some research topics which hopefully will be addressed in the not so
distant future.
