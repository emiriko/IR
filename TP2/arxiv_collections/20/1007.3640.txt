Mobile data services in combination with profluent web services are seemingly
the path breaking domain in current information research. Effectively, these
mobile web services will pave the way for exciting performance and security
challenges, the core need-to-be-addressed issues. On security front, though a
lot of standardized security specifications and implementations exist for web
services in the wired networks, not much has been analysed and standardized in
the wireless environments. This paper addresses some of the critical challenges
in providing security to the mobile web service domain. We first explore mobile
web services and their key security issues, with special focus on provisioning
based on a mobile web service provider realized by us. Later we discuss
state-of-the-art security awareness in the wired and wireless web services, and
finally address the realization of security for the mobile web service
provisioning with performance analysis results.
