We show that current in a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) can trap
ultracold atoms $<1 \mu$m away with orders of magnitude less spatial noise than
a metal trapping wire. This enables the creation of hybrid systems, which
integrate ultracold atoms with quantum electronic devices to give extreme
sensitivity and control: for example, activating a single quantized conductance
channel in the 2DEG can split a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) for atom
interferometry. In turn, the BEC offers unique structural and functional
imaging of quantum devices and transport in heterostructures and graphene.
