We present Spitzer photometric data for a complete sample of 19 low redshift
(z<0.1) 3CRR radio galaxies as part of our efforts to understand the origin of
the prodigious mid- to far-infrared (MFIR) emission from radio-loud AGN. Our
results show a correlation between AGN power (indicated by [OIII] 5007 emission
line luminosity) and 24 micron luminosity. This result is consistent with the
24 micron thermal emission originating from warm dust heated directly by AGN
illumination. Applying the same correlation test for 70 micron luminosity
against [OIII] luminosity we find this relation to suffer from increased
scatter compared to that of 24 micron. In line with our results for the
higher-radio-frequency-selected 2Jy sample, we are able to show that much of
this increased scatter is due to heating by starbursts which boost the
far-infrared emission at 70 micron in a minority of objects (17-35%). Overall
this study supports previous work indicating AGN illumination as the dominant
heating mechanism for MFIR emitting dust in the majority of low to intermediate
redshift radio galaxies (0.03<z<0.7), with the advantage of strong statistical
evidence. However, we find evidence that the low redshift broad-line objects
(z<0.1) are distinct in terms of their positions on the MFIR vs. [OIII]
correlations.
