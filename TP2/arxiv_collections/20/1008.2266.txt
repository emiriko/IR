The two user Gaussian interference channel with a full-duplex relay is
studied. By using genie aided approaches, two new upper bounds on the
achievable sum-rate in this setup are derived. These upper bounds are shown to
be tighter than previously known bounds under some conditions. Moreover, a
transmit strategy for this setup is proposed. This strategy utilizes the
following elements: Block Markov encoding combined with a Han-Kobayashi scheme
at the sources, decode and forward at the relay, and Willems' backward decoding
at the receivers. This scheme is shown to achieve within a finite gap our upper
bounds in certain cases.
