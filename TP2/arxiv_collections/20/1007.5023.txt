Despite several indirect confirmations of the existence of dark matter, the
properties of a new dark matter particle are still largely unknown. Several
experiments are currently searching for this particle underground in direct
detection, in space and on earth in indirect detection and at the LHC. A
confirmed signal could select a model for dark matter among the many extensions
of the standard model. In this paper we present a short review of the public
codes for computation of dark matter observables.
