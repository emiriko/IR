We first show that every quasisimple sporadic group possesses an unmixed
strongly real Beauville structure aside from the Mathieu groups M11 and M23
(and possibly 2B and M). We go on to show that no almost simple sporadic group
possesses a mixed Beauville structure. We then go on to use the exceptional
nature of the alternating group A6 to give a strongly real Beauville structure
for this group explicitly correcting an earlier error of Fuertes and
Gonzalez-Diez. In doing so we complete the classification of alternating groups
that possess strongly real Beauville structures. We conclude by discussing
mixed Beauville structures of the groups A6:2 and A6:2^2.
