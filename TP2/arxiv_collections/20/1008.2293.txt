An expansion is developed for the Weil-Petersson Riemann curvature tensor in
the thin region of the Teichm\"{u}ller and moduli spaces. The tensor is
evaluated on the gradients of geodesic-lengths for disjoint geodesics. A
precise lower bound for sectional curvature in terms of the surface systole is
presented. The curvature tensor expansion is applied to establish continuity
properties at the frontier strata of the augmented Teichm\"{u}ller space. The
curvature tensor has the asymptotic product structure already observed for the
metric and covariant derivative. The product structure is combined with the
earlier negative sectional curvature results to establish a classification of
asymptotic flats. Furthermore, tangent subspaces of more than half the
dimension of Teichm\"{u}ller space contain sections with a definite amount of
negative curvature. Proofs combine estimates for uniformization group
exponential-distance sums and potential theory bounds.
