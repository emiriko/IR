We present deep optical 18-medium-band photometry from the Subaru telescope
over the ~30' x 30' Extended Chandra Deep Field-South (ECDF-S), as part of the
Multiwavelength Survey by Yale-Chile (MUSYC). This field has a wealth of
ground- and space-based ancillary data, and contains the GOODS-South field and
the Hubble Ultra Deep Field. We combine the Subaru imaging with existing
UBVRIzJHK and Spitzer IRAC images to create a uniform catalog. Detecting
sources in the MUSYC BVR image we find ~40,000 galaxies with R_AB<25.3, the
median 5 sigma limit of the 18 medium bands. Photometric redshifts are
determined using the EAZY code and compared to ~2000 spectroscopic redshifts in
this field. The medium band filters provide very accurate redshifts for the
(bright) subset of galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts, particularly at 0.1 <
z < 1.2 and at z > 3.5. For 0.1 < z < 1.2, we find a 1 sigma scatter in \Delta
z/(1+z) of 0.007, similar to results obtained with a similar filter set in the
COSMOS field. As a demonstration of the data quality, we show that the red
sequence and blue cloud can be cleanly identified in rest-frame color-magnitude
diagrams at 0.1 < z < 1.2. We find that ~20% of the red-sequence-galaxies show
evidence of dust-emission at longer rest-frame wavelengths. The reduced images,
photometric catalog, and photometric redshifts are provided through the public
MUSYC website.
