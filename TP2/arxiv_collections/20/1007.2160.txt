Thermodynamic fluctuation theory originated with Einstein who inverted the
relation $S=k_B\ln\Omega$ to express the number of states in terms of entropy:
$\Omega= \exp(S/k_B)$. The theory's Gaussian approximation is discussed in most
statistical mechanics texts. I review work showing how to go beyond the
Gaussian approximation by adding covariance, conservation, and consistency.
This generalization leads to a fundamentally new object: the thermodynamic
Riemannian curvature scalar $R$, a thermodynamic invariant. I argue that $|R|$
is related to the correlation length and suggest that the sign of $R$
corresponds to whether the interparticle interactions are effectively
attractive or repulsive.
