We show that on every product probability space, Boolean functions with small
total influences are essentially the ones that are almost measurable with
respect to certain natural sub-sigma algebras. This theorem in particular
describes the structure of monotone set properties that do not exhibit sharp
thresholds.
  Our result generalizes the core of Friedgut's seminal work [Ehud Friedgut.
Sharp thresholds of graph properties, and the k-sat problem. J. Amer. Math.
Soc., 12(4):1017-1054, 1999.] on properties of random graphs to the setting of
arbitrary Boolean functions on general product probability spaces, and improves
the result of Bourgain in his appendix to Friedgut's paper.
