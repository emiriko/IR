We show that thin horizontal arrays of single wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs)
suspended above the channel of silicon MOSFETs can be used as vibrating gate
electrodes. This new class of nano-electromechanical system (NEMS) combines the
unique mechanical and electronic properties of SWNTs with an integrated
siliconbased motion detection. Its electrical response exhibits a clear
signature of the mechanical resonance of SWNTs arrays (120-150 MHz) showing
that these thin horizontal arrays behave as a cohesive, rigid and elastic body
membrane with a Young modulus in the order of 1-10 GPa and ultra-low mass. The
resonant frequency can be tuned by the gate voltage and its dependence is well
understood within the continuum mechanics framework.
