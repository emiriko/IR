Xgrid is the first distributed computing architecture built into a desktop
operating system. It allows you to run a single job across multiple computers
at once. All you need is at least one Macintosh computer running Mac OS X v10.4
or later. (Mac OS X Server is not required.) We provide explicit instructions
and example code to get you started, including examples of how to distribute
your computing jobs, even if your initial cluster consists of just two old
laptops in your basement.
