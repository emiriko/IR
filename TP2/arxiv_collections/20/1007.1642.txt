In dynamical spacetimes, apparent and event horizons do not coincide. In this
paper we propose a geometrical measure of the distance between those horizons
and investigate it for the case of the Vaidya spacetime. We show that it is
well-defined, physically meaningful, and has the expected behaviour in the
near-equilibrium limit. We consider its implications for our understanding of
black hole physics.
