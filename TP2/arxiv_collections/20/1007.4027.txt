Arguably the most intriguing aspect of the physics of cuprates is the close
proximity between the record high-Tc superconductivity (HTSC) and the
antiferromagnetic charge-transfer insulating state driven by Mott-like electron
correlations. These are responsible for the intimate connection between high
and low-energy scale physics, and their key role in the mechanism of HTSC was
conjectured very early on. More recently, the detection of quantum oscillations
in high-magnetic field experiments on YBa2Cu3O6+x (YBCO) has suggested the
existence of a Fermi surface of well-defined quasiparticles in underdoped
cuprates, lending support to the alternative proposal that HTSC might emerge
from a Fermi liquid across the whole cuprate phase diagram. Discriminating
between these orthogonal scenarios hinges on the quantitative determination of
the elusive quasiparticle weight Z, over a wide range of hole-doping p. By
means of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) on in situ doped
YBCO, and following the evolution of bilayer band-splitting, we show that the
overdoped metal electronic structure (0.25<p<0.37) is in remarkable agreement
with density functional theory and the Z=2p/(p+1) mean-field prediction. Below
p~0.10-0.15, we observe the vanishing of the nodal quasiparticle weight Z_N;
this marks a clear departure from Fermi liquid behaviour and -- consistent with
dynamical mean-field theory -- is even a more rapid crossover to the Mott
physics than expected for the doped resonating valence bond (RVB) spin liquid.
