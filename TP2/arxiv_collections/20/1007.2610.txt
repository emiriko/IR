A monochromatic double-mode coherent light endowed with orthogonally
polarized photons propagating collinearly is studied in Degenerate Parametric
Amplification. Generation of Hidden Optical- Polarized States is shown by
non-zero values of Index of Hidden Optical-Polarization. Squeezing in HOPS is
demonstrated by recognizing a Squeezing function. The Non-Classical feature of
HOPS is observed by 'degree of Hidden Optical-Polarization' which attains
non-classical value 'greater than unity'. The dynamical nature of Generation,
Squeezing and Non-Classicality are numerically presented.
