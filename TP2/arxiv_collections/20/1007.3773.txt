We derive a factorization theorem for the differential distributions of
electroweak gauge bosons in Drell-Yan processes, valid at low transverse
momentum, using the Soft-Collinear Effective Theory (SCET). We present the
next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) transverse momentum distribution for the
Z-boson and find good agreement with Tevatron data collected by the CDF and D0
collaborations. We also give predictions for the Higgs boson differential
distributions at NLL based on a factorization theorem derived in earlier work.
We derive formulae for all quantities needed to study low transverse momentum
production of color-neutral particles within the effective theory. This
effective field theory approach is free of Landau poles and can be formulated
entirely in momentum space. Consequently, our results are free of the
Landau-pole prescriptions necessary in the standard approach.
