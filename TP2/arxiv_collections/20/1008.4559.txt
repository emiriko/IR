When a thick cylindrical coin is tossed in the air and lands without bouncing
on an inelastic substrate, it ends up on its face or its side. We account for
the rigid body dynamics of spin and precession and calculate the probability
distribution of heads, tails, and sides for a thick coin as a function of its
dimensions and the distribution of its initial conditions. Our theory yields a
simple expression for the aspect ratio of homogeneous coins with a prescribed
frequency of heads/tails compared to sides, which we validate by tossing
experiments using coins of different aspect ratios.
