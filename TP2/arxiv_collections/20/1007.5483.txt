We study the effect of squark generation mixing on squark production and
decays at LHC in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). We show that
the effect can be very large despite the very strong constraints on quark
flavour violation (QFV) from experimental data on B mesons. We find that the
two lightest up-type squarks su_{1,2} can have large branching ratios for the
decays into 'c-quark + neutralino_1' and 't-quark + neutralino_1' at the same
time due to squark generation mixing, leading to QFV signals 'pp -> c bar{t} (t
bar{c}) + missing-E_T + X' with a significant rate. The observation of this
remarkable signature would provide a powerful test of supersymmetric QFV at
LHC. This could have a significant impact on the search for squarks and the
determination of the underlying MSSM parameters.
