We report the iron (Fe) isotope effect on the transition temperature (Tc) in
the oxygen-deficient SmFeAsO_{1-y}, a 50 K-class Fe-based superconductor. For
the optimally-doped samples with Tc = 54 K, change of the Fe average atomic
mass (MFe) causes a negligibly small shift in Tc, with the Fe isotope
coefficient (alphaFe) as small as -0.024 \pm 0.015. This result contrasts with
the finite, inverse isotope shift observed in optimally-doped (Ba,K)Fe2As2,
indicating that the contribution of the electron-phonon interaction markedly
differs between these two Fe-based high-Tc superconductors.
