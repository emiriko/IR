We have computed the adsorption of Krypton in a closed single-walled carbon
nanotube using the method of Grand Canonical Monte Carlo. Our results indicate
evidence of an incommensurate solid formed at high pressure and low temperature
(T<85K), before the formation of a second layer. The solid melts above that
temperature. Our simulations are in good agreement with novel experimental
results for adsorption in individual carbon nanotubes.
