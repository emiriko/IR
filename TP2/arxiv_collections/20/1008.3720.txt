A Path Integral Monte Carlo method is used to investigate the thermodynamics
of nuclear like systems. Systems composed of bosons or fermions interracting
via a Lennard-Jones potential with periodic boundary conditions were simulated
and the corresponding phase diagrams are constructed. The Path Integral Monte
Carlo appears to be a powerfull tool for investigating quantum effects in
nuclear multifragmentation phenomena.
