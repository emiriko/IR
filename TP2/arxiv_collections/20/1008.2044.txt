We study the finite temperature Casimir effect on a pair of parallel
perfectly conducting plates in Randall-Sundrum model without using scalar field
analogy. Two different ways of interpreting perfectly conducting conditions are
discussed. The conventional way that uses perfectly conducting condition
induced from 5D leads to three discrete mode corrections. This is very
different from the result obtained from imposing 4D perfectly conducting
conditions on the 4D massless and massive vector fields obtained by decomposing
the 5D electromagnetic field. The latter only contains two discrete mode
corrections, but it has a continuum mode correction that depends on the
thicknesses of the plates. It is shown that under both boundary conditions, the
corrections to the Casimir force make the Casimir force more attractive. The
correction under 4D perfectly conducting condition is always smaller than the
correction under the 5D induced perfectly conducting condition. These
statements are true at any temperature.
