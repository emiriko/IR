If a TeV-scale charged gauge boson (W') is discovered at the Large Hadron
Collider (LHC), it will become imperative to determine its chiral couplings to
standard model (SM) fermions in order to learn about the underlying theory
containing the W'. We describe the reconstruction of the t, b decay mode of the
W' at the LHC, and identify various kinematic observables such as the angular
distributions of the top quark and the lepton resulting from top decay that can
be used to disentangle the chiral couplings of the W' to SM fermions. We
demonstrate by presenting analytical expressions, numerical simulations, as
well as intuitive illustrations for these observables at the LHC that among the
SM fermions, the polarized top quark can most directly probe the chirality of
such couplings.
