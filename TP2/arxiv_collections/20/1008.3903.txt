We report a discovery of the circularly polarized CH $A^2\Delta-X^2\Pi$ and
$B^2\Sigma^- -X^2\Pi$ molecular bands in the spectrum of the DQ white dwarf GJ
841B. This is only the second such object since the discovery of G99-37 in the
1970s. GJ 841B is also the first WD to unambiguously show polarization in the
C_2 Swan bands. By modeling the intensity and circular polarization in the CH
bands we determine the longitudinal magnetic field strength of 1.3 +- 0.5 MG
and the temperature of 6100 +- 200 K in the absorbing region. We also present
new observations of G99-37 and obtain estimates of the magnetic field strength
7.3 +- 0.3 MG and temperature 6200 +- 200 K, in good agreement with previous
results.
