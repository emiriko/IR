We construct the moduli space of Enriques surfaces in positive characteristic
and eventually over the integers, and determine its local and global structure.
As an application, we show lifting of Enriques surfaces to characteristic zero.
The key observation is that the canonical double cover of an Enriques surface
is birational to the complete intersection of three quadrics in IP^5, even in
characteristic 2.
