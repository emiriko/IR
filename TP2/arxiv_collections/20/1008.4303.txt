We review the basic theory of matrix product states (MPS) as a numerical
variational ansatz for time evolution, and present two methods to simulate
finite temperature systems with MPS: the ancilla method and the minimally
entangled typical thermal state method. A sample calculation with the
Bose-Hubbard model is provided.
