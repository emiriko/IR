A novel method is proposed to determine an analytical expression for
eigenfunctions and numerical result for eigenvalues of the Schr\"odinger type
equations, within the context of Taylor expansion of a function. Optimal
truncation of the Taylor series gives a best possible analytical expression for
eigenfunctions and numerical result for eigenvalues.
