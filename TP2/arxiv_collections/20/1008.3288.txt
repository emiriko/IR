Reversible logic is emerging as an important research area having its
application in diverse fields such as low power CMOS design, digital signal
processing, cryptography, quantum computing and optical information processing.
This paper presents a new 4*4 parity preserving reversible logic gate, IG. The
proposed parity preserving reversible gate can be used to synthesize any
arbitrary Boolean function. It allows any fault that affects no more than a
single signal readily detectable at the circuit's primary outputs. It is shown
that a fault tolerant reversible full adder circuit can be realized using only
two IGs. The proposed fault tolerant full adder (FTFA) is used to design other
arithmetic logic circuits for which it is used as the fundamental building
block. It has also been demonstrated that the proposed design offers less
hardware complexity and is efficient in terms of gate count, garbage outputs
and constant inputs than the existing counterparts.
