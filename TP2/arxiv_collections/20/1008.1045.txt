The macroscopic dimensions of space should not be input but rather output of
a general model for physics. Here, dimensionality arises from a recently
discovered mathematical bifurcation: positive versus indefinite manifold
pairings. It is used to build an action on a formal chain of combinatorial
space-times of arbitrary dimension. The context for such actions is 2-field
theory where Feynman integrals are not over classical, but previously quantized
configurations. A topologically enforced singularity of the action terminates
the dimension at four and, in fact, the final fourth dimension is Lorentzian
due to light-like vectors in the four dimensional manifold pairing. Our
starting point is the action of causal dynamical triangulations but in a
dimension-agnostic setting. It is encouraging that some hint of extra small
dimensions emerges from our action.
