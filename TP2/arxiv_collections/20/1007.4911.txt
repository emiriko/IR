Agglomeration of highly charged microparticles was observed and studied in
complex plasma experiments carried out in a capacitively coupled rf discharge.
The agglomeration was caused by strong dust density waves triggered in a
particle cloud by decreasing neutral gas pressure. Using a high-speed camera
during this unstable regime, it was possible to resolve the motion of
individual microparticles and to show that the relative velocities of some
particles were sufficiently high to overcome the mutual Coulomb repulsion and
hence to result in agglomeration. After stabilising the cloud again through the
increase of the pressure, we were able to observe the aggregates directly with
a long-distance microscope. We show that the agglomeration rate deduced from
our experiments is in good agreement with theoretical estimates. In addition,
we briefly discuss the mechanisms that can provide binding of highly charged
microparticles in a plasma.
