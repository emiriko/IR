The scattering of a neutrino on atomic electrons is considered in the
situation where the energy transferred to the electrons is comparable to the
characteristic atomic energies, as relevant to the current experimental search
for neutrino magnetic moment. The process is contributed by the standard
electroweak interaction as well as by the possible neutrino magnetic moment.
Quantum mechanical sum rules are derived for the inclusive cross section at a
fixed energy deposited in the atomic system, and it is shown that the
differential over the energy transfer cross section is given, modulo very small
corrections, by the same expression as for free electrons, once all possible
final states of the electronic system are taken into account. Thus the atomic
effects effectively cancel in the inclusive process.
