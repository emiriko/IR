We show that a vortex current is created around a skyrmion spin texture under
magnetic field due to a radial spin motive force in a two-dimensional metal
with localized magnetic moments even in the absence of any superconductivity
correlations. The effect is expected both for ferromagnetic and for
antiferromagnetic systems. The Skyrmion-induced vortex mechanism provides a
picture for large Nernst signals observed in the pseudogap phase of the
high-$T_c$ cuprates.
