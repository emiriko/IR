We introduce a class of facilitated asymmetric exclusion processes in which
particles are pushed by neighbors from behind. For the simplest version in
which a particle can hop to its vacant right neighbor only if its left neighbor
is occupied, we determine the steady state current and the distribution of
cluster sizes on a ring. We show that an initial density downstep develops into
a rarefaction wave that can have a jump discontinuity at the leading edge,
while an upstep results in a shock wave. This unexpected rarefaction wave
discontinuity occurs generally for facilitated exclusion processes.
