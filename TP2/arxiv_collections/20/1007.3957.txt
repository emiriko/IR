When a non-integrable system evolves out of equilibrium for a long time,
local observables are expected to attain stationary expectation values,
independent of the details of the initial state. However, intriguing
experimental results with ultracold gases have shown no thermalization in
non-integrable settings, triggering an intense theoretical effort to decide the
question. Here we show that the phenomenology of thermalization in a quantum
system is much richer than its classical counterpart. Using a new numerical
technique, we identify two distinct thermalization regimes, strong and weak,
occurring for different initial states. Strong thermalization, intrinsically
quantum, happens when instantaneous local expectation values converge to the
thermal ones. Weak thermalization, well-known in classical systems, happens
when local expectation values converge to the thermal ones only after time
averaging. Remarkably, we find a third group of states showing no
thermalization, neither strong nor weak, to the time scales one can reliably
simulate.
