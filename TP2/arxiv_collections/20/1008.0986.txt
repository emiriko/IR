We propose a simple approach to construct a quantum-dot and it's electrodes
using chiral metallic single walled carbon nanotube (CM-SWCNT) segments of
exactly opposite chiralities $(m,n)$ and $(n,m)$. The degree and energetics of
electron confinement crucially depends on the choice of $n$ and $m$, and
collinearity of the SWCNT segments constituting the quantum-dot and the
electrodes. All the segments can in principle be obtained through simple
manipulations of fragments of a single nanotube of chirality either $(m,n)$ or
$(n,m)$.
