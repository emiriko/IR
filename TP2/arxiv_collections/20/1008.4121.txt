We show that well-separated quantum superposition states, measurements of
strongly nonlinear observables, and quantum dynamics driven by anomalous
diffusion can all be achieved for single atoms or molecules by imaging
spontaneous photons that they emit via resonance florescence. To generate
anomalous diffusion we introduce continuous measurements driven by L\'evy
processes, and prove a number of results regarding their properties. In
particular we present strong evidence that the only stable L\'evy density that
can realize a strictly continuous measurement is the Gaussian.
