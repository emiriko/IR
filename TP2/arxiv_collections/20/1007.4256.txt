Polarization has been detected at early times for all types of supernova,
indicating that such systems result from or quickly develop some form of
asymmetry. In addition, the detection of strong line polarization in supernovae
is suggestive of chemical inhomogeneities ("clumps") in the layers above the
photosphere, which may reflect hydrodynamical instabilities during the
explosion. We have developed a fast, flexible, approximate semi-analytic code
for modeling polarized line radiative transfer within 3-D inhomogeneous
rapidly-expanding atmospheres. Given a range of model parameters, the code
generates random sets of clumps in the expanding ejecta and calculates the
emergent line profile and Stokes parameters for each configuration. The
ensemble of these configurations represents both the effects of various host
geometries and of different viewing angles. We present results for the first
part of our survey of model geometries, specifically the effects of the number
and size of clumps (and the related effect of filling factor) on the emergent
spectrum and Stokes parameters. Our simulations show that random clumpiness can
produce line polarization in the range observed in SNe Ia (~1-2%), as well as
the Q-U loops that are frequently seen in all SNe. We have also developed a
method to connect the results of our simulations to robust observational
parameters such as maximum polarization and polarized equivalent width in the
line. Our models, in connection with spectropolarimetric observations, can
constrain the 3-D structure of supernova ejecta and offer important insight
into the SN explosion physics and the nature of their progenitor systems.
