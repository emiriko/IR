The connection between geoneutrino registration and the Earth theory test is
discussed. We compare standard theory of lithosphere plates and hypothesis of
hydride Earth. Last hypothesis adds additional neutrino source $-$ planet core
in which the initial Earth composition is conserved. Large volume scintillation
detector is supposed to install at Baksan neutrino observatory INR RAS at
Caucasus. The detector will register all possible neutrino fluxes, but mainly
geo-neutrinos. So kind a detector (or detector net) placed in a number of sites
on the Earth surface can measure all radioactivity from $^{238}$U and
$^{232}$Th, because their neutrino energy exceeds the inverse beta-decay
reaction threshold. By this way it will it possible to understand if there are
any more neutrino sources in the Earth other than the crust and mantle.
