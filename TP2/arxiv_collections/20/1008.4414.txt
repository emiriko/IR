We propose two efficient numerical methods of evaluating the luminosity
distance in the spatially flat {\Lambda}CDM universe. The first method is based
on the Carlson symmetric form of elliptic integrals, which is highly accurate
and can replace numerical quadratures. The second method, using a modified
version of Hermite interpolation, is less accurate but involves only basic
numerical operations and can be easily implemented. We compare our methods with
other numerical approximation schemes and explore their respective features and
limitations. Possible extensions of these methods to other cosmological models
are also discussed.
