A novel technique for damage detection of structures is introduced and
discussed. It is based on purely electric measurements of the state variables
of an electric network coupled to the main structure through a distributed set
of piezoelectric patches. The constitutive parameters of this auxiliary network
are optimized to increase the sensitivity of global measurements- as the
frequency, response functions relative to selected electric degrees of
freedom-with respect to a given class of variations in the
structural-mechanical properties. Because the proposed method is based on
purely electric input and output measurements, it allows for accurate results
in the identification and localization of damages. Use of the electric
frequency-response function to identify the mechanical damage leads to
nonconvex optimization problems; therefore the proposed sensitivity-enhanced
identification procedure becomes computationally efficient if an a priori
knowledge about the damage is available.
