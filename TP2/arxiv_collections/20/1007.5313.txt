Because the LHC is a proton-proton collider, sizable production of two
positively charged W-bosons in association with two jets is possible. This
process leads to a distinct signature of same sign high-pt leptons, missing
energy and jets. We compute the NLO QCD corrections to the QCD-mediated part of
pp -> W+W+jj. These corrections reduce the dependence of the production
cross-section on the renormalization and factorization scale to about +- 10
percent. We find that a large number of W+W+jj events contain a relatively hard
third jet. The presence of this jet should help to either pick up the W+W+jj
signal or to reject it as an unwanted background.
