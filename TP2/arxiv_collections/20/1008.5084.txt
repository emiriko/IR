A diagrammatic presentation of functors and natural transformations and the
virtues of biadjointness are discussed. We then review a graphical description
of the category of Soergel bimodules and a diagrammatic categorification of
positive halves of quantum groups. These notes are a write-up of Takagi
lectures given by the author in Hokkaido University in June 2009.
