The development of a general theoretical framework for describing the
behaviour of a crystal driven far from equilibrium has proved difficult1.
Microfluidic crystals, formed by the introduction of droplets of immiscible
fluid into a liquid-filled channel, provide a convenient means to explore and
develop models to describe non-equilibrium dynamics2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
11. Owing to the fact that these systems operate at low Reynolds number (Re),
in which viscous dissipation of energy dominates inertial effects, vibrations
are expected to be over-damped and contribute little to their dynamics12, 13,
14. Against such expectations, we report the emergence of collective normal
vibrational modes (equivalent to acoustic 'phonons') in a one-dimensional
microfluidic crystal of water-in-oil droplets at Reapprox10-4. These phonons
propagate at an ultra-low sound velocity of approx100 mum s-1 and frequencies
of a few hertz, exhibit unusual dispersion relations markedly different to
those of harmonic crystals, and give rise to a variety of crystal instabilities
that could have implications for the design of commercial microfluidic systems.
First-principles theory shows that these phonons are an outcome of the
symmetry-breaking flow field that induces long-range inter-droplet
interactions, similar in nature to those observed in many other systems
including dusty plasma crystals15, 16, vortices in superconductors17, 18,
active membranes19 and nucleoprotein filaments20.
