The isospin, spin and parity dependent potential of a pair of static-light
mesons is computed using Wilson twisted mass lattice QCD with two flavors of
degenerate dynamical quarks. From the results a simple rule can be deduced
stating, which isospin, spin and parity combinations correspond to attractive
and which to repulsive forces.
