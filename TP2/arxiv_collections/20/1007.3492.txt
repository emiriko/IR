A summary is given of the current status of the next-to-leading order (NLO)
parton-level integrator MCFM. Some details are given about the Higgs + 2-jet
process and the production and decay of $t \bar{t}$, both of which have
recently been added to the code. Using MCFM, comparisons between the Tevatron
running at $\sqrt{s}=2$~TeV and the LHC running at $\sqrt{s}=7$~TeV are made
for standard model process including the production of Higgs bosons. The case
for running the Tevatron until 16fb$^{-1}$ are accumulated by both detectors is
sketched.
