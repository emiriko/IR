In this paper we introduce a novel notion of probabilistic bisimulation for
quantum processes and prove that it is congruent with respect to various
process algebra combinators including parallel composition even when both
classical and quantum communications are present. We also establish some basic
algebraic laws for this bisimulation. In particular, we prove uniqueness of the
solutions to recursive equations of quantum processes, which provides a
powerful proof technique for verifying complex quantum protocols.
