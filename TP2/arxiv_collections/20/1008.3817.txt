Triggered by the study of Carquillat & Prieur (2007, MNRAS, 380, 1064) of Am
binaries, I reanalyse their sample of 60 orbits to derive the mass ratio
distribution (MRD), assuming as they did a priori functional forms, i.e. a
power law or a Gaussian. The sample is then extended using orbits published by
several groups and a full analysis of the MRD is made, without any assumption
on the functional form. I derive the MRD using a Richardson-Lucy inversion
method, assuming a fixed mass of the Am primary and randomly distributed
orbital inclinations. Using the large sub-sample of double-lined spectroscopic
binaries, I show that this methodology is indeed perfectly adequate. Using the
inversion method, applied to my extended sample of 162 systems, I find that the
final MRD can be approximated by a uniform distribution.
