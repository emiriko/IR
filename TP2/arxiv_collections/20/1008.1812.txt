In this paper we will show how the results found in Cator and Pimentel 2009,
about the Busemann functions in last-passage percolation, can be used to
calculate the asymptotic distribution of the speed of a single second class
particle starting from an arbitrary deterministic configuration which has a
rarefaction fan, in either the totally asymetric exclusion process, or the
Hammersley interacting particle process. The method will be to use the well
known last-passage percolation description of the exclusion process and of the
Hammersley process, and then the well known connection between second class
particles and competition interfaces.
