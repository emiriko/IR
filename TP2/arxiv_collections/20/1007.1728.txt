It was recently pointed out that in supersymmetric scenarios with gravitino
dark matter and bilinear R-parity violation, gravitinos with masses below Mw
typically decay with a sizable branching ratio into the 3-body final states
W^*+lepton and Z^*+neutrino. In this paper we study the indirect detection
signatures of gravitino dark matter including such final states. First, we
obtain the gamma ray spectrum from gravitino decays, which features a
monochromatic contribution from the decay into photon+neutrino and a continuum
contribution from the three-body decays. After studying its dependence on
supersymmetric parameters, we compute the expected gamma ray fluxes and derive
new constraints, from recent FERMI data, on the R-parity breaking parameter and
on the gravitino lifetime. Indirect detection via antimatter searches, a new
possibility brought about by the three-body final states, is also analyzed. For
models compatible with the gamma ray observations, the positron signal is found
to be negligible whereas the antiproton one can be significant.
