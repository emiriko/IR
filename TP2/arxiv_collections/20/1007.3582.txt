We study the noncommutative geometrical structures of quantum entangled
states. We show that the space of a pure entangled state is a noncommutative
space. In particular we show that by rewritten the conifold or the Segre
variety we can get a $q$-deformed relation in noncommutative geometry. We
generalized our construction into a multi-qubit state. We also in detail
discuss the noncommutative geometrical structure of a three-qubit state.
