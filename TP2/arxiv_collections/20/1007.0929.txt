Generalized Cullen Numbers are positive integers of the form
$C_b(n):=nb^n+1$. In this work we generalize some known divisibility properties
of Cullen Numbers and present two primality tests for this family of integers.
The first test is based in the following property of primes from this family:
$n^{b^{n}}\equiv (-1)^{b}$ (mod $nb^n+1$). It is stronger and has less
computational cost than Fermat's test (for bases $b$ and $n$) and than
Miller-Rabin's test (for base $n$). Pseudoprimes for this new test seem to be
very scarce, only 4 pseudoprimes have been found among the many millions of
Generalized Cullen Numbers tested. We also present a second, more demanding,
test for wich no pseudoprimes have been found. This test leads to a
"quasi-deterministic" test, running in $\tilde{O}(\log^2(N))$ time, which might
be very useful in the search of Generalized Cullen Primes.
