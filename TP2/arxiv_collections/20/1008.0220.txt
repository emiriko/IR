Polarization data from high mass star formation regions (W51 e2/e8, Orion
BN/KL) are used to derive statistical properties of the plane of sky projected
magnetic field. Structure function and auto-correlation function are calculated
for observations with various resolutions from the BIMA and SMA
interferometers, covering a range in physical scales from $\sim 70$~mpc to
$\sim 2.1$~mpc. Results for the magnetic field turbulent dispersion, its
turbulent to mean field strength ratio and the large-scale polarization angle
correlation length are presented as a function of the physical scale at the
star formation sites. Power law scaling relations emerge for some of these
physical quantities. The turbulent to mean field strength ratio is found to be
close to constant over the sampled observing range, with a hint of a decrease
toward smaller scales, indicating that the role of magnetic field and
turbulence is evolving with physical scale. A statistical method is proposed to
separate large and small scale correlations from an initial ensemble of
polarization segments. This also leads to a definition of a turbulent
polarization angle correlation length.
