The bremsstrahlung cross section for relativistic electrons in a crystal is
split into the sum of coherent and incoherent parts (the last is due to a
thermal motion of atoms in the crystal). Although the spectrum of incoherent
radiation in crystal is similar to one in amorphous medium, the incoherent
radiation intensity could demonstrate substantial dependence on the crystal
orientation due to the electrons' flux redistribution in the crystal. In the
present paper we apply our method of the incoherent bremsstrahlung simulation
developed earlier to interpretation of some recent experimental results
obtained at the Mainz Microtron MAMI.
