We report an investigation of quantum Hall induced currents by simultaneous
measurements of their magnetic moment and their effect on the conductance of a
quantum point contact (QPC). Features in the magnetic moment and QPC resistance
are correlated at Landau-level filling factors nu=1, 2 and 4, which
demonstrates the common origin of the effects. Temperature and non-linear sweep
rate dependences are observed to be similar for the two effects. Furthermore,
features in the noise of the induced currents, caused by breakdown of the
quantum Hall effect, are observed to have clear correlations between the two
measurements. In contrast, there is a distinct difference in the way that the
induced currents decay with time when the sweeping field halts at integer
filling factor. We attribute this difference to the fact that, while both
effects are sensitive to the magnitude of the induced current, the QPC
resistance is also sensitive to the proximity of the current to the QPC
split-gate. Although it is clearly demonstrated that induced currents affect
the electrostatics of a QPC, the reverse effect, the QPC influencing the
induced current, was not observed.
