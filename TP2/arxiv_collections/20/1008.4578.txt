With the use of N-body calculations the amount and properties of escaping
stars from low-N (N = 100 and 1000) young embedded star clusters prior to gas
expulsion are studied over the first 5 Myr of their existence. Besides the
number of stars also different initial radii and binary populations are
examined as well as virialised and collapsing clusters. It is found that these
clusters can loose substantial amounts (up to 20%) of stars within 5 Myr with
considerable velocities up to more than 100 km/s. Even with their mean
velocities between 2 and 8 km/s these stars will still be travelling between 2
and 30 pc during the 5 Myr. Therefore can large amounts of distributed stars in
star-forming regions not necessarily be counted as evidence for the isolated
formation of stars.
