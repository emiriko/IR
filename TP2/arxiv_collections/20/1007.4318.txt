We provide a glimpse of recent progress in meson physics made via QCD's
Dyson-Schwinger equations with: a perspective on confinement and dynamical
chiral symmetry breaking (DCSB); a pre'cis on the physics of in-hadron
condensates; results for the masses of the \pi, \sigma, \rho, a_1 mesons and
their first-radial excitations; and an illustration of the impact of DCSB on
the pion form factor.
