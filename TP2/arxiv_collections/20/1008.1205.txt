We present a Michelson-Morley type experiment for testing the isotropy of the
speed of light in vacuum and matter. The experiment compares the resonance
frequency of a monolithic optical sapphire resonator with the resonance
frequency of an orthogonal evacuated optical cavity made of fused silica while
the whole setup is rotated on an air bearing turntable once every 45 s.
Preliminary results yield an upper limit for the anisotropy of the speed of
light in matter (sapphire) of \Delta c/c < 4x10^(-15), limited by the frequency
stability of the sapphire resonator operated at room temperature. Work to
increase the measurement sensitivity by more than one order of magnitude by
cooling down the sapphire resonator to liquid helium temperatures (LHe) is
currently under way.
