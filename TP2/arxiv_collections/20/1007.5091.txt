Wireless sensor-actor networks are a recent development of wireless networks
where both ordinary sensor nodes and more sophisticated and powerful nodes,
called actors, are present. In this paper we formalize a recently introduced
algorithm that recovers failed actor communication links via the existing
sensor infrastructure. We prove via refinement that the recovery is terminating
in a finite number of steps and is distributed, thus self-performed by the
actors. Most importantly, we prove that the recovery can be done at different
levels, via different types of links, such as direct actor links or indirect
links between the actors, in the latter case reusing the wireless
infrastructure of sensors. This leads to identifying coordination classes,
e.g., for delegating the most security sensitive coordination to the direct
actor-actor coordination links, the least real-time constrained coordination to
indirect links, and the safety critical coordination to both direct actor links
and indirect sensor paths between actors. Our formalization is done using the
theorem prover in the RODIN platform.
