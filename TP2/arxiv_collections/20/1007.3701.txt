This paper investigates situations where a property of a ring can be tested
on a set of "prime right ideals." Generalizing theorems of Cohen and Kaplansky,
we show that every right ideal of a ring is finitely generated (resp.
principal) iff every "prime right ideal" is finitely generated (resp.
principal), where the phrase "prime right ideal" can be interpreted in one of
many different ways. We also use our methods to show that other properties can
be tested on special sets of right ideals, such as the right artinian property
and various homological properties. Applying these methods, we prove the
following noncommutative generalization of a result of Kaplansky: a (left and
right) noetherian ring is a principal right ideal ring iff all of its maximal
right ideals are principal. A counterexample shows that the left noetherian
hypothesis cannot be dropped. Finally, we compare our results to earlier
generalizations of Cohen's and Kaplansky's theorems in the literature.
