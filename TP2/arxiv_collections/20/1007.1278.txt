We derive a simple analytical expression for the two-body force in a
sub-class of MOND-like theories and make testable predictions in the
modification to the two-body orbital period, shape, and precession rate, and
escape speed etc. We demonstrate the applications of the modified Kepler's law
in the timing of satellite orbits around the Milky Way, and checking the
feasibility of MOND in the orbit of Large Magellanic Cloud, the M31 galaxy, and
the merging Bullet Clusters. MOND appears to be consistent with satellite
orbits although with a tight margin. Our results on two-bodies are also
generalized to restricted three-body, many-body problems, rings and shells.
