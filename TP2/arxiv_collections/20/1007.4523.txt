Pandemics can cause immense disruption and damage to communities and
societies. Thus far, modeling of pandemics has focused on either large-scale
difference equation models like the SIR and the SEIR models, or detailed
micro-level simulations, which are harder to apply at a global scale. This
paper introduces a hybrid model for pandemics considering both global and local
spread of infections. We hypothesize that the spread of an infectious disease
between regions is significantly influenced by global traffic patterns and the
spread within a region is influenced by local conditions. Thus we model the
spread of pandemics considering the connections between regions for the global
spread of infection and population density based on the SEIR model for the
local spread of infection. We validate our hybrid model by carrying out a
simulation study for the spread of SARS pandemic of 2002-2003 using available
data on population, population density, and traffic networks between different
regions. While it is well-known that international relationships and global
traffic patterns significantly influence the spread of pandemics, our results
show that integrating these factors into relatively simple models can greatly
improve the results of modeling disease spread.
