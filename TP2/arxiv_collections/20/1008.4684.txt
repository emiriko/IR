We study atoms trapped with a harmonic confinement in an optical lattice
characterized by a flat band and Dirac cones. We show that such an optical
lattice can be constructed which can be accurately described with the tight
binding or Hubbard models. In the case of fermions the release of the harmonic
confinement removes fast atoms occupying the Dirac cones while those occupying
the flat band remain immobile. Using exact diagonalization and dynamics we
demonstrate that a similar strong occupation of the flat band does not happen
in bosonic case and furthermore that the mean field model is not capable for
describing the dynamics of the boson cloud.
