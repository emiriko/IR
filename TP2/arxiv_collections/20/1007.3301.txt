We present an ADHMN-like construction which generates self-dual string
solutions to the effective M5-brane worldvolume theory from solutions to the
Basu-Harvey equation. Our construction finds a natural interpretation in terms
of gerbes, which we develop in some detail. We also comment on a possible
extension to stacks of multiple M5-branes.
