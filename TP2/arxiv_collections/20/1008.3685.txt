We establish an Atiyah-Hirzebruch type spectral sequence relating real
morphic cohomology and real semi-topological K-theory and prove it to be
compatible with the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence relating Bredon
cohomology and Atiyah's KR-theory constructed by Dugger. An equivariant and a
real version of Suslin's conjecture on morphic cohomology are formulated,
proved to come from the complex version of Suslin conjecture and verified for
certain real varieties. In conjunction with the spectral sequences constructed
here this allows the computation of the real semi-topological K-theory of some
real varieties. As another application of this spectral sequence we give an
alternate proof of the Lichtenbaum-Quillen conjecture over $\R$, extending an
earlier proof of Karoubi and Weibel.
