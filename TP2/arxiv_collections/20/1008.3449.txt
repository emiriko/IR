Two-dimensional structures grown with Witten and Sander algorithm are
investigated. We analyze clusters grown off-lattice and clusters grown with
antenna method with $N_{fp}=3,4,5,6,7$ and 8 allowed growth directions. With
the help of variable probe particles technique we measure fractal dimension of
such clusters $D(N)$ as a function of their size $N$. We propose that in the
thermodynamic limit of infinite cluster size the aggregates grown with high
degree of anisotropy ($N_{fp}=3,4,5$) tend to have fractal dimension $D$ equal
to 3/2, while off-lattice aggregates and aggregates with lower anisotropy
($N_{fp}>6$) have $D \approx 1.710$. Noise-reduction procedure results in the
change of universality class for DLA. For high enough noise-reduction value
clusters with $N_{fp} \ge 6$ have fractal dimension going to $3/2$ when
$N\rightarrow\infty$.
