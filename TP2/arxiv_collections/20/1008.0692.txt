Spatially homogeneous and anisotropic Bianchi type $VI_0$ cosmological models
with cosmological constant are investigated in the presence of anisotropic dark
energy. We examine the effects of electromagnetic field on the dynamics of the
universe and anisotropic behavior of dark energy. The law of variation of the
mean Hubble parameter is used to find exact solutions of the Einstein field
equations. We find that electromagnetic field promotes anisotropic behavior of
dark energy which becomes isotropic for future evolution. It is concluded that
the isotropic behavior of the universe model is seen even in the presence of
electromagnetic field and anisotropic fluid.
