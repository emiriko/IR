The ferromagnetic phase (FMP) of a uniaxial magnet with the easy-plane
single-ion anisotropy (SIA) and the anisotropic biquadra\-tic exchange
interaction (BQEI) has been studied. The case $S=1$ for the site spin $S$ has
been considered. Expressions for two branches of the spin excitation spectrum
at finite temperatures $T$ have been obtained, and the conditions for spectral
mode stability have been determined. The spectral mode stability diagram in the
$T-h$ coordinates has been constructed. The diagram testifies that, under
certain conditions, the temperature decrease is accompanied by a violation of
the spectral mode stability followed, as the temperature decreases further, by
its restoration; i.e. the reentrance phenomenon is observed. The temperature of
the second-order phase transition (PT) from the FMP into the phase with
spontaneously broken symmetry has been demonstrated to depend considerably on
the BQEI anisotropy constant.
