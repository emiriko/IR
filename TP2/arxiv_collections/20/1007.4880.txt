A set of all linear transformations with a fixed Jordan structure $J$ is a
symplectic manifold isomorphic to the coadjoint orbit $\mathcal O (J)$ of
$GL(N,C)$. Any linear transformation may be projected along its eigenspace to
(at least one) coordinate subspace of the complement dimension. The Jordan
structure $\tilde J$ of the image is defined by the Jordan structure $J$ of the
pre-image, consequently the projection $\mathcal O (J)\to \mathcal O (\tilde
J)$ is the mapping of the symplectic manifolds. It is proved that the fiber
$\mathcal E$ of the projection is a linear symplectic space and the map
$\mathcal O(J) \to \mathcal E \times \mathcal O (\tilde J)$ is a birational
symplectomorphysm. The iteration of the procedure gives the isomorphism between
$\mathcal O (J)$ and the linear symplectic space, which is the direct product
of all the fibers of the projections. The Darboux coordinates on $\mathcal
O(J)$ are pull-backs of the canonical coordinates on the linear spaces in
question.
