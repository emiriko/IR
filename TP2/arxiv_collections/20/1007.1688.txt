We consider the issue of the appropriate underlying wavefunction describing
the enigmatic 5/2 fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE), the only even
denominator FQHE unambiguously observed in a single layer two dimensional (2D)
electron system. Using experimental transport data and theoretical analysis, we
argue that the possibility of the experimental 5/2 FQH state being not fully
spin-polarized cannot be ruled out. We also establish that the parallel
field-induced destruction of the 5/2 FQHE arises primarily from the enhancement
of effective disorder by the parallel field with the Zeeman energy playing an
important quantitative role.
