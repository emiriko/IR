Shock breakout is the earliest, readily-observable emission from a
core-collapse supernova explosion. Observing supernova shock breakout may yield
information about the nature of the supernova shock prior to exiting the
progenitor and, in turn, about the core-collapse supernova mechanism itself.
X-ray Outburst 080109, later associated with SN 2008D, is a very well-observed
example of shock breakout from a core-collapse supernova. Despite excellent
observational coverage and detailed modeling, fundamental information about the
shock breakout, such as the radius of breakout and driver of the light curve
time scale, is still uncertain. The models constructed for explaining the shock
breakout emission from SN 2008D all assume spherical symmetry. We present a
study of the observational characteristics of {\it aspherical} shock breakout
from stripped-envelope core-collapse supernovae. We conduct two-dimensional,
jet-driven supernova simulations from stripped-envelope progenitors and
calculate the resulting shock breakout X-ray spectra and light curves. The
X-ray spectra evolve significantly in time as the shocks expand outward and are
not well-fit by single-temperature and radius black bodies. The time scale of
the X-ray burst light curve of the shock breakout is related to the shock
crossing time of the progenitor, not the much shorter light crossing time that
sets the light curve time scale in spherical breakouts. This could explain the
long shock breakout light curve time scale observed for XRO 080109/SN 2008D.
