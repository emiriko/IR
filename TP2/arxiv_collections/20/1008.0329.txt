We have investigated the fluorescence emission in the Near Infrared from the
air and its main components, nitrogen and oxygen. The gas was excited by a 95kV
electron beam and the fluorescence light detected by an InGaAs photodiode,
sensitive down to about 1700nm. We have recorded the emission spectra by means
of a Fourier Transform Infrared spectrometer. The light yield was also measured
by comparing the Near Infrared signal with the known Ultraviolet fluorescence,
detected by a Si photodiode. The possibility of using the Near Infrared
fluorescence of the atmosphere to detect Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays is
discussed, showing the pros and the cons of this novel method.
