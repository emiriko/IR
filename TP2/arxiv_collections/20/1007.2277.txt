We present results on the isospin dependence of the eta-prime production
cross section in nucleon-nucleon collisions, as well as the results of
comparative analysis of the invariant mass distributions for the pp-->pp
eta-prime and pp-->pp eta reactions in the context of the proton-eta and
proton-eta-prime interaction. Additionally, the value of the total width of the
eta-prime is reported as derived directly from the measurement of the mass
distribution and an explanation of the experimental technique used in order to
achieve a precision about an order of magnitude better then former experiments
is included.
