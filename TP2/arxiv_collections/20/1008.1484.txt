In order to study the communication between information systems, Gong and
Xiao [Z. Gong and Z. Xiao, Communicating between information systems based on
including degrees, International Journal of General Systems 39 (2010) 189--206]
proposed the concept of general relation mappings based on including degrees.
Some properties and the extension for fuzzy information systems of the general
relation mappings have been investigated there. In this paper, we point out by
counterexamples that several assertions (Lemma 3.1, Lemma 3.2, Theorem 4.1, and
Theorem 4.3) in the aforementioned work are not true in general.
