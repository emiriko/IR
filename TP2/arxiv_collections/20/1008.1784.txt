We explore dark matter mechanisms that can simultaneously explain the
galactic 511 keV gamma rays observed by INTEGRAL/SPI, the DAMA/LIBRA annual
modulation, and the excess of low-recoil dark matter candidates observed by
CoGeNT. It requires three nearly degenerate states of dark matter in the 4-7
GeV mass range, with splittings respectively of order an MeV and a few keV. The
top two states have the small mass gap and transitions between them, either
exothermic or endothermic, can account for direct detections. Decays from one
of the top states to the ground state produce low-energy positrons in the
galaxy whose associated 511 keV gamma rays are seen by INTEGRAL. This decay can
happen spontaneously, if the excited state is metastable (longer-lived than the
age of the universe), or it can be triggered by inelastic scattering of the
metastable states into the shorter-lived ones. We focus on a simple model where
the DM is a triplet of an SU(2) hidden sector gauge symmetry, broken at the
scale of a few GeV, giving masses of order \lsim 1 GeV to the dark gauge
bosons, which mix kinetically with the standard model hypercharge. The purely
decaying scenario can give the observed angular dependence of the 511 keV
signal with no positron diffusion, while the inelastic scattering mechanism
requires transport of the positrons over distances \sim 1 kpc before
annihilating. We note that an x-ray line of several keV in energy, due to
single-photon decays involving the top DM states, could provide an additional
component to the diffuse x-ray background. The model is testable by proposed
low-energy fixed target experiments.
