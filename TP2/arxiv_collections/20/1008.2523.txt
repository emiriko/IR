We have studied electron scattering by out-of-plane (flexural) phonon modes
in doped suspended graphene and its effect on charge transport. In the
free-standing case (absence of strain) the flexural branch shows a quadratic
dispersion relation, which becomes linear at long wavelength when the sample is
under tension due to the rotation symmetry breaking. In the non-strained case,
scattering by flexural phonons is the main limitation to electron mobility.
This picture changes drastically when strains above $\bar{u}=10^{-4}
n(10^{12}\,\text{cm}^{-2})$ are considered. Here we study in particular the
case of back gate induced strain, and apply our theoretical findings to recent
experiments in suspended graphene.
