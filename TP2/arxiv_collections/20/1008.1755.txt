Studying the M-branes leads us naturally to new structures that we call
Membrane-, Membrane^c-, String^K(Z,3)- and Fivebrane^K(Z,4)-structures, which
we show can also have twisted counterparts. We study some of their basic
properties, highlight analogies with structures associated with lower levels of
the Whitehead tower of the orthogonal group, and demonstrate the relations to
M-branes.
