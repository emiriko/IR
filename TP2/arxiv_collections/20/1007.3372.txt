We have proved on the basis of the symmetry analysis of the standard Dirac
equation with nonzero mass that this equation may describe not only fermions of
spin 1/2, but also bosons of spin 1. The new bosonic symmetries of the Dirac
equation in both the Foldy -- Wouthuysen and the Pauli -- Dirac representations
are found. Among these symmetries (together with the 32-dimensional pure matrix
algebra of invariance) the new, physically meaningful spin 1 Poincare symmetry
of equation under consideration is proved. In order to carry out the
corresponding proofs a 64-dimensional extended real Clifford -- Dirac algebra
is put into consideration.
