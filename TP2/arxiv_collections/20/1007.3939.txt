We study the dynamics of a pair of parametrically-driven coupled nonlinear
mechanical resonators of the kind that is typically encountered in applications
involving microelectromechanical and nanoelectromechanical systems (MEMS &
NEMS). We take advantage of the weak damping that characterizes these systems
to perform a multiple-scales analysis and obtain amplitude equations,
describing the slow dynamics of the system. This picture allows us to expose
the existence of homoclinic orbits in the dynamics of the integrable part of
the slow equations of motion. Using a version of the high-dimensional Melnikov
approach, developed by Kovacic and Wiggins [Physica D, 57, 185 (1992)], we are
able to obtain explicit parameter values for which these orbits persist in the
full system, consisting of both Hamiltonian and non-Hamiltonian perturbations,
to form so-called Shilnikov orbits, indicating a loss of integrability and the
existence of chaos. Our analytical calculations of Shilnikov orbits are
confirmed numerically.
