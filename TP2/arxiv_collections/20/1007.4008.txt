A semi-empirical method is used to characterize the 3s(2)3p(2)-3s3p(3) J=2
transition array in P II. In this method, Slater, spin-orbit, and radial
parameters are fitted to experimental energy levels in order to obtain a
description of the array in terms of LS-coupling basis vectors. The various IC
and CI amplitudes resulting from this model are then used to predict the
branching fractions of transitions within the array. Results close to
LS-coupling values are presented, and these are compared to branching ratios
measured using beam-foil spectroscopy at the THIA laboratory. The work provides
support for the hypothesis of Dr. Curtis that transition arrays with little
upper state IC but significant upper state CI in atoms of low Z exhibit
branching fractions close to LS-coupled values, although the data are
inconclusive in this respect.
