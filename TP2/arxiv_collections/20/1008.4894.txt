Preliminary results from the STAR collaboration of the azimuthal anisotropy
$(v_{2})$ of $\pi^{0}$ and direct photon ($\gamma_{dir}$) at high transverse
momentum (p$_{T}$) from Au+Au collisions at center-of-mass energy
$\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}=200$~GeV are presented. A shower-shape analysis is used to
select a sample free of direct photons ($\pi^0$) and a sample rich in direct
photons $\gamma_{rich}$. The relative contribution of background in the
$\gamma_{rich}$ sample is determined assuming no associated charged particles
nearby $\gamma_{dir}$. The $v_{2}$ of direct photons ($v_{2}^{\gamma_{dir}}$)
at mid-rapidity ($|\eta^{\gamma_{dir}}|<1$) and high p$_{T}$ ($8<
p_{T}^{\gamma_{dir}}<16$~GeV/$c$) is extracted from those of $\pi^{0}$ and
neutral particles measured in the same kinematic range. In mid-central Au+Au
collisions (10-40$\%$), the $v_{2}$ of $\pi^0$ ($v_{2}^{\pi^{0}}(p_{T})$) and
charged particles ($v_{2}^{ch}(p_{T})$) are found to be $\sim$ 0.12 and nearly
independent of p$_{T}$. The measured $v_{2}^{\gamma_{dir}}(p_{T})$ is positive
finite and systematically smaller than that of $\pi^{0}$ and charged particles
by a factor of $\sim$ 3. Although the large $v_{2}^{\pi^{0}}$ at such high
p$_{T}$ might be partially due to the path-length dependence of energy loss,
the non-zero value of $v_{2}^{\gamma_{dir}}$ indicates a bias of the reaction
plane determination due to the presence of jets in the events. Systematic
studies are currently in progress.
