An important metric of the performance of a quantum secret sharing scheme is
its information rate. Beyond the fact that the information rate is upper
bounded by one, very little is known in terms of bounds on the information rate
of quantum secret sharing schemes. Further, not every scheme can be realized
with rate one. In this paper we derive new upper bounds for the information
rates of quantum secret sharing schemes. We show that there exist quantum
access structures on $n$ players for which the information rate cannot be
better than $O((\log_2 n)/n)$. These results are the quantum analogues of the
bounds for classical secret sharing schemes proved by Csirmaz.
