Several new experiments have extended studies of the Casimir force into new
and interesting regimes. This recent work will be briefly reviewed. With this
recent progress, new issues with background electrostatic effects have been
uncovered. The myriad of problems associated with both patch potentials and
electrostatic calibrations are discussed and the remaining open questions are
brought forward.
