In the hidden order of URu2Si2 the resistivity at very low temperature shows
no T^2 behavior above the transition to superconductivity. However, when
entering the antiferromagnetic phase, the Fermi liquid behavior is recovered.
We discuss the change of the inelastic term when entering the AF phase with
pressure considering the temperature dependence of the Grueneisen parameter at
ambient pressure and the influence of superconductivity by an extrapolation of
high field data.
