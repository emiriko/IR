Femtosecond bunch is a hot topic in the present world accelerator research
community. The high peak current bunch will lead to the beam breakup
phenomenon. In this paper, the scaling law with current for the single
ultrashort bunch beam breakup in the radio frequency linear accelerator is
proposed and obtained. The scaling power factor is roughly estimated to be 1/6,
1/6 and 1/3 for the geometry wake, the surface roughness wake and the
resistance wake respectively.
