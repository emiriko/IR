We study the thermoelectric properties of three-dimensional topological
Anderson insulators with line dislocations. We show that at high densities of
dislocations the thermoelectric figure of merit ZT can be dominated by
one-dimensional topologically-protected conducting states channeled through the
lattice screw dislocations in the topological insulator materials with a
non-zero time-reversal-invariant momentum such as Bi_{1-x}Sb_x. When the
chemical potential does not exceed much the mobility edge the ZT at room
temperatures can reach large values, much higher than unity for reasonable
parameters, hence making this system a strong candidate for applications in
heat management of nano-devices.
