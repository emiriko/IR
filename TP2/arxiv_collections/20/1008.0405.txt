We study methods for reconstructing the momenta of invisible particles in
cascade decay chains at hadron colliders. We focus on scenarios, such as SUSY
and UED, in which new physics particles are pair produced. Their subsequent
decays lead to two decay chains ending with neutral stable particles escaping
detection. Assuming that the masses of the decaying particles are already
measured, we obtain the momenta by imposing the mass-shell constraints. Using
this information, we develop techniques of determining spins of particles in
theories beyond the standard model. Unlike the methods relying on Lorentz
invariant variables, this method can be used to determine the spin of the
particle which initiates the decay chain. We present two complementary ways of
applying our method by using more inclusive variables relying on kinematic
information from one decay chain, as well as constructing correlation variables
based on the kinematics of both decay chains in the same event.
