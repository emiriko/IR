As more and more multi-tier services are developed from commercial
off-the-shelf components or heterogeneous middleware without source code
available, both developers and administrators need a request tracing tool to
(1) exactly know how a user request of interest travels through services of
black boxes; (2) obtain macro-level user request behavior information of
services without the necessity of inundating within massive logs. Previous
research efforts either accept imprecision of probabilistic correlation methods
or present precise but unscalable tracing approaches that have to collect and
analyze large amount of logs; Besides, previous precise request tracing
approaches of black boxes fail to propose macro-level abstractions that enables
debugging performance-in-the-large, and hence users have to manually interpret
massive logs. This paper introduces a precise, scalable and online request
tracing tool, named PreciseTracer, for multi-tier services of black boxes. Our
contributions are four-fold: first, we propose a precise request tracing
algorithm for multi-tier services of black boxes, which only uses
application-independent knowledge; second, we respectively present micro-level
and macro-level abstractions: component activity graphs and dominated causal
path patterns to represent causal paths of each individual request and
repeatedly executed causal paths that account for significant fractions; third,
we present two mechanisms: tracing on demand and sampling to significantly
increase system scalability; fourth, we design and implement an online request
tracing tool. PreciseTracer's fast response, low overhead and scalability make
it a promising tracing tool for large-scale production systems.
