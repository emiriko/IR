This snapshot of recent progress in hadron physics made in connection with
QCD's Dyson-Schwinger equations includes: a perspective on confinement and
dynamical chiral symmetry breaking (DCSB); a pre'cis on the physics of
in-hadron condensates; results on the hadron spectrum, including
dressed-quark-core masses for the nucleon and Delta, their first radial
excitations, and the parity-partners of these states; an illustration of the
impact of DCSB on the electromagnetic pion form factor, thereby exemplifying
how data can be used to chart the momentum-dependence of the dressed-quark mass
function; and a prediction that F_1^{p,d}/F_1^{p,u} passes through zero at
Q^2\approx 5m_N^2 owing to the presence of nonpointlike scalar and axial-vector
diquark correlations in the nucleon.
