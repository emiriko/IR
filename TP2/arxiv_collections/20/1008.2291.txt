We present preliminary measurements of $Z/\gamma^*$+jets, $W+c$ and $Z+b+X$
at the Tevatron, and review recent measurements of vector boson plus inclusive
and heavy-flavor jets production. All measurements are in agreement with
next-to-leading-order QCD calculations within the experimental and theoretical
uncertainties. We also point to comparisons of the production rate and
kinematics of the data with several Monte Carlo simulation programs of vector
boson + jets processes.
