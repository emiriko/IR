This work developed a numerical procedure for a system of partial
differential equations (PDEs) describing the propagation of solitons in ideal
optical fibers. The validation of the procedure was implemented from the
numerical comparison between the known analytical solutions of the PDEs system
and those obtained by using the numerical procedure developed. It was
discovered that the procedure, based on the finite difference method and
relaxation Gauss-Seidel method, was adequate in describing the propagation of
soliton waves in ideals optical fibers.
