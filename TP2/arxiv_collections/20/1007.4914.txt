Radiation reaction effects in the interaction of an electron and a strong
laser field are investigated in the realm of quantum electrodynamics. We
identify quantum radiation reaction with the multiple photon recoils
experienced by the laser-driven electron due to consecutive incoherent photon
emissions. After determining a quantum radiation dominated regime, we
demonstrate how in this regime quantum signatures of radiation reaction
strongly affect multiphoton Compton scattering spectra and that they could be
measurable in principle with presently available laser technology.
