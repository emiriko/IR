We give a formula for the values of automorphic Green functions on the
special rational 0-cycles (big CM points) attached to certain maximal tori in
the Shimura varieties associated to rational quadratic spaces of signature
(2d,2). Our approach depends on the fact that the Green functions in question
are constructed as regularized theta lifts of harmonic weak Mass forms, and it
involves the Siegel-Weil formula and the central derivatives of incoherent
Eisenstein series for totally real fields. In the case of a weakly holomorphic
form, the formula is an explicit combination of quantities obtained from the
Fourier coefficients of the central derivative of the incoherent Eisenstein
series. In the case of a general harmonic weak Maass form, there is an
additional term given by the central derivative of a Rankin-Selberg type
convolution.
