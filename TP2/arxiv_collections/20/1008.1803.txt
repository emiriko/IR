Model gravitational waveforms must be accurate enough to be useful for
detection of signals and measurement of their parameters, so appropriate
accuracy standards are needed. Yet these standards should not be unnecessarily
restrictive, making them impractical for the numerical and analytical modelers
to meet. The work of Lindblom, Owen, and Brown [Phys. Rev. D 78, 124020 (2008)]
is extended by deriving new waveform accuracy standards which are significantly
less restrictive while still ensuring the quality needed for gravitational-wave
data analysis. These new standards are formulated as bounds on certain norms of
the time-domain waveform errors, which makes it possible to enforce them in
situations where frequency-domain errors may be difficult or impossible to
estimate reliably. These standards are less restrictive by about a factor of 20
than the previously published time-domain standards for detection, and up to a
factor of 60 for measurement. These new standards should therefore be much
easier to use effectively.
