This paper studies the possibility of using axicons in Free Space Optics
(FSO) systems. The behavior of the pseudo- Bessel beams generated by
"logarithmic" and "linear" axicons, with or without stops, was analyzed through
the Huygens-Fresnel integral of diffraction in cylindrical coordinates. We also
show that GRIN (Gradient Index) axicons, when well designed, could be used in
order to choose the intensity pattern along the propagation axis, which could
be a new technique for the alignment equipment.
