In this Analysis we investigated the possibility of the measurement of Higgs
self-coupling at ILC through the process $e^++e^-\rightarrow ZHH$ using fast
simulation data. So far two combinations of decay modes: $Z\rightarrow q \bar
q,H\rightarrow b\bar b, H\rightarrow WW^*$ and $Z\rightarrow l \bar l,
H\rightarrow b\bar b, H\rightarrow b\bar b$ were studied. Our preliminary
results show that it is very challenging to suppress the huge standard model
backgrounds effectively.
