We consider the energy density and energy transfer in small amplitude,
one-dimensional waves on a string, and find that the common expressions used in
textbooks for the introductory physics with calculus course give wrong results
for some cases, including standing waves. We discuss the origin of the problem,
and how it can be corrected in a way appropriate for the introductory calculus
based physics course.
