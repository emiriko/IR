We show that the charge conductivity for impurity free multi band electronic
systems can be expressed in terms of the diagonal and non-diagonal elements of
the Zitterbewegung amplitudes while the Berry curvature and the Chern number is
related only to the diagonal elements. Thus, the phenomenon of the
Zitterbewegung can no longer be viewed just as an interesting consequence of
quantum physics but it has also an experimental relevance. Moreover, through
several examples we demonstrate how efficient our approach is in the analytical
calculation of the charge conductivity.
