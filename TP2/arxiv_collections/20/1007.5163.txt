We have studied the production of the 1S_0 charmonium state, eta_c, at the
Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in the framework of Non-Relativistic Quantum
Chromodynamics (NRQCD) using heavy-quark symmetry. We find that NRQCD predicts
a large production cross-section for this resonance at the LHC even after
taking account the small branching ratio of eta_c into two photons. We show
that it will be possible to test NRQCD through its predictions for eta_c, with
the statistics that will be achieved at the early stage of the LHC, running at
a center of mass energy of 7 TeV with an integrated luminosity of 100 pb^{-1}
