We extend the Krori-Barua analysis of the static, spherically symmetric,
Einstein-Maxwell field equations and consider charged fluid sources with
anisotropic stresses. The inclusion of a new variable (tangential pressure)
allows the use of a non-linear, Chaplygin-type equation of state with
coefficients fixed by the matching conditions at the boundary of the source.
Some physical features are briefly discussed.
