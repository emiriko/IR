It is known from earlier work of Iqbal, Liu (arXiv:0809.3808) that the
boundary transport coefficients such as electrical conductivity (at vanishing
chemical potential), shear viscosity etc. at low frequency and finite
temperature can be expressed in terms of geometrical quantities evaluated at
the horizon. In the case of electrical conductivity, at zero chemical potential
gauge field fluctuation and metric fluctuation decouples, resulting in a
trivial flow from horizon to boundary. In the presence of chemical potential,
the story becomes complicated due to the fact that gauge field and metric
fluctuation can no longer be decoupled. This results in a nontrivial flow from
horizon to boundary. Though horizon conductivity can be expressed in terms of
geometrical quantities evaluated at the horizon, there exist no such neat
result for electrical conductivity at the boundary. In this paper we propose an
expression for boundary conductivity expressed in terms of geometrical
quantities evaluated at the horizon and thermodynamical quantities. We also
consider the theory at finite cutoff outside the horizon (arXiv:1006.1902) and
give an expression for cutoff dependent electrical conductivity, which
interpolates smoothly between horizon conductivity and boundary conductivity .
Using the results about the electrical conductivity we gain much insight into
the universality of thermal conductivity to viscosity ratio proposed in
