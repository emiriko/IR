Anomalous transport is usually described either by models of continuous time
random walks (CTRW) or, otherwise by fractional Fokker-Planck equations (FFPE).
The asymptotic relation between properly scaled CTRW and fractional diffusion
process has been worked out via various approaches widely discussed in
literature. Here, we focus on a correspondence between CTRWs and time and space
fractional diffusion equation stemming from two different methods aimed to
accurately approximate anomalous diffusion processes. One of them is the Monte
Carlo simulation of uncoupled CTRW with a L\'evy $\alpha$-stable distribution
of jumps in space and a one-parameter Mittag-Leffler distribution of waiting
times. The other is based on a discretized form of a subordinated Langevin
equation in which the physical time defined via the number of subsequent steps
of motion is itself a random variable. Both approaches are tested for their
numerical performance and verified with known analytical solutions for the
Green function of a space-time fractional diffusion equation. The comparison
demonstrates trade off between precision of constructed solutions and
computational costs. The method based on the subordinated Langevin equation
leads to a higher accuracy of results, while the CTRW framework with a
Mittag-Leffler distribution of waiting times provides efficiently an
approximate fundamental solution to the FFPE and converges to the probability
density function of the subordinated process in a long-time limit.
