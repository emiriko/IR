The boundary-induced phase transitions in an asymmetric simple exclusion
process with inter-particle repulsion and bulk non-conservation are analyzed
through the fixed points of the boundary layers. This system is known to have
phases in which particle density profiles have different kinds of shocks. We
show how this boundary-layer fixed-point method allows us to gain physical
insights on the nature of the phases and also to obtain several quantitative
results on the density profiles especially on the nature of the boundary-layers
and shocks.
