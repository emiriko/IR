Much effort has been devoted to removing differential Stark shifts for atoms
trapped in specially tailored "magic" optical lattices, but thus far work has
focused on a single trapped atomic species. In this work, we extend these ideas
to include two atomic species sharing the same optical lattice. We show
qualitatively that, in particular, scalar J = 0 divalent atoms paired with
non-scalar state atoms have the necessary characteristics to achieve such Stark
shift cancellation. We then present numerical results on "magic" trapping
conditions for 27Al paired with 87Sr, as well as several other divalent atoms.
