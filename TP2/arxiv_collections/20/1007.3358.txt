A generalized form of the Hastings and Levitov (HL) algorithm for simulation
of diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA) restricted in a sector geometry is
studied. It is found that this generalization with uniform measure produces
"wedge-like" fractal patterns in the physical space, whose fractal dimension
and anisotropy exponent depend significantly on the opening angle $\beta$ of
the sector. The morphological properties and the overall shape of the patterns
are analyzed by computing the angular two-point density correlation function of
the patterns. We also find that the fractal dimension of the patterns with
sinusoidal distributed measure depend weakly on $\beta$ with almost the same
dimension as the radial DLA cluster. The anisotropy exponent and the visual
appearance of the patterns in this case are shown to be compatible with those
of the advection-diffusion-limited aggregation (ADLA) clusters.
