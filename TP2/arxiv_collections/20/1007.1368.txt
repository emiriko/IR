Linear Programming (LP) decoding of Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes has
attracted much attention in the research community in the past few years. The
aim of LP decoding is to develop an algorithm which has error-correcting
performance similar to that of the Sum-Product (SP) decoding algorithm, while
at the same time it should be amenable to mathematical analysis. The LP
decoding algorithm has also been extended to nonbinary linear codes by Flanagan
et al. However, the most important problem with LP decoding for both binary and
nonbinary linear codes is that the complexity of standard LP solvers such as
the simplex algorithm remain prohibitively large for codes of moderate to large
block length. To address this problem, Vontobel et al. proposed a low
complexity LP decoding algorithm for binary linear codes which has complexity
linear in the block length. In this paper, we extend the latter work and
propose a low-complexity LP decoding algorithm for nonbinary linear codes. We
use the LP formulation proposed by Flanagan et al. as a basis and derive a pair
of primal-dual LP formulations. The dual LP is then used to develop the
low-complexity LP decoding algorithm for nonbinary linear codes. In contrast to
the binary low-complexity LP decoding algorithm, our proposed algorithm is not
directly related to the nonbinary SP algorithm. Nevertheless, the complexity of
the proposed algorithm is linear in the block length and is limited mainly by
the maximum check node degree. As a proof of concept, we also present a
simulation result for a $[80,48]$ LDPC code defined over $\mathbb{Z}_4$ using
quaternary phase-shift keying over the AWGN channel, and we show that the
error-correcting performance of the proposed LP decoding algorithm is similar
to that of the standard LP decoding using the simplex solver.
