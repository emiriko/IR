We report on initial results from a Spitzer program to search for very
low-mass brown dwarfs in Ophiuchus. This program is an extension of an earlier
study by Allers et al. which had resulted in an extraordinary success rate, 18
confirmed out of 19 candidates. Their program combined near-infrared and
Spitzer photom- etry to identify objects with very cool photospheres together
with circumstellar disk emission to indicate youth. Our new program has
obtained deep IRAC pho- tometry of a 0.5 deg2 field that was part of the
original Allers et al. study. We report 18 new candidates whose luminosities
extend down to 10-4 L\cdot which sug- gests masses down to ~ 2 MJ if confirmed.
We describe our selection techniques, likely contamination issues, and
follow-on photometry and spectroscopy that are in progress.
