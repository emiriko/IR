Single and double torsion oscillators have been used successfully to measure
the anomalous change in resonant frequency and accompanying dissipation in
solid He-4. We present a glass description of the mechanical anomalies found in
torsion oscillator measurements. Our results show that it is not necessary to
invoke a supersolid interpretation to explain these mechanical anomalies.
Previously, we demonstrated that the back-action of a glassy subsystem present
in solid He-4 can account for frequency change and dissipation peak in many
single torsion oscillator experiments. Here, we show that the same glassy
back-action can explain the experimental results of the composite torsion
oscillator developed by the Rutgers group, which measures the response of solid
He-4 at the in-phase mode f1=496 Hz and out-of-phase mode f2=1173 Hz.
