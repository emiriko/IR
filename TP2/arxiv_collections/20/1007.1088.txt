We show that in a rotating two-component Bose mixture, the spin drag between
the two different spin species shows a Hall effect. This spin drag Hall effect
can be observed experimentally by studying the out-of-phase dipole mode of the
mixture. We determine the damping of this mode due to spin drag as a function
of temperature. We find that due to Bose stimulation there is a strong
enhancement of the damping for temperatures close to the critical temperature
for Bose-Einstein condensation.
