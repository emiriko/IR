The Hirota algorithm for solving several integrable nonlinear evolution
equations is suggestive of a simple quantized representation of these equations
and their soliton solutions over a Fock space of bosons or of fermions. The
classical nonlinear wave equation becomes a nonlinear equation for an operator.
The solution of this equation is constructed through the operator analog of the
Hirota transformation. The classical N-solitons solution is the expectation
value of the solution operator in an N-particle state in the Fock space.
