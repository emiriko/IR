We sketch a recent sum-rule extraction of the decay constants of the heavy
pseudoscalar mesons D, D_s, B, and B_s from the two-point correlator of
heavy-light pseudoscalar currents [1]. Our main emphasis lies on the control
over all the uncertainties in the decay constants, related both to the input
QCD parameters and to the limited accuracy of the method of sum rules. Gaining
this control has become possible by application of our new procedure of
extracting hadron observables based on a dual threshold depending on the Borel
parameter. For the charmed-meson decay constants, we find f_D=206.2\pm 7.3(OPE)
\pm 5.1(syst) MeV, f_Ds=245.3\pm 15.7(OPE) \pm 4.5(syst) MeV. For the beauty
mesons, the decay constants turn out to be extremely sensitive to the precise
value of the MSbar mass of the b-quark, mb(mb). By requiring our sum-rule
estimate to match the average of the lattice determinations of f_B, we extract
the rather accurate value mb(mb)=(4.245\pm 0.025) GeV. Feeding this parameter
value into our sum-rule formalism leads to the beauty-meson decay constants f_B
= 193.4 \pm 12.3(OPE) \pm 4.3(syst) MeV, f_Bs =232.5 \pm 18.6(OPE) \pm
2.4(syst) MeV.
