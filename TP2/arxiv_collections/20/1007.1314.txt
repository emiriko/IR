We show that points in the intersection of the tropicalizations of
subvarieties of a torus lift to algebraic intersection points with expected
multiplicities, provided that the tropicalizations intersect in the expected
dimension. We also prove a similar result for intersections inside an ambient
subvariety of the torus, when the tropicalizations meet inside a facet of
multiplicity 1. The proofs require not only the geometry of compactified
tropicalizations of subvarieties of toric varieties, but also new results about
the geometry of finite type schemes over non-noetherian valuation rings of rank
1. In particular, we prove subadditivity of codimension and a principle of
continuity for intersections in smooth schemes over such rings, generalizing
well-known theorems over regular local rings. An appendix on the topology of
finite type morphisms may also be of independent interest.
