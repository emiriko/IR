We discuss new physics in top-quark interactions, using an effective field
theory approach. We consider top-quark decay, single top production, and
top-quark pair production. We identify 15 dimension-six operators that
contribute to these processes, and we compute the deviation from the Standard
Model induced by these operators. The results provide a systematic way of
searching for (or obtaining bounds on) physics beyond the Standard Model.
