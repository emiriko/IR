We have carried out multi-epoch VLBI observations with VERA (VLBI Exploration
of Radio Astrometry) of the 22~GHz H$_{2}$O masers associated with a Class 0
protostar L1448C in the Perseus molecular cloud. The maser features trace the
base of collimated bipolar jet driven by one of the infrared counter parts of
L1448C named as L1448C(N) or L1448-mm A. We detected possible evidences for
apparent acceleration and precession of the jet according to the
three-dimensional velocity structure. Based on the phase-referencing VLBI
astrometry, we have successfully detected an annual parallax of the H$_{2}$O
maser in L1448C to be 4.31$\pm$0.33~milliarcseconds (mas) which corresponds to
a distance of 232$\pm$18~pc from the Sun. The present result is in good
agreement with that of another H$_{2}$O maser source NGC~1333 SVS13A in the
Perseus molecular cloud, 235~pc. It is also consistent with the photometric
distance, 220~pc. Thus, the distance to the western part of the Perseus
molecular cloud complex would be constrained to be about 235~pc rather than the
larger value, 300~pc, previously reported.
