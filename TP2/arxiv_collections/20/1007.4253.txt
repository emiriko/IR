There are constructed exact solutions of the quantum-mechanical Dirac
equation for a spin S=1/2 particle in Riemannian space of constant negative
curvature, hyperbolic Lobachevsky space, in presence of an external magnetic
field, analogue of the homogeneous magnetic field in the Minkowski space. A
generalized formula for energy levels, describing quantization of the
transversal motion of the particle in magnetic field has been obtained. The
same problem is solved for spin 1/2 particle in the space of constant positive
curvature, spherical Riemann space. A generalized formula for energy levels,
describing quantization of the transversal and along the magnetic field motions
of the particle on the background of the Riemann space geometry, is obtained.
