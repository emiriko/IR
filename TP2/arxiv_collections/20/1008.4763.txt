Recently one of us derived the action of modified gravity consistent with the
holographic and new-agegraphic dark energy. In this paper, we investigate the
stability of the Lagrangians of the modified gravity as discussed in [M. R.
Setare, Int. J. Mod. Phys. D 17 (2008) 2219; M. R. Setare, Astrophys. Space
Sci. 326 (2010) 27]. We also calculate the statefinder parameters which
classify our dark energy model.
