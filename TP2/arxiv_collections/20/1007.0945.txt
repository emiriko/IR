We consider the editorial processing of papers in scientific journals as a
human activity process based on the decision making. A functional form of the
probability distributions of random variables describing a human dynamics is
studied using classical approaches of mass service systems theory, physics of
critical phenomena and statistical methods of data analysis. Our additional
goal is to corroborate the scientometrical application of the results obtained.
