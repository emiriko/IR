Taking advantage of the electron Bernstein waves heating (EBWH) system of the
TJ-II stellarator, an electron Bernstein emission (EBE) diagnostic was
installed. Its purpose is to investigate the B-X-O radiation properties in the
zone where optimum theoretical EBW coupling is predicted. An internal movable
mirror shared by both systems allows us to collect the EBE radiation along the
same line of sight that is used for EBW heating. The theoretical EBE has been
calculated for different orientations of the internal mirror using the TRUBA
code as ray tracer. A comparison with experimental data obtained in NBI
discharges is carried out. The results provide a valuable information regarding
the experimental O-X mode conversion window expected in the EBW heating
experiments. Furthermore, the characterization of the radiation polarization
shows evidence of the underlying B-X-O conversion process.
