We investigate the feasibility of extracting the gravitational nanolensing
signal due to the presence of subsolar mass halos within galaxy-sized dark
matter halos. We show that subsolar mass halos in a lensing galaxy can cause
strong nanolensing events with shorter durations and smaller amplitudes than
microlensing events caused by stars. We develop techniques that can be used in
future surveys such as Pan-STARRS, LSST and OMEGA to search for the nanolensing
signal from subsolar mass halos.
