Implementing a component-based system in a distributed way so that it ensures
some global constraints is a challenging problem. We consider here abstract
specifications consisting of a composition of components and a controller given
in the form of a set of interactions and a priority order amongst them. In the
context of distributed systems, such a controller must be executed in a
distributed fashion while still respecting the global constraints imposed by
interactions and priorities.
  We present in this paper an implementation of an algorithm that allows a
distributed execution of systems with (binary) interactions and priorities. We
also present a comprehensive simulation analysis that shows how sensitive to
changes our algorithm is, in particular changes related to the degree of
conflict in the system.
