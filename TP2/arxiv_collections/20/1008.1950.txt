I present a study of two Herbig Ae stars that are in completely different
evolutionary stages: V892 Tau and PV Cep. Using sub arc-second interferometric
observations obtained with the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave
Astronomy (CARMA) at the 1.3 and 2.7 mm wavelengths, I have for the first time
resolved their disks. I deduce that the 5 Myr old V892 Tau has a low dust
opacity index $\beta$=1.1 and a disk mass of 0.03 $\msun$. These values
correspond to the growth of its dust into large up to centimeters size
structures. In contrast, the very young (a few 10$^5$yrs) PV Cep has a quite
high opacity index $\beta$ =1.75 and a more massive disk 0.8 $\msun$. PV Cep
has the youngest resolved disk around any Herbig Ae star. Unlike the youngest T
Tauri and Class 0 stars, which contain large and processed grains, the young
Herbig Ae star, PV Cep, disk contains ISM-like unprocessed dust. This suggests
that PV Cep's dust evolution is slower than T Tauri stars'. I also present high
spatial resolution interferometric observations of the PV Cep outflow. The
outflow inclination is consistent with the orientation of the known Herbig-Haro
flow in that region, HH315.
