Finite temperature density functional theory provides, in principle, an exact
description of the thermodynamical equilibrium of many-electron systems. In
practical applications, however, the functionals must be approximated.
Efficient and physically meaningful approximations can be developed if relevant
properties of the exact functionals are known and taken into consideration as
constraints. In this work, derivations of exact properties and scaling
relations for the main quantities of finite temperature density functional
theory are presented. In particular, a coordinate scaling transformation at
finite temperature is introduced and its consequences are elucidated.
