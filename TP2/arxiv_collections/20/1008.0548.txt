The problem of the generation of an intermediate image between two given
images in an image sequence is considered. The problem is formulated as an
optimal control problem governed by a transport equation. This approach bears
similarities with the Horn \& Schunck method for optical flow calculation but
in fact the model is quite different. The images are modelled in $BV$ and an
analysis of solutions of transport equations with values in $BV$ is included.
Moreover, the existence of optimal controls is proven and necessary conditions
are derived. Finally, two algorithms are given and numerical results are
compared with existing methods. The new method is competitive with
state-of-the-art methods and even outperforms several existing methods.
