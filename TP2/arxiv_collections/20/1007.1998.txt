The group $\Out$ of outer automorphisms of the free group has been an object
of active study for many years, yet its geometry is not well understood.
Recently, effort has been focused on finding a hyperbolic complex on which
$\Out$ acts, in analogy with the curve complex for the mapping class group.
Here, we focus on one of these proposed analogues: the edge splitting complex
$\ESC$, equivalently known as the separating sphere complex. We characterize
geodesic paths in its 1-skeleton algebraically, and use our characterization to
find lower bounds on distances between points in this graph.
  Our distance calculations allow us to find quasiflats of arbitrary dimension
in $\ESC$. This shows that $\ESC$: is not hyperbolic, has infinite asymptotic
dimension, and is such that every asymptotic cone is infinite dimensional.
These quasiflats contain an unbounded orbit of a reducible element of $\Out$.
As a consequence, there is no coarsely $\Out$-equivariant quasiisometry between
$\ESC$ and other proposed curve complex analogues, including the regular free
splitting complex $\FSC$, the (nontrivial intersection) free factorization
complex $\FFZC$, and the free factor complex $\FFC$, leaving hope that some of
these complexes are hyperbolic.
