We consider a possibility of capture of a heavy charged massive particle
$\chi^-$ by the nucleus leading to appearance of a bound state. A simple
analytic formula allowing to calculate binding energies of the $N\chi^-$ bound
state for different nuclei is derived. If the binding energy is sufficiently
large the particle $\chi^-$ is stable inside the nucleus. The probabilities of
the nuclear fissions for such states are calculated. It is shown that the bound
states are more stable to a possible fission in comparison to the bare nucleus.
This makes an observation of this hypothetical charged massive particle and the
superheavy nuclei more probable.
