The Wilson Coefficients for all 4-parton operators which arise in matching
QCD to Soft-Collinear Effective Theory (SCET) are computed at 1-loop. Any dijet
observable calculated in SCET beyond leading order will require these results.
The Wilson coefficients are separated by spin and color, although most
applications will involve only the spin-averaged hard functions. The anomalous
dimensions for the Wilson coefficients are given to 2-loop order, and the
renormalization group equations are solved explicitly. This will allow for
analytical resummation of dijet observables to next-to-next-to-leading
logarithmic accuracy. For each channel, there is a natural basis in which the
evolution is diagonal in color space. The same basis also diagonalizes the
color evolution for the soft function. Even though soft functions required for
SCET calculations are observable dependent, it is shown that their
renormalization group evolution is almost completely determined by a universal
structure. With these results, it will be possible to calculate hadronic event
shapes or other dijet observables to next-to-leading order with
next-to-next-to-leading log resummation.
