We present new measurements of the centers for 65 Milky Way globular
clusters. Centers were determined by fitting ellipses to the density
distribution within the inner $2\arcmin$ of the cluster center, and averaging
the centers of these ellipses. The symmetry of clusters was also analyzed by
comparing cumulative radial distributions on opposite sides of the cluster
across a grid of trial centers. All of the determinations were done with
stellar positions derived from a combination of two single-orbit ACS images of
the core of the cluster in $F606W$ and $F814W$. We find that the
ellipse-fitting method provides remarkable accuracy over a wide range of core
sizes and density distributions, while the symmetry method is difficult to use
on clusters with very large cores, or low density. The symmetry method requires
a larger field, or a very sharply peaked density distribution.
