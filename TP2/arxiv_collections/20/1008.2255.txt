We show from a simulations-based study of the TACTIC telescope that fractal
and wavelet analysis of Cerenkov images, recorded in a single imaging Cerenkov
telescope, enables almost complete segregation of isotropic gamma-ray initiated
events from the overwhelming background of cosmic-ray hadron-initiated events.
This presents a new method for measuring galactic and extragalactic gamma-ray
background above 1 TeV energy. Preliminary results based on this method are
reported here. Primary aim is to explore the possibility of using data recorded
by a single imaging atmospheric Cerenkov telescope(IACT) for making accurate
measurements of diffuse galactic and extragalactic gamma-ray flux above ~1 TeV
energy. Using simulated data of atmospheric Cerenkov images recorded in an
IACT, initiated both by cosmic ray protons and diffuse gamma-rays with energies
above 4 TeV and 2 TeV respectively, we identify the most efficient fractal
/wavelet parameters of the recorded images for primary identification. The
method is based on the pattern recognition technique and employs fractal and
wavelet analysis of the recorded Cerenkov images for gamma-hadron segregation.
We show that the value of wavelet dimension parameter B6 can segregate Cerenkov
images of hadronic origin from those of diffuse gamma-ray origin with almost
100% accuracy. We use the results to get a preliminary upper limit estimate of
the diffuse galactic gamma-ray flux within galactic range of |b|\leq -50 and
|l|\leq 2000 above 2TeV from a 36h data set recorded by the TACTIC telescope.
