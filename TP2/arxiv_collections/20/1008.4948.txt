We assess the strengths and weaknesses of several likelihood formalisms,
including the XFaster likelihood. We compare the performance of the XFaster
likelihood to that of the Offset Lognormal Bandpower likelihood on simulated
data for the Planck satellite. Parameters estimated with these two likelihoods
are in good agreement. The advantages of the XFaster likelihood can therefore
be realized without compromising performance.
