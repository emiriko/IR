To define oscillatory movements of securities market, we put in the non-local
extension of Ito- equation for wavelet-images of random processes. It is
proposed an algorithm of creation of evolutionary equation and a model of
prediction of the most probable price movement path. It is carried out
experimental validation of findings.
