A recent theory by Feigel [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 92}, 020404 (2004)] predicts
the finite transfer of momentum from the quantum vacuum to a fluid placed in
strong perpendicular electric and magnetic fields. The momentum transfer arises
because of the optically anisotropic magnetoelectric response induced in the
fluid by the fields. After summarising Feigel's original assumptions and
derivation (corrected of trivial mistakes), we rederive the same result by a
simpler route, validating Feigel's semi-classical approach. We then derive the
stress exerted by the vacuum on the fluid which, if the Feigel hypothesis is
correct, should induce a Poiseuille flow in a tube with maximum speed $\approx
100\mu$m/s (2000 times larger than Feigel's original prediction). An experiment
is suggested to test this prediction for an organometallic fluid in a tube
passing through the bore of a high strength magnet. The predicted flow can be
measured directly by tracking microscopy or indirectly by measuring the flow
rate ($\approx 1$ml/min) corresponding to the Poiseuille flow. A second
experiment is also proposed whereby a `vacuum radiometer' is used to test a
recent prediction that the net force on a magnetoelectric slab in the vacuum
should be zero.
