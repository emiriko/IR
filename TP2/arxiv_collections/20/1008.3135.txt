We single out a large class of semisimple singularities with the property
that all roots of the Poincar\'e polynomial of the Lie algebra of derivations
of the corresponding suitably (not necessarily quasihomogeneously) graded
moduli algebra lie on the unit circle; for a still larger class there might
occur exactly four roots outside the unit circle.
