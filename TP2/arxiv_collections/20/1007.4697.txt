We investigate the photon emission from the electrosphere of a quark star. It
is shown that at temperatures T\sim 0.1-1 MeV the dominating mechanism is the
bremsstrahlung due to bending of electron trajectories in the mean Coulomb
field of the electrosphere. The radiated energy for this mechanism is much
larger than that for the Bethe-Heitler bremsstrahlung. The energy flux from the
mean field bremsstrahlung exceeds the one from the tunnel e^{+}e^{-} pair
creation as well. We demonstrate that the LPM suppression of the photon
emission is negligible.
