One of the most attractive events in the pre-main sequence evolution is the
FU Orionis (FUor) outburst. Because only a small number of FUor stars have been
detected to date, photometric and spectral studies of every new object are of
great interest. Recently, a new FUor candidate was discovered by Anton Khruslov
- V582 Aur. To confirm the FUors nature of this object we started regular
photometric observations with the telescopes of the National Astronomical
Observatory Rozhen (Bulgaria). A high-resolution spectrum of V582 Aur was
obtained with the 1.93 m telescope in Haute-Provence Observatory (France).
