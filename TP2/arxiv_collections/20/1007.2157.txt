We study repeated (noncontinuous) measurements on the electron spin in a
quantum dot and find that the measurement technique may lead to a different
met$ or mechanism to realize nuclear spin polarization. While it may be used in
any case, the method is aimed at the further polarization, providing that
nuclear spins have been polarized by the existent electrical or optical
methods. The feasibility of the method is analyzed. The existing techniques in
electron spin measurements are applicable to this scheme. The repeated
measurements \emph{deform} the structures of the nuclear wave function and can
also serve as $\emph{gates}$ to manipulate nuclear spins.
