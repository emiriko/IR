We investigate the expanding and collapsing regions by taking two well-known
spherically symmetric spacetimes. For this purpose, the general formalism is
developed by using Israel junction conditions for arbitrary spacetimes. This
has been used to obtain the surface energy density and the tangential pressure.
The minimal pressure provides the gateway to explore the expanding and
collapsing regions. We take Minkowski and Kantowski-Sachs spacetimes and use
the general formulation to investigate the expanding and collapsing regions of
the shell.
