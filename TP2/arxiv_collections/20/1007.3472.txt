We study quantum phase transitions induced by the on-site spin-orbit
interaction lambda(L.S) in a toy model of vanadium chains. In the lambda->0
limit, the decoupled spin and orbital sectors are described by a Haldane and an
Ising chain, respectively. The gapped ground state is composed of a
ferro-orbital order and a spin liquid with finite correlation lengths. In the
opposite limit, strong spin-orbital entanglement results in a simultaneous spin
and orbital-moment ordering, which can be viewed as an orbital liquid. Using a
combination of analytical arguments and density-matrix renormalization group
calculation, we show that an intermediate phase, where the ferro-orbital state
is accompanied by a spin Neel order, is bounded on both sides by Ising
transition lines. Implications for vanadium compounds CaV2O4 and ZnV2O4 are
also discussed.
