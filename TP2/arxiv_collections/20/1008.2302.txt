Using the algorithm of constructing the IR finite observables suggested and
discussed in details in our previous publications, we consider construction of
such observables in N=8 SUGRA in NLO of PT. In general, contrary to the
amplitudes defined in the presence of some IR regulator, such observables do
not reveal any simple structure.
