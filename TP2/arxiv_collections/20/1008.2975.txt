We derive the spectra of D=2, SU(3) supersymmetric Yang-Mills quantum
mechanics in all fermionic sectors. Moreover, we provide exact expressions for
the corresponding eigenvectors in the sectors with none and one fermionic
quantum. We also generalize our results obtained in a cut Fock space to the
infinite cut-off limit.
