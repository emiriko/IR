Temperature- and bias voltage-dependent transport measurements of magnetic
tunnel junctions (MTJs) with perpendicularly magnetized Co/Pd electrodes are
presented. Magnetization measurements of the Co/Pd multilayers are performed to
characterize the electrodes. The effects of the Co layer thickness in the Co/Pd
bilayers, the annealing temperature, the Co thickness at the MgO barrier
interface, and the number of bilayers on the tunneling magneto resistance (TMR)
effect are investigated. TMR-ratios of about 11 % at room temperature and 18.5
% at 13 K are measured and two well-defined switching fields are observed. The
results are compared to measurements of MTJs with Co-Fe-B electrodes and
in-plane anisotropy.
