A covariant spectator constituent quark model is applied to study the gamma N
-> Delta(1600) transition. Two processes are important in the transition: a
photon couples to the individual quarks of the Delta(1600) core (quark core),
and a photon couples to the intermediate pion-baryon states (pion cloud). While
the quark core contributions are estimated assuming Delta(1600) as the first
radial excitation of Delta(1232), the pion cloud contributions are estimated
based on an analogy with the gamma N -> Delta(1232) transition. To estimate the
pion cloud contributions in the gamma N -> Delta(1600) transition, we include
the relevant intermediate states, pi-N, pi-Delta, pi-N(1440) and
pi-Delta(1600). Dependence on the four-momentum transfer squared, Q2, is
predicted for the magnetic dipole transition form factor, GM*(Q2), as well as
the helicity amplitudes, A_1/2(Q2) and A_3/2(Q2). The results at Q2=0 are
compared with the existing data.
