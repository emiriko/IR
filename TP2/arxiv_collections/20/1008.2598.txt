If entanglement is available, the error-correcting ability of quantum codes
can be increased. We show how to optimize the minimum distance of an
entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting (EAQEC) code, obtained by adding
ebits to a standard quantum error-correcting code, over different encoding
operators. By this encoding optimization procedure, we found several new EAQEC
codes, including a family of [[n, 1, n; n-1]] EAQEC codes for n odd and code
parameters [[7, 1, 5; 2]], [[7, 1, 5; 3]], [[9, 1, 7; 4]], [[9, 1, 7; 5]],
which saturate the quantum singleton bound for EAQEC codes. A random search
algorithm for the encoding optimization procedure is also proposed.
