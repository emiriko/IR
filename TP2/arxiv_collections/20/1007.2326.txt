We prove that if T is a tree on n vertices wih maximum degree D and the edge
probability p(n) satisfies: np>c*max{D*logn,n^{\epsilon}} for some constant
\epsilon>0, then with high probability the random graph G(n,p) contains a copy
of T. The obtained bound on the edge probability is shown to be essentially
tight for D=n^{\Theta(1)}.
