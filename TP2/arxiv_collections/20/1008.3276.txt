Motivated by applications to bond markets, we propose a multivariate
framework for discrete time financial markets with proportional transaction
costs and a countable infinite number of tradable assets. We show that the
no-arbitrage of second kind property (NA2 in short), recently introduced by
Rasonyi for finite-dimensional markets, allows us to provide a closure property
for the set of attainable claims in a very natural way, under a suitable
efficient friction condition. We also extend to this context the equivalence
between NA2 and the existence of many (strictly) consistent price systems.
