A scheme for stabilizing stochastic approximation iterates by adaptively
scaling the step sizes is proposed and analyzed. This scheme leads to the same
limiting differential equation as the original scheme and therefore has the
same limiting behavior, while avoiding the difficulties associated with
projection schemes. The proof technique requires only that the limiting o.d.e.
descend a certain Lyapunov function outside an arbitrarily large bounded set.
