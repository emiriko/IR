We demonstrate the epitaxial growth of EuO on GaAs by reactive molecular beam
epitaxy. Thin films are grown in an adsorption-controlled regime with the aid
of an MgO diffusion barrier. Despite the large lattice mismatch, it is shown
that EuO grows well on MgO(001) with excellent magnetic properties. Epitaxy on
GaAs is cube-on-cube and longitudinal magneto-optic Kerr effect measurements
demonstrate a large Kerr rotation of 0.57{\deg}, a significant remanent
magnetization, and a Curie temperature of 69 K.
