We present a methodology for modelling population dynamics with formal means
of computer science. This allows unambiguous description of systems and
application of analysis tools such as simulators and model checkers. In
particular, the dynamics of a population of Aedes albopictus (a species of
mosquito) and its modelling with the Stochastic Calculus of Looping Sequences
(Stochastic CLS) are considered. The use of Stochastic CLS to model population
dynamics requires an extension which allows environmental events (such as
changes in the temperature and rainfalls) to be taken into account. A simulator
for the constructed model is developed via translation into the specification
language Maude, and used to compare the dynamics obtained from the model with
real data.
