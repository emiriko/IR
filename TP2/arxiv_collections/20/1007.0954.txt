The origins of the hot solar corona and the supersonically expanding solar
wind are still the subject of much debate. This paper summarizes some of the
essential ingredients of realistic and self-consistent models of solar wind
acceleration. It also outlines the major issues in the recent debate over what
physical processes dominate the mass, momentum, and energy balance in the
accelerating wind. A key obstacle in the way of producing realistic simulations
of the Sun-heliosphere system is the lack of a physically motivated way of
specifying the coronal heating rate. Recent models that assume the energy comes
from Alfven waves that are partially reflected, and then dissipated by
magnetohydrodynamic turbulence, have been found to reproduce many of the
observed features of the solar wind. This paper discusses results from these
models, including detailed comparisons with measured plasma properties as a
function of solar wind speed. Some suggestions are also given for future work
that could answer the many remaining questions about coronal heating and solar
wind acceleration.
