To extract information on hadron production dynamics in the ultrarelativistic
heavy ion collision, the space-time structure of the hadron source has been
measured using Hanbury Brown and Twiss interferometry. We study the distortion
of the source images due to the effect of a final state interaction. We
describe the interaction, taking place during penetrating through a cloud
formed by evaporating particles, in terms of a one-body mean field potential
localized in the vicinity of the source region. By adopting the semiclassical
method, the modification of the propagation of an emitted particle is examined.
In analogy to the optical model applied to nuclear reactions, our
phenomenological model has an imaginary part of the potential, which describes
the absorption in the cloud. In this work, we focus on the pion interferometry
and mean field interaction obtained using a phenomenological $\pi\pi$ forward
scattering amplitude in the elastic channels. The p-wave scattering with $\rho$
meson resonance leads to an attractive mean field interaction, and the presence
of the absorptive part is mainly attributed to the formation of this resonance.
We also incorporate a simple time dependence of the potential reflecting the
dynamics of the evaporating source. Using the obtained potential, we examine
how and to what extent the so-called HBT Gaussian radius is varied by the
modification of the propagation.
