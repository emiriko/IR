Entangled photons are a crucial resource for quantum communication and linear
optical quantum computation. Unfortunately, the applicability of many
photon-based schemes is limited due to the stochastic character of the photon
sources. Therefore, a worldwide effort has focused in overcoming the limitation
of probabilistic emission by generating two-photon entangled states conditioned
on the detection of auxiliary photons. Here we present the first heralded
generation of photon states that are maximally entangled in polarization with
linear optics and standard photon detection from spontaneous parametric
down-conversion. We utilize the down-conversion state corresponding to the
generation of three photon pairs, where the coincident detection of four
auxiliary photons unambiguously heralds the successful preparation of the
entangled state. This controlled generation of entangled photon states is a
significant step towards the applicability of a linear optics quantum network,
in particular for entanglement swapping, quantum teleportation, quantum
cryptography and scalable approaches towards photonics-based quantum computing.
