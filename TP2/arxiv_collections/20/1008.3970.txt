The Large Area Telescope on the Fermi gamma-ray Space Telescope (FGST,
ex-GLAST) provides unprecedented sensitivity for all-sky monitoring of
gamma-ray activity. It is an adequate telescope to detect transient sources,
since the observatory scans the entire sky every three hours and allows a
general search for flaring activity on daily timescale. This search is
conducted automatically as part of the ground processing of the data and allows
a fast response -less than a day- to transient events. Follow-up observations
in X-rays, optical, and radio are then performed to attempt to identify the
origin of the emission and probe the possible existence of new transient
gamma-ray sources in the Galaxy. Since its launch on 11th June 2008, Fermi-LAT
has detected nearly 1500 gamma-ray sources, nearly half of them being
extragalactic. After a brief census of detected celestial objects, we report
here on the LAT results focusing on Galactic transient binary systems. The
Fermi-LAT has detected 2 gamma-ray binaries, a microquasar and an unexpected
new type of gamma-ray source: a symbiotic nova.
