We have extended the mean field calculation of Zandi et al [1] and have
obtained an approximate mathematical expression for the Casimir scaling
function, which if extrapolated to the domain $\pi^2\ge-y\ge 0$, becomes
surprisingly similar to that obtained experimentally by Ganshin et al [2]. The
extrapolated scaling function can be regarded as a proposed fitting function,
that appears to agree better with the experiments [2] in D=3, than the exact
mean field result of Zandi et al [1].
