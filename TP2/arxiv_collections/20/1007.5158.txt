In this paper, we introduce a tilting interface that controls direction based
applications in ubiquitous environments. A tilt interface is useful for
situations that require remote and quick interactions or that are executed in
public spaces. We explored the proposed tilting interface with different
application types and classified the tilting interaction techniques. Augmenting
objects with sensors can potentially address the problem of the lack of
intuitive and natural input devices in ubiquitous environments. We have
conducted an experiment to test the usability of the proposed tilting interface
to compare it with conventional input devices and hand gestures. The experiment
results showed greater improvement of the tilt gestures in comparison with hand
gestures in terms of speed, accuracy, and user satisfaction.
