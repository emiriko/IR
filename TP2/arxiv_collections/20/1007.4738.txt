Isotope yields have been analyzed within the framework of a Modified Fisher
Model to study the power law yield distribution of isotopes in the
multifragmentation regime. Using the ratio of the mass dependent symmetry
energy coefficient relative to the temperature, $a_{sym}/T$, extracted in
previous work and that of the pairing term, $a_{p}/T$, extracted from this
work, and assuming that both reflect secondary decay processes, the
experimentally observed isotope yields have been corrected for these effects.
For a given I = N - Z value, the corrected yields of isotopes relative to the
yield of $^{12}C$ show a power law distribution, $Y(N,Z)/Y(^{12}C) \sim
A^{-\tau}$, in the mass range of $1 \le A \le 30$ and the distributions are
almost identical for the different reactions studied. The observed power law
distributions change systematically when I of the isotopes changes and the
extracted $\tau$ value decreases from 3.9 to 1.0 as I increases from -1 to 3.
These observations are well reproduced by a simple de-excitation model, which
the power law distribution of the primary isotopes is determined to
$\tau^{prim} = 2.4 \pm 0.2$, suggesting that the disassembling system at the
time of the fragment formation is indeed at or very near the critical point.
