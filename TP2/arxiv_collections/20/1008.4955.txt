We explore the conditions prevailing in primordial planets in the framework
of the HGD cosmologies as discussed by Gibson and Schild. The initial stages of
condensation of planet-mass H-4He gas clouds in trillion-planet clumps is set
at 300,000 yr (0.3My) following the onset of plasma instabilities when ambient
temperatures were >1000K. Eventual collapse of the planet-cloud into a solid
structure takes place against the background of an expanding universe with
declining ambient temperatures. Stars form from planet mergers within the
clumps and die by supernovae on overeating of planets. For planets produced by
stars, isothermal free fall collapse occurs initially via quasi equilibrium
polytropes until opacity sets in due to molecule and dust formation. The
contracting cooling cloud is a venue for molecule formation and the sequential
condensation of solid particles, starting from mineral grains at high
temperatures to ice particles at lower temperatures, water-ice becomes
thermodynamically stable between 7 and 15 My after the initial onset of
collapse, and contraction to form a solid icy core begins shortly thereafter.
Primordial-clump-planets are separated by ~ 1000 AU, reflecting the high
density of the universe at 30,000 yr. Exchanges of materials, organic molecules
and evolving templates readily occur, providing optimal conditions for an
initial origin of life in hot primordial gas planet water cores when adequately
fertilized by stardust. The condensation of solid molecular hydrogen as an
extended outer crust takes place much later in the collapse history of the
protoplanet. When the object has shrunk to several times the radius of Jupiter,
the hydrogen partial pressure exceeds the saturation vapour pressure of solid
hydrogen at the ambient temperature and condensation occurs.
