We find a lower bound for the essential norm of the difference of two
composition operators acting on $H^2(B_N)$ or $A^2_s(B_N)$ ($s>-1$). This
result plays an important role in proving a necessary and sufficient condition
for the difference of linear fractional composition operators to be compact,
which answers a question posed by MacCluer and Weir in 2005.
