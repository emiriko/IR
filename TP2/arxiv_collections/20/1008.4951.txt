We study the Lagrangian mechanism of the fluctuation dynamo at zero Prandtl
number and infinite magnetic Reynolds number, in the Kazantsev-Kraichnan model
of white-noise advection. With a rough velocity field corresponding to a
turbulent inertial-range, flux-freezing holds only in a stochastic sense. We
show that field-lines arriving to the same point which were initially separated
by many resistive lengths are important to the dynamo. Magnetic vectors of the
seed field that point parallel to the initial separation vector arrive
anti-correlated and produce an "anti-dynamo" effect. We also study the problem
of "magnetic induction" of a spatially uniform seed field. We find no essential
distinction between this process and fluctuation dynamo, both producing the
same growth-rates and small-scale magnetic correlations. In the regime of very
rough velocity fields where fluctuation dynamo fails, we obtain the induced
magnetic energy spectra. We use these results to evaluate theories proposed for
magnetic spectra in laboratory experiments of turbulent induction
