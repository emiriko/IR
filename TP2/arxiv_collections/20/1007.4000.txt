Statistical behavior and scaling properties of iso-height lines in three
different saturated two-dimensional grown surfaces with controversial
universality classes are investigated using ideas from Schramm-Loewner
evolution (SLE$_\kappa$). We present some evidence that the iso-height lines in
the ballistic deposition (BD), Eden and restricted solid-on-solid (RSOS) models
have conformally invariant properties all in the same universality class as the
self-avoiding random walk (SAW), equivalently SLE$_{8/3}$. This leads to the
conclusion that all these discrete growth models fall into the same
universality class as the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation in two dimensions.
