It is well known that the surface of nonmagnetic $\alpha$-Ce is magnetically
ordered, i.e., $\gamma$-like. One then might conjecture, in agreement with
previous theoretical predictions, that the $\gamma$-Ce may also exhibit at its
surfaces even more strongly enhanced $\gamma$-like magnetic ordering.
Nonetheless, our result shows that the (111)-surfaces of magnetic $\gamma$-Ce
are neither spin nor orbitally polarized, i.e., $\alpha$-like. Therefore, we
predict, in contrast to the nonmagnetic $\alpha$-phase which tends to produce
magnetically ordered $\gamma$-like thin layers at its free surfaces, the
magnetic $\gamma$-phase has a tendency to form $\alpha$-like dead layers. This
study, which explains the suppressed (promoted) surface magnetic moments of
$\gamma$-Ce ($\alpha$-Ce), shows that how nanoscale can reverse physical
properties by going from bulk to the surface in isostructural $\alpha$- and
$\gamma$-phases of cerium. We predict using our freestanding surface results
that a typical unreactive and non-diffusive substrate can dramatically
influence the magnetic surface of cerium thin films in contrast to most of the
uncorrelated thin films and strongly correlated transition metals. Our result
implies that magnetic surface moments of $\alpha$-Ce(111) can be suddenly
disappeared by increasing lattice mismatch at the interface of a typical
unreactive and non-diffusive substrate with cerium overlayers.
