In this contribution, an algorithm for evaluating the capacity-achieving
input covariance matrices for frequency selective Rayleigh MIMO channels is
proposed. In contrast with the flat fading Rayleigh case, no closed-form
expressions for the eigenvectors of the optimum input covariance matrix are
available. Classically, both the eigenvectors and eigenvalues are computed
numerically and the corresponding optimization algorithms remain
computationally very demanding. In this paper, it is proposed to optimize
(w.r.t. the input covariance matrix) a large system approximation of the
average mutual information derived by Moustakas and Simon. The validity of this
asymptotic approximation is clarified thanks to Gaussian large random matrices
methods. It is shown that the approximation is a strictly concave function of
the input covariance matrix and that the average mutual information evaluated
at the argmax of the approximation is equal to the capacity of the channel up
to a O(1/t) term, where t is the number of transmit antennas. An algorithm
based on an iterative waterfilling scheme is proposed to maximize the average
mutual information approximation, and its convergence studied. Numerical
simulation results show that, even for a moderate number of transmit and
receive antennas, the new approach provides the same results as direct
maximization approaches of the average mutual information.
