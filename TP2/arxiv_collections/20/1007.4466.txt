The rheology near jamming of a suspension of soft colloidal spheres is
studied using a custom microfluidic rheometer that provides stress versus
strain rate over many decades. We find non-Newtonian behavior below the jamming
concentration and yield stress behavior above it. The data may be collapsed
onto two branches with critical scaling exponents that agree with expectations
based on Hertzian contacts and viscous drag. These results support the
conclusion that jamming is similar to a critical phase transition, but with
interaction-dependent exponents.
