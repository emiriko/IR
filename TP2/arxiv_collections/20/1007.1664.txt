Quantum networks are composed of quantum nodes that interact coherently by
way of quantum channels and open a broad frontier of scientific opportunities.
For example, a quantum network can serve as a `web' for connecting quantum
processors for computation and communication, as well as a `simulator' for
enabling investigations of quantum critical phenomena arising from interactions
among the nodes mediated by the channels. The physical realization of quantum
networks generically requires dynamical systems capable of generating and
storing entangled states among multiple quantum memories, and of efficiently
transferring stored entanglement into quantum channels for distribution across
the network. While such capabilities have been demonstrated for diverse
bipartite systems (i.e., N=2 quantum systems), entangled states with N > 2 have
heretofore not been achieved for quantum interconnects that coherently `clock'
multipartite entanglement stored in quantum memories to quantum channels. Here,
we demonstrate high-fidelity measurement-induced entanglement stored in four
atomic memories; user-controlled, coherent transfer of atomic entanglement to
four photonic quantum channels; and the characterization of the full
quadripartite entanglement by way of quantum uncertainty relations. Our work
thereby provides an important tool for the distribution of multipartite
entanglement across quantum networks.
