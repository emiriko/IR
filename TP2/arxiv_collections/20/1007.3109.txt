Pattern formation in reaction-diffusion systems is of great importance in
surface micro-patterning [Grzybowski et al. Soft Matter. 1, 114 (2005)],
self-organization of cellular micro-organisms [Schulz et al. Annu. Rev.
Microbiol. 55, 105 (2001)] and in developmental biology [Barkai et al. FEBS
Journal 276, 1196 (2009)]. In this work, we apply the Lattice Boltzmann method
(LBM) to study pattern formation in reaction-diffusion systems. As a first
methodological step, we consider the case of a single species undergoing
transformation reaction and diffusion. In this case, we perform a third-order
Chapman-Enskog multiscale expansion and study the dependence of the Lattice
Boltzmann truncation error on the diffusion coefficient and the reaction rate.
These findings are in good agreement with numerical simulations. Furthermore,
taking the Gray-Scott model as a prominent example, we provide evidence for the
maturity of the LBM in studying pattern formation in non-linear
reaction-diffusion systems. For this purpose, we perform linear stability
analysis of the Gray-Scott model and determine the relevant parameter range for
pattern formation. Lattice Boltzmann simulations allow not only to test the
validity of the linear stability phase diagram including Turing and Hopf
instabilities, but also permit going beyond the linear stability regime, where
large perturbations give rise to interesting dynamical behavior such as the so
called self replicating spots. We also show that the length scale of the
patterns may be tuned by rescaling all relevant diffusion coefficients in the
system with the same factor while letting all the reaction constants unchanged.
