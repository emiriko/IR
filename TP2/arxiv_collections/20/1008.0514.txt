We study the superfluid pairing in a two-species gas of heteronuclear
fermionic molecules with equal density. The interplay of the isotropic s-wave
interaction and anisotropic long-range dipolar interaction reveals rich
physics. We find that the single-particle momentum distribution has a
characteristic ellipsoidal shape that can be reasonably represented by a
deformation parameter $\alpha$ defined similarly to the normal phase.
Interesting momentum-dependent features of the order parameter are identified.
We calculate the critical temperatures of both the singlet and triplet
superfluid, suggesting a possible pairing symmetry transition by tuning the
s-wave or dipolar interaction strength.
