Mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) are considered within the framework of a
generic star-product scheme. We rederive that a full set of MUBs is adequate
for a spin tomography, i.e. knowledge of all probabilities to find a system in
each MUB-state is enough for a state reconstruction. Extending the ideas of the
tomographic-probability representation and the star-product scheme to
MUB-tomography, dequantizer and quantizer operators for MUB-symbols of spin
states and operators are introduced, ordinary and dual star-product kernels are
found. Since MUB-projectors are to obey specific rules of the star-product
scheme, we reveal the Lie algebraic structure of MUB-projectors and derive new
relations on triple- and four-products of MUB-projectors. Example of qubits is
considered in detail. MUB-tomography by means of Stern-Gerlach apparatus is
discussed.
