Let V be a finite set of points in the plane, not contained in a line. Assume
|V| = n is an odd number, and |L \cap V| \leq 3 for every line L which is
spanned by V. We prove that every simple line L_{a,b} in V creates a simple
wedge (i.e., a triple {a, b, c} \subseteq V such that L_{a,b} and L_{a,c} are
simple lines). We also show that both restrictions on V (namely |V| is odd and
|L \cap V| \leq 3) are needed. We conjecture, further, that if |V | = n is an
odd number then V contains a simple wedge, even if V is not 3-bounded. We
introduce a method for proving this, which gives (in this paper) partial
results.
