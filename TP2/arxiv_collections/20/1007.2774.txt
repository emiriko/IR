The Fermi Paradox is the apparent contradiction between the high probability
extraterrestrial civilizations' existence and the lack of contact with such
civilizations. In general, solutions to Fermi's paradox come down to either
estimation of Drake equation parameters i.e. our guesses about the potential
number of extraterrestrial civilizations or simulation of civilizations
development in the universe. We consider a new type of cellular automata, that
allows to analyze Fermi paradox. We introduce bonus stimulation model
(BS-model) of development in cellular space (Universe) of objects
(Civilizations). When civilizations get in touch they stimulate development
each other, increasing their life time. We discovered nonlinear threshold
behaviour of total volume of civilizations in universe and on the basis of our
model we built analogue of Drake equation.
