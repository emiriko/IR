The shadowing of cosmic ray primaries by the the moon and sun was observed by
the MINOS far detector at a depth of \unit[2070]{mwe} using 83.54 million
cosmic ray muons accumulated over 1857.91 live-days. The shadow of the moon was
detected at the \unit[5.6]{$\sigma$} level and the shadow of the sun at the
\unit[3.8]{$\sigma$} level using a log-likelihood search in celestial
coordinates. The moon shadow was used to quantify the absolute astrophysical
pointing of the detector to be 0.17\pm 0.12^\circ. Hints of Interplanetary
Magnetic Field effects were observed in both the sun and moon shadow.
