The distribution of the first hitting time of a disc for the standard two
dimensional Brownian motion is computed. By investigating the inversion
integral of its Laplace transform we give fairy detailed asymptotic estimates
of its density valid uniformly with respect to the point where the Brownian
motion starts from.
