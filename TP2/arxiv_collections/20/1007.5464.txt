We study a curve of Gibbsian families of complex 3x3-matrices and point out
new features, absent in commutative finite-dimensional algebras: a
discontinuous maximum-entropy inference, a discontinuous entropy distance and
non-exposed faces of the mean value set. We analyze these problems from various
aspects including convex geometry, topology and information geometry. This
research is motivated by a theory of info-max principles, where we contribute
by computing first order optimality conditions of the entropy distance.
