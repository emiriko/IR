We study the $W/Z$ pair production via two-photon exchange at the LHC and
give the sensitivities on trilinear and quartic gauge anomalous couplings
between photons and $W/Z$ bosons for an integrated luminosity of 30 and 200
fb$^{-1}$. For simplicity and to obtain lower backgrounds, only the leptonic
decays of the electroweak bosons are considered. The intact protons in the
final states are detected in the ATLAS Forward Proton detectors. The high
energy and luminosity of the LHC and the forward detectors allow to probe
beyond standard model physics and to test the higgsless and extra dimension
models in an unprecedent way.
