We present a new theoretical scheme for laser cooling of rare earth doped
solids with optical super-radiance (SR), which is the coherent, sharply
directed spontaneous emission of photons by a system of laser excited rare
earth ions in the solid state host (glass or crystal). We consider an Yb3+
doped ZBLAN sample pumped at the wavelength 1015 nm with a rectangular pulsed
source with a power of ~433W and duration of 10ns. The intensity of the SR is
proportional to the square of the number of excited ions. This unique feature
of SR permits a dramatic increase in the rate of the cooling process in
comparison with the traditional laser cooling of the rare earth doped solids
with anti-Stokes spontaneous incoherent radiation (fluorescence). This scheme
overcomes the limitation of using only low phonon energy hosts for laser
cooling.
