We determine how the elementary excitations of iridium-oxide materials, which
are dominated by a strong relativistic spin-orbit coupling, appear in Resonant
Inelastic X-ray Scattering (RIXS). Whereas the RIXS spectral weight at the L2
x-ray edge vanishes, we find it to be strong at the L3-edge. Applying this to
Sr2IrO4, we observe that RIXS, besides being sensitive to local doublet to
quartet transitions, meticulously maps out the strongly dispersive delocalized
excitations of the low-lying spin-orbit doublets.
