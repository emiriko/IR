Recent results are reviewed on galaxy dynamics, bar evolution, destruction
and re-formation, cold gas accretion, gas radial flows and AGN fueling, minor
mergers. Some problems of galaxy evolution are discussed in particular,
exchange of angular momentum, radial migration through resonant scattering, and
consequences on abundance gradients, the frequency of bulgeless galaxies, and
the relative role of secular evolution and hierarchical formation.
