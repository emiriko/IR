The model of the Abrikosov vortex pinning on a cylindrical defect is
proposed. It is shown that in the limit $\varkappa \gg 1$ the potential for the
vortex core excitations can be treated in terms of the zero-range potentials
method. Using the variational method the estimates for the energy of pinning,
the pinning force and the density of critical current defect are obtained.
