Reversible logic has become one of the promising research directions in low
power dissipating circuit design in the past few years and has found its
applications in low power CMOS design, cryptography, optical information
processing and nanotechnology. This paper presents a novel and quantum cost
efficient reversible full adder gate in nanotechnology. This gate can work
singly as a reversible full adder unit and requires only one clock cycle. The
proposed gate is a universal gate in the sense that it can be used to
synthesize any arbitrary Boolean functions. It has been demonstrated that the
hardware complexity offered by the proposed gate is less than the existing
counterparts. The proposed reversible full adder gate also adheres to the
theoretical minimum established by the researchers.
