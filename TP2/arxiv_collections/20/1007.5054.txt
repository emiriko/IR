We refine a previous zeroth order analysis of the nuclear properties of a
supersymmetric (susy) universe with standard model particle content plus
degenerate susy partners. No assumptions are made concerning the Higgs
structure except we assume that the degenerate fermion/sfermion masses are
non-zero. This alternate universe has been dubbed Susyria and it has been
proposed that such a world may exist with zero vacuum energy in the string
landscape.
