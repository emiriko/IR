We determine the zero temperature quantum phase diagram of a p_x+ip_y pairing
model based on the exactly solvable hyperbolic Richardson-Gaudin model. We
present analytical and large-scale numerical results for this model. In the
continuum limit, the exact solution exhibits a third-order quantum phase
transition, separating a strong-pairing from a weak-pairing phase. The mean
field solution allows to connect these results to other models with p_x+ip_y
pairing order. We define an experimentally accessible characteristic length
scale, associated with the size of the Cooper pairs, that diverges at the
transition point, indicating that the phase transition is of a
confinement-deconfinement type without local order parameter. We show that this
phase transition is not limited to the p_x+ip_y pairing model, but can be found
in any representation of the hyperbolic Richardson-Gaudin model and is related
to a symmetry that is absent in the rational Richardson-Gaudin model.
