During the last decade, it has been well understood that communication over
multiple antennas can increase linearly the multiplexing capacity gain and
provide large spectral efficiency improvements. However, the majority of
studies in this area were carried out ignoring cochannel interference. Only a
small number of investigations have considered cochannel interference, but even
therein simple channel models were employed, assuming identically distributed
fading coefficients. In this paper, a generic model for a multi-antenna channel
is presented incorporating four impairments, namely additive white Gaussian
noise, flat fading, path loss and cochannel interference. Both point-to-point
and multiple-access MIMO channels are considered, including the case of
cooperating Base Station clusters. The asymptotic capacity limit of this
channel is calculated based on an asymptotic free probability approach which
exploits the additive and multiplicative free convolution in the R- and
S-transform domain respectively, as well as properties of the eta and Stieltjes
transform. Numerical results are utilized to verify the accuracy of the derived
closed-form expressions and evaluate the effect of the cochannel interference.
