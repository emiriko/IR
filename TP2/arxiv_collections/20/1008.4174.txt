Many large financial planning models are written in a spreadsheet programming
language (usually Microsoft Excel) and deployed as a spreadsheet application.
Three groups, FAST Alliance, Operis Group, and BPM Analytics (under the name
"Spreadsheet Standards Review Board") have independently promulgated
standardized processes for efficiently building such models. These spreadsheet
engineering methodologies provide detailed guidance on design, construction
process, and quality control. We summarize and compare these methodologies.
They share many design practices, and standardized, mechanistic procedures to
construct spreadsheets. We learned that a written book or standards document is
by itself insufficient to understand a methodology. These methodologies
represent a professionalization of spreadsheet programming, and can provide a
means to debug a spreadsheet that contains errors. We find credible the
assertion that these spreadsheet engineering methodologies provide enhanced
productivity, accuracy and maintainability for large financial planning models
