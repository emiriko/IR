Measurements of cross sections for events with charm and beauty jets in deep
inelastic scattering at HERA are presented. Events with jets of transverse
energy E_T^jet > 6 GeV and pseudorapidity -1.0 < eta^jet < 1.5 in the
laboratory frame are selected in the kinematic region of photon virtuality Q^2
> 6 GeV^2 and inelasticity variable 0.07 < y < 0.625. Measurements are also
made requiring a jet in the Breit frame with E_T^*jet > 6 GeV. The data were
collected with the H1 detector in the years 2006 and 2007 corresponding to an
integrated luminosity of 189 pb^-1. The numbers of charm and beauty jets are
determined using variables reconstructed using the H1 vertex detector with
which the impact parameters of the tracks to the primary vertex and the
position of secondary vertices are measured. The measurements are compared with
QCD predictions and with previous measurements where heavy flavours are
identified using muons.
