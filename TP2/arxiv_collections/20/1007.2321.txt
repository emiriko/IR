The luminescence caused by the interband transitions of hot carriers in
graphene is considered theoretically. The dependencies of emission in mid- and
near-IR spectral regions versus energy and concentration of hot carriers are
analyzed; they are determined both by an applied electric field and a gate
voltage. The polarization dependency is determined by the angle between the
propagation direction and the normal to the graphene sheet. The characteristics
of radiation from large-scale-area samples of epitaxial graphene and from
microstructures of exfoliated graphene are considered. The averaged over angles
efficiency of emission is also presented.
