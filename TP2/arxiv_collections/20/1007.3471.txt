We analyze the Coulomb interacting problem in undoped graphene layers by
using an excitonic variational ansatz. By minimizing the energy, we derive a
gap equation which reproduces and extends known results. We show that a full
treatment of the exchange term, which includes the renormalization of the Fermi
velocity, tends to suppress the phase transition by increasing the critical
coupling at which the excitonic instability takes place.
