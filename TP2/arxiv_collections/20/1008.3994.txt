Maxwell-Lorenz theory describes only vortex electromagnetic processes.
Potential component of the magnetic field is usually excluded by the
introduction of mathematical terms: Coulomb and Lorenz gauges. Proposed
approach to the construction of the four-dimensional electrodynamics based on
the total (four-dimensional) field theory takes into account both vortex and
potential components of its characteristics. It is shown that potential
components of the electromagnetic field have physical content. System of
modified (generalized) Maxwell equations is written. With their help
contradictions usually appearing while describing the distribution of
electromagnetic waves, are eliminated. Works of other authors obtained similar
results are presented and analyzed.
