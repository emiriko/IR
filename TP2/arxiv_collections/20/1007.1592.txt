In many applications of the simple three-element einzel lens, such as
injecting a low energy ion beam into a high-field Penning trap, there is a need
for small-angle steering as well as focusing of the beam. We have analyzed a
diagonalslit cylinder serving as the middle electrode of such a lens and have
shown that such an electrode configuration significantly diminishes the
aberration associated with such a deflection.
