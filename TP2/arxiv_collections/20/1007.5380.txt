An exhaustive kinetic model for the atoms in a 1D Magneto-Optical Trap is
derived, without any approximations. It is shown that the atomic density is
described by a Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation, coupled with two simple
differential equations describing the trap beam propagation. The analogy of
such a system with plasmas is discussed. This set of equations is then
simplified through some approximations, and it is shown that corrective terms
have to be added to the models usually used in this context.
