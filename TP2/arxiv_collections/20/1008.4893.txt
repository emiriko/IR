A review is presented of the scientific benefits of rapid (v >= 0.1c)
interstellar spaceflight. Significant benefits are identified in the fields of
interstellar medium studies, stellar astrophysics, planetary science and
astrobiology. In the latter three areas the benefits would be considerably
enhanced if the interstellar vehicle is able to decelerate from its
interstellar cruise velocity to rest relative to the target system. Although
this will greatly complicate the mission architecture, and extend the overall
travel time, the scientific benefits are such that this option should be
considered seriously in future studies.
