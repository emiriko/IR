Top interactions beyond the Standard Model can be conveniently described in
the framework of gauge-invariant effective operators. We briefly review the
general form of the fermion-fermion-gauge boson and fermion-fermion-Higgs
interactions arising from dimension-6 operators, focusing on the top quark. We
discuss in detail an expansion in powers of 1/Lambda^2, where Lambda is the new
physics scale, to consistently calculate observables in terms of top anomalous
couplings.
