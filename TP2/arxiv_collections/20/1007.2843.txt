Recently, a new class of semi-Lagrangian methods for the BGK model of the
Boltzmann equation has been introduced [8, 17, 18]. These methods work in a
satisfactory way either in rarefied or fluid regime. Moreover, because of the
semi-Lagrangian feature, the stability property is not restricted by the CFL
condition. These aspects make them very attractive for practical applications.
In this paper, we investigate the convergence properties of the method and
prove that the discrete solution of the scheme converges in a weighted L1 norm
to the unique smooth solution by deriving an explicit error estimate.
