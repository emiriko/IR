The real-space localized hole pair is constructed in the Cu-O plane of the
hole-doped cuprate superconductors. We prove analytically and numerically that
two electrons, due to the nearest-neighbor Coulomb repulsive confinement
effect, can be in pairing inside a single plaquette with the d-wave symmetry.
The scenario supports the `no glue' pairing picture for the cuprates. Based on
the scenarios, the physical origin of the Fermi pocket (or Fermi arc) and the
two pseudogap behavior are provided. Our framework leads directly to a unified
linear relationship between the pseudogap temperature T* and the hole doping
level x in these compounds.
