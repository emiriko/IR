We report a detailed simulation study of the phase behavior of core softened
system with attractive well. Different repulsive shoulder widthes and
attractive well depthes are considered which allows to monitor the influence of
repulsive and attractive forces on the phase diagram of the system.
Thermodynamic anomalies in the systems are also studied. It is shown that the
diffusion anomaly is stabilized by small attraction.
