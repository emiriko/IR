We present the result of a full direct component calculation for the first
three even moments of the non-planar contribution into the four-loop anomalous
dimension of twist-2 operators in maximally extended N=4 supersymmetric
Yang-Mills theory. Obtained result complete our previous calculations in
arXiv:0902.4646 and gives the usual result for the higher moments on the
contrary to degenerate one in the case of Konishi. We have proposed a general
form of zeta(5) and zeta(3) parts of the full non-planar anomalous dimension of
twist-2 operators. As by product, we have obtained the first moment of the
non-planar contribution to the non-singlet four-loop anomalous dimension of
Wilson twist-2 operators in QCD.
