The universe, with large-scale homogeneity, is locally inhomogeneous,
clustering into stars, galaxies and larger structures. Such property is
described by the smoothness parameter $\alpha$ which is defined as the
proportion of matter in the form of intergalactic medium. If we take
consideration of the inhomogeneities in small scale, there should be
modifications of the cosmological distances compared to a homogenous model.
Dyer and Roeder developed a second-order ordinary differential equation (D-R
equation) that describes the angular diameter distance-redshift relation for
inhomogeneous cosmological models. Furthermore, we may obtain the D-R equation
for observational $H(z)$ data (OHD). The density-parameter $\Omega_{\rm M}$,
the state of dark energy $\omega$, and the smoothness-parameter $\alpha$ are
constrained by a set of OHD in a spatially flat $\Lambda$CDM universe as well
as a spatially flat XCDM universe. By using of $\chi^2$ minimization method we
get $\alpha=0.81^{+0.19}_{-0.20}$ and $\Omega_{\rm M}=0.32^{+0.12}_{-0.06}$ at
$1\sigma$ confidence level. If we assume a Gaussian prior of $\Omega_{\rm
M}=0.26\pm0.1$, we get $\alpha=0.93^{+0.07}_{-0.19}$ and $\Omega_{\rm
M}=0.31^{+0.06}_{-0.05}$. For XCDM model, $\alpha$ is constrained to
$\alpha\geq0.80$ but $\omega$ is weakly constrained around -1, where $\omega$
describes the equation of the state of the dark energy ($p_{\rm
X}=\omega\rho_{\rm X}$). We conclude that OHD constrains the smoothness
parameter more effectively than the data of SNe Ia and compact radio sources.
