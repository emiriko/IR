Within warped extra dimension models that explain flavor through geometry,
flavor changing neutral current constraints generally force the Kaluza-Klein
scale to be above many TeV. This creates tension with a natural electroweak
scale. On the other hand, a much lower scale compatible with precision
electroweak and flavor changing neutral current constraints is allowed if we
decouple the Kaluza-Klein states of Standard Model gauge bosons from light
fermions $c_{\rm light}\simeq c_b\simeq 0.5$ bulk mass parameters). The main
signature for this approach is four top quark production via the Kaluza-Klein
excitations' strong coupling to top quarks. We study single lepton, like-sign
dilepton, and trilepton observables of four-top events at the Large Hadron
Collider. The like-sign dilepton signature typically has the largest discovery
potential for a strongly coupled right-handed top case ($M_{KK} \sim 2-2.5
\TeV$), while single lepton is the better when the left-handed top couples most
strongly ($M_{KK} \sim 2 \TeV$). We also describe challenging lepton-jet
collimation issues in the like-sign dilepton and trilepton channels. An
alternative single lepton observable is considered which takes advantage of the
many bottom quarks in the final state. Although searches of other particles may
compete, we find that four top production via Kaluza-Klein gluons is most
promising in a large region of this parameter space.
