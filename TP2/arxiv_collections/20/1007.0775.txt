We establish compactness estimates for $\overline{\partial}_{b}$ on a compact
pseudoconvex CR-submanifold of $\mathbb{C}^{n}$ of hypersurface type that
satisfies property(P). When the submanifold is orientable, these estimates were
proved by A.~Raich via microlocal methods. Our proof deduces the estimates from
(a slight extension, when $q>1$, of) those known on hypersurfaces via the fact
that locally, CR-submanifolds of hypersurface type are CR-equivalent to a
hypersurface. The relationship between two potential theoretic conditions is
also clarified.
