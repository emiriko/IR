In this paper, we report on theoretical investigation of the effect of
refractive index of immersion oil on the position of optimal depth and optical
trap quality in optical tweezers. Using simple numerical calculation presented
here, one can study the optical trapping in different samples, after multi
interfaces and find the best choice of immersion oil for a particular case.
