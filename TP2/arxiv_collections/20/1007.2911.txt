The physics of tau and charm started in early 70's after J/$\psi$ and $\tau$
were discovered. Since then several dedicated accelerators and experiments were
built with increasing luminosities and studies on light hadron spectroscopy,
charmonium, electroweak and QCD were never interupted. New interests and
surprises are not rare in this area. With the newly built BEPCII/BESIII, an
even brighter future is foreseen.
