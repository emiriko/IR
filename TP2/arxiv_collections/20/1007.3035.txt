We present a simple and inexpensive means to measure background-free
photoinduced absorption spectra by implementing a dual optical modulation
scheme. Our objective is to measure quasi-steady-state absorption spectra of
long-lived photoexcitations, such as polarons and triplet excitons in organic
semiconductors, when the photoluminescence of the sample is strong compared to
the photoinduced absorption signal. In our instrument, we modulate a
continuous-wave laser at a frequency $f_{pu}$ with a mechanical chopper before
exciting the material. We measure the fractional change of transmission of the
sample with a tuneable monochromatic probe source modulated at a frequency
$f_{pr}$, and with a digital lockin amplifier at a reference frequency $f_{ref}
= f_{pu} + f_{pr}$. We generate the reference sinusoidal wave for the lockin
amplifier using a simple home-built electronic circuit that generates their
sum-frequency signal. This scheme allows measurement of the fractional change
of transmittance of the sample induced by the pump laser at a frequency $f_{pu}
+ f_{pr}$ without parasitic signal at a frequency $f_{pu}$, such as
photoluminescence of the sample or pump-laser scatter. We demonstrate the power
of this approach by measuring cleanly the photoinduced absorption spectrum of a
highly luminescent semiconductor polymer,
poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene-co-benzothiadiazole), at 10\,K. We compare this
measurement favourably with that obtained by simple modulation of the pump
laser after subtraction of the dominant photoluminescence background.
