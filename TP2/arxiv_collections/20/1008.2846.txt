(Abridged) We present new deep VLT/FORS optical spectra with intermediate
resolution and large wavelength coverage of the GPS radio source and ULIRG
PKS1345+12 (4C12.50; z=0.122), taken with the aim of investigating the impact
of the nuclear activity on the circumnuclear ISM. PKS1345+12 is a powerful
quasar and is also the best studied case of an emission line outflow in a
ULIRG. Using the density sensitive transauroral emission lines [S II]4068,4076
and [O II]7318,7319,7330,7331, we pilot a new technique to accurately model the
electron density for cases in which it is not possible to use the traditional
diagnostic [S II]6716/6731, namely sources with highly broadened complex
emission line profiles and/or high (Ne > 10^4 cm^-3) electron densities. We
measure electron densities of Ne=2.94x10^3 cm^-3, Ne=1.47x10^4 cm^-3 and
Ne=3.16x10^5 cm^-3 for the regions emitting the narrow, broad and very broad
components respectively. We calculate a total mass outflow rate of 8 M_sun
yr^-1. We estimate the total mass in the warm gas outflow is 8x10^5 M_sun. The
total kinetic power in the warm outflow is 3.4x10^42 erg s^-1. We find that
only a small fraction (0.13% of Lbol) of the available accretion power is
driving the warm outflow, significantly less than currently required by the
majority of quasar feedback models (~5-10\% of Lbol), but similar to recent
findings by Hopkins et al. (2010) for a two-stage feedback model. The models
also predict that AGN outflows will eventually remove the gas from the bulge of
the host galaxy. The visible warm outflow in PKS1345+12 is not currently
capable of doing so. However, it is entirely possible that much of the outflow
is either obscured by a dense and dusty natal cocoon and/or in cooler or hotter
phases of the ISM. This result is important not just for studies of young
(GPS/CSS) radio sources, but for AGN in general.
