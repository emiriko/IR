We show that the non-equilibrium dynamic in two-dimensional electron glasses
close to metal-dielectric transition is dramatically sensitive to electric
fields confinement inside the sample, which leads to a nearly thermally
activated conductance behavior and a strong non-equilibrium conductance
response to the gate voltage, i. e. memory dip in a field dependence of
conductance. Theory accounts qualitatively and quantitatively for the universal
temperature and field dependencies of memory dip.
