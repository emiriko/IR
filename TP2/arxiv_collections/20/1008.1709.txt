We have redetermined the parallax and proper motion of the nearby isolated
neutron star RX~J185635-3754. We used eight observations with the high
resolution camera of the HST/ACS taken from 2002 through 2004. We performed the
astrometric fitting using five independent methods, all of which yielded
consistent results. The mean estimate of the distance is 123 (+11, -15) pc (1
sigma), in good agreement with our earlier published determination.
