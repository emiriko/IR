We performed a sensitive search for the ground-state emission lines of ortho-
and para-water vapor in the DM Tau protoplanetary disk using the Herschel/HIFI
instrument. No strong lines are detected down to 3sigma levels in 0.5 km/s
channels of 4.2 mK for the 1_{10}--1_{01} line and 12.6 mK for the
1_{11}--0_{00} line. We report a very tentative detection, however, of the
1_{10}--1_{01} line in the Wide Band Spectrometer, with a strength of
T_{mb}=2.7 mK, a width of 5.6 km/s and an integrated intensity of 16.0 mK km/s.
The latter constitutes a 6sigma detection. Regardless of the reality of this
tentative detection, model calculations indicate that our sensitive limits on
the line strengths preclude efficient desorption of water in the UV illuminated
regions of the disk. We hypothesize that more than 95-99% of the water ice is
locked up in coagulated grains that have settled to the midplane.
