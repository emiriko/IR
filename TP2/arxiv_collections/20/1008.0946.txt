In this note we have applied directly the Shannon formula for information
theory entropy to derive the Black Hole (Bekenstein-Hawking) entropy. Our
analysis is semi-classical in nature since we use the (recently proposed [8])
quantum mechanical near horizon mode functions to compute the tunneling
probability that goes in to the Shannon formula, following the general idea of
[5]. Our framework conforms to the information theoretic origin of Black Hole
entropy, as originally proposed by Bekenstein.
