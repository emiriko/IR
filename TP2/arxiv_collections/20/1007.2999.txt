This proceeding summarizes the Higgs recoil mass and Higgs-strahlung
cross-section study done for the Letter of Intent (LOI) of the International
Large Detector (ILD) Concept. Assuming a Higgs mass of 120 GeV, working at 250
GeV center of mass energy with beam parameters RDR250 and beam polarization,
this full simulation study predicts that, the ILD detector can achieve 37 MeV
precision on the Higgs mass measurement and 3.3% on the cross-section
measurement from the muon channel, while 83 MeV and 4.9% from the electron
channel, if we have 250 inverse fb integrated luminosity.
