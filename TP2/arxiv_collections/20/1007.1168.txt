Transistors based on various types of non-silicon nanowires have shown great
potential for a variety of applications, especially for those require
transparency and low-temperature substrates. However, critical requirements for
circuit functionality such as saturated source-drain current, and matched
threshold voltages of individual nanowire transistors in a way that is
compatible with low temperature substrates, have not been achieved. Here we
show that femtosecond laser pulses can anneal individual transistors based on
In2O3 nanowires, improve the saturation of the source-drain current, and
permanently shift the threshold voltage to the positive direction. We applied
this technique and successfully shifted the switching threshold voltages of
NMOS based inverters and improved their noise margin, in both depletion and
enhancement modes. Our demonstration provides a method to trim the parameters
of individual nanowire transistors, and suggests potential for large-scale
integration of nanowire-based circuit blocks and systems.
