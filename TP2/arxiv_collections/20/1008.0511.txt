High-order harmonic generation (HHG) with relativistically strong laser
pulses is considered employing electron ionization-recollisions from multiply
charged ions in counterpropagating, linearly polarized attosecond pulse trains.
The propagation of the harmonics through the medium and the scaling of HHG into
the multi-kilo-electronvolt regime are investigated. We show that the phase
mismatch caused by the free electron background can be compensated by an
additional phase of the emitted harmonics specific to the considered setup
which depends on the delay time between the pulse trains. This renders feasible
the phase-matched emission of harmonics with photon energies of several tens of
kilo-electronvolt from an underdense plasma.
