We develop the algebraic theory behind the constructions of Yekhanin (2008)
and Efremenko (2009), in an attempt to understand the ``algebraic niceness''
phenomenon in $\mathbb{Z}_m$. We show that every integer $m = pq = 2^t -1$,
where $p$, $q$ and $t$ are prime, possesses the same good algebraic property as
$m=511$ that allows savings in query complexity. We identify 50 numbers of this
form by computer search, which together with 511, are then applied to gain
improvements on query complexity via Itoh and Suzuki's composition method. More
precisely, we construct a $3^{\lceil r/2\rceil}$-query LDC for every positive
integer $r<104$ and a $\left\lfloor (3/4)^{51}\cdot 2^{r}\right\rfloor$-query
LDC for every integer $r\geq 104$, both of length $N_{r}$, improving the $2^r$
queries used by Efremenko (2009) and $3\cdot 2^{r-2}$ queries used by Itoh and
Suzuki (2010).
  We also obtain new efficient private information retrieval (PIR) schemes from
the new query-efficient LDCs.
