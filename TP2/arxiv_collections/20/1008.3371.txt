We report on semiclassical angle-dependent magnetoresistance oscillations
(AMRO) and the Shubnikov-de Haas effect in the electron-overdoped cuprate
superconductor Nd$_{2-x}$Ce$_x$CuO$_4$. Our data provide convincing evidence
for magnetic breakdown in the system. This shows that a reconstructed
multiply-connected Fermi surface persists, at least at strong magnetic fields,
up to the highest doping level of the superconducting regime. Our results
suggest an intimate relation between translational symmetry breaking and the
superconducting pairing in the electron-doped cuprate superconductors.
