Ecosystems often undergo abrupt regime shifts in response to gradual external
changes. These shifts are theoretically understood as a regime switch between
alternative stable states of the ecosystem dynamical response to smooth changes
in external conditions. Usual models introduce nonlinearities in the
macroscopic dynamics of the ecosystem that lead to different stable attractors
among which the shift takes place. Here we propose an alternative explanation
of catastrophic regime shifts based on a recent model that pictures ecological
communities as systems in continuous fluctuation, according to certain
transition probabilities, between different micro-states in the phase space of
viable communities. We introduce a spontaneous extinction rate that accounts
for gradual changes in external conditions, and upon variations on this control
parameter the system undergoes a regime shift with similar features to those
previously reported. Under our microscopic viewpoint we recover the main
results obtained in previous theoretical and empirical work (anomalous
variance, hysteresis cycles, trophic cascades). The model predicts a gradual
loss of species in trophic levels from bottom to top near the transition. But
more importantly, the spectral analysis of the transition probability matrix
allows us to rigorously establish that we are observing the fingerprints, in a
finite size system, of a true phase transition driven by background
extinctions.
