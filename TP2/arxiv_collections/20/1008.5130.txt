Let $G$ be a simple graph with $n$ vertices. The coloring complex $\Delta(G)$
was defined by Steingr\'{\i}msson, and the homology of $\Delta(G)$ was shown to
be nonzero only in dimension $n-3$ by Jonsson. Hanlon recently showed that the
Eulerian idempotents provide a decomposition of the homology group
$H_{n-3}(\Delta(G))$ where the dimension of the $j^{th}$ component in the
decomposition, $H_{n-3}^{(j)}(\Delta(G))$, equals the absolute value of the
coefficient of $\lambda^{j}$ in the chromatic polynomial of $G$,
$\chi_{G}(\lambda)$.
  Jonsson recently studied the topology of intersections of coloring complexes.
In this note, we show that the coefficient of the ${j}^{th}$ term in the
chromatic polynomial of the intersection of coloring complexes gives the Euler
Characteristic of the $j^{th}$ Hodge subcomplex of the Hodge decomposition of
the intersection of coloring complexes.
