We compute the \'etale cohomology groups H^i(X,G_m) in several cases, where X
is a smooth tame Deligne-Mumford stack of dimension 1 over an algebraically
closed field. We have complete results for orbicurves (and, more generally, for
twisted nodal curves) and in the case all stabilizers are cyclic; we give some
partial results and examples in the general case. In particular we show that if
the stabilizers are abelian then H^2(X, G_m) does not depend on X but only on
the underlying orbicurve and on the generic stabilizer.
