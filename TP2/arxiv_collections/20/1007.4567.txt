We provide bounds on the upper box-counting dimension of negatively invariant
subsets of Banach spaces, a problem that is easily reduced to covering the
image of the unit ball under a linear map by a collection of balls of smaller
radius. As an application of the abstract theory we show that the global
attractors of a very broad class of parabolic partial differential equations
(semilinear equations in Banach spaces) are finite-dimensional.
