We investigate FeII emission in Broad Line Region (BLR) of AGNs by analyzing
the FeII(UV), FeII(4570) and MgII emission lines in 884 quasars in the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Quasar catalog in a redshift range of 0.727 < z <
0.804. FeII(4570)/FeII(UV) is used to infer the column density of FeII-emitting
clouds and explore the excitation mechanism of FeII emission lines. As
suggested before in various works, the classical photoionization models fail to
account for FeII(4570)/FeII(UV) by a factor of 10, which may suggest anisotropy
of UV FeII emission; otherwise, an alternative heating mechanism like shock is
working. The column density distribution derived from FeII(4570)/FeII(UV)
indicates that radiation pressure plays an important role in BLR gas dynamics.
We find a positive correlation between FeII(4570)/FeII(UV) and the Eddington
ratio. We also find that almost all FeII-emitting clouds are to be under
super-Eddington conditions unless ionizing photon fraction is much smaller than
that previously suggested. Finally we propose a physical interpretation of a
striking set of correlations between various emission-line properties, known as
``Eigenvector 1''.
