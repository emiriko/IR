We calculate the current-voltage characteristic of a homogeneously strained
metallic carbon nanotube adsorbed on a substrate. The strain generates a gap in
the energy spectrum leading to a reduction of the current. In the elastic
regime, the current-voltage characteristic shows a large negative differential
conductance at bias voltages of around $ \gtrsim 0.17 $V. We discuss the
implications for the current in the superelongated regime.
