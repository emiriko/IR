The August 2010 edition of the AAO newsletter has been newly updated and
renamed the AAO Observer as we become the Australian Astronomical Observatory.
This edition contains articles on the Galaxy And Mass Assembly survey, a
bipolar Type I planetary nebula an open cluster as well as PCA sky subtraction
for AAOmega; an OH spectrograph named GNOSIS and an overview of our recent
conference "Celebrating the AAO: past, present, and future".
