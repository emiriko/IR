We discuss two physical examples of the so-called {\em pseudo-bosons},
recently introduced in connection with pseudo-hermitian quantum mechanics. In
particular, we show that the so-called {\em extended harmonic oscillator} and
the {\em Swanson model} satisfy all the assumptions of the pseudo-bosonic
framework introduced by the author. We also prove that the biorthogonal bases
they produce are not Riesz bases.
