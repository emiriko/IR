We report the precise characterization of the optical potential obtained by
injecting a distributed-feedback erbium-doped fiber laser (DFB EDFL) at 1560 nm
to the transversal modes of a folded optical cavity. The optical potential was
mapped in situ using cold rubidium atoms, whose potential energy was spectrally
resolved thanks to the strong differential light shift induced by the 1560 nm
laser on the two levels of the probe transition. The optical potential obtained
in the cavity is suitable for trapping rubidium atoms, and eventually to
achieve all-optical Bose-Einstein condensation directly in the resonator.
