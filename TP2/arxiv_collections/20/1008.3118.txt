We prove the asymptotic stability of the equilibrium solution of a class of
vector Li\'enard equations by means of LaSalle invariance principle. The key
hypothesis consists in assuming that the intersections of the manifolds in
$\{\dot V = 0\}$ be isolated. We deduce an existence theorem for periodic
solutions of periodically perturbed vector Li\'enard equations.
