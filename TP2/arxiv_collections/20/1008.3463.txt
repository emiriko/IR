We study entropy production and fluctuation relations in the restricted
solid-on-solid growth model, which is a microscopic realization of the KPZ
equation. Solving the one dimensional model exactly on a particular line of the
phase diagram we demonstrate that entropy production quantifies the distance
from equilibrium. Moreover, as an example of a physically relevant current
different from the entropy, we study the symmetry of the large deviation
function associated with the interface height. In a special case of a system of
length L=4 we find that the probability distribution of the variation of height
has a symmetric large deviation function, displaying a symmetry different from
the Gallavotti-Cohen symmetry.
