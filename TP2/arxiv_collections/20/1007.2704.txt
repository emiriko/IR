Motivated by many worthwhile paper about (2 + 1)-dimensional BTZ black holes,
we generalize them to to (n + 1)-dimensional solutions, so called BTZ-like
solutions. We show that the electric field of BTZ-like solutions is the same as
(2 + 1)-dimensional BTZ black holes, and also their lapse functions are
approximately the same, too. By these similarities, it is also interesting to
investigate the geometric and thermodynamics properties of the BTZ-like
solutions. We find that, depending on the metric parameters, the BTZ-like
solutions may be interpreted as black hole solutions with inner (Cauchy) and
outer (event) horizons, an extreme black hole or naked singularity. Then, we
calculate thermodynamics quantities and conserved quantities, and show that
they satisfy the first law of thermodynamics. Finally, we perform a stability
analysis in the canonical ensemble and show that the BTZ-like solutions are
stable in the whole phase space.
