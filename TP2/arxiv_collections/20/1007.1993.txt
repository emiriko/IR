The impact of right-handed currents in both charged- and neutral-current
flavour-violating processes is analysed by means of an effective theory
approach. More explicitly, we analyse the structure of dimension-six operators
assuming a left-right symmetric flavour group, commuting with an underlying
$SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R \times U(1)_{B-L}$ global symmetry, broken only by two
Yukawa couplings. The model contains a new unitary matrix controlling
flavour-mixing in the right-handed sector. We determine the structure of this
matrix by charged-current data, where the tension between inclusive and
exclusive determinations of $|V_{ub}|$ can be solved. Having determined the
size and the flavour structure of right-handed currents, we investigate how
they would manifest themselves in neutral current processes, including
particle-antiparticle mixing, $Z\to b \bar b$, $B_{s,d}\to \mu^+\mu^-$, $B\to
{Xs,K,K*} \nu\bar\nu$, and $K\to \pi\nu\bar\nu$ decays. The possibility to
explain a non-standard CP-violating phase in $B_s$ mixing in this context, and
the comparison with other predictive new-physics frameworks addressing the same
problem, is also discussed. While a large $S_{\psi \phi}$ asymmetry can easily
be accommodated, we point out a tension in this framework between $|V_{ub}|$
and $S_{\psi K}$.
