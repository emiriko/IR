We demonstrate that the electric field enhancement that occurs in a gap
between two closely spaced nanostructures, such as metallic nanoparticles, is
the result of a transverse electromagnetic waveguide mode. We derive an
explicit semianalytic equation for the enhancement as a function of gap size,
which we show has a universal qualitative behavior in that it applies
irrespective of the material or geometry of the nanostructures and even in the
presence of surface plasmons. Examples of perfect electrically conducting and
Ag thin-wire antennas and a dimer of Ag spheres are presented and discussed.
