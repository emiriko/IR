We employ a dual-gated geometry to control the band gap \Delta in bilayer
graphene and study the temperature dependence of the resistance at the charge
neutrality point, RNP(T), from 220 to 1.5 K. Above 5 K, RNP(T) is dominated by
two thermally activated processes in different temperature regimes and exhibits
exp(T3/T)^{1/3} below 5 K. We develop a simple model to account for the
experimental observations, which highlights the crucial role of localized
states produced by potential fluctuations. The high temperature conduction is
attributed to thermal activation to the mobility edge. The activation energy
approaches \Delta /2 at large band gap. At intermediate and low temperatures,
the dominant conduction mechanisms are nearest neighbor hopping and
variable-range hopping through localized states. Our systematic study provides
a coherent understanding of transport in gapped bilayer graphene.
