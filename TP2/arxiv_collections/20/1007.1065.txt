We consider the Casimir-Polder potential of particles placed inside a
metallic cylindrical cavity at finite temperatures, taking account of thermal
non-equilibrium effects. In particular, we study how the resonant (thermal
non-equilibrium) potential and transition rates can be enhanced by fine-tuning
the radius of the cavity to match the transition wavelength of the dominant
transition of the particle. Numerical calculations show that the CP potential
acting atoms prepared in low-lying Rydberg states can be enhanced beyond 30
kHz, which is within the range of observability of modern experiments. Because
the magnitude of the resonance peaks depend sensitively on the low frequency
dissipation of the cavity metal, experiments in this set-up could be a critical
test of the disputed thermal correction to the Casimir force between metal
plates.
