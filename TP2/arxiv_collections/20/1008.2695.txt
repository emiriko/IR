We present a quantitative analysis of the constraints on the total equation
of state parameter that can be obtained from measuring the red shift evolution
of the cosmic shear. We compare the constraints that can be obtained from
measurements of the spin two angular multipole moments of the cosmic shear to
those resulting from the two dimensional and three dimensional power spectra of
the cosmic shear. We find that if the multipole moments of the cosmic shear are
measured accurately enough for a few red shifts the constraints on the dark
energy equation of state parameter improve significantly compared to those that
can be obtained from other measurements.
