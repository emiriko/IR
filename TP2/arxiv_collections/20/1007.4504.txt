We discuss the spin fluctuations and the role played by the magnetic
susceptibility in an atomic Fermi gas interacting with positive scattering
length. Both thermal and quantum fluctuations are considered. Using a sum rule
approach and recent {\it ab initio} Monte Carlo results for the magnetic
susceptibility of uniform matter we provide explicit predictions for the
frequency of the spin dipole oscillation of a gas trapped by a harmonic
potential and discuss the deviations from the behaviour of an ideal gas when
the system approaches the ferromagnetic transition. The role of the Landau's
parameters in the characterization of the magnetic properties is also
discussed.
