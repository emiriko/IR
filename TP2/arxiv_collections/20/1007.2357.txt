We argue that Coulomb interaction can strongly influence non-local electron
transport in normal-superconducting-normal structures and emphasize direct
relation between Coulomb effects and non-local shot noise. In the tunneling
limit non-local differential conductance is found to have an S-like shape and
can turn negative at non-zero bias. At high transmissions crossed Andreev
reflection yields positive noise cross-correlations and Coulomb anti-blockade
of non-local electron transport.
