The Very Local Interstellar Medium (VLISM) contains clouds which consist of
partially-ionized plasma. These clouds can be effectively diagnosed via high
resolution optical and ultraviolet spectroscopy of the absorption lines they
form in the spectra of nearby stars. Among the information provided by these
spectroscopic measurements are the root-mean-square velocity fluctuation due to
turbulence in these clouds and the ion temperature, which may be partially
determined by dissipation of turbulence. We consider whether this turbulence
resembles the extensively studied and well-diagnosed turbulence in the solar
wind and solar corona. Published observations are used to determine if the
velocity fluctuations are primarily transverse to a large-scale magnetic field,
whether the temperature perpendicular to the large scale field is larger than
that parallel to the field, and whether ions with larger Larmor radii have
higher temperatures than smaller gyroradius ions. Although a thorough
investigation of the data is underway, a preliminary examination of the
published data shows neither evidence for anisotropy of the velocity
fluctuations or temperature, nor Larmor radius-dependent heating. These results
indicate differences between solar wind and Local Cloud turbulence.
