UBVI CCD photometry has been obtained for the Ruprecht 93 (Ru 93) region. We
were unable to confirm the existence of an intermediate-age open cluster in Ru
93 from the spatial distribution of blue stars. On the other hand, we found two
young star groups in the observed field: the nearer one (Ru 93 group) comprises
the field young stars in the Sgr-Car arm at d ~ 2.1 kpc, while the farther one
(WR 37 group) is the young stars around WR 37 at d ~ 4.8 kpc. We have derived
an abnormal extinction law (Rv = 3.5) in the Ruprecht 93 region.
