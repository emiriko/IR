We demonstrate a mechanism for a dual layer, vertical field-effect
transistor, in which nearly-depleting one layer will extend its wavefunction to
overlap the other layer and increase tunnel current. We characterize this
effect in a specially designed GaAs/AlGaAs device, observing a tunnel current
increase of two orders of magnitude at cryogenic temperatures, and we suggest
extrapolations of the design to other material systems such as graphene.
