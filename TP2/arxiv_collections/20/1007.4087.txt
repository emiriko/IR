In a recent paper, which has been published in Nature, the LIGO Scientific
Collaboration (LSC) obtained an upper limit on the stochastic
gravitational-wave background of cosmological origin by using the data from a
two-year science run of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational- wave
Observatory (LIGO). Such an upper limit rules out some models of early Universe
evolution, like the ones with relatively large equation-of-state parameter and
the cosmic (super) string models with relatively small string tension arising
from some String Theory's models. It results also an upper limit for the relic
stochastic background of gravitational waves (RSBGWs) which is proposed by the
Pre-Big-Bang Theory. On the other hand, the upper bound on the RSBGWs which is
proposed by the Standard Inflationary Model is well known and often updated by
using the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP). The potential detection
of such a RSBGWs is the only way to learn about the evolution of the very early
universe, up to the bounds of the Planck epoch and the initial singularity.
This is a kind of information that is inaccessible to standard astrophysical
observations. By using a conformal treatment, a formula that directly connects
the average amplitude of the RSBGWs with the Inflaton field has been re- cently
obtained in our paper Gen. Rel. Grav. 42, 5, 1323-1333 (2010). In this
proceeding, by joining this formula with the equation for the characteristic
amplitude hC for the RSBGWs, the upper bounds on the RSBGWs from the WMAP and
LSC data will be translated in lower bounds on the Inflaton field. The results
show that the value of the Inflaton field that arises from the WMAP bound on
the RSBGWs is totally in agreement with the famous slow roll condition on
Inflation, while the value of the Inflaton field that arises from the LSC bound
on the RSBGWs could be not in agreement with such a condition.
