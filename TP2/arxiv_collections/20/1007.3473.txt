Measurements of strangeness production in jets help illuminate the QCD
mechanisms in fragmentation. Furthermore, they provide a crucial baseline for
heavy-ion studies where modifications in jet chemistry have recently been
observed by the STAR experiment. We present new results on strange particle
production in jets from p+p $\sqrt{s}$ = 200 GeV collisions measured by the
STAR experiment. The fragmentation functions of the \Lambda, \bar{\Lambda} and
K0Short particles are obtained using various jet finding algorithms, and then
compared to various models. Strange particle ratios in jets will be obtained
and compared to values obtained from the inclusive spectra. Finally, we will
show jets tagged with leading strange baryons and mesons, in order to
investigate whether gluon or quark jets can be isolated in this way.
