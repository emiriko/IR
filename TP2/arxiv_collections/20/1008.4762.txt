The past decade has presented a revolution in the field of observational high
energy gamma-ray astrophysics with the advent of a new generation in
ground-based TeV telescopes and subsequent GeV space telescopes. The Fermi
Large Area Telescope (LAT) was launched in August 2008 and has offered
unprecedented sensitivity and survey capabilities in the 30 MeV - 300 GeV
energy range.
  Presented here are the results from the first two years of LAT observations
of galactic binary systems including the definitive detections of LSI+61 303,
LS 5039 and Cyg X-3. These sources and others are discussed in context with
their known TeV and X-ray properties. The LAT data provides new understandings
and pose new questions about the nature of these objects. The identification of
an exponential cutoff in the spectra of both LSI+61 303 and LS 5039 was
unexpected and poses challenges for explaining the emission mechanisms and
processes which are in operation within these systems.
