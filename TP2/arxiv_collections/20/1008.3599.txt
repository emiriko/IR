Tunnel field effect transistor (TFET) devices are attractive as they show
good scalability and have very low leakage current. However they suffer from
low on-current and high threshold voltage. In order to employ the TFET for
circuit applications, these problems need to be tackled. In this paper, a novel
lateral strained double-gate TFET (SDGTFET) is presented. Using device
simulation, we show that the SDGTFET has a higher on-current, low leakage, low
threshold voltage, excellent subthreshold slope, and good short channel effects
and also meets important ITRS guidelines.
