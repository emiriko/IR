The paper presents a theoretical analysis on the interaction between the
Earth's magnetic field of a compass needle and the magnetic field of a straight
infinite current-carrying wire. Implementation of a planar horizontal coil of
wires has been shown as a sinus galvanometer. The magnetic field over the
planar coil of wires has been examined by experiment. The coil could be used as
a model for straight infinite current wire in demonstration set-ups or could be
given as an assignment in Physics laboratory workshops.
