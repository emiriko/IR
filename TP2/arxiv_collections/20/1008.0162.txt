Electrostatically charged aerosol nanoparticles strongly attract surrounding
polar gas molecules due to a charge-dipole interaction. In humid air, the
substantial electrostatic attraction and acceleration of surrounding water
vapour molecules towards charged combustible nanoparticles cause intense
electrostatic hydration and preferential oxidation of these nanoparticles by
accelerated water vapor molecules rather than non-polar oxygen molecules. In
particular, electrostatic acceleration, acquired by surrounding water vapour
molecules at a distance of their mean free path from the minimally charged iron
metal nanoparticle can increase an oxidative activity of these polar molecules
with respect to the nanoparticle by a factor of one million. Intense
electrostatic hydration of charged metal nanoparticles converts the
nanoparticle's oxide based shells into the hydroxide based electrolyte shells,
transforming these nanoparticles into metal/air core-shell nanobatteries,
periodically short-circuited by intra-particle field and thermionic electron
emission. Partially synchronized breakdowns within trillions of
nanoparticles-nanobatteries turn a cloud of charged nanoparticles-nanobatteries
- ball lightning - into a powerful radio-frequency aerosol generator.
Electrostatic hydration and charge-catalyzed oxidation of charged combustible
nanoparticles also contribute to a self-oscillating thermocycling process of
evolution and periodic auto-ignition of inflammable gases near to the
nanoparticle's surface. The described effects might be of interest for the
improvement of certain nanotechnological processes and to better understand
ball lightning phenomenon.
