We propose distributed algorithms to automatically deploy a group of robotic
agents and provide coverage of a discretized environment represented by a
graph. The classic Lloyd approach to coverage optimization involves separate
centering and partitioning steps and converges to the set of centroidal Voronoi
partitions. In this work we present a novel graph coverage algorithm which
achieves better performance without this separation while requiring only
pairwise ``gossip'' communication between agents. Our new algorithm provably
converges to an element of the set of pairwise-optimal partitions, a subset of
the set of centroidal Voronoi partitions. We illustrate that this new
equilibrium set represents a significant performance improvement through
numerical comparisons to existing Lloyd-type methods. Finally, we discuss ways
to efficiently do the necessary computations.
