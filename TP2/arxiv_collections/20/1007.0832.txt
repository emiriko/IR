We define a class of Euclidean distances on weighted graphs, enabling to
perform thermodynamic soft graph clustering. The class can be constructed form
the "raw coordinates" encountered in spectral clustering, and can be extended
by means of higher-dimensional embeddings (Schoenberg transformations).
Geographical flow data, properly conditioned, illustrate the procedure as well
as visualization aspects.
