We give an exposition and numerical studies of upper hedging prices in
multinomial models from the viewpoint of linear programming and the
game-theoretic probability of Shafer and Vovk. We also show that, as the number
of rounds goes to infinity, the upper hedging price of a European option
converges to the solution of the Black-Scholes-Barenblatt equation.
