The results from data taken during the last several years at the Relativistic
Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) will be reviewed in the paper. Several selected
topics that further our understanding of constituent quark scaling, jet
quenching and color screening effect of heavy quarkonia in the hot dense medium
will be presented. Detector upgrades will further probe the properties of Quark
Gluon Plasma. Future measurements with upgraded detectors will be presented.
The discovery perspectives from future measurements will also be discussed.
