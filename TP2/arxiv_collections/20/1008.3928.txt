Scientific communication is an essential part of modern science: whereas
Archimedes worked alone, Newton (correspondence with Hooke, 1676) acknowledged
that "If I have seen a little further, it is by standing on the shoulders of
Giants." How is scientific communication reflected in the patterns of citations
in scientific papers? How have these patterns changed in the 20th century, as
both means of communication and individual transportation changed rapidly,
compared to the earlier post-Newton 18th and 19th centuries? Here we discuss a
glass model for scientific communications, based on a unique 2009 scientometric
study of 25 million papers and 600 million citations that encapsulates the
epistemology of modern science. The glass model predicts and explains, using no
adjustable parameters, a surprisingly universal internal structure in the
development of scientific research, which is essentially constant across the
natural sciences, but which because of globalization changed qualitatively
around 1960. Globalization corresponds physically to anomalous superdiffusion,
which has been observed near the molecular glass transition, and can enhance
molecular diffusion by factors as large as 100.
