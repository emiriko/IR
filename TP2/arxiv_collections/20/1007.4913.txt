The elasticity, dynamic properties, and superconductivity of $\alpha$,
$\omega$, and $\beta$ Zr are investigated by using first-principles methods.
Our calculated elastic constants, elastic moduli, and Debye temperatures of
$\alpha$ and $\omega$ phases are in excellent agreement with experiments.
Electron-phonon coupling constant $\lambda$ and electronic density of states at
the Fermi level $N$(\emph{E}$_{\rm{F}}$) are found to increase with pressure
for these two hexagonal structures. For cubic $\beta$ phase, the critical
pressure for mechanical stability is predicted to be 3.13 GPa and at \emph{P}=4
GPa the low elastic modulus ($E$=31.97 GPa) can be obtained. Besides, the
critical pressure for dynamic stability of $\beta$ phase is achieved by phonon
dispersion calculations to be $\mathtt{\sim}$26 GPa. Over this pressure,
$\lambda$ and $N$(\emph{E}$_{\rm{F}}$) of $\beta$ phase decrease upon further
compression. Our calculations show that the large value of superconducting
transition temperature $\emph{T}_{\rm{c}}$ at 30 GPa for $\beta$ Zr is mainly
due to the TA1 soft mode. Under further compression, the soft vibrational mode
will gradually fade away.
