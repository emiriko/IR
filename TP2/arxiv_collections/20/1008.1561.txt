The Fe pnictide parent compound EuFe2As2 exhibits a strongly momentum
dependent carrier dynamics around the hole pocket at the center of the
Brillouin zone. The very different dynamics of electrons and holes cannot be
explained solely by intraband scattering and interband contributions have to be
considered. In addition, three coherently excited modes at frequencies of 5.6,
3.1 and 2.4 THz are observed. An estimate of the electron-phonon coupling
parameter reveals lambda < 0.5, suggesting a limited importance of e-ph
coupling to superconductivity in Fe pnictides.
