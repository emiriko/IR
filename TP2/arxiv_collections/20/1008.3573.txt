We report on numerical investigation of fractal properties of critical
interfaces in two-dimensional Potts models. Algorithms for finding percolating
interfaces of Fortuin-Kasteleyn clusters, their external perimeters and
interfaces of spin clusters are presented. Fractal dimensions are measured and
compared to exact theoretical predictions.
