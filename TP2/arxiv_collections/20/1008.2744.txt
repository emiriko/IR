We present measurements of $ab$-plane resistivity $\rho_{ab}(T)$ and
superfluid density [$\propto \lambda^{-2}$, $\lambda$ = magnetic penetration
depth] in $La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4}$ films. As Sr concentration $x$ exceeds about
0.22, the superconducting transition sharpens dramatically, becoming as narrow
as 200 mK near the super-to-normal metal quantum critical point. At the same
time, $\rho_{ab}(T)$, $\lambda^{-2}(T)$, and transition temperature $T_c$
decrease, and upward curvature develops in $\lambda^{-2}(T)$. Given the sharp
transitions, we interpret these results in the context of a homogeneous d-wave
superconducting state, with elastic scattering that is enhanced relative to
underdoped LSCO due to weaker electron correlations. This interpretation
conflicts with the viewpoint that the overdoped state is inhomogeneous due to
phase separation into superconducting and normal metal regions.
