This paper presents non-destructive dark current measurements of
superconducting TESLA cavities for superconducting LINACs. The measurements
were carried out in a highly disturbed accelerator environment using a low
temperature superconducting d.c. SQUID based Cryogenic Current Comparator
(CCC). The overall current sensitivity under these rough conditions was
measured to be 0.2 nA/sqrt(Hz) which enables the detection of dark currents of
5 nA.
