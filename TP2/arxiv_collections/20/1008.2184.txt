The mechanical vapor recompression is an efficient process to decrease energy
consumption of drying processes. In order to use the mechanical vapor
recompression (MVR) in residential clothe dryers, the volumetric Turbivo
technology is used to design a dry water vapor compressor. The Turbivo
volumetric machine is composed mainly of a rotor with one blade, a stator, and
a mobile oscillating thrust. The advantages of Turbivo(R) technology are the
absence of contact between rotor and stator as well as the oil-free operation.
A model of the Turbivo compressor, including kinematic, dynamic, and
thermodynamic analysis is presented. The compressor internal tightness is
ensured by a surface treatment of the compressor components. Using the model, a
water vapor Turbivo compressor of 12m3/h and compression ratio of 5 has been
sized and realized. The compressor prototype will be tested on a dedicated test
bench to characterize its volumetric and isentropic efficiencies.
