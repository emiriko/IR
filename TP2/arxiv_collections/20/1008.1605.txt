The recent "breakdown criterion" result of S. Klainerman and I. Rodnianski
stated roughly that an Einstein-vacuum spacetime, given as a CMC foliation, can
be further extended in time if the second fundamental form and the derivative
of the lapse of the foliation are uniformly bounded. This theorem and its proof
were extended to Einstein-scalar and Einstein-Maxwell spacetimes in the
author's Ph.D. thesis. In this paper, we state the main results of the thesis,
and we summarize and discuss their proofs. In particular, we will discuss the
various issues resulting from nontrivial Ricci curvature and the coupling
between the Einstein and the field equations.
