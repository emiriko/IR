We present the effective range expansions for the 1S_0 and 3S_1 scattering
phase shifts, and the relativistic deuteron wave functions that accompany our
recent high precision fits (with chi^2/N{data} approx 1) to the 2007 world np
data below 350 MeV. The wave functions are expanded in a series of analytical
functions (with the correct asymptotic behavior at both large and small
arguments) that can be Fourier-transformed from momentum to coordinate space
and are convenient to use in any application. A fortran subroutine to compute
these wave functions can be obtained from the authors.
