We discuss the Berry curvature calculations of the Hall viscosity for the
unprojected to the lowest Landau level wave function of the Fermi-liquid-like
state. We conclude, within assumptions made, that in the linear response, with
small deformation of the system and in the thermodynamic limit, the Hall
viscosity takes the value characteristic for the Laughlin states. We present
arguments that the value is the same even for general deformations in the same
limit.
