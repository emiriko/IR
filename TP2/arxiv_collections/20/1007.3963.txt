We consider the Directed Coulomb Explosion regime of ion acceleration from
ultra-thin double layer (high Z/low Z) mass limited targets. In this regime the
laser pulse evacuated the electrons from the irradiated spot and accelerates
the remaining ion core in the direction of the laser pulse propagation. Then
the moving ion core explodes due to the excess of positive charge forming a
moving charge separation field that accelerates protons from the second layer.
The utilization of the mass limited targets increases the effectiveness of the
acceleration. It is also shown that different parameters of laser-target
configuration should be chosen to ensure optimal acceleration by either
linearly polarized or circularly polarized pulses.
