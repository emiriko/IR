We propose a survey of a rocky region in the north-east part of Sudan, using
the satellite imagery from Google Maps. In particular we analyse the region
which lies to the north of Nakasib Suture. Images reveal craters and ring
complexes. To enhance their features, images are processed with a method based
on fractional calculus. Two of these structures are proposed as possible impact
craters.
