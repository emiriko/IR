Non-ergodic renewal processes have recently been shown by several authors to
be insensitive to periodic perturbations, thereby apparently sanctioning the
death of linear response, a building block of nonequilibrium statistical
physics. We show that it is possible to go beyond the ``death of linear
response" and establish a permanent correlation between an external stimulus
and the response of a complex network generating non-ergodic renewal processes,
by taking as stimulus a similar non-ergodic process. The ideal condition of
1/f-noise corresponds to a singularity that is expected to be relevant in
several experimental conditions.
