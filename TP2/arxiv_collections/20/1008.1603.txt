We present a model as well as experimental results for a surface electrode
radio-frequency Paul trap that has a circular electrode geometry well-suited
for trapping of single ions and two-dimensional planar ion crystals. The trap
design is compatible with microfabrication and offers a simple method by which
the height of the trapped ions above the surface may be changed \emph{in situ}.
We demonstrate trapping of single and few Sr+ ions over an ion height range of
200-1000 microns for several hours under Doppler laser cooling, and use these
to characterize the trap, finding good agreement with our model.
