Let k be an algebraically closed field. We show that the Cremona group of all
birational transformations of the projective plane P^2 over k is not a simple
group. The strategy makes use of hyperbolic geometry, geometric group theory,
and algebraic geometry to produce elements in the Cremona group that generate
non trivial normal subgroups.
