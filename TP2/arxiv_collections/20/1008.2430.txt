We use the AdS/CFT correspondence to study the DC conductivity of massive
$\mathcal{N} = 2$ hypermultiplet fields in an $\mathcal{N} = 4\, SU(N_c)$
super-Yang-Mills theory plasma in the large $N_c$ and finite 't Hooft coupling.
We also discuss general curvature-squared and Gauss-Bonnet corrections on the
DC conductivity.
