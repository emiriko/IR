Factorization of quantum mechanical Hamiltonians has been a useful technique
for some time. This procedure has been given an elegant description by
supersymmetric quantum mechanics, and the subject has become well-developed. We
demonstrate that the existence of raising and lowering operators for the
harmonic oscillator (and many other potentials) can be extended to their
supersymmetric partners. The use of double supersymmetry (or a factorization
chain) is used to obtain non-singular isospectral potentials, and the explicit
expressions for the ladder operators, wave functions and probability densities
are provided. This application avoids the technical complexities of the most
general approaches, and requires relatively modest methods from supersymmetric
quantum mechanics.
