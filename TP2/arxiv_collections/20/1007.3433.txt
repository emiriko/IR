In dealing with asymptotic approximation of possibly divergent nets of
probability distributions, we are led to study uniform structures on the set of
distributions. This paper identifies a class of such uniform structures that
may be considered to be reasonable generalizations of the weak topology. It is
shown that all structures in the class yield the same notion of asymptotic
approximation for sequences (but not for general nets) of probability
distributions.
