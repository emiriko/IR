A critical examination of RHIC paradigms is presented. Topics include: search
for a critical point with a low energy scan; the lack of understanding of
radiative processes in a medium in QCD compared in detail to examples from QED;
the reason why some physicists started to measure particles at large pT in the
1960's; a review of the discovery of hard-scattering in p-p collisions in the
1970's via single-inclusive and two-particle correlations and application of
these techniques at RHIC. Several paradigms in both soft and hard physics which
are popular at RHIC are discussed and challenged.
