Angular magnetotransport measurements have been performed to tackle the
origin of the magnetoresistance in the quasi-1D Hollandite Ba1.2Rh8O16. Three
samples of different impurities amount were measured. We observe that the low
temperature resistivity upturn is not due to a charge density wave transition,
and a dominant role of impurities scattering for low temperature transport
properties is instead demonstrated. The components of magnetoresistance were
separated by using the Kohler plot and the angular dependency of the resistance
under magnetic field. It shows the major contribution of an isotropic, likely
spin driven, negative magnetoresistance. Galvanomagnetic characteristics are
then consistent with a Kondo effect and appear to be essentially 3D at low
temperature.
