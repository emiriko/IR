The observation of single top quark production by the CDF and D0
collaborations is one of the flagship measurements of the Run II of the
Tevatron. The Tevatron combined single top quark cross section is measured to
be: $\sigma(tb+X,~tqb+X)=2.8^{+0.6}_{-0.5}$~pb for a top quark mass of 170~GeV.
This result is in agreement with the standard model production of a single top
quark together with a jet in $\ppbar$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}$=1.96~TeV and
allows to measure the CKM matrix element $|V_{tb}|$ without assumptions about
the number of quark families. Other analyses involving tau leptons have been
performed, and several properties, like the top quark width or the polarization
have been measured.
