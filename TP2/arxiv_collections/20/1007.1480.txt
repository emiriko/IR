Magneto-optical traps (MOTs) of highly magnetic lanthanides open the door to
explorations of novel phases of strongly correlated matter such as lattice
supersolids and quantum liquid crystals. We recently reported the first MOTs of
the five high abundance isotopes of the most magnetic atom, dysprosium.
Described here are details of the experimental technique employed for
repumper-free Dy MOTs containing up to half a billion atoms. Extensive
characterization of the MOTs' properties---population, temperature, loading,
metastable decay dynamics, trap dynamics---is provided.
