This document presents the integration of design patterns and mobile
applications, in the development of software management of plates (SIGEP) that
allows to support in the solutions to problematics that they appear in the
process of maintaining of plates copper cathodes of a Mining Company, in our
case for Quebrada Blanca S.A. (CMQB S.A.). These problematics mainly are
related to the little control over the tasks carried out in the maintaining to
the cathodic plates, and the lack of information that leads to this practice,
originates a deficient management and it does not allow to make opportune
decisions referring to these elements, and therefore it does to project and to
administer the life utility of the plates of cathodes, generating lifted costs
associated to this process. As the process of maintaining a cathode plates
constantly changing process, with respect to maintenance strategies in the
system design SIGEP recognizing the flexibility and reuse in the design of
system components, this achieved through design patterns used. The SIGEP
implementation of the system and the incorporation of a mobile application,
meant for CMQB S.A. increase control of the tasks carried out plates cathodes,
allowing the company to detailed information on the maintenance of these
elements, allowing among other things, identify cathode plates which are more
expensive, and therefore knowing what must be replaced.
