In this paper I review the possibility of TeV scale strings that may be
detectable by the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). This possibility was
investigated extensively in a series of phenomenological papers during
1984-1985 in connection with the Superconducting Super Collider (SSC). The work
was mainly based on a model independent systematic parametrization of
scattering amplitudes and cross sections, for Standard Model particles, quarks
and leptons, that were assumed to behave like strings, while gluons, photons,
$W^{\pm},Z$ were taken as elementary. By using Veneziano type beta functions
consistent with crossing symmetry, duality and Regge behavior, bosonic or
fermionic resonances in each channel were included, while the low energy
behavior was matched to effective field theory non-renormalizable interactions
consistent with the Standard Model SU(3)xSU(2)xU(1) gauge symmetry as well as
global flavor and family symmetries. The motivation for this approach at that
time was the possible compositeness of quarks and leptons but the same
phenomenological approach would apply effectively with the modern additional
motivations for TeV scale strings, such as the hypothesis of D-branes with
large extra dimensions. Because some of the main theoretical and
phenomenological work of that time appeared only in the 1984 Snowmass and other
proceedings, the results of the investigations have been inaccessible to most
researchers and consequently have been largely forgotten. Meanwhile similar
approaches are being explored by other researchers. Given the renewed interest
in the old results, the purpose of the current paper is to make them readily
available.
