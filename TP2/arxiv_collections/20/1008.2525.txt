We construct a coarse-grained model of parallel actin bundles crosslinked by
compact, globular bundling proteins, such as fascin and espin, necessary
components of filapodial and mechanosensory bundles. Consistent with structural
observations of bundles, we find that the optimal geometry for crosslinking is
overtwisted, requiring a coherent structural change of the helical geometry of
the filaments. We study the linker-dependent thermodynamic transition of
bundled actin filaments from their native state to the overtwisted state and
map out the "twist-state'' phase diagram in terms of the availability as well
as the flexibility of crosslinker proteins. We predict that the transition from
the uncrosslinked to fully-crosslinked state is highly sensitive to linker
flexibility: flexible crosslinking smoothly distorts the twist-state of bundled
filaments, while rigidly crosslinked bundles undergo a phase transition,
rapidly overtwisting filaments over a narrow range of free crosslinker
concentrations. Additionally, we predict a rich spectrum of intermediate
structures, composed of alternating domains of sparsely-bound (untwisted) and
strongly-bound (overtwisted) filaments. This model reveals that subtle
differences in crosslinking agents themselves modify not only the detailed
structure of parallel actin bundles, but also the thermodynamic pathway by
which they form.
