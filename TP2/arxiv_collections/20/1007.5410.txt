The frequency and temperature dependence of the dielectric constant and the
electrical conductivity of the transparent glasses in the composition
0.5Cs2O-0.5Li2O-3B2O3 (CLBO) were investigated in the 100 Hz - 10 MHz frequency
range. The dielectric constant for the as-quenched glass increased with
increasing temperature, exhibiting anomalies in the vicinity of the glass
transition and crystallization temperatures. The temperature coefficient of
dielectric constant was estimated (35 \pm 2 ppm.K-1) using Havinga's formula.
The dielectric loss at 313 K is 0.005 \pm 0.0005 at all the frequencies
understudy. The activation energy associated with the electrical relaxation
determined from the electric modulus spectra was found to be 1.73 \pm 0.05 eV,
close to that of the activation energy obtained for DC conductivity (1.6 \pm
0.06 eV). The frequency dependent electrical conductivity was analyzed using
Jonscher's power law. The combination of these dielectric characteristics
suggests that these are good candidates for electrical energy storage device
applications.
