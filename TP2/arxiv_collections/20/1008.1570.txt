Using photometric data of infrared surveys, young stellar object (YSO) status
is verified for 141 objects selected in our previous papers in the Cassiopeia
and Camelopardalis segment of the Milky Way bounded by Galactic coordinates (l,
b) = (132--158 deg, p/m 12 deg). The area includes the known star-forming
regions in the emission nebulae W3, W4 and W5 and the massive YSO AFGL 490.
Spectral energy distribution (SED) curves between 700 nm and 160 microns,
constructed from the GSC2, 2MASS, IRAS, MSX, Spitzer and AKARI data, are used
to estimate the evolutionary stages of these stars. We confirm the YSO status
for most of the objects. If all of the investigated objects were YSOs, 45 % of
them should belong to Class I, 41 % to class II and 14 % to Class III. However,
SEDs of some of these objects can be affected by nearby extended infrared
sources, like compact H II regions, infrared clusters or dusty galaxies.
