We study the space of 2-frieze patterns generalizing that of the classical
Coxeter-Conway frieze patterns. The geometric realization of this space is the
space of n-gons (in the projective plane and in 3-dimensional vector space)
which is a close relative of the moduli space of genus 0 curves with n marked
points. We show that the space of 2-frieze patterns is a cluster manifold and
study its algebraic and arithmetic properties.
