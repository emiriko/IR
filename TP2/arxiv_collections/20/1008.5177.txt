After the prediction that strong enough optical activity may result in
negative refraction and negative reflection, more and more artificial chiral
metamaterials were designed and fabricated at difference frequency ranges from
microwaves to optical waves. Therefore, a simple and robust method to retrieve
the effective constitutive parameters for chiral metamaterials is urgently
needed. Here, we analyze the wave propagation in chiral metamaterials and
follow the regular retrieval procedure for ordinary metamaterials and apply it
in chiral metamaterial slabs. Then based on the transfer matrix technique, the
parameter retrieval is extended to treat samples with not only the substrate
but also the top layers. After the parameter retrieval procedure, we take two
examples to check our method and study how the substrate influences on the thin
chiral metamaterials slabs. We find that the substrate may cause the
homogeneous slab to be inhomogeneous, i.e. the reflections in forward and
backward directions are different. However, the chiral metamaterial where the
resonance element is embedded far away from the substrate is insensitive to the
substrate.
