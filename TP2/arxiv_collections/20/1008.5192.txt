With an eye on developing a quantum theory of gravity, many physicists have
recently searched for quantum challenges to the equivalence principle of
general relativity. However, as historians and philosophers of science are well
aware, the principle of equivalence is not so clear. When clarified, we think
quantum tests of the equivalence principle won't yield much. The problem is
that the clash/not-clash is either already evident or guaranteed not to exist.
Nonetheless, this work does help teach us what it means for a theory to be
geometric.
