Magnetic susceptibility results for single crystals of the new cubic
compounds UT$_2$Al$_{20}$ (T=Mn, V, and Mo) are reported. Magnetization,
specific heat, resistivity, and neutron diffraction results for a single
crystal and neutron diffraction and inelastic spectra for a powder sample are
reported for UMn$_2$Al$_{20}$. For T = V and Mo, temperature independent Pauli
paramagnetism is observed. For UMn$_2$Al$_{20}$, a ferromagnetic transition is
observed in the magnetic susceptibility at $T_c$ = 20 K. The specific heat
anomaly at $T_c$ is very weak while no anomaly in the resistivity is seen at
$T_c$. We discuss two possible origins for this behavior of UMn$_2$Al$_{20}$:
moderately small moment itinerant ferromagnetism, or induced local moment
ferromagnetism.
