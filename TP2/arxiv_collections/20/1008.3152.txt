Radio transients are sporadic signals and their detection requires that the
backends of radio telescopes be equipped with the appropriate hardware and
software to undertake this. Observational programs to detect transients can be
dedicated or they can piggy-back on observations made by other programs. It is
the single-dish single-transient (non-periodical) mode which is considered in
this paper. Because neither the width of a transient nor the time of its
arrival is known, a sequential analysis in the form of a cumulative sum (cusum)
algorithm is proposed here. Computer simulations and real observation data
processing are included to demonstrate the performance of the cusum. The use of
the Hough transform is here proposed for the purpose of non-coherent
de-dispersion. It is possible that the detected transients could be radio
frequency interferences (RFI) and a procedure is proposed here which can
distinguish between celestial signals and man-made RFI. This procedure is based
on an analysis of the statistical properties of the signals.
