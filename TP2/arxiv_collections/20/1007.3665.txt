We propose two schemes of a novel spin-optronic device, optical analog of
Datta and Das spin transistor for the electrons. The role of ferromagnetic
contacts is played by one-dimensional polariton channels with strong TE-TM
splitting. A symmetric 2D trap plays a role of the non-magnetic active region.
The rotation of the polarization of the pulse in this region can be achieved
either due to its interaction with a spatially confined polariton condensate
created resonantly by a circular polarized laser, either due to the splitting
between the two linear polarizations of the excitons, controlled electrically
by use of metallic gate.
