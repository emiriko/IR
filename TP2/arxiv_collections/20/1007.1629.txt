This article surveys the application of the representation theory of loop
groups to simple models in quantum field theory and to certain integrable
systems. The common thread in the discussion is the construction of quantum
fields using vertex operators. These examples include the construction and
solution of the Luttinger model and other 1+1 dimensional interacting quantum
field theories, the construction of anyon field operators on the circle, the
`2nd quantization' of the Calogero-Sutherland model using anyons and the
geometric construction of quantum fields on Riemann surfaces. We describe some
new results on the elliptic Calogero-Sutherland model.

accessible because it is a reference for us for subsequent work.)
