For nanoscale CMOS applications, strained-silicon devices have been receiving
considerable attention owing to their potential for achieving higher
performance and compatibility with conventional silicon processing. In this
work, an analytical model for the output current characteristics (I-V) of
nanoscale bulk strained-Si/SiGe MOSFETs, suitable for analog circuit
simulation, is developed. We demonstrate significant current enhancement due to
strain, even in short channel devices, attributed to the velocity overshoot
effect. The accuracy of the results obtained using our analytical model is
verified using two-dimensional device simulations.
