It has recently been pointed out that, under certain conditions, the energy
of particles accelerated by black holes in the center-of-mass frame can become
arbitrarily high. In this paper, we study the collision of two particles in the
case of four-dimensional charged nonrotating, extremal charged rotating and
near-extremal charged rotating Kaluza-Klein black holes as well as the naked
singularity case in Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory. We find that the
center-of-mass energy for a pair of colliding particles is unlimited at the
horizon of charged nonrotating Kaluza-Klein black holes, extremal charged
rotating Kaluza-Klein black holes and in the naked singularity case.
