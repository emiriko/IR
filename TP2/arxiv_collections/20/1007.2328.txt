A new L-band 7 feed array at the 100-m telescope is used to perform an
unbiased, fully sampled HI survey of the whole northern hemisphere - the
Effelsberg-Bonn HI Survey (EBHIS). The use of state-of-the-art digital Fast
Fourier Transform spectrometers based on FPGAs - superior in dynamic range and
allowing fast dumping of spectra - makes it possible to apply sophisticated RFI
mitigation schemes. Based on the current status of the survey we discuss the
RFI situation at the 100-m telescope and present a fast algorithm to
automatically identify RFI in the raw data output from the spectrometer. Using
simulations we show that it is feasible to detect more than 95% of all RFI in
excess of 1 sigma amplitude with less than 1% false positives.
