High-luminosity e+ e- colliders at the GeV scale (flavor factories) have been
recently recognized to be an ideal environment to search for a light weakly
coupled vector boson U (dark photon) emerging in several new physics models
able to interpret anomalous astrophysical observations in terms of dark matter.
At flavor factories a particularly clean channel is the production of the U
boson in association with a photon, followed by the decay of the U boson into
lepton pairs. Beyond the approximations addressed in previous works, we revisit
the reach potential of this channel by performing an exact lowest-order
calculation of the signal and background processes. We also include the effect
of initial and final state QED corrections neglected so far, to show how they
affect the distributions of experimental interest. We present new results for
the expected statistical significance to a dark photon signal at KLOE/KLOE-2
and future super-B factories. The calculation is implemented in a new release
of the event generator BabaYaga@NLO, which is available for full event
simulations and data analysis.
