Recently, the CDF and D{\O} collaborations have claimed that the CP violating
phase in $B_s^0-\bar{B}_s^0$ mixing is large, which is contrary to the
expectations in the Standard Model. Such a large phase suggests New Physics
contributions to $B_s^0-\bar{B}_s^0$ mixing. Motivated by this, we reevaluate
the constraints on R-parity violating contributions, including baryon number
violating couplings not considered before, to the mixing mass matrix element
$M^s_{12}$ from the recent measurements of $B_s^0-\bar{B}_s^0$ mixing. We show
that present data allow us to put quite strong constraints on both the
magnitudes and the weak phases of the R-parity violating parameters. Some of
these bounds are better than the exciting ones, and some bounds are obtained
for the first time. Near future experiments at the Tevatron, the LHC and
B-factories can shrink or reveal the relevant parameter spaces of R-parity
violating couplings.
