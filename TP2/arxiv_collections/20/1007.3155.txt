We show that the conformal blocks constructed in the previous article by the
first and the third author may be described as certain integrals in equivariant
cohomology. When the bundles of conformal blocks have rank one, this
construction may be compared with the old integral formulas of the second and
the third author. The proportionality coefficients are some Selberg type
integrals which are computed. Finally, a geometric construction of the tensor
products of vector representations of the Lie algebra $\frak{gl}(m)$ is
proposed.
