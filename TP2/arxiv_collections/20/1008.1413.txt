With modern data acquisition devices that work fast and very precise,
scientists often face the task of dealing with huge amounts of data. These need
to be rapidly processed and stored onto a hard disk. We present a LabVIEW
program which reliably streams analog time series of MHz sampling. Its run time
has virtually no limitation. We explicitly show how to use the program to
extract time series from two experiments: For a photodiode detection system
that tracks the position of an optically trapped particle and for a measurement
of ionic current through a glass capillary. The program is easy to use and
versatile as the input can be any type of analog signal. Also, the data
streaming software is simple, highly reliable, and can be easily customized to
include, e.g., real-time power spectral analysis and Allan variance noise
quantification.
