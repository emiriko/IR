We study a dynamical random network model in which at every construction step
a new vertex is introduced and attached to every existing vertex independently
with a probability proportional to a concave function f of its current degree.
We give a criterion for the existence of a giant component, which is both
necessary and sufficient, and which becomes explicit when f is linear.
Otherwise it allows the derivation of explicit necessary and sufficient
conditions, which are often fairly close. We give an explicit criterion to
decide whether the giant component is robust under random removal of edges. We
also determine asymptotically the size of the giant component and the empirical
distribution of component sizes in terms of the survival probability and size
distribution of a multitype branching random walk associated with f.
