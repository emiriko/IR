In this paper we explore the use of Answer Set Programming (ASP) to
formalize, and reason about, psychological knowledge. In the field of
psychology, a considerable amount of knowledge is still expressed using only
natural language. This lack of a formalization complicates accurate studies,
comparisons, and verification of theories. We believe that ASP, a knowledge
representation formalism allowing for concise and simple representation of
defaults, uncertainty, and evolving domains, can be used successfully for the
formalization of psychological knowledge. To demonstrate the viability of ASP
for this task, in this paper we develop an ASP-based formalization of the
mechanics of Short-Term Memory. We also show that our approach can have rather
immediate practical uses by demonstrating an application of our formalization
to the task of predicting a user's interaction with a graphical interface.
