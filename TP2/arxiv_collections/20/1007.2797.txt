We consider the head-on collision of equal-mass neutron stars boosted towards
each other and we study the behavior of such systems near the threshold of
black-hole formation. In particular, we confirm the previous findings by [1]
that a type-I critical phenomenon can be observed by fine-tuning the initial
mass of the two neutron stars. At the same time, we argue against the
interpretation that the critical solution is not a perturbed spherical star and
show instead that the metastable star corresponds to a (perturbed) equilibrium
solution on the unstable branch of the equilibrium configurations. As a result,
the head-on collision of two neutron stars near the critical threshold can be
seen as a transition in the space of configurations from an initial stable
solution over to a critical metastable one which can either migrate to a stable
solution or collapse to a black hole. The critical exponent for this process
shows a fine structure which was already observed in the case of the critical
collapse of scalar fields but never before for perfect fluids.
