The all sky surveys done by the Palomar Observatory Schmidt, the European
Southern Observatory Schmidt, and the United Kingdom Schmidt, the InfraRed
Astronomical Satellite and the 2 Micron All Sky Survey have proven to be
extremely useful tools for astronomy with value that lasts for decades. The
Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer is mapping the whole sky following its
launch on 14 December 2009. WISE began surveying the sky on 14 Jan 2010 and
completed its first full coverage of the sky on July 17. The survey will
continue to cover the sky a second time until the cryogen is exhausted
(anticipated in November 2010). WISE is achieving 5 sigma point source
sensitivities better than 0.08, 0.11, 1 and 6 mJy in unconfused regions on the
ecliptic in bands centered at wavelengths of 3.4, 4.6, 12 and 22 microns.
Sensitivity improves toward the ecliptic poles due to denser coverage and lower
zodiacal background. The angular resolution is 6.1, 6.4, 6.5 and 12.0
arc-seconds at 3.4, 4.6, 12 and 22 microns, and the astrometric precision for
high SNR sources is better than 0.15 arc-seconds.
