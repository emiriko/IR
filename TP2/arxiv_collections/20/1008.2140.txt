We discuss the suitability of holographically generated optical potentials
for the investigation of superfluidity in ultracold atoms. By using a spatial
light modulator and a feedback enabled algorithm we generate a smooth ring with
variable bright regions that can be dynamically rotated to stir ultracold atoms
and induce superflow. We also comment on its future integration into a cold
atoms experiment.
