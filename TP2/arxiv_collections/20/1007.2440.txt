At the ILC machine induced backgrounds, mainly electron-positron pairs from
beamstrahlung, will be the most important source of unwanted interactions.
Methods of generating, simulating and imposing pair-background on physics
events are presented and influence of this background on ILD reconstruction is
reviewed. Effects of the background on various ILD detectors are shown for
nominal beam parameters and for SB09 reduced beam parameter set and an example
of a physics analysis performed with overlayed pair background is given.
