A MATLAB program has been developed for simulation of polymer blend
self-assembly with nano-scaled features. The Cahn-Hilliard equation is
implemented to calculate the free energy profile of the polymer blends. The
Flory-Huggins type of energy is used to estimate the local free energy. The
program is capable of quantitatively simulate the phase separation of polymer
blends. The effects such as the substrate functionalization, solvent
evaporation, and polymer materials properties are included in the program. The
program can estimate the model parameters from the real experimental processing
parameters and the material properties. The simulation results can be evaluated
quantitatively and compared with the experimental results with analysis tools
included in the program.
