We report on observations of a luminous supersoft X-ray source (SSS) in M31,
r1-25, that has exhibited spectral changes to harder X-ray states. We document
these spectral changes. In addition, we show that they have important
implications for modeling the source. Quasisoft states in a source that has
been observed as an SSS represent a newly- discovered phenomenon. We show how
such state changers could prove to be examples of unusual black hole or neutron
star accretors. Future observations of this and other state changers can
provide the information needed to determine the nature(s) of these intriguing
new sources.
