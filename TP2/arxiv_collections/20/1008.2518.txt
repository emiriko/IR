In this paper, we investigate global dynamics for a system of delay
differential equations which describes a virus-immune interaction in
\textit{vivo}. The model has two distributed time delays describing time needed
for infection of cell and virus replication. Our model admits three possible
equilibria, an uninfected equilibrium and infected equilibrium with or without
immune response depending on the basic reproduction number for viral infection
$R_{0}$ and for CTL response $R_{1}$ such that $R_{1}<R_{0}$. It is shown that
there always exists one equilibrium which is globally asymptotically stable by
employing the method of Lyapunov functional. More specifically, the uninfected
equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable if $R_{0}\leq1$, an infected
equilibrium without immune response is globally asymptotically stable if
$R_{1}\leq1<R_{0}$ and an infected equilibrium with immune response is globally
asymptotically stable if $R_{1}>1$. The immune activation has a positive role
in the reduction of the infection cells and the increasing of the uninfected
cells if $R_{1}>1$.
