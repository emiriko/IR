In this paper, we present an interference model for cognitive radio (CR)
networks employing power control, contention control or hybrid power/contention
control schemes. For the first case, a power control scheme is proposed to
govern the transmission power of a CR node. For the second one, a contention
control scheme at the media access control (MAC) layer, based on carrier sense
multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA), is proposed to coordinate
the operation of CR nodes with transmission requests. The probability density
functions of the interference received at a primary receiver from a CR network
are first derived numerically for these two cases. For the hybrid case, where
power and contention controls are jointly adopted by a CR node to govern its
transmission, the interference is analyzed and compared with that of the first
two schemes by simulations. Then, the interference distributions under the
first two control schemes are fitted by log-normal distributions with greatly
reduced complexity. Moreover, the effect of a hidden primary receiver on the
interference experienced at the receiver is investigated. It is demonstrated
that both power and contention controls are effective approaches to alleviate
the interference caused by CR networks. Some in-depth analysis of the impact of
key parameters on the interference of CR networks is given via numerical
studies as well.
