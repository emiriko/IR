Examples are presented of how the geometric notion of the mean curvature is
used for general magnetic field configurations and magnetic surfaces. It is
shown that the mean magnetic curvature is related to the variation of the
absolute value of the magnetic field along its lines. Magnetic surfaces of
constant mean curvature are optimum for plasma confinement in multimirror open
confinement systems and rippled tori.
