We investigate the electromagnetic form factors of the Delta and the Omega
baryons within the Poincare-covariant framework of Dyson-Schwinger and
Bethe-Salpeter equations. The three-quark core contributions of the form
factors are evaluated by employing a quark-diquark approximation. We use a
consistent setup for the quark-gluon dressing, the quark-quark bound-state
kernel and the quark-photon interaction. Our predictions for the multipole form
factors are compatible with available experimental data and quark-model
estimates. The current-quark mass evolution of the static electromagnetic
properties agrees with results provided by lattice calculations.
