The interaction between two parts in a compound quantum system may be
reconsidered more completely than before and some new understandings and
conclusions different from current quantum mechanics are obtained, including
the conservation law in the evolution in an isolated quantum system, new
understandings of duality of particle and wave and the superposition principle
of states, three laws corresponding to Newton's laws, new understandings of
measurement and the uncertainty relation, arguments against the non-locality of
any entangled state and a simple criterion of coherence which is obtained for
the experimenter to examine the correctness of the non-locality. These may make
quantum mechanics be easily understood intuitively and some strange properties
will not appear.
