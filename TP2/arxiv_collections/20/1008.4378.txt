We are concerned with the problem of the decay of a tangle of quantized
vortices in He II generated by a heat current. Direct application of Vinen's
equation yields the temporal scaling of vortex line density $L \sim t^{-1}$.
Schwarz and Rozen [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 66}, 1898 (1991); Phys. Rev. B {\bf
44}, 7563 (1991)] observed a faster decay followed by a slower decay. More
recently, Skrbek and collaborators [Phys. Rev. E {\bf 67}, 047302 (2003)] found
an initial transient followed by the same classical $t^{-3/2}$ scaling observed
in the decay of grid-generated turbulence. We present a simple theoretical
model which, we argue, contains the essential physical ingredients, and
accounts for these apparently contradictory results.
