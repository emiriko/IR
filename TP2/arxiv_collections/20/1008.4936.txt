[JDEM-Omega is one of the three concepts that contributed to the Wide-Field
Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) mission advocated by the Astro2010 Decadal
Survey. It is the concept on which the recommended observatory configuration is
based.] The Joint Dark Energy Mission (JDEM) is a space-based observatory
designed to perform precision measurements of the nature of dark energy in the
Universe. It will make an order of magnitude progress in measuring the equation
of state parameters of the Universe of most importance for understanding dark
energy. JDEM-Omega is a wide-field space telescope operating in the near
infrared. Dark energy measurements will be made via large surveys of galaxies
and supernova monitoring. These will be an order of magnitude larger surveys
than currently available and will provide enormous catalogs of astrophysical
objects for many communities ranging from solar system to galaxy to
galaxies/clusters to cosmology. JDEM-Omega is a mission concept collaboratively
developed by NASA and the Department of Energy, with substantial input from the
JDEM Science Coordination Group and community at large.
