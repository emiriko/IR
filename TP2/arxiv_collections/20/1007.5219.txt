This document reviews the physics program of the KLOE-2 detector at
DA$\Phi$NE upgraded in energy and provides a simple solution to run the
collider above the $\phi$-peak (up to 2, possibly 2.5 GeV). It is shown how a
precise measurement of the multihadronic cross section in the energy region up
to 2 (possibly 2.5) GeV would have a major impact on the tests of the Standard
Model through a precise determination of the anomalous magnetic moment of the
muon and the effective fine-structure constant at the $M_Z$ scale. With a
luminosity of about $10^{32}$cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$, DA$\Phi$NE upgraded in energy
can perform a scan in the region from 1 to 2.5 GeV in one year by collecting an
integrated luminosity of 20 pb$^{-1}$ (corresponding to a few days of data
taking) for single point, assuming an energy step of 25 MeV. A few years of
data taking in this region would provide important tests of QCD and effective
theories by $\gamma\gamma$ physics with open thresholds for pseudo-scalar (like
the $\eta'$), scalar ($f_0,f'_0$, etc...) and axial-vector ($a_1$, etc...)
mesons; vector-mesons spectroscopy and baryon form factors; tests of CVC and
searches for exotics. In the final part of the document a technical solution
for the energy upgrade of DA$\Phi$NE is proposed.
