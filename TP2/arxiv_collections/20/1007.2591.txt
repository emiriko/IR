A forthcoming challenge in ultracold lattice gases is the simulation of
quantum magnetism. That involves both the preparation of the lattice atomic gas
in the desired spin state and the probing of the state. Here we demonstrate how
a probing scheme based on atom-light interfaces gives access to the order
parameters of nontrivial quantum magnetic phases, allowing us to characterize
univocally strongly correlated magnetic systems produced in ultracold gases.
This method, which is also nondemolishing, yields spatially resolved spin
correlations and can be applied to bosons or fermions. As a proof of principle,
we apply this method to detect the complete phase diagram displayed by a chain
of (rotationally invariant) spin-1 bosons.
