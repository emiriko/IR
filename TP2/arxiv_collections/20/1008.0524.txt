Motivated by recent work of Choquet-Bruhat, Chrusciel, and Martin-Garcia, we
prove monotonicity properties and comparison results for the area of slices of
the null cone of a point in a Lorentzian manifold. We also prove volume
comparison results for subsets of the null cone analogous to the Bishop-Gromov
relative volume monotonicity theorem and Guenther's volume comparison theorem.
We briefly discuss how these estimates may be used to control the null second
fundamental form of slices of the null cone in Ricci-flat Lorentzian
four-manifolds with null curvature bounded above.
