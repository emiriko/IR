Do cell phones, household electrical power wiring or appliance, or high
voltage power lines cause cancer? Fuggedaboudit! No way! When pigs fly! When
I'm the Pope! Don't text while you're driving, however, or eat your cell phone.
  All organisms absorb microwave radiation directly as thermal energy. In
living organisms, the organisms' thermal control systems, including the blood
flow, and various cooling mechanisms, such as sweating in humans, that work to
maintain a stable body temperature rapidly transfer the absorbed energy to the
environment. Any temperature rise is small or even unobserved. Any proposed
mechanism by which cell phone radiation might cause cancer must begin with this
fact. But the amount of radiation absorbed from a cell phone is less than that
produced by normal metabolic processes, and much less than that produced by,
for example, exercise. None of these normal metabolic processes cause cancer.
Therefore, the much smaller amounts of energy from cell phones doesn't cause
cancer either. All forms of electromagnetic energy that are known carcinogens
are ionizing; ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays. Microwave radiation cannot
ionize any physiological molecule. In fact, microwave radiation cannot directly
break or modify any chemical bond, covalent or weak. Therefore, microwaves
cannot initiate any process leading to cancer, unless it does so through
thermal mechanisms. All chemical bonds that act in physiological processes must
operate correctly in the thermal environment of the cells at body temperature.
All of them have bond energy that is greater than that arising from the thermal
jostling, vibrating, and rotating of the cytoplasm. Energy added by microwave
radiation is more than a thousand times weaker than that present in the normal
thermal jiggling. Since the normal thermal environment does not cause cancer,
neither does any absorbed microwave radiation.
