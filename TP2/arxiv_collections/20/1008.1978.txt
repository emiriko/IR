Let $r \ge 2$ be an integer and let $A$ be a finite, nonempty set of nonzero
integers. We will obtain a lower bound for the number of squarefree integers
$n$, up to $x$, for which the products $\prod_{p \mid n} (p+a)$ (over primes
$p$) are perfect $r$th powers for all $a \in A$. Also, in the cases $A =
\{-1\}$ and $A = \{+1\}$, we will obtain a lower bound for the number of such
$n$ with exactly $r$ distinct prime factors.
