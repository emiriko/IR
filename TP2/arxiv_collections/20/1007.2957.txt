Measurements and calculations of magnetotransport in the molecular organic
conductor (DMET)2I3 detect and simulate all known angular magnetoresistance
oscillation (AMRO) phenomena for quasi-one dimensional (Q1D) systems. Employing
the true triclinic crystal structure in the calculations, these results address
the mystery of the putative vanishing of the primary AMRO phenomenon, the Lebed
magic angle effect, for orientations in which it was expected to be strongest.
They also show a common origin for Lebed and so-called "LN" oscillations, and
confirm the generalized nature of AMRO in Q1D systems.
