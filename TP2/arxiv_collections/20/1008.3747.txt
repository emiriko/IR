We present magnetic-torque measurements of the organic superconductor
k-(BEDT-TTF)2Cu(NCS)2 for in-plane magnetic fields up to 32 T. In this layered
two-dimensional compound the superconductivity can persist even in fields above
the Pauli limit of about 21 T. There, a pronounced upturn of the
upper-critical-field line occurs and the superconducting phase-transition line
splits and forms an additional high magnetic field phase. k-(BEDT-TTF)2Cu(NCS)2
is a spin-singlet superconductor, therefore, such a superconducting high-field
phase beyond the Pauli limit can originate only from Cooper pairing with finite
center-of-mass momentum. The measurements are discussed in connection with a
Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state, in accordance with earlier
specific-heat observations. The torque experiments allow us to investigate the
high magnetic-field phase diagram and the FFLO state of k-(BEDT-TTF)2Cu(NCS)2
in great detail.
