A debris ring around the star HD 207129 (G0V; d = 16.0 pc) has been imaged in
scattered visible light with the ACS coronagraph on the Hubble Space Telescope
and in thermal emission using MIPS on the Spitzer Space Telescope at 70 microns
(resolved) and 160 microns (unresolved). Spitzer IRS (7-35 microns) and MIPS
(55-90 microns) spectrographs measured disk emission at >28 microns. In the HST
image the disk appears as a ~30 AU wide ring with a mean radius of ~163 AU and
is inclined by 60 degrees from pole-on. At 70 microns it appears partially
resolved and is elongated in the same direction and with nearly the same size
as seen with HST in scattered light. At 0.6 microns the ring shows no
significant brightness asymmetry, implying little or no forward scattering by
its constituent dust. With a mean surface brightness of V=23.7 mag per square
arcsec, it is the faintest disk imaged to date in scattered light.
