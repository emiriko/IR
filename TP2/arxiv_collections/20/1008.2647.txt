This note concerns a search for publications in which the pragmatic concept
of a test as conducted in the practice of software testing is formalized, a
theory about software testing based on such a formalization is presented or it
is demonstrated on the basis of such a theory that there are solid grounds to
test software in cases where in principle other forms of analysis could be
used. This note reports on the way in which the search has been carried out and
the main outcomes of the search. The message of the note is that the
fundamentals of software testing are not yet complete in some respects.
