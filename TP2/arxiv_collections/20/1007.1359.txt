We study the initial value problem for the BBM equation:
$$\left\{\begin{array}{l} u_t+u_x+uu_x-u_{txx}=0 \qquad x\in \T, t \in \R
u(0,x)=u_0(x) \end{array} \right. .$$ We prove that the BBM equation is globaly
well-posed on $H^s(\T)$ for $s\geq0$ and a symplectic non-squeezing theorem on
$H^{1/2}(\T)$. That is to say the flow-map $u_0 \mapsto u(t)$ that associates
to initial data $u_0 \in H^{1/2}(\T)$ the solution $u$ cannot send a ball into
a symplectic cylinder of smaller width.
