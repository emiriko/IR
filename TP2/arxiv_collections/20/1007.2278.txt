We study the double-exchange model at half-filling with competing
superexchange interactions on a triangular lattice, combining exact
diagonalization and Monte-Carlo methods. We find that in between the expected
itinerant ferromagnetic and $120^{\circ}$ Yafet-Kittel phases a robust
scalar-chiral, insulating spin state emerges. At finite temperatures the
ferromagnet - scalar-chiral quantum critical point is characterized by
anomalous bad-metal behavior in charge transport as observed in frustrated
itinerant magnets R$_2$Mo$_{2}$O$_7$.
