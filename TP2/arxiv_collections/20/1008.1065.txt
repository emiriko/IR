We prove that there exists a class of crystalline insulators, which we call
"fragile Mott insulators" which are not adiabatically connected to any sort of
band insulator provided time-reversal and certain point-group symmetries are
respected, but which are otherwise unspectacular in that they exhibit no
topological order nor any form of fractionalized quasiparticles. Different
fragile Mott insulators are characterized by different nontrivial
one-dimensional representations of the crystal point group. We illustrate this
new type of insulators with two examples: the d-Mott insulator discovered in
the checkerboard Hubbard model at half-filling and the
Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki insulator on the square lattice.
