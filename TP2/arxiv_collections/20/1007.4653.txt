We consider non-local transport in a system with one superconducting and two
normal metal terminals. Electron focusing by weak perpendicular magnetic fields
is shown to tune the ratio between crossed Andreev reflection (CAR) and
electron transfer (ET) in the non-local current response. Additionally,
electron focusing facilitates non-local signals between normal metal contacts
where the separation is as large as the mean free path rather than being
limited by the coherence length of the superconductor. CAR and ET can be
selectively enhanced by modulating the magnetic field.
