Contemporary relativity theory is restricted in two points: (1) a use of the
Riemannian space-time geometry and (2) a use of inadequate (nonrelativistic)
concepts. Reasons of these restrictions are analysed in [1]. Eliminating these
restrictions the relativity theory is generalized on the case of non-Riemannian
(nonaxiomatizable) space-time geometry. Taking into account a progress of a
geometry and introducing adequate relativistic concepts, the elementary
particle dynamics is generalized on the case of arbitrary space-time geometry.
A use of adequate relativistic concepts admits one to formulate the simple
demonstrable dynamics of particles.
