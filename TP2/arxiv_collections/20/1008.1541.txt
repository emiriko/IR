SuperB is a high luminosity e+e- collider that will be able to indirectly
probe new physics at energy scales far beyond the reach of any man made
accelerator planned or in existence. Just as detailed understanding of the
Standard Model of particle physics was developed from stringent constraints
imposed by flavour changing processes between quarks, the detailed structure of
any new physics is severely constrained by flavour processes. In order to
elucidate this structure it is necessary to perform a number of complementary
studies of a set of golden channels. With these measurements in hand, the
pattern of deviations from the Standard Model behavior can be used as a test of
the structure of new physics. If new physics is found at the LHC, then the many
golden measurements from SuperB will help decode the subtle nature of the new
physics. However if no new particles are found at the LHC, SuperB will be able
to search for new physics at energy scales up to 10-100 TeV. In either
scenario, flavour physics measurements that can be made at SuperB play a
pivotal role in understanding the nature of physics beyond the Standard Model.
Examples for using the interplay between measurements to discriminate New
Physics models are discussed in this document. SuperB is a Super Flavour
Factory, in addition to studying large samples of B_{u,d,s}, D and tau decays,
SuperB has a broad physics programme that includes spectroscopy both in terms
of the Standard Model and exotica, and precision measurements of sin^2theta_W.
In addition to performing CP violation measurements at the Y(4S) and phi(3770),
SuperB will test CPT in these systems, and lepton universality in a number of
different processes. The multitude of rare decay measurements possible at
SuperB can be used to constrain scenarios of physics beyond the Standard Model.
