Eta Carinae is the colliding wind binary with the largest mass loss rate in
our Galaxy and the only one in which hard X-ray emission has been detected. Eta
Carinae is therefore a primary candidate to search for particle acceleration by
probing its gamma-ray emission. We used the first 21 months of Fermi/LAT data
to extract gamma-ray (0.2-100 GeV) images, spectra and light-curves, then
combined them with multi-wavelength observations to model the non-thermal
spectral energy distribution. A bright gamma-ray source is detected at the
position of eta Carinae. Its flux at a few 100 MeV corresponds very well to the
extrapolation of the hard X-ray spectrum towards higher energies. The spectral
energy distribution features two distinct components. The first one extends
over the keV to GeV energy range, and features an exponential cutoff at ~ 1
GeV. It can be understood as inverse Compton scattering of ultraviolet photons
by electrons accelerated up to gamma~1E4 in the colliding wind region. The
expected synchrotron emission is compatible with the existing upper limit on
the non-thermal radio emission. The second component is a hard gamma-ray tail
detected above 20 GeV. It could be explained by pi0-decay of accelerated
hadrons interacting with the dense stellar wind. The ratio between the fluxes
of the pi0 and inverse Compton components is roughly as predicted by
simulations of colliding wind binaries. This hard gamma-ray tail can only be
understood if emitted close to the wind collision region. The energy
transferred to the accelerated particles (~5% of the collision mechanical
energy) is comparable to that of the thermal X-ray emission. We have measured
the electron spectrum responsible for the keV to GeV emission and detected an
evidence of hadronic acceleration in eta Carinae. These observations are thus
in good agreement with the colliding wind scenario suggested for eta Carinae.
