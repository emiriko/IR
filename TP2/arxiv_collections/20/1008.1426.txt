We consider the homogeneous components U_r of the map on R = k[x,y,z]/(x^A,
y^B, z^C) that multiplies by x + y + z. We prove a relationship between the
Smith normal forms of submatrices of an arbitrary Toeplitz matrix using Schur
polynomials, and use this to give a relationship between Smith normal form
entries of U_r. We also give a bijective proof of an identity proven by J. Li
and F. Zanello equating the determinant of the middle homogeneous component U_r
when (A, B, C) = (a + b, a + c, b + c) to the number of plane partitions in an
a by b by c box. Finally, we prove that, for certain vector subspaces of R,
similar identities hold relating determinants to symmetry classes of plane
partitions, in particular classes 3, 6, and 8.
