We propose a direct gauge mediation model based on an uplifted metastable
SUSY breaking coupled to supergravity. A constant superpotential plays an
essential role to fix the moduli as well as breaking SUSY and R-symmetry and
the cancellation of the cosmological constant. Gaugino masses are generated at
leading order of SUSY breaking scale, and comparable to the sfermion masses as
in the ordinary gauge mediation. Landau pole problem for QCD coupling can be
easily solved since more than half of messengers become superheavy, which are
heavier than the GUT scale.
