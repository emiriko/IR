Measuring the spin of Accreting Neutron Stars is important because it can
provide constraints on the Equation of State of ultra-dense matter.
Particularly crucial to our physical understanding is the discovery of
sub-millisecond pulsars, because this will immediately rule out many proposed
models for the ground state of dense matter. So far, it has been impossible to
accomplish this because, for still unknown reasons, only a small amount of
Accreting Neutron Stars exhibit coherent pulsations. An intriguing explanation
for the lack of pulsations is that they form only on neutron stars accreting
with a very low average mass accretion rate. I have searched pulsations in the
faintest persistent X-ray source known to date and I found no evidence for
pulsations. The implications for accretion theory are very stringent, clearly
showing that our understanding of the pulse formation process is not complete.
I discuss which sources are optimal to continue the search of sub-ms pulsars
and which are the new constraints that theoretical models need to explain to
provide a complete description of these systems
