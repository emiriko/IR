We developed a low-cost, high-throughput microbiome profiling method that
uses combinatorial sequence tags attached to PCR primers that amplify the rRNA
V6 region. Amplified PCR products are sequenced using an Illumina paired-end
protocol to generate millions of overlapping reads. Combinatorial sequence
tagging can be used to examine hundreds of samples with far fewer primers than
is required when sequence tags are incorporated at only a single end. The
number of reads generated permitted saturating or near-saturating analysis of
samples of the vaginal microbiome. The large number of reads al- lowed an
in-depth analysis of errors, and we found that PCR-induced errors composed the
vast majority of non-organism derived species variants, an ob- servation that
has significant implications for sequence clustering of similar high-throughput
data. We show that the short reads are sufficient to assign organisms to the
genus or species level in most cases. We suggest that this method will be
useful for the deep sequencing of any short nucleotide region that is
taxonomically informative; these include the V3, V5 regions of the bac- terial
16S rRNA genes and the eukaryotic V9 region that is gaining popularity for
sampling protist diversity.
