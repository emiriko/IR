Though the classical treatment of spontaneous decay leads to an exponential
decay law, it is well known that this is an approximation of the quantum
mechanical result which is a non-exponential at very small and large times for
narrow states. The non exponential nature at large times is however hard to
establish from experiments. A method to recover the time evolution of unstable
states from a parametrization of the amplitude fitted to data is presented. We
apply the method to a realistic example of a very broad state, the sigma meson
and reveal that an exponential decay is not a valid approximation at any time
for this state. This example derived from experiment, shows the unique nature
of broad resonances.
