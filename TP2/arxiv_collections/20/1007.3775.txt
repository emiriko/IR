Vector analyzing power for the proton-6He elastic scattering at 71
MeV/nucleon has been measured for the first time, with a newly developed
polarized proton solid target working at low magnetic field of 0.09 T. The
results are found to be incompatible with a t-matrix folding model prediction.
Comparisons of the data with g-matrix folding analyses clearly show that the
vector analyzing power is sensitive to the nuclear structure model used in the
reaction analysis. The alpha-core distribution in 6He is suggested to be a
possible key to understand the nuclear structure sensitivity.
