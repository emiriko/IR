Top-$k$ queries allow end-users to focus on the most important (top-$k$)
answers amongst those which satisfy the query. In traditional databases, a user
defined score function assigns a score value to each tuple and a top-$k$ query
returns $k$ tuples with the highest score. In uncertain database, top-$k$
answer depends not only on the scores but also on the membership probabilities
of tuples. Several top-$k$ definitions covering different aspects of
score-probability interplay have been proposed in recent
past~\cite{R10,R4,R2,R8}. Most of the existing work in this research field is
focused on developing efficient algorithms for answering top-$k$ queries on
static uncertain data. Any change (insertion, deletion of a tuple or change in
membership probability, score of a tuple) in underlying data forces
re-computation of query answers. Such re-computations are not practical
considering the dynamic nature of data in many applications. In this paper, we
propose a fully dynamic data structure that uses ranking function
$PRF^e(\alpha)$ proposed by Li et al.~\cite{R8} under the generally adopted
model of $x$-relations~\cite{R11}. $PRF^e$ can effectively approximate various
other top-$k$ definitions on uncertain data based on the value of parameter
$\alpha$. An $x$-relation consists of a number of $x$-tuples, where $x$-tuple
is a set of mutually exclusive tuples (up to a constant number) called
alternatives. Each $x$-tuple in a relation randomly instantiates into one tuple
from its alternatives. For an uncertain relation with $N$ tuples, our structure
can answer top-$k$ queries in $O(k\log N)$ time, handles an update in $O(\log
N)$ time and takes $O(N)$ space. Finally, we evaluate practical efficiency of
our structure on both synthetic and real data.
