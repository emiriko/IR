We analyse the results of a 5.5-yr photometric campaign that monitored 247
southern, semi-regular variables with relatively precise Hipparcos parallaxes
to demonstrate an unambiguous detection of Red Giant Branch (RGB) pulsations in
the solar neighbourhood. We show that Sequence A' contains a mixture of AGB and
RGB stars, as indicated by a temperature related shift at the TRGB. Large
Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and Galactic sequences are compared in several ways to
show that the P-L sequence zero-points have a negligible metallicity
dependence. We describe a new method to determine absolute magnitudes from
pulsation periods and calibrate the LMC distance modulus using Hipparcos
parallaxes to find \mu (LMC) = 18.54 +- 0.03 mag. Several sources of systematic
error are discussed to explain discrepancies between the MACHO and OGLE
sequences in the LMC. We derive a relative distance modulus of the Small
Magellanic Cloud (SMC) relative to the LMC of \Delta \mu = 0.41 +- 0.02 mag. A
comparison of other pulsation properties, including period-amplitude and
luminosity-amplitude relations, confirms that RGB pulsation properties are
consistent and universal, indicating that the RGB sequences are suitable as
high-precision distance indicators. The M giants with the shortest periods
bridge the gap between G and K giant solar-like oscillations and M-giant
pulsation, revealing a smooth continuity as we ascend the giant branch.
