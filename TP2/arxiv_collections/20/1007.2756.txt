Different observers do not have to agree on how they identify a quantum
system. We explore a condition based on algorithmic complexity that allows a
system to be described as an objective "element of reality". We also suggest an
experimental test of the hypothesis that any system, even much smaller than a
human being, can be a quantum mechanical observer.
