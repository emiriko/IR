We present expressions in terms of a double infinite series for the Stieltjes
constants $\gamma_k(a)$. These constants appear in the regular part of the
Laurent expansion for the Hurwitz zeta function. We show that the case
$\gamma_k(1)=\gamma$ corresponds to a series representation for the Riemann
zeta function given much earlier by Brun. As a byproduct, we obtain a
parameterized double series representation of the Hurwitz zeta function.
