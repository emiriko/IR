If a Z' gauge boson of a gauged L_mu - L_tau symmetry is very light, it is
associated with a long-range leptonic force. In this case the particles in the
Sun create via mixing of Z' with the Standard Model Z a flavor-dependent
potential for muon neutrinos in terrestrial long-baseline experiments. The
potential changes sign for anti-neutrinos and hence can lead to apparent
differences in neutrino and anti-neutrino oscillations without introducing CP
or CPT violation. This could for instance explain the recently found
discrepancy in the survival probabilities of muon neutrinos and anti-neutrinos
in the MINOS experiment. We obtain the associated parameters of gauged L_mu -
L_tau required to explain this anomaly. The consequences for future
long-baseline experiments and for the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon are
discussed. The main feature of our explanation is that atmospheric neutrino
mixing has to be non-maximal. Neutrino masses tend to be quasi-degenerate.
