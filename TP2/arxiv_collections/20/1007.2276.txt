Transparent glasses in the system 3BaO-3TiO2-B2O3 (BTBO) were fabricated via
the conventional melt-quenching technique. The as-quenched samples were
confirmed to be glassy by differential thermal analysis (DTA) technique. The
thermal parameters were evaluated using non-isothermal DTA experiments.
Kauzmann temperature was found to be 759 K based on heating rate dependent
glass transition and crystallization temperatures. Theoretical relation for
temperature dependent viscosity was proposed for these glasses and
glass-ceramics.
