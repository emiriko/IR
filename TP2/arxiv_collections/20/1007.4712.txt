We consider semilinear evolution equations for which the linear part is
normal and generates a strongly continuous semigroup and the nonlinear part is
sufficiently smooth on a scale of Hilbert spaces. We approximate their semiflow
by an implicit, A-stable Runge--Kutta discretization in time and a spectral
Galerkin truncation in space. We show regularity of the Galerkin-truncated
semiflow and its time-discretization on open sets of initial values with bounds
that are uniform in the spatial resolution and the initial value. We also prove
convergence of the space-time discretization without any condition that couples
the time step to the spatial resolution. Then we estimate the Galerkin
truncation error for the semiflow of the evolution equation, its Runge--Kutta
discretization, and their respective derivatives, showing how the order of the
Galerkin truncation error depends on the smoothness of the initial data. Our
results apply, in particular, to the semilinear wave equation and to the
nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation.
