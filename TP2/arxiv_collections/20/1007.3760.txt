Most three dimensional constitutive relations that have been developed to
describe the behavior of bodies are correlated against one dimensional and two
dimensional experiments. What is usually lost sight of is the fact that
infinity of such three dimensional models may be able to explain these
experiments that are lower dimensional. Recently, the notion of maximization of
the rate of entropy production has been used to obtain constitutive relations
based on the choice of the stored energy and rate of entropy production, etc.
In this paper we show different choices for the manner in which the body stores
energy and dissipates energy and satisfies the requirement of maximization of
the rate of entropy production that leads to many three dimensional models. All
of these models, in one dimension, reduce to the model proposed by Burgers to
describe the viscoelastic behavior of bodies.
