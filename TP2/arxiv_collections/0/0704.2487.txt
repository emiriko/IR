We study the interplay of Klein tunneling (= interband tunneling) between
n-doped and p-doped regions in graphene and Andreev reflection (= electron-hole
conversion) at a superconducting electrode. The tunneling conductance of an
n-p-n junction initially increases upon lowering the temperature, while the
coherence time of the electron-hole pairs is still less than their lifetime,
but then drops back again when the coherence time exceeds the lifetime. This
reentrance effect, known from diffusive conductors and ballistic quantum dots,
provides a method to detect phase coherent Klein tunneling of electron-hole
pairs.
