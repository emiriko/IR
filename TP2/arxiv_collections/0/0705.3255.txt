We consider a generalization of the one-dimensional t-J model with
anisotropic spin-spin interactions. We show that the anisotropy leads to an
effective attractive interaction between the spinon and holon excitations,
resulting in a localized bound state. Detailed quantitative analytic
predictions for the dependence of the binding energy on the anisotropy are
presented, and verified by precise numerical simulations. The binding energy is
found to interpolate smoothly between a finite value in the t-Jz limit and zero
in the isotropic limit, going to zero exponentially in the vicinity of the
latter. We identify changes in spinon dispersion as the primary factor for this
non-trivial behavior.
