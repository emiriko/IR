We propose that cosmological magnetic fields generated in regions of finite
spatial dimensions may manifest themselves in the global dynamics of the
Universe as `dark energy'. We test our model in the context of spatially flat
cosmological models by assuming that the Universe contains non-relativistic
matter $\rho_m\propto \alpha^{-3}$, dark energy $\rho_{Q}\propto
\alpha^{-3(1+w)}$, and an extra fluid with $\rho_{B} \propto \alpha^{n-3}$ that
corresponds to the magnetic field. We place constraints on the main
cosmological parameters of our model by combining the recent supernovae type Ia
data and the differential ages of passively evolving galaxies. In particular,
we find that the model which best reproduces the observational data when
$\Omega_m=0.26$ is one with $\Omega_{B}\simeq 0.03$, $n\simeq 7.68$,
$\Omega_{Q}\simeq 0.71$ and $w\simeq -0.8$.
