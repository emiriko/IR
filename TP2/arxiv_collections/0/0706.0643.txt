We present a model for diffusion in a molecularly crowded environment. The
model consists of random barriers in percolation network. Random walks in the
presence of slowly moving barriers show normal diffusion for long times, but
anomalous diffusion at intermediate times. The effective exponents for square
distance versus time usually are below one at these intermediate times, but can
be also larger than one for high barrier concentrations. Thus we observe sub-
as well as super-diffusion in a crowded environment.
