In 2001, Seth Lloyd presented a radical new critique of the universe as a
quantum computing device, with an upper limit of bit calculations of the order
of 10 to the 120 power. We find that his calculations permit us to reconcile
the existance of a huge cosmological constant 10 to the minus 43 seconds after
the big bang, with a resulting huge relic graviton flux, with the existance of
a CMBR observational barrier of z = 1100 years after the big bang. Lloyd's
calculations pre suppose the existence of a huge entropy value during the
nucleation of a new universe, a datum we think helps shed light on the
cosmological landscape problem.
