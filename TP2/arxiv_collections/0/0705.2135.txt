Low-dimensional organic conductors could establish themselves as model
systems for the investigation of the physics in reduced dimensions. In the
metallic state of a one-dimensional solid, Fermi-liquid theory breaks down and
spin and charge degrees of freedom become separated. But the metallic phase is
not stable in one dimension: as the temperature is reduced, the electronic
charge and spin tend to arrange themselves in an ordered fashion due to strong
correlations. The competition of the different interactions is responsible for
which broken-symmetry ground state is eventually realized in a specific
compound and which drives the system towards an insulating state.
  Here we review the various ordering phenomena and how they can be identified
by optic and magnetic measurements. While the final results might look very
similar in the case of a charge density wave and a charge-ordered metal, for
instance, the physical cause is completely different. When density waves form,
a gap opens in the density of states at the Fermi energy due to nesting of the
one-dimension Fermi surface sheets. When a one-dimensional metal becomes a
charge-ordered Mott insulator, on the other hand, the short-range Coulomb
repulsion localizes the charge on the lattice sites and even causes certain
charge patterns.
  We try to point out the similarities and conceptional differences of these
phenomena and give an example for each of them. Particular emphasis will be put
on collective phenomena which are inherently present as soon as ordering breaks
the symmetry of the system.
