Chandra and VLA observations of the symbiotic star R Aqr in 2004 reveal
significant changes over the three to four year interval between these
observations and previous observations taken with the VLA in 1999 and with
Chandra in 2000. This paper reports on the evolution of the outer thermal X-ray
lobe-jets and radio jets. The emission from the outer X-ray lobe-jets lies
farther away from the central binary than the outer radio jets, and comes from
material interpreted as being shock heated to ~10^6 K, a likely result of
collision between high speed material ejected from the central binary and
regions of enhanced gas density. Between 2000 and 2004, the Northeast (NE)
outer X-ray lobe-jet moved out away from the central binary, with an apparent
projected motion of ~580 km s^-1. The Southwest (SW) outer X-ray lobe-jet
almost disappeared between 2000 and 2004, presumably due to adiabatic expansion
and cooling. The NE radio bright spot also moved away from the central binary
between 2000 and 2004, but with a smaller apparent velocity than of the NE
X-ray bright spot. The SW outer lobe-jet was not detected in the radio in
either 1999 or 2004. The density and mass of the X-ray emitting material is
estimated. Cooling times, shock speeds, pressure and confinement are discussed.
