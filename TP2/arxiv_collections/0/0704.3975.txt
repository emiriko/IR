The description of the proximity effect in superconducting/ferromagnetic
heterostructures requires to use spin-dependent boundary conditions. Such
boundary conditions must take into account the spin dependence of the phase
shifts acquired by electrons upon scattering on the boundaries of ferromagnets.
The present article shows that this property can strongly affect the critical
temperature and the energy dependence of the density of states of diffusive
heterostructures. These effects should allow a better caracterisation of
diffusive superconductor/ferromagnet interfaces.
