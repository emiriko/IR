We discuss the structure of Dyson--Schwinger equations in quantum gravity and
conclude in particular that all relevant skeletons are of first order in the
loop number. There is an accompanying sub Hopf algebra on gravity amplitudes
equivalent to identities between n-graviton scattering amplitudes which
generalize the Slavnov Taylor identities. These identities map the infinite
number of charges and finite numbers of skeletons in gravity to an infinite
number of skeletons and a finite number of charges needing renormalization. Our
analysis suggests that gravity, regarded as a probability conserving but
perturbatively non-renormalizable theory, is renormalizable after all, thanks
to the structure of its Dyson--Schwinger equations.
