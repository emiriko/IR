We calculate the formal group law which represents the completion of the
N\'eron model of an algebraic torus over the rationals that splits in a tamely
ramified abelian extension. As a tools in the proof, we define and give
criterions to compute the Weil restriction of a formal group law and the analog
of the fixed part of a formal group law with respect to the action of a
(finite) group.
