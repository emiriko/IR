Using the instanton representation method, we re-construct graviton solutions
about DeSitter spacetime. We have used this example as a testing arena to
expose the internal structure of the method and to establish that it works for
known solutions. This paper is a precursor for its application to the
construction of new General Relativity solutions in future work.
