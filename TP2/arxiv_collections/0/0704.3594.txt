A search for narrow baryonic resonances decaying into Xi- pi- or Xi- pi+ and
their antiparticles is carried out with the H1 detector using deep inelastic
scattering events at HERA in the range of negative photon four-momentum
transfer squared 2 < Q^2 < 100 GeV^2. No signal is observed for a new baryonic
state in the mass range 1600 - 2300 MeV in either the doubly charged or the
neutral decay channels. The known baryon Xi0 is observed through its decay mode
into Xi- pi+. Upper limits are given on the ratio of the production rates of
new baryonic states, such as the hypothetical pentaquark states Xi^{--}_{5q} or
Xi^{0}_{5q}, relative to the Xi0 baryon state.
