We investigate the performances of a selective cloning machine based on
linear optical elements and Gaussian measurements, which allows to clone at
will one of the two incoming input states. This machine is a complete
generalization of a 1 to 2 cloning scheme demonstrated by U. L. Andersen et al.
[Phys. Rev. Lett. vol. 94, 240503 (2005)]. The input-output fidelity is studied
for generic Gaussian input state and the effect of non-unit quantum efficiency
is also taken into account. We show that if the states to be cloned are
squeezed states with known squeezing parameter, then the fidelity can be
enhanced using a third suitable squeezed state during the final stage of the
cloning process. A binary communication protocol based on the selective cloning
machne is also discussed.
