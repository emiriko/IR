A selected set of di-hadron correlation results from PHENIX are discussed.
These results provide evidences for four distinct contributions concentrated at
various $\Delta\phi$ ranges. The $p_T$, particle species and energy dependence
of these contributions reflect detailed interplay between jet quenching and
response of the partonic matter to the lost energy.
