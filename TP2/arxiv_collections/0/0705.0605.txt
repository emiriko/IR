We present the discovery and CCD observations of the first eclipsing binary
with a Type II Cepheid component in our Galaxy. The pulsation and orbital
periods are found to be 4.1523 and 51.38 days, respectively, i.e. this variable
is a system with the shortest orbital period among known Cepheid binaries.
Pulsations dominate the brightness variations. The eclipses are assumed to be
partial. The EB-subtype eclipsing light curve permits to believe that the
binary's components are non-spherical.
