We theoretically study the Fano-Kondo effect in a triple quantum dot (QD)
system where two QDs constitute a two-level system and the other QD works in a
detector with electrodes. We found that the Fano dip is clearly modulated by
strongly coupled QDs in a two-level system and a slow detector with no
interacting QD. This setup suggests a new method of reading out qubit states.
