We simulate the collapse of isolated dwarf galaxies using SPH + N-Body
simulations including a physically motivated description of the effects of
supernova feedback. As the gas collapses and stars form, the supernova feedback
disrupts enough gas to temporarily quench star formation. The gas flows outward
into a hot halo, where it cools until star formation can continue once more and
the cycle repeats. The star formation histories of isolated Local Group dwarf
galaxies exhibit similar episodic bursts of star formation. We examine the mass
dependence of the stellar velocity dispersions and find that they are no less
than half the velocity of the halos measured at the virial radius.
