Theoretical research on electronic properties in mesoscopic condensed matter
systems has focused primarily on the electron charge freedom degrees, while its
corresponding spin freedom degrees have not yet received the same attention.
Nevertheless nowadays there has been an increment in the number of electron
spin-related experiments showing unique possibilities for finding novel
mechanisms of information processing and transmission, opening ample fields of
opportunities in the theoretical developed of new models. In this spirit we
have calculated the resonant tunneling characteristics curves in double-barrier
heterostructures of GaAs-Ga1-x AlxAs under external stress and considering two
charges with spin half. The resonant tunneling study has been carried out by
means of the diagrammatic techniques for non equilibrium processes following
the model proposed by Keldysh also a simple one-band tight-binding Hamiltonian
is adopted in the theoretical framework. We have compared our results of the
spin-tunneling with previous ones reported in literature.
