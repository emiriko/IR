We have studied the interplay of an Anderson impurity in Landau quantized
graphene, with special emphasis on the influence of the chemical potential.
Within the slave-boson mean-field theory, we found reentrant Kondo behaviour by
varying the chemical potential or gate voltage. Between Landau levels, the
density of states is suppressed, and by changing the graphene's Fermi energy,
we cross from metallic to semiconducting regions. Hence, the corresponding
Kondo behaviour is also influenced. The f-level spectral function reveals both
the presence of Landau levels in the conduction band and the Kondo resonance.
