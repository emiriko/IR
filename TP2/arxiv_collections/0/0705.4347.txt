In this paper we work out a multiverse scenario whose physical
characteristics enable us to advance the following the conjecture that whereas
the physics of particles and fields is confined to live in the realm of the
whole multiverse formed by finite-time single universes, that for our
observable universe must be confined just in one of the infinite number of
universes of the multiverse when such a universe is consistently referred to an
infinite cosmic time. If this conjecture is adopted then some current
fundamental problems that appear when one tries to make compatible particle
physics and cosmology- such as that for the cosmological constant, the arrow of
time and the existence of a finite proper size of the event horizon- can be
solved.
