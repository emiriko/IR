The present paper introduces an original biofeedback system for improving
human balance control, whose underlying principle consists in providing
additional sensory information related to foot sole pressure distribution to
the user through a tongue-placed tactile output device. To assess the effect of
this biofeedback system on postural control during quiet standing, ten young
healthy adults were asked to stand as immobile as possible with their eyes
closed in two conditions of No-biofeedback and Biofeedback. Centre of foot
pressure (CoP) displacements were recorded using a force platform. Results
showed reduced CoP displacements in the Biofeedback relative to the
No-biofeedback condition. The present findings evidenced the ability of the
central nervous system to efficiently integrate an artificial plantar-based,
tongue-placed tactile biofeedback for controlling control posture during quiet
standing.
