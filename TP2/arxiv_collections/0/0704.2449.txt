We study the relation between a supermatrix model and the free 4D, N=1
supersymmetric field theory of a massless supermultiplet with spins (3, 5/2).
In order to do this, we construct a superfield formulation of the theory. We
show that solutions of the equations of motion for the supermultiplet (3, 5/2)
satisfy the equations of motion of a supermatrix model.
