We prove higher order asymptotic formulas for determinants and traces of
finite block Toeplitz matrices generated by matrix functions belonging to
generalized H\"older spaces with characteristic functions from the
Bari-Stechkin class. We follow the approach of B\"ottcher and Silbermann and
generalize their results for symbols in standard H\"older spaces.
