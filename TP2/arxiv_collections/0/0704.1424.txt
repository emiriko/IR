The change of the hadron masses and hadron interactions in the nuclear medium
and the structure of cold dense hadronic matter are hot topics of hadron
physics today. These important, yet unsolved, problems will be the research
field of AMADEUS (Antikaonic Matter At DAFNE: Experiments with Unraveling
Spectroscopy) - new experiment proposal at DAFNE accelerator at LNF-INFN.
AMADEUS will search for antikaon-mediated deeply bound nuclear states produced
in helium by stopping K- from DAFNE, both in the formation and in the decay
processes.
