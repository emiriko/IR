We examine the infrared properties of five low surface brightness galaxies
(LSBGs) and compare them with related but higher surface brightness galaxies,
using Spitzer Space Telescope images and spectra. All the LSBGs are detected in
the 3.6 and 4.5um bands, representing the stellar population. All but one are
detected at 5.8 and 8.0um, revealing emission from hot dust and aromatic
molecules, though many are faint or point-like at these wavelengths. Detections
of LSBGs at the far-infrared wavelengths, 24, 70, and 160um, are varied in
morphology and brightness, with only two detections at 160um, resulting in
highly varied spectral energy distributions. Consistent with previous
expectations for these galaxies, we find that detectable dust components exist
for only some LSBGs, with the strength of dust emission dependent on the
existence of bright star forming regions. However, the far-infrared emission
may be relatively weak compared with normal star-forming galaxies.
