Although supersymmetry (SUSY) is thirty five years old, it is still one of
the most attractive theories for physics beyond the standard model. Assuming
that SUSY will be discovered at the LHC, the key question is: What SUSY model
do we expect to be the correct one ? After reviewing briefly the advantages and
problems of SUSY, several interesting models that have been proposed in the
literature will be discussed. In particular, models such as the MSSM, BRpV,
NMSSM, and possible extensions. We will also introduce the $\mu\nuSSM$ whose
interest resides in the fact that it generates a solution to the (famous) $\mu$
problem of SUSY models that is connected to the (nowadays very popular)
neutrino physics.
