The recently proposed theoretical model of superconductors endowed with two
distinct superconducting phases and critical temperatures is further analyzed
by introducing two distinct order parameters, described by two scalar fields
which condensate at different temperatures. We find some deviations in basic
thermodynamical quantities with respect to the Ginzburg-Landau one-phase
superconductors. In particular, by contrast to the usual case where only one
jump in specific heat takes place at the normal-superconductor transition
temperature, we actually predict an additional discontinuity for C_V when
passing from a superconducting phase to the other one.
