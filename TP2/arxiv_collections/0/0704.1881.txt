Wavefunction correlations and density matrices for few or many particles are
derived from the properties of semiclassical energy Green functions. Universal
features of fixed energy (microcanonical) random wavefunction correlation
functions appear which reflect the emergence of the canonical ensemble as the
number of particles approaches infinity. This arises through a little known
asymptotic limit of Bessel functions. Constraints due to symmetries,
boundaries, and collisions between particles can be included.
