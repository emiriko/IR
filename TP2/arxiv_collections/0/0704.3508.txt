We use photometric and spectroscopic observations of the eclipsing binary
OGLEGC-228 (V228) to derive the masses, radii, and luminosities of the
component stars. Based on measured systemic velocity, proper motion and
distance, the system is a blue straggler member of the globular cluster 47 Tuc.
Our analysis shows that V228 is a semi-detached Algol. We obtain M=1.512 +/-
0.022 Msun, R=1.357 +/- 0.019 Rsun, L=7.02 +/- 0.050 Lsun for the hotter and
more luminous primary component and M=0.200 +/- 0.007 Msun, R=1.238 +/- 0.013
Rsun, L=1.57 +/- 0.09 Lsun for the Roche lobe filling secondary.
