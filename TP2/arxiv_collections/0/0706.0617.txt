Two-dimensional (2D) equations describing the nonlinear interaction between
upper-hybrid and dispersive magnetosonic waves are presented. Nonlocal
nonlinearity in the equations results in the possibility of existence of stable
2D nonlinear structures. A rigorous proof of the absence of collapse in the
model is given. We have found numerically different types of nonlinear
localized structures such as fundamental solitons, radially symmetric vortices,
nonrotating multisolitons (two-hump solitons, dipoles and quadrupoles), and
rotating multisolitons (azimuthons). By direct numerical simulations we show
that 2D fundamental solitons with negative hamiltonian are stable.
