We study restricted multiple three wave interaction system by the inverse
scattering method. We develop the algebraic approach in terms of classical
$r$-matrix and give an interpretation of the Poisson brackets as linear
$r$-matrix algebra. The solutions are expressed in terms of polynomials of
theta functions. In particular case for $n=1$ in terms of Weierstrass
functions.
