A detailed analysis of the wave-mode structure in a bend and its
incorporation into a stable algorithm for calculation of the scattering matrix
of the bend is presented. The calculations are based on the modal approach. The
stability and precision of the algorithm is numerically and analytically
analysed. The algorithm enables precise numerical calculations of scattering
across the bend. The reflection is a purely quantum phenomenon and is discussed
in more detail over a larger energy interval. The behaviour of the reflection
is explained partially by a one-dimensional scattering model and heuristic
calculations of the scattering matrix for narrow bends. In the same spirit we
explain the numerical results for the Wigner-Smith delay time in the bend.
