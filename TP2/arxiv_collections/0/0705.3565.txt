A scheme for a THz frequency standard based on three-photon coherent
population trapping in stored ions is proposed. Assuming the propagation
directions of the three lasers obey the phase matching condition, we show that
stability of few 10$^{-14}$ at one second can be reached with a precision
limited by power broadening to $10^{-11}$ in the less favorable case. The
referenced THz signal can be propagated over long distances, the useful
information being carried by the relative frequency of the three optical
photons.
