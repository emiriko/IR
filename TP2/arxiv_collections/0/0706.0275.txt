We explore the hierarchy of hidden space-time symmetries of noncritical
strings in RNS formalism, realized nonlinearly. Under these symmetry
transformations the variation of the matter part of the RNS action is cancelled
by that of the ghost part. These symmetries, referred to as the
$\alpha$-symmetries, are induced by special space-time generators, violating
the equivalence of ghost pictures. We classify the $\alpha$-symmetry generators
in terms of superconformal ghost cohomologies $H_{n}\sim{H_{-n-2}}(n\geq{0})$
and associate these generators with a chain of hidden space-time dimensions,
with each ghost cohomology $H_{n}\sim{H_{-n-2}}$ ``contributing'' an extra
dimension. Namely, we show that each ghost cohomology $H_{n}\sim{H_{-n-2}}$ of
non-critical superstring theory in $d$-dimensions contains $d+n+1$
$\alpha$-symmetry generators and the generators from
$H_{k}\sim{H_{-k-2}},1\leq{k}\leq{n}$, combined together, extend the space-time
isometry group from the naive $SO(d,2)$ to $SO(d+n,2)$. In the simplest case of
$n=1$ the $\alpha$-generators are identified with the extra symmetries of the
$2T$-physics formalism, also known to originate from a hidden space-time
dimension.
