We propose noise oscillation measurements in a double point contact,
accessible with current technology, to seek for a signature of the non-abelian
nature of the \nu=5/2 quantum Hall state. Calculating the voltage and
temperature dependence of the current and noise oscillations, we predict the
non-abelian nature to materialize through a multiplicity of the possible
outcomes: two qualitatively different frequency dependences of the nonzero
interference noise. Comparison between our predictions for the Moore-Read state
with experiments on \nu=5/2 will serve as a much needed test for the nature of
the \nu=5/2 quantum Hall state.
