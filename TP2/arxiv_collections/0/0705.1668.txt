We analyze the physics of cold dipolar gases in quasi one-dimensional
geometries, showing that the confinement-induced scattering resonances produced
by the transversal trapping are crucially affected by the dipole-dipole
interaction. As a consequence, the dipolar interaction may drastically change
the properties of quasi-1D dipolar condensates, even for situations in which
the dipolar interaction would be completely overwhelmed by the short-range
interactions in a 3D environment.
