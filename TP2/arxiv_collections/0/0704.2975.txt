We propose that the origin of the Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann law is the increase
of the range of elastic interaction between local relaxation events in a
liquid. In this picture, we discuss the origin of cooperativity of relaxation,
the absence of divergence of relaxation time at a finite temperature and the
crossover to a more Arrhenius behaviour at low temperature.
