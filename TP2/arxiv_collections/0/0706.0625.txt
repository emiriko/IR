We investigate the modification of the spontaneous emission dynamics and
external quantum efficiency for self-assembled InGaAs quantum dots coupled to
extended and localised photonic states in GaAs 2D-photonic crystals. The
2D-photonic bandgap is shown to give rise to a 5-10 times enhancement of the
external quantum efficiency whilst the spontaneous emission rate is
simultaneously reduced by a comparable factor. Our findings are quantitatively
explained by a modal redistribution of spontaneous emission due to the modified
local density of photonic states. The results suggest that quantum dots
embedded within 2D-photonic crystals are suitable for practical single photon
sources with high external efficiency.
