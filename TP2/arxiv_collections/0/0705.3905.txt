Let R be a ring (associative, with 1). A non-zero module M is said to be a
Pruefer module provided there exists a surjective, locally nilpotent
endomorphism with kernel of finite length. The aim of this note is construct
Pruefer modules starting from a pair of module homomorphisms w,v: U_0 -> U_1,
where w is injective and its cokernel is of finite length.
