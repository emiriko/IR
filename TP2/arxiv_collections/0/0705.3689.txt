A dynamical system on the total space of the fibre bundle of second order
accelerations, $T^2M$, is defined as a third order vector field $S$ on $T^2M$,
called semispray, which is mapped by the second order tangent structure into
one of the Liouville vector field. For a regular Lagrangian of second order we
prove that this semispray is uniquely determined by two associated
Cartan-Poincar\'e one-forms. To study the geometry of this semispray we
construct a nonlinear connection, which is a Lagrangian subbundle for the
presymplectic structure. Using this semispray and the associated nonlinear
connection we define covariant derivatives of first and second order. With
respect to this, the second order dynamical derivative of the Lagrangian metric
tensor vanishes.
