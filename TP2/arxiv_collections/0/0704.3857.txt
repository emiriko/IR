We introduce a new, highly sensitive, and simple heterodyne optical method
for imaging individual nonfluorescent nanoclusters and nanocrystals. A 2 order
of magnitude improvement of the signal is achieved compared to previous
methods. This allows for the unprecedented detection of individual small
absorptive objects such as metallic clusters (of 67 atoms) or nonluminescent
semiconductor nanocrystals. The measured signals are in agreement with a
calculation based on the scattering field theory from a photothermal-induced
modulated index of refraction profile around the nanoparticle.
