We discuss a general procedure to obtain 1/2 BPS partition functions for
generic N=1 quiver gauge theories. These functions count the gauge invariant
operators (bosonic and fermionic), charged under all the global symmetries
(mesonic and baryonic), in the chiral ring of a given quiver gauge theory. In
particular we discuss the inclusion of the spinor degrees of freedom in the
partition functions.
