We consider the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov system of linear differential
equations. The coefficients of this system are rational functions generated by
elements of the symmetric group $S_{n}$. We assume that parameter
$\rho=\pm{1}$. In previous paper we proved that the fundamental solution of the
corresponding KZ-equation is rational. Now we construct this solution in the
explicit form.
