Motivated by the organization of crosslinked cytoskeletal biopolymers, we
present a semimicroscopic replica field theory for the formation of anisotropic
random networks of semiflexible polymers. The networks are formed by
introducing random permanent crosslinks which fix the orientations of the
corresponding polymer segments to align with one another. Upon increasing the
crosslink density, we obtain a continuous gelation transition from a fluid
phase to a gel where a finite fraction of the system gets localized at random
positions. For sufficiently stiff polymers, this positional localization is
accompanied by a {\em continuous} isotropic-to-nematic (IN) transition occuring
at the same crosslink density. As the polymer stiffness decreases, the IN
transition becomes first order, shifts to a higher crosslink density, and is
preceeded by an orientational glass (statistically isotropic amorphous solid)
where the average polymer orientations freeze in random directions.
