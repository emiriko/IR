In this paper, we demonstrate the efficiency of simulations via direct
computation of the partition function under various macroscopic conditions,
such as different temperatures or volumes. The method can compute partition
functions by flattening histograms, through the Wang-Landau recursive scheme,
outside the energy space. This method offers a more general and flexible
framework for handling various types of ensembles, especially the ones in which
computation of the density of states is not convenient. It can be easily scaled
to large systems, and it is flexible in incorporating Monte Carlo cluster
algorithms or molecular dynamics. High efficiency is shown in simulating large
Ising models, in finding ground states of simple protein models, and in
studying the liquid-vapor phase transition of a simple fluid. The method is
very simple to implement and we expect it to be efficient in studying complex
systems with rugged energy landscapes, e.g., biological macromolecules.
