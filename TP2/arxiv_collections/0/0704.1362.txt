A fast and accurate computational scheme for simulating nonlinear dynamic
systems is presented. The scheme assumes that the system can be represented by
a combination of components of only two different types: first-order low-pass
filters and static nonlinearities. The parameters of these filters and
nonlinearities may depend on system variables, and the topology of the system
may be complex, including feedback. Several examples taken from neuroscience
are given: phototransduction, photopigment bleaching, and spike generation
according to the Hodgkin-Huxley equations. The scheme uses two slightly
different forms of autoregressive filters, with an implicit delay of zero for
feedforward control and an implicit delay of half a sample distance for
feedback control. On a fairly complex model of the macaque retinal horizontal
cell it computes, for a given level of accuracy, 1-2 orders of magnitude faster
than 4th-order Runge-Kutta. The computational scheme has minimal memory
requirements, and is also suited for computation on a stream processor, such as
a GPU (Graphical Processing Unit).
