We use all-electrical methods to inject, transport, and detect spin-polarized
electrons vertically through a 350-micron-thick undoped single-crystal silicon
wafer. Spin precession measurements in a perpendicular magnetic field at
different accelerating electric fields reveal high spin coherence with at least
13pi precession angles. The magnetic-field spacing of precession extrema are
used to determine the injector-to-detector electron transit time. These transit
time values are associated with output magnetocurrent changes (from in-plane
spin-valve measurements), which are proportional to final spin polarization.
Fitting the results to a simple exponential spin-decay model yields a
conduction electron spin lifetime (T1) lower bound in silicon of over 500ns at
60K.
