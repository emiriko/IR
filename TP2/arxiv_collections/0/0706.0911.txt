We present a theory and experiment demonstrating optical readout of charge
and spin in a single InAs/GaAs self-assembled quantum dot. By applying a
magnetic field we create the filling factor 2 quantum Hall singlet phase of the
charged exciton. Increasing or decreasing the magnetic field leads to
electronic spin-flip transitions and increasing spin polarization. The
increasing total spin of electrons appears as a manifold of closely spaced
emission lines, while spin flips appear as discontinuities of emission lines.
The number of multiplets and discontinuities measures the number of carriers
and their spin. We present a complete analysis of the emission spectrum of a
single quantum dot with N=4 electrons and a single hole, calculated and
measured in magnetic fields up to 23 Tesla.
