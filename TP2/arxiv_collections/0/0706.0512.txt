Two neutrino mixing angles have been measured, and much of the neutrino
community is turning its attention to the unmeasured mixing angle, $\quq$,
whose best limit comes from the reactor neutrino experiment
CHOOZ.\cite{bib:chooz} New two detector reactor neutrino experiments are being
planned, along with more ambitious accelerator experiments, to measure or
further limit $\quq$. Here I will overview how to measure $\quq$ using reactor
neutrinos, mention some experiments that were considered and are not going
forward, and review the current status of four projects: Double Chooz in
France, Daya Bay in China, RENO in South Korea and Angra in Brazil. Finally I
will mention how the neutrino observer can gauge progress in these projects two
years from now as we approach the times corresponding to early estimates for
new results.
