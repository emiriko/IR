TiO$_{2-\delta}$ films were deposited on (100) Lanthanum aluminates
LaAlO$_{3}$ substrates at a very low oxygen chamber pressure $P\approx 0.3$
mtorr employing a pulsed laser ablation deposition technique. In previous work,
it was established that the oxygen deficiency in these films induced
ferromagnetism. In this work it is demonstrated that this same oxygen
deficiency also gives rise to semiconductor titanium ion impurity donor energy
levels. Transport resistivity measurements in thin films of TiO$_{2-\delta}$
are presented as a function of temperature and magnetic field. Magneto- and
Hall- resistivity is explained in terms of electronic excitations from the
titanium ion donor levels into the conduction band.
