We report on the transport and magnetic properties of hybrid trilayers and
bilayers that consist of low spin-polarized Ni80Fe20 exhibiting in-plane but no
uniaxial anisotropy and low-Tc Nb. We reveal a magnetoresistance effect that is
pronounced. In our trilayers the magnetoresistance exhibits an increase of two
orders of magnitude when the superconducting state is reached: from the
conventional normal-state values 0.6 % it goes up to 1000 % for temperatures
below Tc. In contrast, in the bilayers the effect is only minor since from 3%
in the normal state increases only to 70 % for temperatures below Tc.
Magnetization data of both the longitudinal and transverse magnetic components
are presented. Most importantly, we present data not only for the normal state
of Nb but also in its superconducting state. Strikingly, these data show that
below its Tc SC the Nb interlayer under the influence of the outer Ni80Fe20
layers attains a magnetization component transverse to the external field. By
comparing the transport and magnetization data we propose a candidate mechanism
that could motivate the pronounced magnetoresistance effect observed in the
trilayers. Adequate magnetostatic coupling of the outer Ni80Fe20 layers is
motivated by stray fields that emerge naturally in their whole surface due to
the multidomain magnetic structure that they attain near coercivity. Atomic
force microscopy is employed in order to examine the possibility that such
magnetostatic coupling could be promoted by interface roughness. Referring to
the bilayers, although out-of-plane rotation of the magnetization of the single
Ni80Fe20 layer is still observed, in these structures magnetostatic coupling
does not occur due to the absence of a second Ni80Fe20 one so that the observed
magnetoresistance peaks are only modest.
