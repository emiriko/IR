We have experimentally tested a recently suggested possibility for anomalous
sensitivity of the cross sections of dissipative heavy ion collisions. Cross
sections for the $^{19}$F+$^{27}$Al dissipative collisions were measured at the
fixed energy 118.75 MeV of the $^{19}$F for the 12 different beam spots on the
same target foil. The data demonstrate dramatic differences between the cross
sections for the different beam spots. The effect may indicate deterministic
randomness in complex quantum collisions. New experiments are highly desirable
in a view of the fundamental importance of the problem.
