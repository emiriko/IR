Let X be an orbifold with crepant resolution Y. The Crepant Resolution
Conjectures of Ruan and Bryan-Graber assert, roughly speaking, that the quantum
cohomology of X becomes isomorphic to the quantum cohomology of Y after
analytic continuation in certain parameters followed by the specialization of
some of these parameters to roots of unity. We prove these conjectures in the
case where X is a surface singularity of type A. The key ingredient is mirror
symmetry for toric orbifolds.
