By numerically solving the appropriate Boltzmann equations, we study the
production of sterile neutrinos in models with low reheating temperatures. We
take into account the production in oscillations as well as in direct decays
and compute the sterile neutrino primordial spectrum, the effective number of
neutrino species, and the sterile neutrino contribution to the mass density of
the Universe as a function of the mixing and the reheating parameters. It is
shown that sterile neutrinos with non-negligible mixing angles do not
necessarily lead to $N_\nu\sim 4$ and that sterile neutrinos may have the right
relic density to explain the dark matter of the Universe. If dark matter
consists of sterile neutrinos produced in oscillations, X-rays measurements set
a strong limit on the reheating temperature, $\tr\gtrsim 7\mev$. We also point
out that the direct decay opens up a new production mechanism for sterile
neutrino dark matter where cosmological constraints can be satisfied.
