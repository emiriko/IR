We present three-dimensional numerical simulations of the atmospheric
dynamics of close-orbiting planets such as HD209458b. Our simulations show that
winds of several km/sec and day-night temperature differences reaching 500-1000
K are possible at and above the photosphere. The circulation takes the form of
a broad superrotating (eastward) equatorial jet. At 0.1-1 bar, the
superrotation blows the hottest regions of the atmosphere downwind by 60
degrees of longitude, but at lower pressures the temperature pattern tracks the
stellar illumination. We predict factors of several variation in the infrared
flux received at Earth throughout an orbital cycle; if the photosphere is deep
enough (>50-100 mbar pressure), the peak infrared emission should lead the time
of secondary eclipse by 10 hours or more. Dynamics plays a key role in shaping
the spectrum, clouds, chemistry, and long-term planetary evolution.
