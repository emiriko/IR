Developing a novel experimental technique, we applied photon correlation
spectroscopy using infrared radiation in liquid Sulphur around $T_\lambda$,
i.e. in the temperature range where an abrupt increase in viscosity by four
orders of magnitude is observed upon heating within few degrees. This allowed
us - overcoming photo-induced and absorption effects at visible wavelengths -
to reveal a chain relaxation process with characteristic time in the ms range.
These results do rehabilitate the validity of the Maxwell relation in Sulphur
from an apparent failure, allowing rationalizing the mechanical and
thermodynamic behavior of this system within a viscoelastic scenario.
