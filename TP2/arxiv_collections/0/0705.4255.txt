This paper offers an alternative approach to discussing both the principle of
relativity and the derivation of the Lorentz transformations. This approach
uses the idea that there may not be a preferred inertial frame through a
privileged access to information about events. In classroom discussions, it has
been my experience that this approach produces some lively arguments.
