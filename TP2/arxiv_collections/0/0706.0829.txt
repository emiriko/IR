The paper is devoted to the construction of the superstatistical description
for nonequilibrium Markovian systems. It is based on Kirchhoff's diagram
technique and the assumption on the system under consideration to possess a
wide variety of cycles with vanishing probability fluxes. The latter feature
enables us to introduce equivalence classes called channels within which
detailed balance holds individually. Then stationary probability as well as
flux distributions are represented as some sums over the channels. The latter
construction actually forms the superstatistical description, which, however,
deals with a certain superposition of equilibrium subsystems rather then is a
formal expansion of the nonequilibrium steady state distribution into terms of
the Boltzmann type.
