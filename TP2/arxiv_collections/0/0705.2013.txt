We formulate the Josephson effect in a field theoretic language which affords
a straightforward generalization to the non-abelian case. Our formalism
interprets Josephson tunneling as the excitation of pseudo-Goldstone bosons. We
demonstrate the formalism through the consideration of a single junction
separating two regions with a purely non-abelian order parameter and a sandwich
of three regions where the central region is in a distinct phase. Applications
to various non-abelian symmetry breaking systems in particle and condensed
matter physics are given.
