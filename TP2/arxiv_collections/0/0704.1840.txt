We study the effect of physical aging on the mechanical properties of a model
polymer glass using molecular dynamics simulations. The creep compliance is
determined simultaneously with the structural relaxation under a constant
uniaxial load below yield at constant temperature. The model successfully
captures universal features found experimentally in polymer glasses, including
signatures of mechanical rejuvenation. We analyze microscopic relaxation
timescales and show that they exhibit the same aging characteristics as the
macroscopic creep compliance. In addition, our model indicates that the entire
distribution of relaxation times scales identically with age. Despite large
changes in mobility, we observe comparatively little structural change except
for a weak logarithmic increase in the degree of short-range order that may be
correlated to an observed decrease in aging with increasing load.
