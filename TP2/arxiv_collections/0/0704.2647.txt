In this paper, the study of the gravitational collapse of cylindrically
distributed two perfect fluid system has been carried out. It is assumed that
the collapsing speeds of the two fluids are very large. We explore this
condition by using the high-speed approximation scheme. There arise two cases,
i.e., bounded and vanishing of the ratios of the pressures with densities of
two fluids given by $c_s, d_s$. It is shown that the high-speed approximation
scheme breaks down by non-zero pressures $p_1, p_2$ when $c_s, d_s$ are bounded
below by some positive constants. The failure of the high-speed approximation
scheme at some particular time of the gravitational collapse suggests the
uncertainity on the evolution at and after this time. In the bounded case, the
naked singularity formation seems to be impossible for the cylindrical two
perfect fluids. For the vanishing case, if a linear equation of state is used,
the high-speed collapse does not break down by the effects of the pressures and
consequently a naked singularity forms. This work provides the generalisation
of the results already given by Nakao and Morisawa [1] for the perfect fluid.
