Flicker (1/f^gamma) voltage noise spectrum is derived from finite-temperature
quantum electromagnetic fluctuations produced by elementary charge carriers in
external electric field. It is suggested that deviations of the frequency
exponent \gamma from unity, observed in thin metal films, can be attributed to
quantum backreaction of the conducting medium on the fluctuating field of the
charge carrier. This backreaction is described phenomenologically in terms of
the effective momentum space dimensionality, D. Using the dimensional
continuation technique, it is shown that the combined action of the photon heat
bath and external field results in a 1/f^gamma-contribution to the spectral
density of the two-point correlation function of electromagnetic field. The
frequency exponent is found to be equal to 1 + delta, where delta = 3 - D is a
reduction of the momentum space dimensionality. This result is applied to the
case of a biased conducting sample, and a general expression for the voltage
power spectrum is obtained which possesses all characteristic properties of
observed flicker noise spectra. The range of validity of this expression covers
well the whole measured frequency band. Gauge independence of the power
spectrum is proved. It is shown that the obtained results naturally resolve the
problem of divergence of the total noise power. A detailed comparison with the
experimental data on flicker noise measurements in metal films is given.
