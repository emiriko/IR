Magnetic activity in the photosphere and chromosphere of the M dwarf EY Dra
is studied and possible correlations between the two are investigated using
photometric observations in the V and R bands and optical and near infrared
spectroscopy. The longitudinal spot configuration in the photosphere is
obtained from the V band photometry, and the chromospheric structures are
investigated using variations in the H alpha line profile and observations of
the Paschen beta line. The shape of the V band light-curve indicates two active
regions on the stellar surface, about 0.4 in phase apart. The spectroscopic
observations show enhanced H alpha emission observed close to the phases of the
photometrically detected starspots. This could indicate chromospheric plages
associated with the photospheric starspots. Some indications of prominence
structures are also seen. The chromospheric pressure is limited to logTR < -4
based on the non-detection of emission in the Paschen beta wavelength region.
