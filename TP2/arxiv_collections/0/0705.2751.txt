We study the dynamic critical behavior of the Chayes-Machta dynamics for the
Fortuin-Kasteleyn random-cluster model, which generalizes the Swendsen-Wang
dynamics for the q-state Potts model to noninteger q, in two and three spatial
dimensions, by Monte Carlo simulation. We show that the Li-Sokal bound z \ge
\alpha/\nu is close to but probably not sharp in d=2, and is far from sharp in
d=3, for all q. The conjecture z \ge \beta/\nu is false (for some values of q)
in both d=2 and d=3.
