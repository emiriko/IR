Since molecular energy transformations are responsible for chemical reaction
rates at the most fundamental level, chemical kinetics should provide some
information about molecular energies. This is the premise and objective of this
note. We describe a Hamiltonian formulation for kinetic rate equations where
the concentrations are the generalized coordinates and the conjugate momenta
are simply related to individual average molecular energies. Simple examples
are presented and the resulting energy relations naturally include
non-equilibrium reactions. An analysis predicts the reasonable outcome that
thermal agitation of a composite molecule increases its rate of dissociation.
