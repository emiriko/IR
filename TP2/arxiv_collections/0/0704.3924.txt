The formulation of the Higgs effect is studied in the
Glashow--Weinberg--Salam Standard Model, where the constant part of the Higgs
potential is identified with the zeroth mode of the Higgs field. In this model,
the Coleman--Weinberg effective potential obtained from the vacuum--vacuum
transition amplitude is equal to unity at the extremum. This extremum
immediately removes tremendous vacuum cosmological density and predicts mass of
Higgs field. In this model, the kinetic energy density of the Higgs field and
any scalar field can be treated as the rigid state origin that explains
Supernova data in the conformal cosmology without the $\Lambda$ term.
