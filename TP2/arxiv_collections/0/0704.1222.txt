Spectrum of the neutrinos produced in the massive photon and longitudal
plasmon decay process has been computed with four levels of approximation for
the dispersion relations. Some analytical formulae in limiting cases are
derived. Interesting conclusions related to previous calculations of the energy
loss in stars are presented. High energy tail of the neutrino spectrum is shown
to be proportional to exp(-E/kT), where E is the neutrino energy and kT is the
temperature of the plasma.
