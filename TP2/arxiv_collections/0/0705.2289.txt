The induced Einstein equation on a perturbed brane in the Induced Matter
Theory is re-analyzed. We indicate that in a conformally flat background, the
local quantum corrections to the Einstein equation can be obtained via the IMT.
Using the FRW metric as the 4D gravitational model, we show that the classical
fluctuations of the brane may be related to the quantum corrections to the
classical Einstein equation. In other words, the induced Einstein equation on
the perturbed brane correspond with the semiclassical Einstein equation.
