Aims. This work presents a new hydrodynamical algorithm to study
astrophysical detonations. A prime motivation of this development is the
description of a carbon detonation in conditions relevant to superbursts, which
are thought to result from the propagation of a detonation front around the
surface of a neutron star in the carbon layer underlying the atmosphere.
Methods. The algorithm we have developed is a finite-volume method inspired by
the original MUSCL scheme of van Leer (1979). The algorithm is of second-order
in the smooth part of the flow and avoids dimensional splitting. It is applied
to some test cases, and the time-dependent results are compared to the
corresponding steady state solution. Results. Our algorithm proves to be robust
to test cases, and is considered to be reliably applicable to astrophysical
detonations. The preliminary one-dimensional calculations we have performed
demonstrate that the carbon detonation at the surface of a neutron star is a
multiscale phenomenon. The length scale of liberation of energy is $10^6$ times
smaller than the total reaction length. We show that a multi-resolution
approach can be used to solve all the reaction lengths. This result will be
very useful in future multi-dimensional simulations. We present also
thermodynamical and composition profiles after the passage of a detonation in a
pure carbon or mixed carbon-iron layer, in thermodynamical conditions relevant
to superbursts in pure helium accretor systems.
