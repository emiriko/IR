The superscaling analysis is extended to include quasielastic (QE) scattering
via the weak neutral current of neutrinos and antineutrinos from nuclei. The
scaling function obtained within the coherent density fluctuation model (used
previously in calculations of QE inclusive electron and charge-changing (CC)
neutrino scattering) is applied to neutral current neutrino and antineutrino
scattering with energies of 1 GeV from $^{12}$C with a proton and neutron
knockout (u-channel inclusive processes). The results are compared with those
obtained using the scaling function from the relativistic Fermi gas model and
the scaling function as determined from the superscaling analysis (SuSA) of QE
electron scattering.
