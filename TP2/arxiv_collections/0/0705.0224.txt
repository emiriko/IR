We identify plain evaporation of ions as the fundamental loss mechanism out
of a multipole ion trap. Using thermalized negative Cl- ions we find that the
evaporative loss rate is proportional to a Boltzmann factor. This thermodynamic
description sheds new light on the dynamics of particles in time-varying
confining potentials. It specifically allows us to extract the effective depth
of the ion trap as the activation energy for evaporation. As a function of the
rf amplitude we find two distinct regimes related to the stability of motion of
the trapped ions. For low amplitudes the entire trap allows for stable motion
and the trap depth increases with the rf field. For larger rf amplitudes,
however, rapid energy transfer from the field to the ion motion can occur at
large trap radii, which leads to a reduction of the effective trapping volume.
In this regime the trap depth decreases again with increasing rf amplitude. We
give an analytical parameterization of the trap depth for various multipole
traps that allows predictions of the most favorable trapping conditions.
