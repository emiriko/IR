The Large Area Telescope (LAT) instrument onboard GLAST offers a tremendous
opportunity for future blazar studies. In order to fully benefit from its
capabilities and to maximize the scientific return from the LAT, it is of great
importance to conduct dedicated multi-frequency monitoring campaigns that will
result comprehensive observations. Consequently, we initiated an effort to
conduct a GLAST-dedicated, quasi-simultaneous, broad-band flux-density (and
polarization) monitoring of potential GLAST blazars with the Effelsberg and
OVRO radio telescopes (11cm to 7mm wavelength). Here, we present a short
overview of these activities which will complement the multi-wavelengths
activities of the GLAST/LAT collaboration towards the 'low-energy' radio bands.
Further we will give a brief outlook including the extension of this
coordinated campaign towards higher frequencies and future scientific aims.
