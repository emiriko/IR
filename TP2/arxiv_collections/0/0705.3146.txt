We provide an elementary proof for a theorem due to Petz and R\'effy which
states that for a random $n\times n$ unitary matrix with distribution given by
the Haar measure on the unitary group U(n), the upper left (or any other)
$k\times k$ submatrix converges in distribution, after multiplying by a
normalization factor $\sqrt{n}$ and as $n\to\infty$, to a matrix of independent
complex Gaussian random variables with mean 0 and variance 1.
