We present spectroscopic observations of 11 moderately high-redshift (z~0.7-
1.0) clusters from the first Red-Sequence Cluster Survey (RCS-1). We find
excellent agreement between the red-sequence estimated redshift and the
spectroscopic redshift, with a scatter of 10% at z>0.7. At the high-redshift
end (z>~0.9) of the sample, we find two of the systems selected are projections
of pairs of comparably rich systems, with red-sequences too close to
discriminate in (R-z') colour. In one of these systems, the two components are
close enough to be physically associated. For a subsample of clusters with
sufficient spectroscopic members, we examine the correlation between B_gcR
(optical richness) and the dynamical mass inferred from the velocity
dispersion. We find these measurements to be compatible, within the relatively
large uncertainties, with the correlation established at lower redshift for the
X-ray selected CNOC1 clusters and also for a lower redshift sample of RCS-1
clusters. Confirmation of this and calibration of the scatter in the relation
will require larger samples of clusters at these and higher redshifts.
