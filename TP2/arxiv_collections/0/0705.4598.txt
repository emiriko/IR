Run II at the Tevatron has seen an explosion of results related to the Bs
meson, ranging from tests of QCD models, to probes of electro-weak symmetry
breaking, to direct searches for new physics effects. I will briefly summarize
the CDF and D0 Bs-physics programs, describing the suitability of the detectors
for doing this kind of physics, and pointing out how our knowledge of important
quantities has improved through Run II measurements.
