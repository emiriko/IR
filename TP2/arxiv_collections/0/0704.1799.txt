After the pioneered experimental works on superlubricity by Martin et al. on
MoS2 [1], Hirano et al. on tungsten and silicon [2] and the further
confirmation by Dienwiebel et al. on graphite [3], many groups around the word
investigated the occurrence of near frictionless sliding contacts. This large
mobilization of tribologists, material sciences specialists and physicists has
lead to emerging solutions involving new materials and coatings, the most
promising being carbon based like graphite, diamond, carbon composites or
diamond-like-carbons. Some of them are currently used in practical
applications. The situation is different especially in EHL: the highest
friction coefficients are close to 10% when traction fluids are involved, i.e.
fluids that have especially designed to transmit the highest friction, and they
vary within 3-6% for the rest of lubricants. The range of variation is
consequently very narrow and these typical values are really low compared to
those obtained in dry contacts: as a consequence the gain expected from a super
low traction regime in lubrication will be probably more limited, especially in
the case of experiments conducted at the meso or macro scales. This weak
perspective could be one explanation on the relatively low number of articles
in recent literature dealing with lubricated superlubricity in the above
conditions.
