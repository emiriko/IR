We implement the Bethe anstaz method for the elliptic quantum group
$E_{\tau,\eta}(A_2^{(2)})$. The Bethe creation operators are constructed as
polynomials of the Lax matrix elements expressed through a recurrence relation.
We also give the eigenvalues of the family of commuting transfer matrices
defined in the tensor product of fundamental representations.
