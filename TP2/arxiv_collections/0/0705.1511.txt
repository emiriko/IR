We consider globally regular and black hole solutions in SU(2)
Einstein-Yang-Mills-Higgs theory, coupled to a dilaton field. The basic
solutions represent magnetic monopoles, monopole-antimonopole systems or black
holes with monopole or dipole hair. When the globally regular solutions carry
additionally electric charge, an angular momentum density results, except in
the simplest spherically symmetric case. We evaluate the global charges of the
solutions and their effective action, and analyze their dependence on the
gravitational coupling strength. We show, that in the presence of a dilaton
field, the black hole solutions satisfy a generalized Smarr type mass formula.
