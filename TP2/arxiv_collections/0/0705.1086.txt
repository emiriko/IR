We derive a new expression for the q-analogue of the Young symmetrizer which
generate irreducible representations of the Hecke algebra. We obtain this new
expression using Cherednik's fusion procedure. However, instead of splitting
Young diagrams into their rows or columns, we consider their principal hooks.
This minimises the number of auxiliary parameters needed in the fusion
procedure.
