We present results from a study of the distances and distribution of a sample
of intermediate-age clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Using deep
near-infrared photometry obtained with ISPI on the CTIO 4m, we have measured
the apparent K-band magnitude of the core helium burning red clump stars in 17
LMC clusters. We combine cluster ages and metallicities with the work of
Grocholski & Sarajedini to predict each cluster's absolute K-band red clump
magnitude, and thereby calculate absolute cluster distances. An analysis of
these data shows that the cluster distribution is in good agreement with the
thick, inclined disk geometry of the LMC, as defined by its field stars. We
also find that the old globular clusters follow the same distribution,
suggesting that the LMC's disk formed at about the same time as the globular
clusters, ~ 13 Gyr ago. Finally, we have used our cluster distances in
conjunction with the disk geometry to calculate the distance to the LMC center,
for which we find (m-M)o = 18.40 +/- 0.04_{ran} +/- 0.08_{sys}, or Do = 47.9
+/- 0.9 +/- 1.8 kpc.
