Physics was in crisis at the beginning of the twentieth century because the
newborn Maxwell's electromagnetism defied mechanistic preconceptions. Albert
Einstein understood that the solution to the crisis required an audacious
reworking of the concepts of space and time. Special Relativity deeply modified
our way of regarding space and time, in order to harmonize electromagnetism
with the principle of relativity. As a consequence, lengths and elapsed times
were stripped of the invariant character that classical Physics conferred them;
in their place, the speed of light acquired that privileged status. Such
revolutionary change forced Einstein to reformulate Newtonian mechanics, a step
that led him to discover the mass-energy equivalence.
