Young energetic pulsars will likely be the largest class of Galactic sources
observed by GLAST, with many hundreds detected. Many will be unknown as radio
pulsars, making pulsation detection dependent on radio and/or x-ray
observations or on blind periodicity searches of the gamma-rays. Estimates for
the number of pulsars GLAST will detect in blind searches have ranged from tens
to many hundreds. I argue that the number will be near the low end of this
range, partly due to observations being made in a scanning as opposed to a
pointing mode. This paper briefly reviews how blind pulsar searches will be
conducted using GLAST, what limits these searches, and how the computations and
statistics scale with various parameters.
