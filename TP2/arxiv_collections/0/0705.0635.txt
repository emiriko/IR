We study a simple geometric model of transportation facility that consists of
two points between which the travel speed is high. This elementary definition
can model shuttle services, tunnels, bridges, teleportation devices, escalators
or moving walkways. The travel time between a pair of points is defined as a
time distance, in such a way that a customer uses the transportation facility
only if it is helpful.
  We give algorithms for finding the optimal location of such a transportation
facility, where optimality is defined with respect to the maximum travel time
between two points in a given set.
