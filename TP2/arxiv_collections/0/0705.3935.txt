We study the conversion of $^{40}$K and $^{87}$Rb atoms into stable molecules
through the stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) in photoassociation
assisted with Feshbach resonance. Starting with the mean-field Langrange
density, we show that the atom-to-molecule conversion efficiency by STIRAP
aided by Feshbach resonance is much larger than that by bare Feshbach
resonance. We also study the influence of the population imbalance on the
atom-to-molecule conversion.
