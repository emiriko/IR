Many quantization schemes rely on analogs of classical mechanics where the
connections with classical mechanics are indirect. In this work I propose a new
and direct connection between classical mechanics and quantum mechanics where
the quantum mechanical propagator is derived from a variational principle. This
principle allows a physical system to have imperfect information, i.e., there
is incomplete knowledge of the physical state, and many paths are allowed.
