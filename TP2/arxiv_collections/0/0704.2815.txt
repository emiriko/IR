Comments on six papers published by S.P. Anjali Devi and R. Kandasamy in Heat
and Mass Transfer, ZAMM, Mechanics Research Communications, International
Communications in Heat and Mass Transfer, Communications in Numerical Methods
in Engineering, Journal of Computational and Applied Mechanics
  In conclusion all the above papers are of very low quality, written without
care and are partly or completely wrong.
