Screening of charge impurities in graphene is analyzed using the exact
solution for vacuum polarization obtained from the massless Dirac-Kepler
problem. For the impurity charge below certain critical value no density
perturbation is found away from the impurity, in agreement with the linear
response theory result. For supercritical charge, however, the polarization
distribution is shown to have a power law profile, leading to screening of the
excess charge at large distances. The Dirac-Kepler scattering states give rise
to standing wave oscillations in the local density of states which appear and
become prominent in the supercritical regime.
