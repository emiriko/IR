The article gives an account of several aspects of the space known as the
Bohr compactification of the line, featuring as the quantum configuration space
in loop quantum cosmology, as well as of the corresponding configuration space
realization of the so-called polymer representation. Analogies with loop
quantum gravity are explored, providing an introduction to (part of) the
mathematical structure of loop quantum gravity, in a technically simpler
context.
