In the framework of the model inter-comparison study - Asia Phase II (MICS2),
where eight models are compared over East Asia, this paper studies the
influence of different parameterizations used in the aerosol module on the
aerosol concentrations of sulfate and nitrate in PM10. An intracomparison of
aerosol concentrations is done for March 2001 using different configurations of
the aerosol module of one of the model used for the intercomparison. Single
modifications of a reference setup for model configurations are performed and
compared to a reference case. These modifications concern the size
distribution, i.e. the number of sections, and physical processes, i.e.
coagulation, condensation/evaporation, cloud chemistry, heterogeneous reactions
and sea-salt emissions. Comparing monthly averaged concentrations at different
stations, the importance of each parameterization is first assessed. It is
found that sulfate concentrations are little sensitive to sea-salt emissions
and to whether condensation is computed dynamically or by assuming
thermodynamic equilibrium. Nitrate concentrations are little sensitive to cloud
chemistry. However, a very high sensitivity to heterogeneous reactions is
observed. Thereafter, the variability of the aerosol concentrations to the use
of different chemistry transport models (CTMs) and the variability to the use
of different parameterizations in the aerosol module are compared. For sulfate,
the variability to the use of different parameterizations in the aerosol module
is lower than the variability to the use of different CTMs. However, for
nitrate, for monthly averaged concentrations averaged over four stations, these
two variabilities have the same order of magnitude.
