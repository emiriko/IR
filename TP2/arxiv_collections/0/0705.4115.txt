An approximate holographic dual of QCD is constructed and shown to reproduce
the empirical linear trajectories of universal slope on which the square masses
of radially and orbitally excited hadrons join. Conformal symmetry breaking and
other IR effects are described exclusively by deformations of the anti-de
Sitter background metric. The predictions for the light hadron spectrum include
new relations between ground state masses and trajectory slopes and are in good
overall agreement with experimental data.
