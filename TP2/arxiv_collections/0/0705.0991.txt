Investigation of the many-body condensed-matter systems allows us to connect
the microscopic physics at the atomic energy scale and the macroscopic physics
emerging in the low-energy corner. It gives some hints on the mechanisms of the
formation of the physical laws which our Universe obeys. The paper is devoted
to the centenary of Matvei Petrovich Bronstein.
