We show that the mutual fund theorems of Merton (1971) extend to the problem
of optimal investment to minimize the probability of lifetime ruin. We obtain
two such theorems by considering a financial market both with and without a
riskless asset for random consumption. The striking result is that we obtain
two-fund theorems despite the additional source of randomness from consumption.
