We present a numerical method for spatially 1.5-dimensional and
time-dependent studies of accretion disks around black holes, that is
originated from a combination of the standard pseudo-spectral method and the
adaptive domain decomposition method existing in the literature, but with a
number of improvements in both the numerical and physical senses. In
particular, we introduce a new treatment for the connection at the interfaces
of decomposed subdomains, construct an adaptive function for the mapping
between the Chebyshev-Gauss-Lobatto collocation points and the physical
collocation points in each subdomain, and modify the over-simplified
1-dimensional basic equations of accretion flows to account for the effects of
viscous stresses in both the azimuthal and radial directions. Our method is
verified by reproducing the best results obtained previously by Szuszkiewicz &
Miller on the limit-cycle behavior of thermally unstable accretion disks with
moderate viscosity. A new finding is that, according to our computations, the
Bernoulli function of the matter in such disks is always and everywhere
negative, so that outflows are unlikely to originate from these disks. We are
encouraged to study the more difficult case of thermally unstable accretion
disks with strong viscosity, and wish to report our results in a subsequent
paper.
