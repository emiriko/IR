Stimulated by recent advances in isolating graphene, we discovered that
quantum dot can be trapped in Z-shaped graphene nanoribbon junciton. The
topological structure of the junction can confine electronic states completely.
By varying junction length, we can alter the spatial confinement and the number
of discrete levels within the junction. In addition, quantum dot can be
realized regardless of substrate induced static disorder or irregular edges of
the junction. This device can be used to easily design quantum dot devices.
This platform can also be used to design zero-dimensional functional nanoscale
electronic devices using graphene ribbons.
