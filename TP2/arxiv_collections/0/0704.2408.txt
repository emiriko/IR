We continue our program of single-site observations of pulsating subdwarf B
(sdB) stars and present the results of extensive time series photometry of HS
0039+4302 and HS 0444+0458. Both were observed at MDM Observatory during the
fall of 2005. We extend the number of known frequencies for HS 0039+4302 from 4
to 14 and discover one additional frequency for HS 0444+0458, bringing the
total to three. We perform standard tests to search for multiplet structure,
measure amplitude variations, and examine the frequency density to constrain
the mode degree $\ell$.
  Including the two stars in this paper, 23 pulsating sdB stars have received
follow-up observations designed to decipher their pulsation spectra. It is
worth an examination of what has been detected. We compare and contrast the
frequency content in terms of richness and range and the amplitudes with
regards to variability and diversity. We use this information to examine
observational correlations with the proposed $\kappa$ pulsation mechanism as
well as alternative theories.
