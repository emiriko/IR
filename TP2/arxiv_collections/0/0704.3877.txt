The new scheme of stochastic quantization is proposed. This quantization
procedure is equivalent to the deformation of an algebra of observables in the
manner of deformation quantization with an imaginary deformation parameter (the
Planck constant). We apply this method to the models of nonrelativistic and
relativistic particles interacting with an electromagnetic field. In the first
case we establish the equivalence of such a quantization to the Fokker-Planck
equation with a special force. The application of the proposed quantization
procedure to the model of a relativistic particle results in a relativistic
generalization of the Fokker-Planck equation in the coordinate space, which in
the absence of the electromagnetic field reduces to the relativistic diffusion
(heat) equation. The stationary probability distribution functions for a
stochastically quantized particle diffusing under a barrier and a particle in
the potential of a harmonic oscillator are derived.
