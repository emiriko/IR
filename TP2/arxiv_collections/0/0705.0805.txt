The well known Liouville-Arnold theorem says that if a level surface of
integrals of an integrable system is compact and connected, then it is a torus.
However, in some important examples of integrable systems the topology of a
level surface of integrals is quite complicated. This is due to the fact that
in these examples the phase space has points where either the Hamiltonian is
singular or the symplectic form is singular or degenerate. In such situations
the Liouville-Arnold theorem does not apply. However, sometimes it is possible
to define the corresponding flow on the whole level surface of integrals and
use this flow to investigate the topology. Tomei (1982) and Fried (1986) used
the Toda lattice to study the topology of the isospectral variety of Jacobi
matrices. We recall these results and we also expose new results concerning the
topology of the isospectral variety of zero-diagonal Jacobi matrices. This
topology is studied using the Volterra system.
