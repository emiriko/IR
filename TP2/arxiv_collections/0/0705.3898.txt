The aim of this paper is to apply a contextual probabilistic model (in the
spirit of Mackey, Gudder, Ballentine) to represent and to generalize some
results of quantum logic about possible macroscopic quantum-like (QL)
behaviour. The crucial point is that our model provides QL-representation of
macroscopic configurations in terms of complex probability amplitudes -- wave
functions of such configurations. Thus, instead of the language of propositions
which is common in quatum logic, we use the language of wave functions which is
common in the conventional presentation of QM. We propose a quantum-like
representation algorithm, QLRA, which maps probabilistic data of any origin in
complex (or even hyperbolic) Hilbert space. On the one hand, this paper
clarifyes some questions in foundations of QM, since some rather mystical
quantum features are illustrated on the basis of behavior of macroscopic
systems. On the other hand, the approach developed in this paper may be used
e.g. in biology, sociology, or psychology. Our example of QL-representation of
hidden macroscopic configurations can find natural applications in those
domains of science.
