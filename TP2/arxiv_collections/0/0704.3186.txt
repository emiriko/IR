The dynamical mass generation for gluons is discussed in Euclidean Yang-Mills
theories supplemented with a renormalizable mass term. The mass parameter is
not free, being determined in a self-consistent way through a gap equation
which obeys the renormalization group. The example of the Landau gauge is
worked out explicitly at one loop order. A few remarks on the issue of the
unitarity are provided.
