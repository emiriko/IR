The motion of particles, where the particles: electrons, ions in microtubules
or migrated peoples can be described as the superposition of diffusion and
ordered waves. In this paper it is shown that the master equation for transport
processes can be formulated as the time delayed hyperbolic partial equation.
The equation describes the processes with memory. For characteristic times
shorter than the relaxation time the master equation is the generalized Klein -
Gordon equation.
