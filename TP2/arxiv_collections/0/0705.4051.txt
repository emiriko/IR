After a short review on resent developments achieved in astrophysics in the
past years since last NN conference, experimental efforts in nuclear
astrophysics primarily with RI beams were revisited, especially on the works
relevant to neutron-deficient nuclei, the other half of the nuclear chart
reviewed by Rehm in this conference. A new interesting recognition discussed in
the past years is the important role of explosive hydrogen burning process in
the very early stage of type II supernovae. A new broadening research field
related to the first generation stars both from observations as well as from
nuclear astrophysics was also discussed.
