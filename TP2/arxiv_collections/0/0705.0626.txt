We reveal the existence of systematic variations of isobaric fragility in
different supercooled Lennard-Jones binary mixtures by performing molecular
dynamics simulations. The connection between fragility and local structures in
the bulk is analyzed by means of a Voronoi construction. We find that clusters
of particles belonging to locally preferred structures form slow, long-lived
domains, whose spatial extension increases by decreasing temperature. As a
general rule, a more rapid growth, upon supercooling, of such domains is
associated to a more pronounced super-Arrhenius behavior, hence to a larger
fragility.
