We have studied a one dimensional Hubbard superlattice with different Coulomb
correlations at alternating sites for a half-filled band. Mean field
calculations based on the Hartree-Fock approximation together with a real space
renormalization group technique were used to study the ground state of the
system. The phase diagrams obtained in these approaches agree with each other
from the weak to the intermediate coupling regime. The mean field results show
very quick convergence with system size. The renormalization group results
indicate a spatial modulation of local moments that was identified in some
previous work. Also we have studied the magnetoconductance of such
superlattices which reveals several interesting points.
