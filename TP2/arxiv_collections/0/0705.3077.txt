The paper considers the halting scheme for quantum Turing machines. The
scheme originally proposed by Deutsch appears to be correct, but not exactly as
originally intended. We discuss the result of Ozawa as well as the objections
raised by Myers, Kieu and Danos and others. Finally, the relationship of the
halting scheme to the quest for a universal quantum Turing machine is
considered.
