Multiwavelength observations are reported here of the Be/X-ray binary pulsar
system GRO J1008-57. Over ten years worth of data are gathered together to show
that the periodic X-ray outbursts are dependant on both the binary motion and
the size of the circumstellar disk. In the first instance an accurate orbital
solution is determined from pulse periods, and in the second case the strength
and shape of the Halpha emission line is shown to be a valuable indicator of
disk size and its behaviour. Furthermore, the shape of the emission line
permits a direct determination of the disk size which is in good agreement with
theoretical estimates. A detailed study of the pulse period variations during
outbursts determined the binary period to be 247.8, in good agreement with the
period determined from the recurrence of the outbursts.
