We established a physically utilizable Bell inequality based on the
Peres-Horodecki criterion. The new quadratic probabilistic Bell inequality
naturally provides us a necessary and sufficient way to test all entangled
two-qubit or qubit-qutrit states including the Werner states and the maximally
entangled mixed states.
