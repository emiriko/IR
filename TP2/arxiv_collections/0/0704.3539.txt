We present non-LTE diagnostics of the filament observed by SOHO/SUMER on May
27, 2005 in the whole Lyman series. The filament was situated close to the disk
center. The Ly_alpha observations were carried out with normal voltage of
detector A. The slit was placed at the central part of the detector -- outside
the Ly_alpha attenuator. Therefore, the observed profiles of this line could be
calibrated reliably.
