This paper develops a cosmological hypothesis based on the following
propositions:
  1. Zero-point radiation derives from quantic fluctuations in space, and the
wavelength of its photons with the greatest energy is inversely proportional to
the curvature of space.
  2. The Universe began as the breaking in of photons of extremely high energy
contained in the 3-dimensional surface: $w^2+x^2+y^2+z^2=R^2_i$, whose radius
has continued to expand at the speed of ligth since its origin at $t=0$.
  3. The wavelength of the photons is quantized and the quantum of wavelength
is invariable.
  These propositions imply that the value of the total energy of the zero-point
radiation in the Universe remains constant and the condition $w^2 + x^2 + y^2 +
z^2 = (R_i + ct)^2 = R_u^2$ determines that every point in our space is subject
to a tension whose intensity $i$ is proportional to the curvature $1/R_u$. Any
increase of $R_u$ implies a decrease in $i$ and consequently an energy flow
which translates into an expansive force. Therefore, the Universe will expand
indefinitely: no Big Crunch is possible. If the initial radius of the Universe
$R_i$ has been smaller than the Schwarzschild radius, $R_s$, which corresponds
to the total mass of the Universe, $M_u$, the generation of matter would have
lasted for thousands of millions of years. Generation of matter over short
periods would have required values for $R_i$ of thousands of millions of light
years.
