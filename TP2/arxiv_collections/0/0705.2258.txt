We investigated the viability of neutralino dark matter in the gauge
mediation from emergent supersymmetry proposal. In this proposal, supersymmetry
is broken at Planck scale and consequently, the gravitino is superheavy and
completely decouples from the low energy theory. Squarks and sleptons obtain
their soft masses dominantly through gauge mediation with other mechanisms
highly suppressed. The lightest supersymmetric partner, in contrast to
traditional gauge mediation, is a neutralino which is also a dark matter
candidate. By explicit calculation of the low energy spectra, the parameter
space was constrained using the WMAP observed relic density of dark matter,
LEP2 Higgs mass bounds, collider bounds on supersymmetric partners and exotic
B-meson decays. We found that the model has intriguing hybrid features such as
a nearly gauge-mediated spectrum (the exception being the superheavy gravitino)
but with a dominant mSUGRA-like bino-stau coannihilation channel and at large
$\tan \beta$, A-resonance-like annihilation.
