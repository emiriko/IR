We have measured the flux, profile, color, and substructure in the diffuse
intracluster light (ICL) in a sample of ten galaxy clusters with a range of
mass, morphology, redshift, and density. Deep, wide-field observations for this
project were made in two bands at the one meter Swope and 2.5 meter du Pont
telescope at Las Campanas Observatory. Careful attention in reduction and
analysis was paid to the illumination correction, background subtraction, point
spread function determination, and galaxy subtraction. ICL flux is detected in
both bands in all ten clusters ranging from 7.6 x 10^{10} to 7.0 x 10^{11}
h^{-1} solar luminosities in r and 1.4 x 10^{10} to 1.2 x 10^{11} h^{-1} solar
luminosities in the B-band. These fluxes account for 6 to 22% of the total
cluster light within one quarter of the virial radius in r and 4 to 21% in the
B-band. Average ICL B-r colors range from 1.5 to 2.8 mags when k and evolution
corrected to the present epoch. In several clusters we also detect ICL in group
environments near the cluster center and up to ~1 h^{-1} Mpc distant from the
cluster center. Our sample, having been selected from the Abell sample, is
incomplete in that it does not include high redshift clusters with low density,
low flux, or low mass, and it does not include low redshift clusters with high
flux, mass, or density. This bias makes it difficult to interpret correlations
between ICL flux and cluster properties. Despite this selection bias, we do
find that the presence of a cD galaxy corresponds to both centrally
concentrated galaxy profiles and centrally concentrated ICL profiles. This is
consistent with ICL either forming from galaxy interactions at the center, or
forming at earlier times in groups and later combining in the center.
