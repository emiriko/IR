We propose experiments to observe Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) and
superfluidity of quasi-two-dimensional (2D) spatially indirect magnetoexcitons
in bilayer graphene. The magnetic field $B$ is assumed strong. The energy
spectrum of collective excitations, the sound spectrum as well as the effective
magnetic mass of magnetoexcitons are presented in the strong magnetic field
regime. The superfluid density $n_S$ and the temperature of the
Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition $T_c$ are shown to be increasing functions
of the excitonic density $n$ but decreasing functions of $B$ and the interlayer
separation $D$. Numerical results are presented from these calculations.
