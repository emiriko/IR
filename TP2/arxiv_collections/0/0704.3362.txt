While the usual harmonic oscillator potential gives discrete energies in the
non-relativistic case, it does not however give genuine bound states in the
relativistic case if the potential is treated in the usual way. In the present
article, we have obtained the eigenfunctions of the Dirac oscillator in two
spatial dimensions, adapting the prescription of Moshinsky.
