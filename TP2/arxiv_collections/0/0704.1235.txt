Competitive random sequential adsorption on a line from a binary mix of
incident particles is studied using both an analytic recursive approach and
Monte Carlo simulations. We find a strong correlation between the small and the
large particle distributions so that while both partial contributions to the
fill factor fluctuate widely, the variance of the total fill factor remains
relatively small. The variances of partial contributions themselves are quite
different between the smaller and the larger particles, with the larger
particle distribution being more correlated. The disparity in fluctuations of
partial fill factors increases with the particle size ratio. The additional
variance in the partial contribution of smaller particle originates from the
fluctuations in the size of gaps between larger particles. We discuss the
implications of our results to semiconductor high-energy gamma detectors where
the detector energy resolution is controlled by correlations in the cascade
energy branching process.
