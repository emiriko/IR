The concept of twisted Poincar\'e symmetry, as well as some implications, are
reviewed. The spin-statistics relation and the nonlocality of NC QFT are
discussed in the light of this quantum symmetry. The possibility of a twisted
symmetry principle for quantum field and gauge theories formulated on a
noncommutative space-time is also explored.
