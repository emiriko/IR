We show how the entangled photons produced in parametric down conversion can
be used to improve the sensitivity of a Sagnac interferometer. Two-photon and
four-photon coincidences increases the sensitivity by a factor of two and four
respectively. Our results apply to sources with arbitrary pumping and squeezing
parameters.
