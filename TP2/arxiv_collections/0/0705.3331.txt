The ''polymer reference interaction site model'' (PRISM) integral equation
theory is used to determine the structure factor of rigid dendrimers in
solution. The theory is quite successful in reproducing experimental structure
factors for various dendrimer concentrations. In addition, the structure factor
at vanishing scattering vector is calculated via the compressibility equation
using scaled particle theory and fundamental measure theory. The results as
predicted by both theories are systematically smaller than the experimental and
PRISM data for platelike dendrimers.
