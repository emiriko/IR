We report the electrical induction and detection of dynamic nuclear
polarization in the spin-blockade regime of double GaAs vertical quantum dots.
The largest Overhauser field observed was about 4 Tesla, corresponding to a
nuclear polarization of about 40% in the present device. A phenomenological
model is presented to provide a qualitative understanding of our results.
