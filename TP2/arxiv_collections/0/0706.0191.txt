We present EVN observations of seven BL Lac objects selected from the RGB
sample. To investigate the intrinsic radiation property of BL Lac objects, we
estimated the Doppler factor with the VLA or MERLIN core and the total 408 MHz
luminosity for a sample of 170 BL Lac objects. The intrinsic (comoving)
synchrotron peak frequency was then calculated by using the estimated Doppler
factor. Assuming a Lorentz factor of 5, the viewing angle of jets was
constrained. The high-resolution VLBI images of seven sources all show a
core-jet structure. We estimated the proper motions of three sources with the
VLBI archive data, and find that the apparent speed increases with the distance
of components to the core for all of them. In our BL Lacs sample, the Doppler
factor of LBLs is systematically larger than that of IBLs and HBLs. We find a
significant anti-correlation between the total 408 MHz luminosity and the
intrinsic synchrotron peak frequency. However, the scatter is much larger than
for the blazar sequence. Moreover, we find a significant positive correlation
between the viewing angle and the intrinsic synchrotron peak frequency. The BL
Lac objects show a continuous distribution on the viewing angle. While LBLs
have a smaller viewing angle than that of IBLs and HBLs, IBLs are comparable to
HBLs. We conclude that the intrinsic synchrotron peak frequency is not only
related to the intrinsic radio power (though with a large scatter), but also to
the viewing angle for the present sample.
