Sterile neutrino ($\nu_s$) conversion in meter scale baselines can be
sensitively probed using mono-energetic, sub-MeV, flavor pure $\nu_e$'s from an
artificial MCi source and the unique technology of the LENS low energy solar
$\nu_e$ detector. Active-sterile {\em oscillations} can be directly observed in
the granular LENS detector itself to critically test and extend results of
short baseline accelerator and reactor experiments.
