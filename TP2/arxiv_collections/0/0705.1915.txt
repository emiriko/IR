Grids include heterogeneous resources, which are based on different hardware
and software architectures or components. In correspondence with this diversity
of the infrastructure, the execution time of any single job, as well as the
total grid performance can both be affected substantially, which can be
demonstrated by measurements. Running a simple benchmarking suite can show this
heterogeneity and give us results about the differences over the grid sites.
