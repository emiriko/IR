A recent analysis by Kadin has noted that the superconducting wavefunction
within the BCS theory may be represented in real-space as a spherical
electronic orbital (on the scale of the coherence length) coupled to a
standing-wave lattice vibration. This lattice vibration, effectively a bound
phonon, has wavevector 2kf and a near-resonant frequency (on the order of the
Debye frequency) that maximizes the attractive electrostatic interaction energy
with the electronic orbital. The present paper extends this picture to a
coherent standing-wave pattern of electron and phonon waves that traverses the
entire superconductor on the macroscopic scale. These parallel planes form a
diffractive waveguide for electron waves traveling parallel to the planes,
permitting lossless supercurrent. A similar picture may be extended to
unconventional superconductors such as the cuprates, with an array of standing
spin waves rather than phonons. Such coherent lattice vibrations should be
universal and distinctive indicators of the superconducting state, and should
be observable below Tc using standard x-ray and neutron diffraction techniques.
Further implications of this picture are discussed.
