Many organizations aspire to adopt agile processes to take advantage of the
numerous benefits that it offers to an organization. Those benefits include,
but are not limited to, quicker return on investment, better software quality,
and higher customer satisfaction. To date however, there is no structured
process (at least in the public domain) that guides organizations in adopting
agile practices. To address this problem we present the Agile Adoption
Framework. The framework consists of two components: an agile measurement
index, and a 4-Stage process, that together guide and assist the agile adoption
efforts of organizations. More specifically, the agile measurement index is
used to identify the agile potential of projects and organizations. The 4-Stage
process, on the other hand, helps determine (a) whether or not organizations
are ready for agile adoption, and (b) guided by their potential, what set of
agile practices can and should be introduced.
