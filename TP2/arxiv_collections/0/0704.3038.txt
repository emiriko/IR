The Ge spectrometer of the RHESSI satellite is sensitive to Gamma Ray Bursts
(GRBs) from about 40 keV up to 17 MeV, thus ideally complementing the Swift/BAT
instrument whose sensitivity decreases above 150 keV. We present preliminary
results of spectral fits of RHESSI GRB data. After describing our method, the
RHESSI results are discussed and compared with Swift and Konus.
