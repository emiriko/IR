In order to obtain more comprehensive information about an celestial object,
the radio image must be identified with the optical one. Many years the
identification process is carried out with the coordinate coincidence criteria,
which leads to abundant misidentifications and "empty field" in optics for the
radio sources. For this reason significant part of radio sources do not have
identifications in optic. In present paper we consider the radio refraction in
the Galaxy, which significantly changes the coordinates of radio sources if
compared with the optical one. By taking into account the radio refraction, the
major number of the radio sources can be successfully identified with the
optical objects.
