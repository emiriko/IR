We have found that a novel type of entrainment occurs in two nonidentical
limit cycle oscillators subjected to a common external white Gaussian noise.
This entrainment is anomalous in the sense that the two oscillators have
different mean frequencies, where the difference is constant as the noise
intensity increases, but their phases come to be locked for almost all the
time. We present a theory and numerical evidence for this phenomenon.
