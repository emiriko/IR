The paper has two goals: the study the associated graded ring of contracted
homogeneous ideals in $K[x,y]$ and the study of the Groebner fan of the ideal
$P$ of the rational normal curve in ${\bf P}^d$. These two problems are, quite
surprisingly, very tightly related. We completely classify the contracted
ideals with a Cohen-Macaulay associated graded rings in terms of the numerical
invariants arising from Zariski's factorization. We determine explicitly all
the initial ideals (monomial or not) of $P$ that are Cohen-Macaulay.
