We analyze cotunneling transport through two quantum dots in series weakly
coupled to external ferromagnetic leads. In the Coulomb blockade regime the
electric current flows due to third-order tunneling, while the second-order
single-barrier processes have indirect impact on the current by changing the
occupation probabilities of the double dot system. We predict a zero-bias
maximum in the differential conductance, whose magnitude is conditioned by the
value of the inter-dot Coulomb interaction. This maximum is present in both
magnetic configurations of the system and results from asymmetry in cotunneling
through different virtual states. Furthermore, we show that tunnel
magnetoresistance exhibits a distinctively different behavior depending on
temperature, being rather independent of the value of inter-dot correlation.
Moreover, we find negative TMR in some range of the bias voltage.
