We present numerical magnetohydrostatic solutions describing the
gravitationally stratified, bulk equilibrium of cool, dense prominence plasma
embedded in a near-potential coronal field. These solutions are calculated
using the FINESSE magnetohydrodynamics equilibrium solver and describe the
morphologies of magnetic field distributions in and around prominences and the
cool prominence plasma that these fields support. The equilibrium condition for
this class of problem is usually different in distinct subdomains, separated by
free boundaries, across which solutions are matched by suitable continuity or
jump conditions describing force balance. We employ our precise finite element
elliptic solver to calculate solutions not accessible by previous analytical
techniques with temperature or entropy prescribed as free functions of the
magnetic flux function, including a range of values of the polytropic index,
temperature variations mainly across magnetic field lines and photospheric
field profiles sheared close to the polarity inversion line. Out of the many
examples computed here, perhaps the most noteworthy is one which reproduces
precisely the three-part structure often encountered in observations: a cool
dense prominence within a cavity/flux rope embedded in a hot corona. The
stability properties of these new equilibria, which may be relevant to solar
eruptions, can be determined in the form of a full resistive MHD spectrum using
a companion hyperbolic stability solver.
