The cross section for central diffractive Higgs production is calculated, for
the LHC range of energies. The graphs for the possible mechanisms for Higgs
production, through pomeron fusion and photon fusions are calculated for all
possibilities allowed by the standard model. The cross section for central
diffractive Higgs production through pomeron fusion, must be multiplied by a
factor for the survival probability, to isolate the Higgs signal and reduce the
background. Due to the small value of the survival probability $\Lb 4 \times
10^{-3}\Rb $, the cross sections for central diffractive Higgs production, in
the two cases for pomeron fusion and photon fusion, are competitive.
