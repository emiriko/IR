We study the pair production of doubly charged Higgs bosons at the Large
Hadron Collider (LHC), assuming the doubly charged Higgs to be part of an
SU(2)_L triplet which generates Majorana masses for left-handed neutrinos. Such
pair-production has the advantage that it is not constrained by the triplet
vacuum expectation value, which tends to make the single production rate rather
small. We point out that, in addition to the Drell-Yan (DY) production
mechanism, two-photon processes also contribute to H++H++ production at a level
comparable to the QCD corrections to the DY channel. Decays of the doubly
charged Higgs into both the l+l+ and W+W+ modes are studied in detail to
optimize the signal observation over the backgrounds. Doubly charged scalars
should be observable at the LHC with 300 fb^-1 integrated luminosity in the ll
channel upto the mass range of 1 TeV even with a branching fraction of about 60
%, and in the WW channel upto a mass of 700 GeV. Such a doubly charged Higgs,
if it is a member of a triplet generating neutrino masses,cannot be long-lived
on the scale of collider detectors although it might lead to a displaced
secondary vertex during its decay if it is lighter than about 250 GeV.
