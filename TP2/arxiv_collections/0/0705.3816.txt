The differential cross sections \sigma_0=\sigma_T+\epsilon \sigma_L,
\sigma_{LT}, and \sigma_{TT} of \pi^0 electroproduction from the proton were
measured from threshold up to an additional center of mass energy of 40 MeV, at
a value of the photon four-momentum transfer of Q^2= 0.05 GeV^2/c^2 and a
center of mass angle of \theta=90^\circ. By an additional out-of-plane
measurement with polarized electrons \sigma_{LT'} was determined. This showed
for the first time the cusp effect above the \pi^+ threshold in the imaginary
part of the s-wave. The predictions of Heavy Baryon Chiral Perturbation Theory
are in disagreement with these data. On the other hand, the data are somewhat
better predicted by the MAID phenomenological model and are in good agreement
with the dynamical model DMT.
