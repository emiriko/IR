We study synchronization properties of general uncoupled limit-cycle
oscillators driven by common and independent Gaussian white noises. Using phase
reduction and averaging methods, we analytically derive the stationary
distribution of the phase difference between oscillators for weak noise
intensity. We demonstrate that in addition to synchronization, clustering, or
more generally coherence, always results from arbitrary initial conditions,
irrespective of the details of the oscillators.
