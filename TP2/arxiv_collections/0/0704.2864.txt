We report the observation of a compensation point in the temperature
dependence of magnetization data of polycrystalline Sm2Al. Magnetization
measurements show that this compound magnetically orders at about 150 K. Below
this temperature, the magnetization data shows a compensation point, which
shifts with field. Hysteresis loops obtained below the compensation temperature
show that the compound possesses exchange anisotropy. Both the exchange
anisotropy field and the coercive field are found to be quite large and
comparable to those of the classical spin-orbit compensated ferromagnet
(Sm,Gd)Al2. The heat capacity data also suggest that there are similarities
between (Sm,Gd)Al2 and Sm2Al.
