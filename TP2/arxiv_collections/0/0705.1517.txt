We perform intensive numerical simulations of the three-dimensional
site-diluted Ising antiferromagnet in a magnetic field at high values of the
external applied field. Even if data for small lattice sizes are compatible
with second-order criticality, the critical behavior of the system shows a
crossover from second-order to first-order behavior for large system sizes,
where signals of latent heat appear. We propose "apparent" critical exponents
for the dependence of some observables with the lattice size for a generic
(disordered) first-order phase transition.
