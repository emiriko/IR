As part of preparations for a southern sky search for faint Milky Way dwarf
galaxy satellites, we report the discovery of a stellar overdensity in the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 5, lying at an angular distance of only
1.5 degrees from the recently discovered Bo{\"o}tes dwarf. The overdensity was
detected well above statistical noise by employing a sophisticated data mining
algorithm and does not correspond to any catalogued object. Overlaid isochrones
using stellar population synthesis models show that the color-magnitude diagram
of that region has the signature of an old (12 Gyr), metal-poor (${\rm
Fe/H}\approx-2.0$) stellar population at a tentative distance of 60 kpc,
evidently the same heliocentric distance as the Bo\"otes dwarf. We estimate the
new object to have a total magnitude of $M_{V}\sim-3.1\pm1.1$ mag and a
half-light radius of $r_{h}=4'.1\pm1'.6$ ($72\pm28$ pc) placing it in an
apparent $40<r_{h}<100$ pc void between globular clusters and dwarf galaxies,
occupied only by another recently discovered Milky Way Satellite, Coma
Berenices.
