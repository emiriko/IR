We present the main results of the PhD Thesis carried out by
L\'opez-S\'anchez (2006), in which a detailed morphological, photometrical and
spectroscopical analysis of a sample of 20 Wolf-Rayet (WR) galaxies was
realized. The main aims are the study of the star formation and O and WR
stellar populations in these galaxies and the role that interactions between
low surface companion objects have in the triggering of the bursts. We analyze
the morphology, stellar populations, physical conditions, chemical abundances
and kinematics of the ionized gas, as well as the star-formation activity of
each system.
