In a metallic manganite like La(2/3)Sr(1/3)MnO(3), the substitution of Mn(+3)
by Ga(+3) dilutes the ferromagnetic order and locally cancels the Jahn-Teller
distortion, without heavily affecting the crystal structure. One can thus
follow the changes in the charge dynamics induced by Ga, until the
ferro-metallic manganite is turned into an insulator. Here this phenomenon is
studied in detail through the infrared reflectivity of five samples of
La(2/3)Sr(1/3)Mn(1-x)Ga(x)O(3), with x increasing from 0 to 0.30 and for 50 < T
< 320 K. A simple model which links the measured optical parameters to the
magnetization M(x, T) well describes the behavior of the plasma frequency, the
scattering rate, and the mid-infrared absorption along the metal-to-insulator
transition.
