We compute, in the MSSM framework, the sum of the one-loop electroweak and of
the total QED radiation effects for the process $pp \to t W+X$, initiated by
the parton process $bg\to tW$. Combining these terms with the existing NLO
calculations of SM and SUSY QCD corrections, we analyze the overall one-loop
supersymmetric effects on the partial rates of the process, obtained by
integrating the differential cross section up to a final variable invariant
mass. We conclude that, for some choices of the SUSY parameters and for
relatively small final invariant masses, they could reach the relative ten
percent level, possibly relevant for a dedicated experimental effort at LHC.
