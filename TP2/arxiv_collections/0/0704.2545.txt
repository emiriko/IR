We present measurements of the two-point galaxy angular correlation function
w(\theta) in the COSMOS field. Independent determinations of w(\theta) as a
function of magnitude limit are presented for both the HST ACS catalog and also
for the ground-based data from Subaru and the CFHT. Despite having
significantly different masks, these three determinations agree well. At bright
magnitudes (IAB<22), our data generally match very well with existing
measurements and with mock catalogs based on semi-analytic galaxy formation
calculations of Kitzbichler and White from the Millennium Simulation. The
exception is that our result is at the upper end of the expected cosmic
variance scatter for \theta > 10 arcmin, which we attribute to a particularly
rich structure known to exist at z~0.8. For fainter samples, however, the level
of clustering is somewhat higher than reported by some previous studies: in all
three catalogues we find w(\theta=1')~0.014 at a median IAB magnitude of 24. At
these very faintest magnitudes, our measurements agree well with the latest
determinations from the Canada-France Legacy Survey. This level of clustering
is approximately double what is predicted by the semi-analytic catalogs (at all
angles). The semi-analytic results allow an estimate of cosmic variance, which
is too small to account for the discrepancy. We therefore conclude that the
mean amplitude of clustering at this level is higher than previously estimated.
