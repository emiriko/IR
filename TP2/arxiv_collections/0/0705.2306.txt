A fundamental bound on the relaxation time \tau of a perturbed
thermodynamical system has recently been derived, \tau \geq \hbar/\pi T, where
$T$ is the system's temperature. We demonstrate analytically that black holes
saturate this bound in the extremal limit and for large values of the azimuthal
number m of the perturbation field.
