The Birman-Murakami-Wenzl algebra (BMW algebra) of type Dn is shown to be
semisimple and free of rank (2^n+1)n!!-(2^(n-1)+1)n! over a specified
commutative ring R, where n!! is the product of the first n odd integers. We
also show it is a cellular algebra over suitable ring extensions of R. The
Brauer algebra of type Dn is the image af an R-equivariant homomorphism and is
also semisimple and free of the same rank, but over the polynomial ring Z with
delta and its inverse adjoined. A rewrite system for the Brauer algebra is used
in bounding the rank of the BMW algebra above. As a consequence of our results,
the generalized Temperley-Lieb algebra of type Dn is a subalgebra of the BMW
algebra of the same type.
