We propose a new algorithm to the problem of polygonal curve approximation
based on a multiresolution approach. This algorithm is suboptimal but still
maintains some optimality between successive levels of resolution using dynamic
programming. We show theoretically and experimentally that this algorithm has a
linear complexity in time and space. We experimentally compare the outcomes of
our algorithm to the optimal "full search" dynamic programming solution and
finally to classical merge and split approaches. The experimental evaluations
confirm the theoretical derivations and show that the proposed approach
evaluated on 2D coastal maps either show a lower time complexity or provide
polygonal approximations closer to the input discrete curves.
