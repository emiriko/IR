We complete the analysis of meson resonance contributions to chiral
low-energy constants of O(p^4) by including all quark-antiquark bound states
with orbital angular momentum less or equal to one. Different tensor meson
Lagrangians used in previous work are shown to produce the same final results
for the low-energy constants once QCD short-distance constraints are properly
implemented. We also discuss the possible relevance of axial-vector mesons with
odd C-parity.
