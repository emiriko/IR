Ferromagnetic Resonance Force Microscopy (FMRFM) offers a means of performing
local ferromagnetic resonance. We have studied the evolution of the FMRFM force
spectra in a continuous 50 nm thick permalloy film as a function of probe-film
distance and performed numerical simulations of the intensity of the FMRFM
probe-film interaction force, accounting for the presence of the localized
strongly nonuniform magnetic field of the FMRFM probe magnet. Excellent
agreement between the experimental data and the simulation results provides
insight into the mechanism of FMR mode excitation in an FMRFM experiment.
