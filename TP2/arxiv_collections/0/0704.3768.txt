We investigate the phantom field with potential
$V(\phi)=V_{0}\exp(-\lambda{\phi}^2)$ and dark matter in the spatially flat FRW
model. It has been shown by numerical calculation that there is a attractor
solution in this model. We also apply the statefinder diagnostic to this
phantom model. It is shown that the evolving trajectories of this scenario in
the $s-r$ diagram is quite different form other dark energy models.
