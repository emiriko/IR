It is known that large class of classical string solutions in the type IIB
AdS_5xS^5 background is related to the Neumann and Neumann-Rosochatius
integrable systems, including spiky strings and giant magnons. It is also
interesting if these integrable systems can be associated with some membrane
configurations in M-theory. We show here that this is indeed the case by
presenting explicitly several types of membrane embedding in AdS_4xS^7 with the
searched properties.
