We present self consistent calculations of Synchrotron self Compton (SSC)
radiation that takes place within the afterglow blast wave and External inverse
Compton (EIC) radiation that takes place when flare photons (produced by an
internal process) pass through the blast wave. We show that if our current
interpretations of the Swift XRT data are correct, there should be a canonical
high energy afterglow emission light curve. We expect that GRBs with a long
term X-ray flattening or X-ray flares should show similar high energy features.
The EIC emission, however, is long lasting and weak and might be outshined by
the SSC emission of the forward shock. The high energy emission could be well
detected by the soon to be launched GLAST satellite. Its detection could shed
new light on the conditions within the emitting regions of GRBs.
