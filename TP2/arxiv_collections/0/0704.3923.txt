A recent, major, puzzle in the core-level photoemission spectra of doped
manganites is the observation of a 1-2 eV wide shoulder with intensity varying
with temperature T as the square of the magnetization over a T scale of order
200K, an order of magnitude less than electronic energies. This is addressed
and resolved here, by extending a recently proposed two electron fluid l-b
model for these systems to include core-hole effects. The shoulder arises from
a rapid redistribution of e_g electron density, as a function of T, between the
highly localized (l) and band-like (b) states. Furthermore, our theory leads to
a correspondence between spectral changes due to increasing doping and
decreasing T, as experimentally observed.
