In a dynamic nuclear polarization experiment on a 40 mM solution of
4-amino-TEMPO in a 40:60 water/glycerol mixture, we have observed that the bulk
dipolar reservoir is cooled to a spin temperature of 15.5 micro-K, following
microwave irradiation for 800 s. This is significantly cooler than the 35 mK
spin temperature of the Zeeman reservoir. Equilibration of the two reservoirs
results in a 50 % increase in the NMR signal intensity, corresponding to a
Zeeman spin temperature of 23 mK. In order to achieve this polarization
directly, it was necessary to irradiate the sample with microwaves for 1500 s.
Cooling of the dipolar reservoir occurs during polarization transport through
the magnetic field gradient around the paramagnetic impurity, and is rapidly
communicated to the bulk by dipolar spin diffusion. As dipolar spin diffusion
is significantly faster than Zeeman spin diffusion, the bulk dipolar reservoir
cools faster than the Zeeman reservoir. This process can be exploited to
rapidly polarize the nuclear spins, by repeatedly cooling the dipolar system
and transferring the polarization to the Zeeman reservoir.
