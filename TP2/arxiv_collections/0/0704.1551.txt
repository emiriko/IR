The quantum Zeno effect arises due to frequent observation. That implies the
existence of some experimenter and its interaction with the system. In this
contribution, we examine what happens for a closed system if one considers a
quantum Zeno type of question, namely: "what is the probability of a system,
remaining always in a particular subspace". This has implications to the
arrival time problem that is also discussed. We employ the decoherent histories
approach to quantum theory, as this is the better developed formulation of
closed system quantum mechanics, and in particular, dealing with questions that
involve time in a non-trivial way. We get a very restrictive decoherence
condition, that implies that even if we do introduce an environment, there will
be very few cases that we can assign probabilities to these histories, but in
those cases, the quantum Zeno effect is still present.
