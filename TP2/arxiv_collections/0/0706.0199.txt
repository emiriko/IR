We present a new method for computing the best approximation to a Killing
vector on closed 2-surfaces that are topologically S^2. When solutions of
Killing's equation do not exist, this method is shown to yield results superior
to those produced by existing methods. In addition, this method appears to
provide a new tool for studying the horizon geometry of distorted black holes.
