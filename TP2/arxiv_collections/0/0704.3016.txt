Experiments built to search for neutrinoless double beta-decay are limited in
their sensitivity not only by the exposure but also by the amount of background
encountered. Radioactive isotopes in the surrounding of the detectors which
emit gamma-radiation are expected to be a significant source of background in
the GERmanium Detector Array, GERDA.
  Methods to select electron induced events and discriminate against photon
induced events inside a germanium detector are presented in this paper. The
methods are based on the analysis of the time structure of the detector
response. Data were taken with a segmented GERDA prototype detector. It is
shown that the analysis of the time response of the detector can be used to
distinguish multiply scattered photons from electrons.
