We consider a large class of optical cavities and gain media with an off-axis
external feedback which introduces a two-point nonlocality. This nonlocality
moves the lasing threshold and opens large windows of control parameters where
weak light spots can be strongly amplified while the background radiation
remains very low. Furthermore, transverse phase and group velocities of a
signal can be independently tuned and this enables to steer it non
mechanically, to control its spatial chirping and to split it into two
counter-propagating ones.
