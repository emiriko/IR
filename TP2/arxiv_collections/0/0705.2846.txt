NASA has claimed the discovery of a `Ring of Dark Matter' in the galaxy
cluster CL 0024+17, see Jee M.J. et al. arXiv:0705.2171, based upon
gravitational lensing data. Here we show that the lensing can be given an
alternative explanation that does not involve `dark matter'. This explanation
comes from the new dynamics of 3-space. This dynamics involves two constant G
and alpha - the fine structure constant. This dynamics has explained the bore
hole anomaly, spiral galaxy flat rotation speeds, the masses of black holes in
spherical galaxies, gravitational light bending and lensing, all without
invoking `dark matter', and also the supernova redshift data without the need
for `dark energy'.
