We study the single longitudinal-spin asymmetries in lepton-pair production
with large transverse-momentum at RHIC and J-PARC experiments. The asymmetries
in the azimuthal angular distribution of a lepton can arise from an absorptive
part of production amplitudes. We revisit the one-loop calculation for the
absorptive part of production amplitudes in perturbative QCD, and show that the
asymmetries can be sizable at RHIC and J-PARC. Measurement of the asymmetries
would test the one-loop prediction for the scattering phase of this process,
and provide support for a study of the single transverse-spin asymmetries in
the same kinematical region.
