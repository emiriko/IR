We present a new class of irregular low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes for
moderate block lengths (up to a few thousand bits) that are well-suited for
rate-compatible puncturing. The proposed codes show good performance under
puncturing over a wide range of rates and are suitable for usage in incremental
redundancy hybrid-automatic repeat request (ARQ) systems. In addition, these
codes are linear-time encodable with simple shift-register circuits. For a
block length of 1200 bits the codes outperform optimized irregular LDPC codes
and extended irregular repeat-accumulate (eIRA) codes for all puncturing rates
0.6~0.9 (base code performance is almost the same) and are particularly good at
high puncturing rates where good puncturing performance has been previously
difficult to achieve.
