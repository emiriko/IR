We introduce a wide subclass ${\cal F}(X,\omega)$ of quasi-plurisubharmonic
functions in a compact K\"ahler manifold, on which the complex Monge-Amp\`ere
operator is well-defined and the convergence theorem is valid. We also prove
that ${\cal F}(X,\omega)$ is a convex cone and includes all
quasi-plurisubharmonic functions which are in the Cegrell class.
