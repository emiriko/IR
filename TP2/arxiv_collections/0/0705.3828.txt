String theory tells us that quantum gravity has a dual description as a field
theory (without gravity). We use the field theory dual to ask what happens to
an object as it falls into the simplest black hole: the 2-charge extremal hole.
In the field theory description the wavefunction of a particle is spread over a
large number of `loops', and the particle has a well-defined position in space
only if it has the same `position' on each loop. For the infalling particle we
find one definition of `same position' on each loop, but there is a different
definition for outgoing particles and no canonical definition in general in the
horizon region. Thus the meaning of `position' becomes ill-defined inside the
horizon.
