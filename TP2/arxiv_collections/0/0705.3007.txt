We consider a non-commutative U(1) gauge theory in 4 dimensions with a
modified Slavnov term which looks similar to the 3-dimensional BF model. In
choosing a space-like axial gauge fixing we find a new vector supersymmetry
which is used to show that the model is free of UV/IR mixing problems, just as
in the previously discussed model in arXiv:hep-th/0604154. Finally, we present
generalizations of our proposed model to higher dimensions.
