Even-order dispersion cancellation, an effect previously identified with
frequency-entangled photons, is demonstrated experimentally for the first time
with a linear, classical interferometer. A combination of a broad bandwidth
laser and a high resolution spectrometer was used to measure the intensity
correlations between anti-correlated optical frequencies. Only 14% broadening
of the correlation signal is observed when significant material dispersion,
enough to broaden the regular interferogram by 4250%, is introduced into one
arm of the interferometer.
