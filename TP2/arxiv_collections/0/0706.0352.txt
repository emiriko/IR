Transferring quantum information between two qubits is a basic requirement
for many applications in quantum communication and quantum information
processing. In the iterative quantum state transfer (IQST) proposed by D.
Burgarth et al. [Phys. Rev. A 75, 062327 (2007)], this is achieved by a static
spin chain and a sequence of gate operations applied only to the receiving end
of the chain. The only requirement on the spin chain is that it transfers a
finite part of the input amplitude to the end of the chain, where the gate
operations accumulate the information. For an appropriate sequence of
evolutions and gate operations, the fidelity of the transfer can asymptotically
approach unity. We demonstrate the principle of operation of this transfer
scheme by implementing it in a nuclear magnetic resonance quantum information
processor.
