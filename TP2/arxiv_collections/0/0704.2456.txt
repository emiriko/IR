The classical Heisenberg Hamiltonian was solved for oriented spinel thin and
thick cubic ferrites. The dipole matrix of complicated cubic cell could be
simplified into the form of dipole Matrix of simple cubic cells. This study was
confined only to the highly oriented thin films of ferrite. The variation of
total energy of Nickel ferrite thin films with angle and number of layers was
investigated. Also the change of energy with stress induced anisotropy for
Nickel ferrite films with N=5 and 1000 has been studied. Films with the
magnetic moments ratio 1.86 can be easily oriented in 90 direction when N is
greater than 400.
