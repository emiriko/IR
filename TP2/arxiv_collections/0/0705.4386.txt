We report on the temperature dependence of the impurity-induced resonant
state in Zn-doped Bi_2Sr_2CaCu_2O$_{8+\delta}$ by scanning tunneling
spectroscopy at 30 mK < T < 52 K. It is known that a Zn impurity induces a
sharp resonant peak in tunnel spectrum at an energy close to the Fermi level.
We observed that the resonant peak survives up to 52 K. The peak broadens with
increasing temperature, which is explained by the thermal effect. This result
provides information to understand the origin of the resonant peak.
