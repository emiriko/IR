Near-infrared photometry of transiting extrasolar planets can be of great
scientific value. It is however not straightforward to reach the necessary
millimagnitude precision. Here we report on our attempts to observe transits
and secondary eclipses of several extrasolar planets at 2.2 micron. Best
results have been obtained on OGLE-TR-113b using the SOFI near-infrared camera
on ESO's New Technology Telescope. Its K-band transit shows a remarkably flat
bottom indicating low stellar limb darkening. Secondary eclipse photometry has
resulted in a formal 3 sigma detection, but residual systematic effects make
this detection rather uncertain.
