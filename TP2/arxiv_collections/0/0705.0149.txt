The procedure has been developed for extracting homocharge and heterocharge
currents from experimentally measured thermally stimulated depolarization
currents of corona poled PVDF. Application of different depolarization modes
supplemented with the isothermal currents allowed to obtain such parameters of
relaxation processes, as activation energies, characteristic frequencies and
time constants.
