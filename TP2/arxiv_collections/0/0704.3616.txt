We calculate exactly the von Neumann and topological entropies of the toric
code as a function of system size and temperature. We do so for systems with
infinite energy scale separation between magnetic and electric excitations, so
that the magnetic closed loop structure is fully preserved while the electric
loop structure is tampered with by thermally excited electric charges. We find
that the entanglement entropy is a singular function of temperature and system
size, and that the limit of zero temperature and the limit of infinite system
size do not commute. From the entanglement entropy we obtain the topological
entropy, which is shown to drop to half its zero-temperature value for any
infinitesimal temperature in the thermodynamic limit, and remains constant as
the temperature is further increased. Such discontinuous behavior is replaced
by a smooth decreasing function in finite-size systems. If the separation of
energy scales in the system is large but finite, we argue that our results hold
at small enough temperature and finite system size, and a second drop in the
topological entropy should occur as the temperature is raised so as to disrupt
the magnetic loop structure by allowing the appearance of free magnetic
charges. We interpret our results as an indication that the underlying magnetic
and electric closed loop structures contribute equally to the topological
entropy (and therefore to the topological order) in the system. Since each loop
structure \emph{per se} is a classical object, we interpret the quantum
topological order in our system as arising from the ability of the two
structures to be superimposed and appear simultaneously.
