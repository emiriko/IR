The nature of non-exponential kinetics in microbial cells inactivation by
pulsed electric fields (PEF) is discussed. It was demonstrated that possible
mechanism of non-exponential kinetics can be related to orientational disorder
in suspension of microbial cells of anisotropic form. A numerical studies of
spheroidal cell suspensions was carried out. The most pronounced deviations
from the exponential kinetics were observed for disordered suspensions of
prolate spheroids at small electric field strength $E$ or at large aspect ratio
$a$. For partially oriented suspensions, efficiency of inactivation enhances
with increasing of order parameter and field strength. A possibility of the
PEF-induced orientational ordering in microbial suspensions is discussed.
