Electron-electron interactions play a major role in determining the
low-temperature rate of phase loss of electrons in mesoscopic systems. The
study of the dephasing rate is expected to contribute to the understanding of
the many-body nature of such systems. Closed quantum dots are of special
interest in this respect, due to theoretical predictions suggesting a possible
transition temperature below which the dephasing rate vanishes. This prediction
has attracted much attention, since closed quantum dots are prime candidates
for storage units in quantum computers, and thus their phase coherence
properties are of great importance. However, an effective method for measuring
the dephasing rate within a closed quantum dot is still lacking. Here we study
two-level systems and show that the Fano factor has a sharp peak as a function
of the chemical potential, the location of which can be simply related to the
dephasing rate. We thus suggest to use the properties of the Fano factor peak
in the super-Poissonian regime as a probe for the dephasing rate.
