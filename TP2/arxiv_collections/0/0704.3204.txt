We present U,B,V,R,I imaging polarimetry of NGC 2100 and its surrounding
environment, which comprise a part of the LMC 2 supershell. The morphology of
the observed position angle distribution provides a tracer of the projected
magnetic field in this environment. Our polarization maps detail regions
exhibiting similarly aligned polarization position angles, as well as more
complex position angle patterns. We observe regions of coherent fields on
spatial scales of 42 x 24 pc to 104 x 83 pc, and infer projected field
strengths of $\sim14-30\mu$G. We propose that the superposition of global
outflows from the LMC 2 environment, as well as outflows created within NGC
2100, produce the unique field geometry in the region.
