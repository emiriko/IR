Search for non-Standard-Model Higgs bosons is one of the major goals of the
ongoing Fermilab Tevatron run. Large data sets accumulated by the CDF and D0
experiments break new grounds in sensitivity. We review recent Tevatron results
on searches for Higgs bosons in Minimal Supersymmetric Model in the multi b-jet
and tau-tau final states, as well as a search for fermiophobic Higgs in the
multiphoton final state.
