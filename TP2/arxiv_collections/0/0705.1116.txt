The new emerging quantum physics - quantum computing conceptual bridge,
mandates a ``grand unification'' of space-time-matter and quantum information
(all quantized), with deep implications for science in general. The major
physics revolutions in our understanding of the universe are briefly reviewed
and a ``missing'' equivalence principle is identified and its nature explained.
An implementation as an external super-symmetry $\C{E}=ic\C{P}$ is suggested,
generalizing the Wick rotation ``trick''. Taking advantage of the
interpretation of entropy as a measure of symmetry, it is naturally asimilated
within the present Feynman Path Integral algebraic formalism.
