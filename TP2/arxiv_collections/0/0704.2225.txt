Different damping mechanisms in graphene nanoresonators are studied: charges
in the substrate, ohmic losses in the substrate and the graphene sheet,
breaking and healing of surface bonds (Velcro effect), two level systems,
attachment losses, and thermoelastic losses. We find that, for realistic
structures and contrary to semiconductor resonators, dissipation is dominated
by ohmic losses in the graphene layer and metallic gate. An extension of this
study to carbon nanotube-based resonators is presented.
