The lowest order contribution of the amplitude of the Dirac-Coulomb
scattering in de Sitter spacetime is calculated assuming that the initial and
final states of the Dirac field are described by exact solutions of the free
Dirac equation on de Sitter spacetime with a given momentum and helicity. One
studies the difficulties that arises when one passes from the amplitude to
cross section.
