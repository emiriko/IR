We provide a combinatorial description of exclusion statistics in terms of
minimal difference $p$ partitions. We compute the probability distribution of
the number of parts in a random minimal $p$ partition. It is shown that the
bosonic point $ p=0$ is a repulsive fixed point for which the limiting
distribution has a Gumbel form. For all positive $p$ the distribution is shown
to be Gaussian.
