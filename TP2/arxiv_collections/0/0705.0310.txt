A very compact architecture has been developed for the first level Muon
Trigger of the LHCb experiment that processes 40 millions of proton-proton
collisions per second. For each collision, it receives 3.2 kBytes of data and
it finds straight tracks within a 1.2 microseconds latency. The trigger
implementation is massively parallel, pipelined and fully synchronous with the
LHC clock. It relies on 248 high density Field Programable Gate arrays and on
the massive use of multigigabit serial link transceivers embedded inside FPGAs.
