Classical and quantum Hamiltonian reductions of free geodesic systems of
complete Riemannian manifolds are investigated. The reduced systems are
described under the assumption that the underlying compact symmetry group acts
in a polar manner in the sense that there exist regularly embedded, closed,
connected submanifolds meeting all orbits orthogonally in the configuration
space. Hyperpolar actions on Lie groups and on symmetric spaces lead to
families of integrable systems of spin Calogero-Sutherland type.
