Design, implementation, and machine learning issues associated with
developing a control system for a serpentine robotic manipulator are explored.
The controller developed provides autonomous control of the serpentine robotic
manipulatorduring operation of the manipulator within an enclosed environment
such as an underground storage tank. The controller algorithms make use of both
low-level joint angle control employing force/position feedback constraints,
and high-level coordinated control of end-effector positioning. This approach
has resulted in both high-level full robotic control and low-level telerobotic
control modes, and provides a high level of dexterity for the operator.
