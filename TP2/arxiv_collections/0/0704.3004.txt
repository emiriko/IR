The in-medium behavior of the nucleon spectral density including
self-energies is revisited within the framework of QCD sum rules. Special
emphasis is given to the density dependence of four-quark condensates. A
complete catalog of four-quark condensates is presented and relations among
them are derived. Generic differences of such four-quark condensates occurring
in QCD sum rules for light baryons and light vector mesons are discussed.
