We construct and study a previously defined quantum holographic effective
action whose critical equation implies the holographic loop equation of large-N
QCD_4 for planar self-avoiding loops in a certain regularization scheme. We
extract from the effective action the exact beta function in the given scheme.
For the Wilsonean coupling constant the beta function is exacly one loop and
the first coefficient agrees with its value in perturbation theory. For the
canonical coupling constant the exact beta function has a NSVZ form and the
first two coefficients agree with their value in perturbation theory.
