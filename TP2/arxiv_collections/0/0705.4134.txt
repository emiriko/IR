We define an infinite stochastic state machine, the Battery-Discharge-Model
(BDM), which simulates the behaviour of linear and jump complexity of the
continued fraction expansion of multidimensional formal power series, a
relevant security measure in the cryptanalysis of stream ciphers.
  We also obtain finite approximations to the infinite BDM, where polynomially
many states suffice to approximate with an exponentially small error the
probabilities and averages for linear and jump complexity of M-multisequences
of length n over the finite field F_q, for any M, n, q.
