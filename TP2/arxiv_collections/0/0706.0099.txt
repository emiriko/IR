This article consists of a brief discussion of the energy density over time
or frequency that is obtained with the wavelet transform. Also an efficient
algorithm is suggested to calculate the continuous transform with the Morlet
wavelet. The energy values of the Wavelet transform are compared with the power
spectrum of the Fourier transform. Useful definitions for power spectra are
given. The focus of the work is on simple measures to evaluate the transform
with the Morlet wavelet in an efficient way. The use of the transform and the
defined values is shown in some examples.
