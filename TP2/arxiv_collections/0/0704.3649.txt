This paper proposes a method to address the longstanding problem of lack of
monotonicity in estimation of conditional and structural quantile functions,
also known as the quantile crossing problem. The method consists in sorting or
monotone rearranging the original estimated non-monotone curve into a monotone
rearranged curve. We show that the rearranged curve is closer to the true
quantile curve in finite samples than the original curve, establish a
functional delta method for rearrangement-related operators, and derive
functional limit theory for the entire rearranged curve and its functionals. We
also establish validity of the bootstrap for estimating the limit law of the
the entire rearranged curve and its functionals. Our limit results are generic
in that they apply to every estimator of a monotone econometric function,
provided that the estimator satisfies a functional central limit theorem and
the function satisfies some smoothness conditions. Consequently, our results
apply to estimation of other econometric functions with monotonicity
restrictions, such as demand, production, distribution, and structural
distribution functions. We illustrate the results with an application to
estimation of structural quantile functions using data on Vietnam veteran
status and earnings.
