Plasma instabilities can play a fundamental role in quark-gluon plasma
equilibration in the high energy (weak coupling) limit. Early simulations of
the evolution of plasma instabilities in non-abelian gauge theory, performed in
one spatial dimension, found behavior qualitatively similar to traditional QED
plasmas. Later simulations of the fully three-dimensional theory found
different behavior, unlike traditional QED plasmas. To shed light on the origin
of this difference, we study the intermediate case of two spatial dimensions.
Depending on how the "two-dimensional'' theory is formulated, we can obtain
either behavior.
