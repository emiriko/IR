We present a Monte-Carlo (MC) calculation of the propagation of cosmic ray
protons in the Galaxy for energies above 1 PeV. We discuss the relative
strengths of competing effects such as parallel/perpendicular diffusion and
drifts in toy models of the Galaxy. We compare our estimates with the results
of the MC calculation for the toy models and then we apply the MC calculation
to a few more realistic models of the Galactic magnetic field. We study the
containment times in different models of the magnetic field in order to
understand which one may be consistent with the low energy data.
