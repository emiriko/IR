In the preceding paper, we formulated a conjecture on the relations between
certain classes of irreducible representations of affine Hecke algebras of type
B and symmetric crystals for $\gl_\infty$. In the present paper, we prove the
existence of the symmetric crystal and the global basis for $\gl_\infty$.
