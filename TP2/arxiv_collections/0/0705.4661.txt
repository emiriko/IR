Let $X$ be a projective algebraic manifold and let $CH^r(X)$ be the Chow
group of algebraic cycles of codimension $r$ on $X$, modulo rational
equivalence. Working with a candidate Bloch-Beilinson filtration
$\{F^{\nu}\}_{\nu\geq 0}$ on $CH^r(X)\otimes {\Bbb Q}$ due to the second
author, we construct a space of arithmetic Hodge theoretic invariants $\nabla
J^{r,\nu}(X)$ and corresponding map $\phi_{X}^{r,\nu} :
Gr_{F}^{\nu}CH^r(X)\otimes {\Bbb Q} \to \nabla J^{r,\nu}(X)$, and determine
conditions on $X$ for which the kernel and image of $\phi_{X}^{r,\nu}$ are
``uncountably large''.
