We present recent results on charmless hadronic B decays using data collected
by the BaBar detector at the PEP-II asymmetric-energy e+e- collider at the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. We report measurements of branching
fractions and charge asymmetries in several charmless two-body, three-body, and
quasi-two-body decay modes. We also report measurements of polarization in
charmless B decays to exclusive final states with two vector mesons.
