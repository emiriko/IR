The phase of Super-Soft-Source (SSS) emission of the sixth recorded outburst
of the recurrent nova RS Oph was observed twice with Chandra and once with
XMM-Newton. The observations were taken on days 39.7, 54.0, and 66.9 after
outburst. We confirm a 35-sec period on day 54.0 and found that it originates
from the SSS emission and not from the shock. We discus the bound-free
absorption by neutral elements in the line of sight, resonance absorption lines
plus self-absorbed emission line components, collisionally excited emission
lines from the shock, He-like intersystem lines, and spectral changes during an
episode of high-amplitude variability. We find a decrease of the oxygen K-shell
absorption edge that can be explained by photoionization of oxygen. The
absorption component has average velocities of -1286+-267 km/s on day 39.7 and
of -771+-65 km/s on day 66.9. The wavelengths of the emission line components
are consistent with their rest wavelengths as confirmed by measurements of
non-self absorbed He-like intersystem lines. We have evidence that these lines
originate from the shock rather than the outer layers of the outflow and may be
photoexcited in addition to collisional excitations. We found collisionally
excited emission lines that are fading at wavelengths shorter than 15A that
originate from the radiatively cooling shock. On day 39.5 we find a systematic
blue shift of -526+-114 km/s from these lines. We found anomalous He-like f/i
ratios which indicates either high densities or significant UV radiation near
the plasma where the emission lines are formed. During the phase of strong
variability the spectral hardness light curve overlies the total light curve
when shifted by 1000sec. This can be explained by photoionization of neutral
oxygen in the line of sight if the densities of order 10^{10}-10^{11} cm^{-3}.
