Half life values for proton radioactivity in nuclei have been calculated in
the WKB approximation. The microscopic proton-nucleus potential has been
obtained by folding the densities of daughter nuclei with two microscopic NN
interactions, DDM3Y and JLM. The densities have been obtained in the
Relativistic Mean Field approach in the spherical approximation using the force
FSU Gold. No substantial modification of results has been observed if other
common forces are employed. The calculated results for the decays from the
ground state or the low-lying excited states in almost all the nuclei agree
well with experimental measurements. Reasons for large deviations in a few
cases have been discussed. Results in $^{109}$I and $^{112,113}$Cs show that
the effect of deformation is small contrary to earlier calculations.
Predictions for possible proton radioactivity have been made in two nuclei,
$^{93}$Ag and $^{97}$In.
