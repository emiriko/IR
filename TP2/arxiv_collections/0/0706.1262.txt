Combining the recent lattice calculation of $a_0(1450)$ and $\sigma(600)$
mesons with the overlap fermion in the chiral regime with the pion mass less
than $300 {\rm MeV}$, the quenched lattice calculation of the scalar glueball,
and the phenomenological study of the mixing of isoscalar scalar mesons
$f_0(1710)$, $f_0(1500)$, $f_0(1370)$ through their decays, a simple pattern
for the light scalar mesons begins to emerge. Below 1 GeV, the scalar mesons
form a nonet of tetraquark mesoniums. Above 1 GeV, the nonent $q\bar{q}$ mesons
are made of an octet with largely unbroken SU(3) symmetry and a fairly good
singlet which is $f_0(1370)$. $f_0(1710)$ is identified as an almost pure
scalar glueball with a $\sim 10%$ mixture of $q\bar{q}$.
