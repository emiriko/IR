Motivated by the work of Segal and Segal on the Black-Scholes pricing formula
in the quantum context, we study a quantum extension of the Black-Scholes
equation within the context of Hudson-Parthasarathy quantum stochastic
calculus. Our model includes stock markets described by quantum Brownian motion
and Poisson process.
