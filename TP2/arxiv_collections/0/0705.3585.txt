The contribution of gg->H+jets production process to the vector boson fusion
production of the Higgs boson, VV->H, at LHC was evaluated with the ALPGEN
generator and the PYTHIA shower Monte Carlo including a jet-parton matching
procedure. After the experimental like event selections applied at PYTHIA
particle level, the contribution was found to be 4-5 % for a Higgs boson mass
of 120 GeV.
