We present single pointing observations of SiO, HCO$^+$ and H$^{13}$CO$^+$
from the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope towards 23 massive star forming regions
previously known to contain molecular outflows and ultracompact HII regions. We
detected SiO towards 14 sources and suggest that the non-detections in the
other nine sources could be due to those outflows being older and without
ongoing shocks to replenish the SiO. We serendipitously detected SO$_2$ towards
17 sources in the same tuning as HCO$^+$. We detected HCO$^+$ towards all
sources, and suggest that it is tracing infall in nine cases. For seven infall
candidates, we estimate mass infall rates between 1$\times10^{-2}$ and
2$\times10^{-5}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. Seven sources show both SiO detections
(young outflows) and HCO$^+$ infall signatures. We also find that the abundance
of H$^{13}$CO$^+$ tends to increase along with the abundance of SiO in sources
for which we could determine abundances. We discuss these results with respect
to current theories of massive star formation via accretion. From this survey,
we suggest that perhaps both models of ionized accretion and halted accretion
may be important in describing the evolution of a massive protostar (or
protostars) beyond the formation of an HII region.
