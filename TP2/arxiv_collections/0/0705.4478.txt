We present preliminary results on sensitivity of experiments with slow
neutrons to constrain additional forces in a wide distance range: from
picometers to micrometers. In the sub-nanometer range, available data on
lengths of neutron scattering at nuclei provide the most competitive
constraint. We show that it can be improved significantly in a dedicated
measurement of asymmetry of neutron scattering at noble gases. In the
micrometer range, we present sensitivity of the future GRANIT experiment.
Further analysis will be presented in following publications.
