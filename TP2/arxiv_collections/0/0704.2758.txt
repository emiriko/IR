We propose a criterion for identifying the orientation of the X-line when two
regions of plasma with arbitrary densities, temperatures, and magnetic fields
undergo reconnection. The X-line points in the direction that maximizes the
(suitably-defined) Alfv\'en speed characterizing the reconnection outflow. For
many situations a good approximation is that the X-line bisects the angle
formed by the magnetic fields.
