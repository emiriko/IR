It has recently been suggested \cite{Chang:2006bm} that a reliable and
unambiguous definition of the non-perturbative massive quark condensate could
be provided by considering a non positive-definite class of solutions to the
Schwinger Dyson Equation for the quark propagator. In this paper we show that
this definition is incomplete without considering a third class of solutions.
Indeed, studying these three classes reveals a degeneracy of possible
condensate definitions leading to a whole range of values. However, we show
that the {\it physical} condensate may in fact be extracted by simple fitting
to the Operator Product Expansion, a procedure which is stabilised by
considering the three classes of solution together. We find that for current
quark masses in the range from zero to 25 MeV or so (defined at a scale of 2
GeV in the $\bar{MS}$ scheme), the dynamically generated condensate increases
from the chiral limit in a wide range of phenomenologically successful models
of the confining QCD interaction. Lastly, the role of a fourth class of noded
solutions is briefly discussed.
