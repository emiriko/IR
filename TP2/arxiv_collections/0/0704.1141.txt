Whether torsion plays or not a role in the description of the gravitational
interaction is a problem that can only be solved by experiment. This is,
however, a difficult task: since there are different possible interpretations
for torsion, there is no a model-independent way to look for it. In these
notes, two different possibilities will be reviewed, their consistency
analyzed, and the corresponding experimental outputs briefly discussed.
