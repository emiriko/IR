The observation of neutrino oscillations is clear evidence for physics beyond
the standard model. To make precise measurements of this phenomenon, neutrino
oscillation experiments, including MiniBooNE, require an accurate description
of neutrino charged current quasi-elastic (CCQE) cross sections to predict
signal samples. Using a high-statistics sample of muon neutrino CCQE events,
MiniBooNE finds that a simple Fermi gas model, with appropriate adjustments,
accurately characterizes the CCQE events observed in a carbon-based detector.
The extracted parameters include an effective axial mass, M_A^eff = 1.23+/-0.20
GeV, that describes the four-momentum dependence of the axial-vector form
factor of the nucleon; and a Pauli-suppression parameter, kappa =
1.019+/-0.011. Such a modified Fermi gas model may also be used by future
accelerator-based experiments measuring neutrino oscillations on nuclear
targets.
