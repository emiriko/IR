We propose a stochastic process wherein molecular transport is mediated by
asymmetric nucleation of domains on a one-dimensional substrate. Track-driven
mechanisms of molecular transport arise in biophysical applications such as
Holliday junction positioning and collagenase processivity. In contrast to
molecular motors that hydrolyze nucleotide triphosphates and undergo a local
molecular conformational change, we show that asymmetric nucleation of
hydrolysis waves on a track can also result in directed motion of an attached
particle. Asymmetrically cooperative kinetics between ``hydrolyzed'' and
``unhydrolyzed'' states on each lattice site generate moving domain walls that
push a particle sitting on the track. We use a novel fluctuating-frame,
finite-segment mean field theory to accurately compute steady-state velocities
of the driven particle and to discover parameter regimes which yield maximal
domain wall flux, leading to optimal particle drift.
