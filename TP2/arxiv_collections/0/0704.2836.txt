We present a synthetic spectral analysis of nearly the entire far ultraviolet
International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) archive of spectra of dwarf novae in
or near outburst. The study includes 46 systems of all dwarf nova subtypes both
above and below the period gap. The spectra were uniformly analyzed using
synthetic spectral codes for optically thick accretion disks and stellar
photospheres along with the best-available distance measurements or estimates.
We present newly estimated accretion rates and discuss the implications of our
study for disk accretion physics and CV evolution.
