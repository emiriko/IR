Multi-wavelength galaxy number counts provide clues on the nature of galaxy
evolution. The interpretation per galaxy type with the new code PEGASE.3 of the
12mu (ISO) and 24mu (Spitzer) faint galaxy counts provide new constraints on
the dust and stellar emission. It also reveals the nature of ULIRGs (L/Lsun >
10^12) and informs on the cosmic star formation history and the time-scales for
mass build-up. We firstly present the faint galaxy counts at 12um derived from
the catalogue of the ISO-ESO-Sculptor Survey (ISO-ESS) in a companion paper
(Seymour et al. 2007) which go down to 0.24 mJy after corrections for
incompleteness. We check that they are consistent with ISO number counts at
15um. Secondly we show that the ``normal'' scenarios which fit the deep
UV-optical-near-IR counts with PEGASE.2 (Fioc et al. 1999), are unsuccessful in
modelling the strong excess simultaneously observed in the cumulative and
differential counts at 12um, 15um and 24um. Based on observed 12mu and 25mu
IRAS luminosity functions and optical/mid-IR colors, we finally succeed in
modelling cumulative and differential counts by only changing 9% of normal
galaxies (1/3 of the ellipticals) into ultra-bright dusty elliptical galaxies,
interpreted as ULIRGs. This ULIRG population has similarities with high-z
radio-galaxy hosts. No number density evolution is included. The Herschel
observatory will hopefully confirm these results.
