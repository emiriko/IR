The notion of representative statistical ensembles, correctly representing
statistical systems, is strictly formulated. This notion allows for a proper
description of statistical systems, avoiding inconsistencies in theory. As an
illustration, a Bose-condensed system is considered. It is shown that a
self-consistent treatment of the latter, using a representative ensemble,
always yields a conserving and gapless theory.
