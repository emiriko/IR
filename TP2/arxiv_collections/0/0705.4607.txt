We introduce and solve a general model of dynamic response under external
perturbations. This model captures a wide range of systems out of equilibrium
including Ising models of physical systems, social opinions, and population
genetics. The distribution of states under perturbation and relaxation process
reflects two regimes -- one driven by the external perturbation, and one driven
by internal ordering. These regimes parallel the disordered and ordered regimes
of equilibrium physical systems driven by thermal perturbations but here are
shown to be relevant for non-thermal and non-equilibrium external influences on
complex biological and social systems. We extend our results to a wide range of
network topologies by introducing an effective strength of external
perturbation by analytic mean-field approximation. Simulations show this
generalization is remarkably accurate for many topologies of current interest
in describing real systems.
