The amplitude of zero angle scattering of electron on photon in the 3-rd QED
order of fine structure constant with $\gamma^*\gamma$ intermediate state
converting into quark--antiquark is considered. Utilizing analytic properties
of elastic photon--photon scattering amplitude an explicit expression for
differential cross- section of quark--antiquark pair production at
electron-photon collision in peripheral kinematics is derived apparently.
Limiting case of small transferred momenta with an application of the
Weizs\"acker-Williams like relation gives the sum rule for photon target,
bringing into the relation the sum of ratios of the four power of the quark
charges to squared quark masses with integral over the total $\gamma\gamma \to
2 jets$ cross--section.
