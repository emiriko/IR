We study the high--energy limit for eigenfunctions of the laplacian, on a
compact negatively curved manifold. We review the recent result of
Anantharaman-Nonnenmacher giving a lower bound on the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy
of semiclassical measures, and improve this lower bound in the case of variable
negative curvature.
