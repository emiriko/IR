We numerically investigated the connection between isobaric fragility and the
properties of high-order stationary points of the potential energy surface in
different supercooled Lennard-Jones mixtures. The increase of effective
activation energies upon supercooling appears to be driven by the increase of
average potential energy barriers measured by the energy dependence of the
fraction of unstable modes. Such an increase is sharper, the more fragile is
the mixture. Correlations between fragility and other properties of high-order
stationary points, including the vibrational density of states and the
localization features of unstable modes, are also discussed.
