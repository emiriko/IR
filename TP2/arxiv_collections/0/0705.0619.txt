Further experiments showed the incorrectness of proposed interpretation. We
have studied an in-plane resonant photo-response of an integer quantum Hall
system in which time-reversal and parity symmetries are broken. The response of
initially homogeneous system exhibits a complicate spatial structure sensitive
to the system macroscopic sizes. Conceptually, the effect is explained by the
large-scale quantum entanglement originated from an indistinguishable particle
statistics. The concept is supported by the demonstration of
entanglement-related transfer of information in the system interior.
