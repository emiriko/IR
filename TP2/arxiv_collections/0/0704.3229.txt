We present the results from an optical spectroscopic analysis of the massive
stars HD 37366 and HD 54662. We find that HD 37366 is a double-lined
spectroscopic binary with a period of 31.8187 +/- 0.0004 days, and HD 54662 is
also a double lined binary with a much longer period of 557.8 +/- 0.3 days. The
primary of HD 37366 is classified as O9.5 V, and it contributes approximately
two-thirds of the optical flux. The less luminous secondary is a broad-lined,
early B-type main-sequence star. Tomographic reconstruction of the individual
spectra of HD 37366 reveals absorption lines present in each component,
enabling us to constrain the nature of the secondary and physical
characteristics of both stars. Tomographic reconstruction was not possible for
HD 54662; however, we do present mean spectra from our observations that show
that the secondary component is approximately half as bright as the primary.
The observed spectral energy distributions (SEDs) were fit with model SEDs and
galactic reddening curves to determine the angular sizes of the stars. By
assuming radii appropriate for their classifications, we determine distance
ranges of 1.4 - 1.9 and 1.2 - 1.5 kpc for HD 37366 and HD 54662, respectively.
