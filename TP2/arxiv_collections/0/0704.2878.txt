We propose quantum dynamics for the dipole moving in cosmic string background
and show that the classical scale symmetry of a particle moving in cosmic
string background is still restored even in the presence of dipole moment of
the particle. However, we show that the classical scale symmetry is broken due
to inequivalent quantization of the the non-relativistic system. The
consequence of this quantum anomaly is the formation of bound state in the
interval \xi\in(-1,1). The inequivalent quantization is characterized by a
1-parameter family of self-adjoint extension parameter \Sigma. We show that
within the interval \xi\in(-1,1), cosmic string with zero radius can bind the
dipole and the dipole does not fall into the singularity.
