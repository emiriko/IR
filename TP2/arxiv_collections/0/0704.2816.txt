The six Higgs doublet model is a minimal extension of the Standard Model that
addresses dark matter and gauge coupling unification. Another Higgs doublet in
a 5 representation of a discrete symmetry group, such as S_6, is added to the
SM. The lightest components of the 5-Higgs are neutral, stable and serve as
dark matter so long as the discrete symmetry is not broken. Direct and indirect
detection signals, as well as collider signatures are discussed. The five-fold
multiplicity of the dark matter decreases its mass and typically helps make the
dark matter more visible in upcoming experiments.
