Clumping in the winds of massive stars may significantly reduce empirical
mass-loss rates, and which in turn may have a large impact on our understanding
of massive star evolution. Here, we investigate wind-clumping through the
linear polarization induced by light scattering off the clumps. Through the use
of an analytic wind clumping model, we predict the time evolution of the linear
polarimetry over a large parameter space. We concentrate on the Luminous Blue
Variables, which display the greatest amount of polarimetric variability and
for which we recently conducted a spectropolarimetric survey. Our model results
indicate that the observed level of polarimetric variability can be reproduced
for two regimes of parameter space: one of a small number of massive,
optically-thick clumps; and one of a very large number of low-mass clumps.
Although a systematic time-resolved monitoring campaign is required to
distinguish between the two scenarios, we currently favour the latter, given
the short timescale of the observed polarization variability. As the
polarization is predicted to scale linearly with mass-loss rate, we anticipate
that all hot stars with very large mass-loss rates should display polarimetric
variability. This is consistent with recent findings that intrinsic
polarization is more common in stars with strong H$\alpha$ emission.
