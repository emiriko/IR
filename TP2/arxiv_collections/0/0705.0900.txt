In this talk I review the connections between Feynman integrals and multiple
polylogarithms. After an introductory section on loop integrals I discuss the
Mellin-Barnes transformation and shuffle algebras. In a subsequent section
multiple polylogarithms are introduced. Finally, I discuss how certain Feynman
integrals evaluate to multiple polylogarithms.
