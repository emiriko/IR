Monoatomic layers of graphite can be electrically contacted and used as
building blocks for new promising devices. These experiment are today possible
thanks to the fact that very thin graphite can be identified on a dielectric
substrate using a simple optical microscope. We investigate the mechanism
behind the strong visibility of graphite and we discuss the importance of the
substrate and of the microcope objective used for the imaging.
