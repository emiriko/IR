We study triplet pairing correlations in clean Ferromagnet (F)/Superconductor
(S) nanojunctions, via fully self consistent solution of the Bogoliubov-de
Gennes equations. We consider FSF trilayers, with S being an s-wave
superconductor, and an arbitrary angle $\alpha$ between the magnetizations of
the two F layers. We find that contrary to some previous expectations, triplet
correlations, odd in time, are induced in both the S and F layers in the clean
limit. We investigate their behavior as a function of time, position, and
$\alpha$. The triplet amplitudes are largest at times on the order of the
inverse ``Debye'' frequency, and at that time scale they are long ranged in
both S and F. The zero temperature condensation energy is found to be lowest
when the magnetizations are antiparallel.
