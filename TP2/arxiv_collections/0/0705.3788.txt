We consider backward stochastic differential equations (BSDE) with nonlinear
generators typically of quadratic growth in the control variable. A measure
solution of such a BSDE will be understood as a probability measure under which
the generator is seen as vanishing, so that the classical solution can be
reconstructed by a combination of the operations of conditioning and using
martingale representations. In case the terminal condition is bounded and the
generator fulfills the usual continuity and boundedness conditions, we show
that measure solutions with equivalent measures just reinterpret classical
ones. In case of terminal conditions that have only exponentially bounded
moments, we discuss a series of examples which show that in case of
non-uniqueness classical solutions that fail to be measure solutions can
coexists with different measure solutions.
