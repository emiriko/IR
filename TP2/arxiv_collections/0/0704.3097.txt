We present an examination of the kinematics and stellar populations of a
sample of 3 Brightest Group Galaxies (BGGs) and 3 Brightest Cluster Galaxies
(BCGs) in X-ray groups and clusters. We have obtained high signal-to-noise
Gemini/GMOS (Gemini South Multi-Object Spectrograph) long-slit spectra of these
galaxies and use Lick indices to determine ages, metallicities and
alpha-element abundance ratios out to at least their effective radii. We find
that the BGGs and BCGs have very uniform masses, central ages and central
metallicities. Examining the radial dependence of their stellar populations, we
find no significant velocity dispersion, age, or alpha-enhancement gradients.
However, we find a wide range of metallicity gradients, suggesting a variety of
formation mechanisms. The range of metallicity gradients observed is surprising
given the homogeneous environment these galaxies probe and their uniform
central stellar populations. However, our results are inconsistent with any
single model of galaxy formation and emphasize the need for more theoretical
understanding of both the origins of metallicity gradients and galaxy formation
itself. We postulate two possible physical causes for the different formation
mechanisms.
