In hep-th/0703135, they have found the type IIA intersecting brane
configuration where there exist three NS5-branes, D4-branes and anti-D4-branes.
By analyzing the gravitational interaction for the D4-branes in the background
of the NS5-branes, the phase structures in different regions of the parameter
space were studied in the context of classical string theory. In this paper, by
adding the orientifold 4-plane and 6-plane to the above brane configuration, we
describe the intersecting brane configurations of type IIA string theory
corresponding to the meta-stable nonsupersymmetric vacua of these gauge
theories.
