The dynamics of receding contact lines is investigated experimentally through
controlled perturbations of a meniscus in a dip coating experiment. We first
characterize stationary menisci and their breakdown at the coating transition.
It is then shown that the dynamics of both liquid deposition and
long-wavelength perturbations adiabatically follow these stationary states.
This provides a first experimental access to the entire bifurcation diagram of
dynamical wetting, confirming the hydrodynamic theory developed in Part 1. In
contrast to quasi-static theories based on a dynamic contact angle, we
demonstrate that the transition strongly depends on the large scale flow
geometry. We then establish the dispersion relation for large wavenumbers, for
which we find that sigma is linear in q. The speed dependence of sigma is well
described by hydrodynamic theory, in particular the absence of diverging
time-scales at the critical point. Finally, we highlight some open problems
related to contact angle hysteresis that lead beyond the current description.
