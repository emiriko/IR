A charge injection technique is applied to the X-ray CCD camera, XIS (X-ray
Imaging Spectrometer) onboard Suzaku. The charge transfer inefficiency (CTI) in
each CCD column (vertical transfer channel) is measured by the injection of
charge packets into a transfer channel and subsequent readout. This paper
reports the performances of the charge injection capability based on the ground
experiments using a radiation damaged device, and in-orbit measurements of the
XIS. The ground experiments show that charges are stably injected with the
dispersion of 91eV in FWHM in a specific column for the charges equivalent to
the X-ray energy of 5.1keV. This dispersion width is significantly smaller than
that of the X-ray events of 113eV (FWHM) at approximately the same energy. The
amount of charge loss during transfer in a specific column, which is measured
with the charge injection capability, is consistent with that measured with the
calibration source. These results indicate that the charge injection technique
can accurately measure column-dependent charge losses rather than the
calibration sources. The column-to-column CTI correction to the calibration
source spectra significantly reduces the line widths compared to those with a
column-averaged CTI correction (from 193eV to 173eV in FWHM on an average at
the time of one year after the launch). In addition, this method significantly
reduces the low energy tail in the line profile of the calibration source
spectrum.
