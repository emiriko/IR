We study the thermal entanglement of a 2-qutrit spin chain with nonlinear
coupling in the presence of nonuniform magnetic field. Thermal entanglement of
an arbitrary (finite dimensional) m-partite system vanishes at some finite
threshold temperature T_s. We investigate the dependence of T_s on the system's
parameters, i.e. the nonlinear coupling and the magnetic field, for this
2-qutrit system. In addition, we compare two lower bounds of I-concurrence for
this system and also study its dense coding capacity as a function of system's
parameters.
