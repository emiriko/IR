Here we present a system of coupled phase oscillators with nearest neighbors
coupling, which we study for different boundary conditions. We concentrate at
the transition to total synchronization. We are able to develop exact solutions
for the value of the coupling parameter when the system becomes completely
synchronized, for the case of periodic boundary conditions as well as for an
open chain with fixed ends. We compare the results with those calculated
numerically.
