We review recent advances in our understanding of massive stars through the
analysis of their spectra. Improvements in model atmospheres and analysis
methods are briefly discussed. Results obtained for stars in the Local Group
are compared and the present status of different open questions, like the
temperature scale of OB stars, the Wind Momentum-Luminosity Relation or the
stellar rotation, is outlined.
