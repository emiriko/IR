Dispersive readouts for superconducting qubits have the advantage of speed
and minimal invasiveness. We have developed such an amplifier, the Cavity
Bifurcation Amplifier (CBA) [10], and applied it to the readout of the
quantronium qubit [2]. It consists of a Josephson junction embedded in a
microwave on-chip resonator. In contrast with the Josephson bifurcation
amplifier [17], which has an on-chip capacitor shunting a junction, the
resonator is based on a simple coplanar waveguide imposing a pre-determined
frequency and whose other RF characteristics like the quality factor are easily
controlled and optimized. Under proper microwave irradiation conditions, the
CBA has two metastable states. Which state is adopted by the CBA depends on the
state of a quantronium qubit coupled to the CBA's junction. Due to the MHz
repetition rate and large signal to noise ratio we can show directly that the
coherence is limited by 1/f gate charge noise when biased at the sweet spot - a
point insensitive to first order gate charge fluctuations. This architecture
lends itself to scalable quantum computing using a multi-resonator chip with
multiplexed readouts.
