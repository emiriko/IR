We address Fano-like interference effects in scanning tunneling microscopy
(STM) measurements of nanoscale systems, e.g. two-level systems. Common for
these systems is that second order tunneling contributions give rise to
interference effects that cause suppressed transmission through the system for
certain energies. The suppressed transmission is measurable either in the
differential conductance or in the bias voltage derivative thereof.
