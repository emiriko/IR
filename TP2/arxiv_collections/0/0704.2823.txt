We study the phase diagram of quark matter and nuclear properties based on
the strong coupling expansion of lattice QCD. Both of baryon and finite
coupling correction are found to have effects to extend the hadron phase to a
larger mu direction relative to Tc. In a chiral RMF model with logarithmic
sigma potential derived in the strong coupling limit of lattice QCD, we can
avoid the chiral collapse and normal and hypernuclei properties are well
described.
