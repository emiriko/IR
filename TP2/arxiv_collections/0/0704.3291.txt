We compute the dependence of the tunneling current in a double point contact
in the k=3 Read-Rezayi state (which is conjectured to describe an
incompressible quantum hall fluid at filling fraction nu=12/5) on voltage,
separation between the two contacts, and temperature. Using the tunneling
hamiltonian of cond-mat/0607431, we show that the effect of quasiholes in the
bulk region between the two contacts is simply an overall constant multiplying
the interference term. This is the same effect as found for the differential
conductivity in cond-mat/0601242; the difference is that we do an actual edge
theory calculation and compute the full current-voltage curve at weak
tunneling.
