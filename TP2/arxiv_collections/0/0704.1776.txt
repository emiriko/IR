Photoproduction of pi0 mesons was studied with the Crystal-Barrel detector at
ELSA for incident energies from 300 MeV to 3 GeV. Differential cross sections d
sigma /d Omega, d sigma/d t, and the total cross section are presented. For
E(gamma) < 3 GeV, the angular distributions agree well with the SAID
parametrization. At photon energies above 1.5 GeV, a strong forward peaking
indicates t-channel exchange to be the dominant process. The rapid variations
of the cross section with energy and angle indicate production of resonances.
An interpretation of the data within the Bonn-Gatchina partial wave analysis is
briefly discussed.
