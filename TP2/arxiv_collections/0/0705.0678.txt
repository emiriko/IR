The fluctuations of the largest fragment charge of a partition and of the
charge asymmetries of the two or three largest fragments in spectator decays
following 197Au + 197Au collisions at 1000 MeV per nucleon are investigated.
The observed bimodal distributions at specific values of the sorting variable
Z_bound exhibit features known from percolation theory where they appear as
finite-size effects. The underlying configurational fluctuations seem generic
for fragmentation processes in small systems.
