The generator coordinate (GC) method is a variational approach to the quantum
many-body problem in which interacting many-body wave functions are constructed
as superpositions of (generally nonorthogonal) eigenstates of auxiliary
Hamiltonians containing a deformation parameter. This paper presents a
time-dependent extension of the GC method as a new approach to improve existing
approximations of the exchange-correlation (XC) potential in time-dependent
density-functional theory (TDDFT). The time-dependent GC method is shown to be
a conceptually and computationally simple tool to build memory effects into any
existing adiabatic XC potential. As an illustration, the method is applied to
driven parametric oscillations of two interacting electrons in a harmonic
potential (Hooke's atom). It is demonstrated that a proper choice of
time-dependent generator coordinates in conjunction with the adiabatic
local-density approximation reproduces the exact linear and nonlinear
two-electron dynamics quite accurately, including features associated with
double excitations that cannot be captured by TDDFT in the adiabatic
approximation.
