We present a solid state implementation of quantum computation, which
improves previously proposed optically driven schemes. Our proposal is based on
vertical arrays of quantum dots embedded in a mesoporous material which can be
fabricated with present technology. The redundant encoding typical of the
chosen hardware protects the computation against gate errors and the effects of
measurement induced noise. The system parameters required for quantum
computation applications are calculated for II-VI and III-V materials and found
to be within the experimental range. The proposed hardware may help minimize
errors due to polydispersity of dot sizes, which is at present one of the main
problems in relation to quantum dot-based quantum computation.
