We present radio continuum observations at 7 mm made using the Very Large
Array towards three massive star forming regions thought to be in very early
stages of evolution selected from the sample of Sridharan et al. (2002).
Emission was detected towards all three sources (IRAS 18470-0044, IRAS
19217+1651 and IRAS 23151+5912). We find that in all cases the 7 mm emission
corresponds to thermal emission from ionized gas. The regions of ionized gas
associated with IRAS 19217+1651 and IRAS 23151+5912 are hypercompact with
diameters of 0.009 and 0.0006 pc, and emission measures of 7.0 x 10^8 and 2.3 x
10^9 pc cm^(-6), respectively.
