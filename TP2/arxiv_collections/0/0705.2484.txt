A diagnostics method based on a continuous wavelet transform is proposed.
This method makes it possible to diagnose the presence of synchronization of
the oscillations of a self-excited oscillator locked by an external force with
a linearly modulated frequency and to distinguish such a situation from the
case when an external signal leaks into self-oscillations; i.e., the signals
are summed without a change in the self-oscillation frequency. The method's
efficiency is shown with the use of a Van der Pol generator and experimental
physiological data as examples.
