The semiclassical formula for the quantum propagator in the coherent state
representation $<\mathbf{z}'' | e^{-i\hat{H}T/\hbar} | \mathbf{z}'>$ is not
free from the problem of caustics. These are singular points along the complex
classical trajectories specified by $\mathbf{z}'$, $\mathbf{z}''$ and $T$ where
the usual quadratic approximation fails, leading to divergences in the
semiclassical formula. In this paper we derive third order approximations for
this propagator that remain finite in the vicinity of caustics. We use Maslov's
method and the dual representation proposed in Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 95},
050405 (2005) to derive uniform, regular and transitional semiclassical
approximations for coherent state propagator in systems with two degrees of
freedom.
