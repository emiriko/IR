By analyzing the relationships between a socioeconomical system modeled
through evolutionary game theory and a physical system modeled through quantum
mechanics we show how although both systems are described through two theories
apparently different both are analogous and thus exactly equivalents. The
extensions of quantum mechanics to statistical physics and information theory
let us use some of their definitions for the best understanding of the behavior
of economics and biology. The quantum analogue of the replicator dynamics is
the von Neumann equation. A system in where all its members are in Nash
equilibrium is equivalent to a system in a maximum entropy state. Nature is a
game in where its players compete for a common welfare and the equilibrium of
the system that they are members. They act as a whole besides individuals like
they obey a rule in where they prefer to work for the welfare of the collective
besides the individual welfare.
