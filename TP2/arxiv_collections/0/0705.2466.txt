The arrival directions of ultrahigh energy extensive air showers (EAS) by
Yakutsk, AGASA and SUGAR array data are considered. For the first time, the
maps of equal exposition of celestial sphere for the distribution of particles
by AGASA and SUGAR array data have been constructed. The large-scale anisotropy
of E>4.10^19 eV cosmic rays from the side of Input and Output of the Galaxy
Local Arm by Yakutsk, AGASA and SUGAR array data has been detected. The problem
of cosmic ray origin is discussed.
