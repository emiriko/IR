We calculate modifications to the scalar Casimir force between two parallel
plates due to space-time non-commutativity. We devise a heuristic approach to
overcome the difficulties of describing boundaries in non-commutative theories
and predict that boundary corrections are of the same order as non-commutative
volume corrections. Further, both corrections have the form of more
conventional finite surface effects.
