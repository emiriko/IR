I propose a scheme for reconstructing the weak value of an observable without
the need for weak measurements. The post-selection in weak measurements is
replaced by an initial projector measurement. The observable can be measured
using any form of interaction, including projective measurements. The
reconstruction is effected by measuring the change in the expectation value of
the observable due to the projector measurement. The weak value may take
nonclassical values if the projector measurement disturbs the expectation value
of the observable.
