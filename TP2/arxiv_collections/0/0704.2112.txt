Dissipation-free current transport in high-temperature superconductors is one
of the most crucial properties of this class of materials which is directly
related to the effective inhibition of flux line movement by defect structures.
In this respect epitaxially grown thin films of YBa2Cu3O7-d (YBCO) are proving
to be the strongest candidates for many widescale applications that are close
to realization. We show that the relation between different defect structures
and flux line pinning in these films exhibits universal features which are
clearly displayed in a detailed analysis of the temperature-dependent behaviour
of local critical currents. This allows us to identify different pinning
mechanisms at different temperatures to be responsible for the found critical
currents. Additionally, the presence of grain boundaries with very low
misorientation angles affects the temperature stability of the critical
currents which has important consequences for future applications.
