The machinery of qubit-portraits of qudit states, recently presented, is
consider here in more details in order to characterize the presence of quantum
correlations in bipartite qudit states. In the tomographic representation of
quantum mechanics, Bell-like inequalities are interpreted as peculiar
properties of a family of classical joint probability distributions which
describe the quantum state of two qudits. By means of the qubit-portraits
machinery a semigroup of stochastic matrices can be associated to a given
quantum state. The violation of the CHSH inequalities is discussed in this
framework with some examples, we found that quantum correlations in qutrit
isotropic states can be detected by the suggested method while it cannot in the
case of qutrit Werner states.
