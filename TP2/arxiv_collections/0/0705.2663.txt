We investigate the mm-morphology of IC1396N with unprecedented spatial
resolution to analyze its dust and molecular gas properties, and draw
comparisons with objects of similar mass. We have carried out sensitive
observations in the most extended configurations of the IRAM Plateau de Bure
interferometer, to map the thermal dust emission at 3.3 and 1.3mm, and the
emission from the $J$=13$_k\to12_k$ hyperfine transitions of methyl cyanide
(CH$_3$CN). We unveil the existence of a sub-cluster of hot cores in IC1396N,
distributed in a direction perpendicular to the emanating outflow. The cores
are embedded in a common envelope of extended and diffuse dust emission. We
find striking differences in the dust properties of the cores ($\beta\simeq$ 0)
and the surrounding envelope ($\beta\simeq$ 1), very likely testifying to
differences in the formation and processing of dust material. The CH$_3$CN
emission peaks towards the most massive hot core and is marginally extended in
the outflow direction.
