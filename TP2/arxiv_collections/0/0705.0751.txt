An approximate textual retrieval algorithm for searching sources with high
levels of defects is presented. It considers splitting the words in a query
into two overlapping segments and subsequently building composite regular
expressions from interlacing subsets of the segments. This procedure reduces
the probability of missed occurrences due to source defects, yet diminishes the
retrieval of irrelevant, non-contextual occurrences.
