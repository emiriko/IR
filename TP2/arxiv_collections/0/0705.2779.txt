A new catalogue of extended radio sources has been prepared based on
arcminute-resolution 1420 MHz images from the Canadian Galactic Plane Survey
(CGPS). The new catalogue provides both 1420 MHz and 408 MHz flux density
measurements on sources found near the Galactic plane in the second quadrant of
our Galaxy. In addition cross-identifications are made with other major radio
catalogues and information is provided to facilitate the recovery of CGPS image
data associated with each catalogued source. Numerous new radio sources are
identified and the catalogue provides a comprehensive summary of both newly
discovered and previously known HII regions and supernova remnants in the outer
Galaxy. The catalogue should be of use both for synoptic studies of Galactic
structure and for placing higher resolution observations, at radio and other
wavelengths, in context.
