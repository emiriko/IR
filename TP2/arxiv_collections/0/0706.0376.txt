The exchange bias (EB) in LaMn_{0.7}Fe_{0.3}O_3 is observed by the negative
shift and training effect of the hysteresis loops, while the sample was cooled
in external magnetic field. The analysis of cooling field dependence of EB
gives the size of the ferromagnetic (FM) cluster ~ 25 Angstrom, where the
magnetic anisotropy of FM cluster is found two order of magnitude higher than
the FM bulk manganites. We propose that the nanoscale FM clusters are embedded
in the glassy magnetic host with EB at the FM/glassy magnetic interface.
