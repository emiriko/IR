A high precision search for direct CP-violation in K+- --> 3 pi decays was
performed by the NA48/2 experiment at CERN SPS. The asymmetry in the Dalitz
plot linear slopes A_g = (g^+ - g^-)/(g^+ + g^-) is measured to be A^c_g =
(-1.3 +- 2.3)x10^-4 by studying ~3.1x10^9 K+- --> pi+- pi+ pi- decays and A^n_g
= (2.1 +- 1.9)x10^-4 by studying ~91x10^6 K+- --> pi+- pi0 pi0 decays. The
unique double- beam system, the design of the detectors and the method of
analysis provide good control of the instrumental charge asymmetries and allow
to keep the precision of the result limited by statistics, reaching accuracy
one order of magnitude better than in previous experiments.
