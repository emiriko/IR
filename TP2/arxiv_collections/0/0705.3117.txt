The diffusion contribution of the hole-hole interaction to the conductivity
is analyzed in gated GaAs/In$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$As/GaAs heterostructures. We show
that the change of the interaction correction to the conductivity with the
decreasing Drude conductivity results both from the compensation of the singlet
and triplet channels and from the arising prefactor $\alpha_i<1$ in the
conventional expression for the interaction correction.
