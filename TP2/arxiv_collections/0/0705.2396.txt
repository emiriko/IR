In 1929 Heisenberg and Pauli laid the foundations of QFT by quantizing the
fields (method of canonical quantization). This general theory of quantized
fields has remained undisputed up to now. We show how the unmodified
Heisenberg-Pauli calculations make sense mathematically by using a theory of
generalized functions adapted to nonlinear operations. By providing an
appropriate mathematical setting, nonlinear generalized functions open doors
for their understanding but there remains presumably very hard technical
problems. (i) Domains of the interacting field operators: a priori the H-P
calculations give time dependent dense domains, what is not very convenient;
(ii) Calculations of the resulting matrix elements of the S operator: from the
unitarity of the S operator as a whole there are no longer ``infinities,'' but
a priori there is no other hope than heavy computer calculations; (iii)
Connection with renormalization theory: it should provide an approximation when
the coupling constant is small. The aim of this paper is to present, on the
grounds of a standard mathematical model of QFT (a self interacting scalar
boson field), a basis for improvement without significant prerequisites in
mathematics and physics. It is an attempt to use nonlinear generalized
functions in QFT, starting directly from the calculations made by physicists,
in the same way as they have already been used in classical mechanics and
general relativity.
