We measured the optical properties of mixed valent vanadium oxide nanoscrolls
and their metal exchanged derivatives in order to investigate the charge
dynamics in these compounds. In contrast to the prediction of a metallic state
for the metal exchanged derivatives within a rigid band model, we find that the
injected charges in Mn$^{2+}$ exchanged vanadium oxide nanoscrolls are pinned.
A low-energy electronic excitation associated with the pinned carriers appears
in the far infrared and persists at low temperature, suggesting that the
nanoscrolls are weak metals in their bulk form, dominated by inhomogeneous
charge disproportionation and Madelung energy effects.
