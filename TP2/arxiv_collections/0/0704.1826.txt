We present an extensive analysis of squark and gaugino hadroproduction and
decays in non-minimal flavour violating supersymmetry. We employ the so-called
super-CKM basis to define the possible misalignment of quark and squark
rotations, and we use generalized (possibly complex) charges to define the
mutual couplings of (s)quarks and gauge bosons/gauginos. The cross sections for
all squark-(anti-)squark/gaugino pair and squark-gaugino associated production
processes as well as their decay widths are then given in compact analytic
form. For four different constrained supersymmetry breaking models with
non-minimal flavour violation in the second/third generation squark sector
only, we establish the parameter space regions allowed/favoured by low-energy,
electroweak precision, and cosmological constraints and display the chirality
and flavour decomposition of all up- and down-type squark mass eigenstates.
Finally, we compute numerically the dependence of a representative sample of
production cross sections at the LHC on the off-diagonal mass matrix elements
in the experimentally allowed/favoured ranges.
