In this article we study the thermal response functions for two
one-dimensional models, namely the Hubbard and spin-less fermion $t$-$V$
models. By exactly diagonalizing finite sized systems we calculate dynamical
electrical, thermoelectrical, and thermal conductivities via the Kubo
formalism. The thermopower (Seebeck coefficient), Lorenz number, and
dimensionless figure of merit are then constructed which are quantities of
great interest to the physics community both theoretically and experimentally.
We also geometrically frustrate these systems and destroy integrability by the
inclusion of a second neighbor hop. These frustrated systems are shown to have
enhanced thermopower and Lorenz number at intermediate and low temperatures.
