This thesis studies some examples of families of K3 surfaces with Picard
lattices of maximal rank. These families occur as invariants of finite
automorphism groups. The Picard-Fuchs differential equations describing the
variation of Hodge structure in these families are considered. Techniques are
developed to find the corresponding monodromy groups as arithmetic Fuchsian
groups acting on the families' period spaces.
