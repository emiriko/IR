We review studies of QCD thermodynamics by lattice QCD simulations with
dynamical Wilson quarks. After explaining the basic properties of QCD with
Wilson quarks at finite temperature including the phase structure and the
scaling properties around the chiral phase transition, we discuss the critical
temperature, the equation of state and heavy-quark free energies.
