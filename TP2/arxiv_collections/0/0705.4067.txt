We prove that adiabatic computation is equivalent to standard quantum
computation even when the adiabatic quantum system is restricted to be a set of
particles on a one-dimensional chain. We give a construction that uses a
2-local Hamiltonian on nearest neighbors using particles that can have ten
distinct states. This implies a construction of a one-dimensional chain of
qubits in which the Hamiltonian is 6-local. We adapt this construction to show
that the 2-local Hamiltonian for 13-state particles is QMA-complete which in
turn implies that the 8-local Hamiltonian restricted to a one-dimensional chain
of qubits is QMA-complete.
