We show that the little hierarchy problem can be solved in the no-scale
supergravity framework. In this model the supersymmetry breaking scale is
generated when the electroweak symmetry breaking condition is satisfied and
therefore, unlike usual supersymmetric models, the correlation between the
electroweak symmetry breaking scale and the average stop mass scale can be
justified. This correlation solves the little hierarchy puzzle. Using minimal
supergravity boundary conditions, we find that the parameter space predicted by
no-scale supergravity is allowed by all possible experimental constraints. The
predicted values of supersymmetric particle masses are low enough to be very
easily accessible at the LHC. This parameter space will also be probed in the
upcoming results from the dark matter direct detection experiments.
