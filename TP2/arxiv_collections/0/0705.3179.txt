We investigate quantum fluctuations in the non-local resistance of an open
quantum dot which is connected to four reservoirs via quantum point contacts.
In this four-terminal quantum dot the voltage path can be separated from the
current path. We measured non-local resistance fluctuations of several hundreds
of Ohms, which have been characterized as a function of bias voltage, gate
voltage and perpendicular magnetic field. The amplitude of the resistance
fluctuations is strongly reduced when the coupling between the voltage probes
and the dot is enhanced. Along with experimental results, we present a
theoretical analysis based on the Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker formalism. While the
theory predicts non-local resistance fluctuations of considerably larger
amplitude than what has been observed, agreement with theory is very good if an
additional dephasing mechanism is assumed.
