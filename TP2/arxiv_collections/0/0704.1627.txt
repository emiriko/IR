Planetary topography can either be modeled as a load supported by the
lithosphere, or as a dynamical effect due to lithospheric flexure caused by
mantle convection. In both cases the response of the lithosphere to external
forces can be calculated with the theory of thin elastic plates or shells. On
one-plate planets the spherical geometry of the lithospheric shell plays an
important role in the flexure mechanism. So far the equations governing the
deformations and stresses of a spherical shell have only been derived under the
assumption of a shell of constant thickness. However local studies of gravity
and topography data suggest large variations in the thickness of the
lithosphere. In this article we obtain the scalar flexure equations governing
the deformations of a thin spherical shell with variable thickness or variable
Young's modulus. The resulting equations can be solved in succession, except
for a system of two simultaneous equations, the solutions of which are the
transverse deflection and an associated stress function. In order to include
bottom loading generated by mantle convection, we extend the method of stress
functions to include loads with a toroidal tangential component. We further
show that toroidal tangential displacement always occurs if the shell thickness
varies, even in the absence of toroidal loads. We finally prove that the
degree-one harmonic components of the transverse deflection and of the toroidal
tangential displacement are independent of the elastic properties of the shell
and are associated with translational and rotational freedom. The flexure
equations for a shell of variable thickness are useful not only for the
prediction of the gravity signal in local admittance studies, but also for the
construction of stress maps in tectonic analysis.
