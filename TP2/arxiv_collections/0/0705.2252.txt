In a particular variant of Kaluza-Klein theory, the so-called induced-matter
theory (IMT), it is shown that any configuration of matter may be geometrically
induced from a five-dimensional vacuum space. By using a similar approach we
show that any distribution of charges and currents may also be induced from a
five-dimensional vacuum space. Whereas in the case of IMT the geometry is
Riemannian and the fundamental equations are the five-dimensional Einstein
equations in vacuum, here we consider a Minkowskian geometry and the
five-dimensional Maxwell equations in vacuum.
