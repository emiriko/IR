We have had several talks recently reviewing 11 years of exoplanet
discoveries through radial velocity variations, or from transits, or from
microlensing. More than 200 exoplanets have been found, including some around
pulsars that we do not discuss here.
  My physical definition for a planet is a roughly spherical, self-gravitating
body more massive than 10**26 g formed from the leftover material in a
protostellar disk after the protostar forms. Radiation from the protostar
pushes the inner wall of the disk outward. The material agglomerates and forms
planets in radial sequence. The outer planets are formed slowly by classical
dynamical mechanisms acting in the snow zone. Planets have dense cores because
of agglomeration.
  Not one of the exoplanets discovered thus far is a planet. They are
cryptoplanets formed from matter ejected by protostars. When protostars have
excessive infall at high latitudes, they partially balance angular momentum
through outflow at the equator as they spin up. The ejected matter is trapped
in the magnetic torus formed between the star and the disk, like a tokamak. The
tokamak eventully reconnects and magnetic compression forms self-gravitating
remnants trapped and compressed by a closed spherical magnetic field,
spheromaks. Cooled spheromaks are cryptoplanets. They orbit near the star. They
can merge with each other or fall into the star or be ejected. They can grow by
accreting gas. They have a low density core and abundances characteristic of
the protostar. Their masses, radii, densities, and orbits are random, and are
inconsistent with the parameters for planets. They tend to have lower density
than planets.
