Relativistic self-consistent-field calculations of the radial hyperfine
integrals have been performed in the 4d-shell element ions. The comparison with
available experimental results gives an estimate of configuration interaction
effects in the hyperfine interaction in these ions. The results can also be
used to derive nuclear moments from laserspectroscopic measurements of
radioactive isotopes.
