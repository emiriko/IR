We derive a criterion on the measurability / identifiability of
Multiple--Input Multiple--Output (MIMO) channels based on the size of the
so-called spreading support of its subchannels. Novel MIMO transmission
techniques provide high-capacity communication channels in time-varying
environments and exact knowledge of the transmission channel operator is of key
importance when trying to transmit information at a rate close to channel
capacity.
