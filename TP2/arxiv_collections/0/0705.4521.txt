We investigate the dynamics of a relativistic electron in a strongly
nonlinear plasma wave in terms of classical mechanics by taking into account
the action of the radiative reaction force. The two limiting cases are
considered. In the first case where the energy of the accelerated electrons is
low, the electron makes many betatron oscillations during the acceleration. In
the second case where the energy of the accelerated electrons is high, the
betatron oscillation period is longer than the electron residence time in the
accelerating phase. We show that the force of radiative friction can severely
limit the rate of electron acceleration in a plasma accelerator.
