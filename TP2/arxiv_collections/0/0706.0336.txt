Anisotropic distributions of charged particles including two-stream
distributions give rise to generation of either stochastic electric fields (in
the form of Langmuir waves, Buneman instability) or random quasi-static
magnetic fields (Weibel and filamentation instabilities) or both. These
two-stream instabilities are known to play a key role in collisionless shock
formation, shock-shock interactions, and shock-induced electromagnetic
emission. This paper applies the general non-perturbative stochastic theory of
radiation to study electromagnetic emission produced by relativistic particles,
which random walk in the stochastic electric fields of the Langmuir waves. This
analysis takes into account the cumulative effect of uncorrelated Langmuir
waves on the radiating particle trajectory giving rise to angular diffusion of
the particle, which eventually modifies the corresponding radiation spectra. We
demonstrate that the radiative process considered is probably relevant for
emission produced in various kinds of astrophysical jets, in particular, prompt
gamma-ray burst spectra, including X-ray excesses and prompt optical flashes.
