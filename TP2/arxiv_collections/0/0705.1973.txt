We report on 10 years of monitoring of the 8.7-s Anomalous X-ray Pulsar 4U
0142+61 using the Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer (RXTE). This pulsar exhibited
stable rotation from 2000 March until 2006 February: the RMS phase residual for
a spin-down model which includes nu, nudot, and nuddot is 2.3%. We report a
possible phase-coherent timing solution valid over a 10-yr span extending back
to March 1996. A glitch may have occured between 1998 and 2000, but is not
required by the existing timing data. The pulse profile has been evolving since
2000. In particular, the dip of emission between its two peaks got shallower
between 2002 and 2006, as if the profile were evolving back to its pre-2000
morphology, following an earlier event, which possibly also included the glitch
suggested by the timing data. These profile variations are seen in the 2-4 keV
band but not in 6-8 keV. We also detect a slow increase in the pulsed flux
between 2002 May and 2004 December, such that it has risen by 36+/-3% over 2.6
years in the 2-10 keV band. The pulsed flux variability and the narrow-band
pulse profile changes present interesting challenges to aspects of the magnetar
model.
