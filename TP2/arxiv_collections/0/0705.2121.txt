Systematic description of a spin one-half system endowed with magnetic moment
or any other two-level system (qubit) interacting with the quantized
electromagnetic field is developed. This description exploits a close analogy
between a two-level system and the Dirac electron that comes to light when the
two-level system is described within the formalism of second quantization in
terms of fermionic creation and annihilation operators. The analogy enables one
to introduce all the powerful tools of relativistic QED (albeit in a greatly
simplified form). The Feynman diagrams and the propagators turn out to be very
useful. In particular, the QED concept of the vacuum polarization finds its
close counterpart in the photon scattering off a two level-system leading via
the linear response theory to the general formulas for the atomic
polarizability and the dynamic single spin susceptibility. To illustrate the
usefulness of these methods, we calculate the polarizability and susceptibility
up to the fourth order of perturbation theory. These {\em ab initio}
calculations resolve some ambiguities concerning the sign prescription and the
optical damping that arise in the phenomenological treatment. We also show that
the methods used to study two-level systems (qubits) can be extended to
many-level systems (qudits). As an example, we describe the interaction with
the quantized electromagnetic field of an atom with four relevant states: one S
state and three degenerate P states.
