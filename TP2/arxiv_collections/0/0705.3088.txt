In the present study, we pin down the origin of the coexistence of the large
thermopower and the large conductivity in Na$_x$CoO$_2$. It is revealed that
not just the density of states (DOS), the effective mass, nor the band width,
but the peculiar {\it shape} of the $a_{1g}$ band referred to as the "pudding
mold" type, which consists of a dispersive portion and a somewhat flat portion,
is playing an important role in this phenomenon. The present study provides a
new guiding principle for designing good thermoelectric materials.
