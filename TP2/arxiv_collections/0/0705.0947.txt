We consider the phenomenological consequences of the assumption that the
baryons are the systems of three quarks and string junction. The process of
baryon number transfer due to string junction propagation in rapidity space is
considered in detail. At high energies it leads to a significant effect in the
net baryon production in $hN$ and $hA$ collisions at mid-rapidities and in the
incident meson fragmentation region. The results of numerical calculations in
the framework of the Quark--Gluon String Model are in reasonable agreement with
the data.
