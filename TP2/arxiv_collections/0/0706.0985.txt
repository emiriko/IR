In the framework of loop quantum gravity (LQG), having quantum black holes in
mind, we generalize the previous boundary state counting (gr-qc/0508085) to a
full bulk state counting. After a suitable gauge fixing we are able to compute
the bulk entropy of a bounded region (the "black hole") with fixed boundary.
This allows us to study the relationship between the entropy and the boundary
area in details and we identify a holographic regime of LQG where the leading
order of the entropy scales with the area. We show that in this regime we can
fine tune the factor between entropy and area without changing the Immirzi
parameter.
