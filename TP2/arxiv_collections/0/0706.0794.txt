We present a new variational model for computing the electronic first-order
density matrix of a crystalline material in presence of a local defect. A
natural way to obtain variational discretizations of this model is to expand
the difference Q between the density matrix of the defective crystal and the
density matrix of the perfect crystal, in a basis of precomputed maximally
localized Wannier functions of the reference perfect crystal. This approach can
be used within any semi-empirical or Density Functional Theory framework.
