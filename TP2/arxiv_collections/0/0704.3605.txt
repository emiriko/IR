We discuss the current conservation laws in sigma models based on a compact
Lie groups of the same dimensionality and connected to each other via
pseudoduality transformations in two dimensions. We show that pseudoduality
transformations induce an infinite number of nonlocal conserved currents on the
pseudodual manifold.
