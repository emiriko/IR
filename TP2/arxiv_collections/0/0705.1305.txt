We show that there is a link between the Kuramoto paradigm and another system
of synchronized oscillators, namely an electrical power distribution grid of
generators and consumers. The purpose of this work is to show both the formal
analogy and some practical consequences. The mapping can be made quantitative,
and under some necessary approximations a class of Kuramoto-like models, those
with bimodal distribution of the frequencies, is most appropriate for the
power-grid. In fact in the power-grid there are two kinds of oscillators: the
'sources' delivering power to the 'consumers'.
