A search for scalar quarks and gluinos is performed with 0.96 fb^{-1} of data
collected by the DO experiment in p\bar{p} collisions at \sqrt{s}=1.96 TeV at
the Fermilab Tevatron Collider. The topologies analyzed consist of acoplanar
jets and multijet events with missing transverse energy. We find the data to be
consistent with Standard Model expectations, and set 95% C.L. exclusion domains
in the squark and gluino mass plane and in the (m_0, m_{1/2}) plane, within the
framework of minimal supergravity with tan\beta=3, A_0=0 and \mu<0.
