We present the class of regular homogeneous T-models with vacuum dark fluid,
associated with a variable cosmological term. The vacuum fluid is defined by
the symmetry of its stress-energy tensor, i.e., its invariance under Lorentz
boosts in a distinguished spatial direction (p_j=-\rho), which makes this fluid
essentially anisotropic and allows its density to evolve. Typical features of
homogeneous regular T-models are: the existence of a Killing horizon; beginning
of the cosmological evolution from a null bang at the horizon; the existence of
a regular static pre-bang region visible to cosmological observers; creation of
matter from anisotropic vacuum, accompanied by very rapid isotropization. We
study in detail the spherically symmetric regular T-models on the basis of a
general exact solution for a mixture of the vacuum fluid and dustlike matter
and apply it to give numerical estimates for a particular model which
illustrates the ability of cosmological T-models to satisfy the observational
constraints.
