Three-body resonances in the \bar{K}NN system have been studied within a
framework of the \bar{K}NN-\pi YN coupled hannel Faddeev equation. By solving
the three-body equation the energy dependence of the resonant \bar{K}N
amplitude is fully taken into account. The S-matrix pole has been investigated
from the eigenvalue of the kernel with the analytic continuation of the
scattering amplitude on the unphysical Riemann sheet. The \barKN interaction is
constructed from the leading order term of the chiral Lagrangian using
relativistic kinematics. The \Lambda(1405) resonance is dynamically generated
in this model, where the \bar{K}N interaction parameters are fitted to the data
of scattering length. As a result we find a three-body resonance of the strange
dibaryon system with binding energy, B~79 MeV, and width, \Gamma~74 MeV. The
energy of the three-body resonance is found to be sensitive to the model of the
I=0 \barKN interaction.
