We compute the (three) master integrals for the crossed ladder diagram with
two exchanged quanta of equal mass. The differential equations obeyed by the
master integrals are used to generate power series expansions centered around
all the singular (plus some regular) points, which are then matched numerically
with high accuracy. The expansions allow a fast and precise numerical
calculation of the three master integrals (better than 15 digits with less than
30 terms in the whole real axis). A conspicuous relation with the equal-mass
sunrise in two dimensions is found. Comparison with a previous large momentum
expansion is made finding complete agreement.
