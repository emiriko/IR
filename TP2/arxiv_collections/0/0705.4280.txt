Kubo's formula relates bulk viscosity to the retarded Green's function of the
trace of the energy-momentum tensor. Using low energy theorems of QCD for the
latter we derive the formula which relates the bulk viscosity to the energy
density and pressure of hot matter. We then employ the available lattice QCD
data to extract the bulk viscosity as a function of temperature. We find that
close to the deconfinement temperature bulk viscosity becomes large, with
viscosity-to-entropy ratio zeta/s about 1.
