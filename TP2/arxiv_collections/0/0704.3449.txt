Experimental evidence is provided on close relation between polarization and
space charge in corona poled PVDF films. It is shown that the depolarizing
field is compensated by charges trapped in macroscopic transition zones, by
which polarized parts of the volume are separated from non-polarized ones. The
compensating charges are either injected in the bulk, or created inside due to
the thermal emission and then trapped when the ferroelectric polarization in
crystallites is formed.
