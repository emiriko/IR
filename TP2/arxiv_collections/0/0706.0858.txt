A two-photon process leading to coherent transitions between the two
circularly polarized exciton states in a quantum dot is studied. It is shown
that optical flipping of the exciton polarization is possible with picosecond
laser pulses. The process is closely related to two-photon Rabi oscillations of
a biexciton but it is much more stable against shifts of the laser frequency.
