The Large Hadron Collider, a 7 + 7 TeV proton-proton collider under
construction at CERN (the European Laboratory for Particle Physics in Geneva),
will take experiments squarely into a new energy domain where mysteries of the
electroweak interaction will be unveiled. What marks the 1-TeV scale as an
important target? Why is understanding how the electroweak symmetry is hidden
important to our conception of the world around us? What expectations do we
have for the agent that hides the electroweak symmetry? Why do particle
physicists anticipate a great harvest of discoveries within reach of the LHC?
