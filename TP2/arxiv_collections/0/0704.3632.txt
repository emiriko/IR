We report the spectra of magnetically induced electric dipole absorption in
Eu$_{0.75}$Y$_{0.25}$MnO$_3$ from temperature dependent far infrared
spectroscopy (10-250 cm$^{-1}$). These spectra, which occur only in the $e||a$
polarization, consist of two relatively narrow electromagnon features that
onset at $T_{FE}=30$ K and a broad absorption band that persists to
temperatures well above $T_N=47$ K. The observed excitations account for the
step up of the static dielectric constant in the ferroelectric phase. The
electromagnon at 80 cm$^{-1}$ is observed to be strongly coupled to the nearby
lowest optical phonon which transfers more than 1/2 of its spectral weight to
the magnon. We attribute the origin of the broad background absorption to the
two magnon emission decay process of the phonon.
