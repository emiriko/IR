We have used FUSE and Voyager observations of dust scattered starlight in the
neighborhood of the Coalsack Nebula to derive the optical constants of the dust
grains. The albedo is consistent with a value of $0.28 \pm 0.04$ and the phase
function asymmetry factor with a value of $0.61 \pm 0.07$ throughout the
spectral range from 900 -- 1200 \AA, in agreement with previous determinations
as well as theoretical predictions. We have now observed two regions (Ophiuchus
and Coalsack) with intense diffuse background radiation and in both cases have
found that the emission is due to light from nearby hot stars scattered by a
relatively thin foreground cloud, with negligible contribution from the
background molecular cloud.
