The mechanics of cells is strongly affected by molecular motors that generate
forces in the cellular cytoskeleton. We develop a model for cytoskeletal
networks driven out of equilibrium by molecular motors exerting transient
contractile stresses. Using this model we show how motor activity can
dramatically increase the network's bulk elastic moduli. We also show how motor
binding kinetics naturally leads to enhanced low-frequency stress fluctuations
that result in non-equilibrium diffusive motion within an elastic network, as
seen in recent \emph{in vitro} and \emph{in vivo} experiments.
