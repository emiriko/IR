The ballistic coefficient of a bullet describes how it slows in flight due to
air resistance. This article presents experimental determinations of ballistic
coefficients showing that the majority of bullets tested have their previously
published ballistic coefficients exaggerated from 5-25% by the bullet
manufacturers. These exaggerated ballistic coefficients lead to inaccurate
predictions of long range bullet drop, retained energy and wind drift.
