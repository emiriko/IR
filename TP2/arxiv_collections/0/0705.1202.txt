A bent crystal shield which is capable of deflecting cosmic radiation ions of
all atomic numbers away from spacecraft using the ion channeling effect is
described. Its effect on the transmitted angular distribution of heavy,
high-energy ions is characterized using Monte Carlo channeling simulations.
Ions up to an energy limit set by the bent crystal curvature radius are
deflected by the full curvature angle. A bent crystal shield with a 1 x 1 cm2
surface area capable of deflecting such ions with energies up to 100
GeV/nucleon is fabricated in which the lattice planes across the entrance
surface are uniformly aligned.
