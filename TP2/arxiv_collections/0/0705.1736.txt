We explore further the discovery potential for heavy quarks at the LHC, with
emphasis on the $t'$ and $b'$ of a sequential fourth family associated with
electroweak symmetry breaking. We consider QCD multijets, $t\bar{t}+\rm{jets}$,
$W+\rm{jets}$ and single $t$ backgrounds using event generation based on
improved matrix elements and low sensitivity to the modeling of initial state
radiation. We exploit a jet mass technique for the identification of
hadronically decaying $W$'s and $t$'s, to be used in the reconstruction of the
$t'$ or $b'$ mass. This along with other aspects of event selection can reduce
backgrounds to very manageable levels. It even allows a search for both $t'$
and $b'$ in the absence of $b$-tagging, of interest for the early running of
the LHC. A heavy quark mass of order 600 GeV is motivated by the connection to
electroweak symmetry breaking, but our analysis is relevant for any new heavy
quarks with weak decay modes.
