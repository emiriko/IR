The inclusive energy distributions of the complex fragments (3 $\leq$ Z
$\leq$ 7) emitted from the bombardment of ^{12}C by ^{20}Ne beams with incident
energies between 145 and 200 MeV have been measured in the angular range
10$^{o} \leq \theta_{lab} \leq$ 50^{o}. Damped fragment yields in all the cases
have been found to be the characteristic of emission from fully energy
equilibrated composites. The binary fragment yields are compared with the
standard statistical model predictions. Enhanced yields of entrance channel
fragments (5 $\leq$ Z $\leq$ 7) indicate the survival of orbiting-like process
in ^{20}Ne + ^{12}C system at these energies.
