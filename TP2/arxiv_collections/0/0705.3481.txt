One of the promising sources of gravitational radiation is a binary system
composed of compact stars. It is an important question how the rotation of the
bodies and the eccentricity of the orbit affect the detectable signal. Here we
present a method to evaluate the gravitational wave polarization states for
inspiralling compact binaries with comparable mass. We consider eccentric
orbits and the spin-orbit contribution in the case of one spinning object up to
1.5 post-Newtonian order. For circular orbits our results are in agreement with
existing calculations.
