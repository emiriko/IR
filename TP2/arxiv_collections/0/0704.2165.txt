We study CP violation in e^+ e^- to \tilde\chi_i^+\tilde\chi_j^- in the
framework of the MSSM. Though the cross section of this process is CP-even at
the tree level even for polarized electron-positron beams, we show that it
contains a CP-odd part at the one loop order and there are CP-odd observables
that can in principle be measured even using unpolarized electron-positron
beams. The relevant diagram calculations are briefly discussed and the results
of selected (box) diagram computations are shown.
