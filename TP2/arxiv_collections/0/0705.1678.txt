New experimental data from the scattering of 6He+208Pb at energies around and
below the Coulomb barrier are presented. The yield of breakup products coming
from projectile fragmentation is dominated by a strong group of $\alpha$
particles.
  The energy and angular distributions of this group have been analyzed and
compared with theoretical calculations. This analysis indicates that the
$\alpha$ particles emitted at backward angles in this reaction are mainly due
to two-neutron transfer to weakly bound states of the final nucleus.
