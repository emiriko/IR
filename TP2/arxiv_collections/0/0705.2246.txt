We address the problem of the factors contributing to a peak color trend of
old metal-rich globular cluster (MRGC) populations with mass of their hosts,
early-type galaxies and spheroidal subsystems of spiral ones (spheroids). The
color-mass trend is often converted to a metallicity-mass trend under the
assumption that age effects are small or negligible. While direct estimates of
the ages of MRGC populations neither can rule out nor reliably support the
populations' age trend, key data on timing of the formation of spheroids and
other indirect evidence imply it in the sense: the more massive spheroid the
older on average its MRGC population. We show that the contribution of an
allowable age trend of the MRGC populations to their peak color trend can
achieve up to ~50 % or so. In this event the comparable value of the color
trend, ~30 %, is due to alpha-element ratio systematic variations of the order
of Delta[alpha/Fe] ~ 0.1 to 0.2 dex because of a correlation between the
[alpha/Fe] ratios and age. Hence a systematic variation of exactly [Fe/H]
ratios may turn out to be less significant among the contributors, and its
range many times lower, i.e. of the order of Delta[Fe/H] ~ 0.1 or even none,
than the corresponding range deduced by assuming no age trend.
