We investigate the effects to all orders in the Planck length from a
generalized un- certainty principle (GUP) on black holes thermodynamics. We
calculate the corrected Hawking temperature, entropy, and examine in details
the Hawking evaporation process. As a result, the evaporation process is
accelerated and the evaporation end-point is a zero entropy, zero heat capacity
and finite non zero temperature black hole remnant (BHR). In particular we
obtain a drastic reduction of the decay time, in comparison with the results
obtained in the Hawking semi classical picture and with the GUP to leading
order in the Planck length.
