Astronomers carry out observations to explore the diverse processes and
objects which populate our Universe. High-energy physicists carry out
experiments to approach the Fundamental Theory underlying space, time and
matter. Dark Energy is a unique link between them, reflecting deep aspects of
the Fundamental Theory, yet apparently accessible only through astronomical
observation. Large sections of the two communities have therefore converged in
support of astronomical projects to constrain Dark Energy. In this essay I
argue that this convergence can be damaging for astronomy. The two communities
have different methodologies and different scientific cultures. By uncritically
adopting the values of an alien system, astronomers risk undermining the
foundations of their own current success and endangering the future vitality of
their field. Dark Energy is undeniably an interesting problem to attack through
astronomical observation, but it is one of many and not necessarily the one
where significant progress is most likely to follow a major investment of
resources.
