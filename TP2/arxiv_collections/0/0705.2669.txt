We study the motion of a microscopic swimmer composed of a semiflexible
polymer anchored at the surface of a magnetic sphere using hydrodynamic
simulations and scaling arguments. The swimmer is driven by a rotating magnetic
field, and displays forward and backward motion depending on the value of the
rotational frequency. In particular, the system exhibits forward thrust for
frequencies below a critical frequency $\omega^*$, while above $\omega^*$ the
motion is reversed.
