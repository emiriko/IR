Performance of wave-energy devices of the oscillating water column (OWC) type
is greatly enhanced when a resonant condition with the forcing waves is
maintained. The natural frequency of such systems can in general be tuned to
resonate with a given wave forcing frequency. In this paper we address the
tuning of an OWC sea-water pump to polychromatic waves. We report results of
wave tank experiments, which were conducted with a scale model of the pump.
Also, a numerical solution for the pump equations, which were proven in
previous work to successfully describe its behavior when driven by
monochromatic waves, is tested with various polychromatic wave spectra. Results
of the numerical model forced by the wave trains measured in the wave tank
experiments are used to develop a tuning criterion for the sea-water pump.
