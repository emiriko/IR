Methods and techniques of the theory of nonlinear dynamical systems and
patterns can be useful in astrophysical applications. Some works on the
subjects of dynamical astronomy, stellar pulsation and variability, as well as
spatial complexity in extended systems, in which such approaches have already
been utilized, are reviewed. Prospects for future directions in applications of
this kind are outlined.
