The analysis of databases of photographic images of the Sun (obtained in
region of soft x-ray) by means of a method of multilevel dynamical contrasting,
has shown presence of skeletal structures of the Sun as outside (chromo-sphere
flashes and powerful coronal mass ejections) and on the Sun (structures in its
atmosphere, protuberances and of solar a stains). Moreover the structures which
radius of rotation is less than radius of a solar disk on breadth of their
observation have been revealed. On the basis of the obtained results of this
analysis, the author puts forward a hypothesis about an opportunity of
existence of some filamentary matter as inside, so outside of the Sun.
