We derive single-particle and two-particle correlators of anyons in the
presence of a magnetic field in the lowest Landau level. We show that the
two-particle correlator exhibits signatures of fractional statistics which can
distinguish anyons from their fermionic and bosonic counterparts. These
signatures include the zeroes of the two-particle correlator and its exclusion
behavior. We find that the single-particle correlator in finite geometries
carries valuable information relevant to experiments in which quasiparticles on
the edge of a quantum Hall system tunnel through its bulk.
