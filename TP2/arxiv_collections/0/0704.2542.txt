The main goal of this project is to research technical advances in order to
enhance the possibility to develop narratives within immersive mediated
environments. An important part of the research is concerned with the question
of how a script can be written, annotated and realized for an immersive
context. A first description of the main theoretical framework and the ongoing
work and a first script example is provided. This project is part of the
program for presence research, and it will exploit physiological feedback and
Computational Intelligence within virtual reality.
