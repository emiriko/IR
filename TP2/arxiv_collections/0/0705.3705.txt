Recently, it was demonstrated that the quasiparticle dynamics, the
layer-dependent charge and potential, and the c-axis screening coefficient
could be extracted from measurements of the spectral function of few layer
graphene films grown epitaxially on SiC using angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy (ARPES). In this article we review these findings, and present
detailed methodology for extracting such parameters from ARPES. We also present
detailed arguments against the possibility of an energy gap at the Dirac
crossing ED.
