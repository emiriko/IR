We study the general structure of Fermi conformal nets of von Neumann
algebras on the circle, consider a class of topological representations, the
general representations, that we characterize as Neveu-Schwarz or Ramond
representations, in particular a Jones index can be associated with each of
them. We then consider a supersymmetric general representation associated with
a Fermi modular net and give a formula involving the Fredholm index of the
supercharge operator and the Jones index. We then consider the net associated
with the super-Virasoro algebra and discuss its structure. If the central
charge c belongs to the discrete series, this net is modular by the work of F.
Xu and we get an example where our setting is verified by considering the
Ramond irreducible representation with lowest weight c/24. We classify all the
irreducible Fermi extensions of any super-Virasoro net in the discrete series,
thus providing a classification of all superconformal nets with central charge
less than 3/2.
