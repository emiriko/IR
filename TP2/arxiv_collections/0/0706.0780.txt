The paper analyses volt-ampere characteristics of a planar vacuum diode with
mono-energetic electrons, emitted by the cathode (an electron beam). The
movement of the electron beam in the volume of the diode is described. An
analytic dependence of the volt-ampere characteristics in an unlimited and
limited by the field mode of the electron beam is derived.
