We derive the boundary condition for a subdiffusive particle interacting with
a reactive boundary with finite reaction rate. Molecular crowding conditions,
that are found to cause subdiffusion of larger molecules in biological cells,
are shown to effect long-tailed distributions with identical exponent for both
the unbinding times from the boundary to the bulk and the rebinding times from
the bulk. This causes a weak ergodicity breaking: typically, an individual
particle either stays bound or remains in the bulk for very long times. We
discuss why this may be beneficial for in vivo gene regulation by DNA-binding
proteins, whose typical concentrations are nanomolar
