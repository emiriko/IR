The dissipative quantum system is studied using the Thirring model with a
boundary mass. At the critical point where the Thirring coupling vanishes, the
theory reduces to a free fermion theory with a boundary mass. We construct
boundary states for the dissipative quantum systems in one dimension, which
describes the system off the critical points as well as at the critical points.
