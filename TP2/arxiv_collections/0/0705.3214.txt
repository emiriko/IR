For infinitely large sparse networks of spiking neurons mean field theory
shows that a balanced state of highly irregular activity arises under various
conditions. Here we analytically investigate the microscopic irregular dynamics
in finite networks of arbitrary connectivity, keeping track of all individual
spike times. For delayed, purely inhibitory interactions we demonstrate that
the irregular dynamics is not chaotic but rather stable and convergent towards
periodic orbits. Moreover, every generic periodic orbit of these dynamical
systems is stable. These results highlight that chaotic and stable dynamics are
equally capable of generating irregular activity.
