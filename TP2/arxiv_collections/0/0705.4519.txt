The quantitative description of the orthopositronium anomalies ("isotope
anomaly" in a gaseous neon for the "resonance conditions" and
"lambda{T}-anomaly" in non-resonance conditions) is possible on the basis of a
hypothesis about restoration of spontaneously broken complete relativity
(A.F.Andreev, 1982) of the limited space-time "volume" ("defect" of the
space-time) in a final state of the beta{+}-decay of nucleus such as Na-22,
Ga-68, etc. This addition of the Standard Model in a final state of the
topological quantum transition (non-steady-state, a generalized displacement
current) supposes the description on the common basis timelike fundamental
particles (locality) and spacelike fundamental structure (non-locality without
causal paradoxes). One of achievements of expansion of Standard Model can be a
substantiation of topological connection e-mu-tau-Universality with discrete
structure (quantization) "defect" of the space-time.
