We have investigated the possibility of direct tests of little Higgs models
incorporating triplet Higgs neutrino mass mechanism at LHC experiments. We have
performed Monte Carlo studies of Drell-Yan pair production of doubly charged
Higgs boson \Phi^{++} followed by its leptonic decays which branching ratios
are fixed from the neutrino oscillation data. We propose appropriate selection
rules for the four-lepton signal, including reconstructed taus, which are
optimized for the discovery of \Phi^{++} with the lowest LHC luminosity. As the
Standard Model background can be effectively eliminated, an important aspect of
our study is the correct statistical treatment of the LHC discovery potential.
Adding detection efficiencies and measurement errors to the Monte Carlo
analyses, \Phi^{++} can be discovered up to the mass 250 GeV in the first year
of LHC, and 700 GeV mass is reachable for the integrated luminosity L=30
fb^{-1}.
