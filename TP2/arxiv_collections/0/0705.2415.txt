GRB970228 is analyzed as a prototype to understand the relative role of short
GRBs and their associated afterglows, recently observed by Swift and HETE-II.
Detailed theoretical computation of the GRB970228 light curves in selected
energy bands are presented and compared with observational BeppoSAX data.
