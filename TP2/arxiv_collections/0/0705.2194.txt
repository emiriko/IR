The excitation of cosmological perturbations in an anisotropic cosmological
model and in the presence of a homogeneous magnetic field was studied, using
the resistive magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations. We have shown that
fast-magnetosonic modes, propagating normal to the magnetic field grow
exponentially and saturated at high values, due to the resistivity. We also
demonstrate that the jeans-like instabilities are enhanced inside a resistive
and the formation of condensations formed within an anisotropic fluid influence
the growing magnetosonic waves.
