We study the decay Omega^- -> Xi^- pi^+ pi^- in heavy-baryon chiral
perturbation theory. At leading order, the decay is completely dominated by the
Xi^{*0}(1530) intermediate state, and the predicted rate and Xi^-pi^+ mass
distribution are in conflict with currently available data. It is possible to
resolve this conflict by considering additional contributions at
next-to-leading order.
