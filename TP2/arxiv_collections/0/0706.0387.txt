One of the most basic tasks required for Quantum Information Technology is
the ability to connect different components of a Quantum Computer by quantum
wires that obey the superposition principle. Since superpositions can be very
sensitive to noise this turns out to be already quite difficult. Recently, it
was suggested to use chains of permanently coupled spin-1/2 particles (quantum
chains) for this purpose. They have the advantage that no external control
along the wire is required during the transport of information, which makes it
possible to isolate the wire from sources of noise. We first give an
introduction to basic quantum state transfer and review existing advanced
schemes by other authors. We then show a new result that demonstrates the
stability of the scheme [1] against disorder that is approximately constant
during one application of the channel, but time-dependent with respect to
multiple applications.
