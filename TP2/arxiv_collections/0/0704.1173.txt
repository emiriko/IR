We analyzed the influence of static gravitational field on the vacuum and
proposed the concept of inhomogeneous vacuum. According to the observational
result of the light deflection in solar gravitational field as well as the
corresponding Fermat's principle in the general relativity, we derived an
analytical expression of the refractive index of vacuum in a static
gravitational field. We found that the deviation of the vacuum refractive index
is composed of two parts: one is caused by the time dilation effect, the other
is caused by the length contraction effect. As an application, we simulated the
effect of the gravitational lensing through computer programming and found that
the missing central imaging could be interpreted in a reasonable way.
