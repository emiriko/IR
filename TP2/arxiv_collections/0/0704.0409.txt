We present an analytic example of two dimensional quantum mechanical system,
where the exponential suppression of the probability of over-barrier reflection
changes non-monotonically with energy. The suppression is minimal at certain
"optimal" energies where reflection occurs with exponentially larger
probability than at other energies.
