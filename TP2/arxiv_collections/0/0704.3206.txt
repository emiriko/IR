We present a new numerical code, ECHO, based on an Eulerian Conservative High
Order scheme for time dependent three-dimensional general relativistic
magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) and magnetodynamics (GRMD). ECHO is aimed at
providing a shock-capturing conservative method able to work at an arbitrary
level of formal accuracy (for smooth flows), where the other existing GRMHD and
GRMD schemes yield an overall second order at most. Moreover, our goal is to
present a general framework, based on the 3+1 Eulerian formalism, allowing for
different sets of equations, different algorithms, and working in a generic
space-time metric, so that ECHO may be easily coupled to any solver for
Einstein's equations. Various high order reconstruction methods are implemented
and a two-wave approximate Riemann solver is used. The induction equation is
treated by adopting the Upwind Constrained Transport (UCT) procedures,
appropriate to preserve the divergence-free condition of the magnetic field in
shock-capturing methods. The limiting case of magnetodynamics (also known as
force-free degenerate electrodynamics) is implemented by simply replacing the
fluid velocity with the electromagnetic drift velocity and by neglecting the
matter contribution to the stress tensor. ECHO is particularly accurate,
efficient, versatile, and robust. It has been tested against several
astrophysical applications, including a novel test on the propagation of large
amplitude circularly polarized Alfven waves. In particular, we show that
reconstruction based on a Monotonicity Preserving filter applied to a fixed
5-point stencil gives highly accurate results for smooth solutions, both in
flat and curved metric (up to the nominal fifth order), while at the same time
providing sharp profiles in tests involving discontinuities.
