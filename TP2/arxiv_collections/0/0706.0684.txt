Elementary particle physics is the quadrant of nature whose laws can be
written in a few lines with absolute precision and the greatest empirical
adequacy. If this is the case, as I believe it is, it must be possible and is
probably useful to introduce the students and the interested readers to the
entire subject in a compact way. This is the main aim of these Lectures.
