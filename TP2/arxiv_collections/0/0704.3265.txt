It is shown that only the maximally-symmetric spacetimes can be expressed in
both the Robertson-Walker form and in static form - there are no other static
forms of the Robertson-Walker spacetimes. All possible static forms of the
metric of the maximally-symmetric spacetimes are presented as a table. The
findings are generalized to apply to functionally more general spacetimes: it
is shown that the maximally symmetric spacetimes are also the only spacetimes
that can be written in both orthogonal-time isotropic form and in static form.
