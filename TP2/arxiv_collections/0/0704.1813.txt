We report the detection of a radial velocity companion to SDSS
J091709.55+463821.8, the lowest mass white dwarf currently known with
M~0.17Msun. The radial velocity of the white dwarf shows variations with a
semi-amplitude of 148.8 km/s and a period of 7.5936 hours, which implies a
companion mass of M > 0.28Msun. The lack of evidence of a companion in the
optical photometry forces any main-sequence companion to be smaller than
0.1Msun, hence a low mass main sequence star companion is ruled out for this
system. The companion is most likely another white dwarf, and we present
tentative evidence for an evolutionary scenario which could have produced it.
However, a neutron star companion cannot be ruled out and follow-up radio
observations are required to search for a pulsar companion.
