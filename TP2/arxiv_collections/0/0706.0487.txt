Baryogenesis via leptogenesis provides an appealing mechanism to explain the
observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe. Recent refinements in the
understanding of the dynamics of leptogenesis include detailed studies of the
effects of lepton flavors and of the role possibly played by the lepton
asymmetries generated in the decays of the heavier singlet neutrinos $N_{2,3}$.
A review of these recent developments in the theory of leptogenesis is
presented.
