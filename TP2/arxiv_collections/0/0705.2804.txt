We present a comprehensive and self-consistent modelling of the D' type
symbiotic star (SS) HD330036 from radio to UV. Within a colliding-wind
scenario, we analyse the continuum, line and dust spectra by means of SUMA, a
code that simulates the physical conditions of an emitting gaseous cloud under
the coupled effect of ionization from an external radiation source and shocks.
We find that the UV lines are emitted from high density gas between the stars
downstream of the reverse shock, while the optical lines are emitted downstream
of the shock propagating outwards the system. As regards with the continuum
SED, three shells are identified in the IR, at 850K, 320 K and 200 K with radii
r = 2.8 10^13 cm, 4 10^14$ cm, and 10^15 cm, respectively, adopting a distance
to Earth d=2.3 kpc: interestingly, all these shells appear to be circumbinary.
The analysis of the unexploited ISO-SWS spectrum reveals that both PAHs and
crystalline silicates coexist in HD330036, with PAHs associated to the internal
shell at 850 K, and crystalline silicates stored into the cool shells at 320 K
and 200 K. Strong evidence that crystalline silicates are shaped in a disk-like
structure is derived on the basis of the relative band strengths. Finally, we
suggest that shocks can be a reliable mechanism in activating the annealing and
the consequent crystallization processes. We show that a consistent
interpretation of gas and dust spectra emitted by SS can be obtained by models
which accounts for the coupled effect of the photoionizing flux and of shocks.
The VLTI/MIDI proposal recently accepted by ESO aims to verify and better
constrain some of our results by means of IR interferometric observations.
