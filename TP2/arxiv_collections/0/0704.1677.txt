We study the resummation of large logarithmic perturbative corrections to the
single-inclusive jet cross section at hadron colliders. The corrections we
address arise near the threshold for the partonic reaction, when the incoming
partons have just enough energy to produce the high-transverse-momentum final
state. The structure of the resulting logarithmic corrections is known to
depend crucially on the treatment of the invariant mass of the produced jet at
threshold. We allow the jet to have a non-vanishing mass at threshold, which
most closely corresponds to the situation in experiment. Matching our results
to available semi-analytical next-to-leading-order calculations, we derive
resummed results valid to next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. We present
numerical results for the resummation effects at Tevatron and RHIC energies.
