We present a scheme that transform 1 qubit to M identical copies with optimal
fidedelity via free dynamical evolution of spin star networks. We show that the
Heisenberg XXZ coupling can fulfill the challenge. The initial state of the
copying machine and the parameters of the spin Hamiltonian are discussed in
detail. Furthermore we have proposed a feasible method to prepare the initial
state of the copying machine.
