By studying the decays D_{s0}^+(2317) --> D_s^+ pi^0 and D_s^{*+} gamma, It
is shown that its assignment to the I_3=0 component of iso-triplet scalar
four-quark mesons is favored. Productions of its neutral and doubly charged
partners are also studied. As the result, it is concluded that they could be
observed in B decays. Their iso-singlet partner might have been observed in the
radiative channels of B decays by the BELLE Collaboration.
