The design and development of complex products invariably involves many
actors who have different points of view on the problem they are addressing,
the product being developed, and the process by which it is being developed.
The actors' viewpoints approach was designed to provide an organisational
framework in which these different perspectives or points of views, and their
relationships, could be explicitly gathered and formatted (by actor activity's
focus). The approach acknowledges the inevitability of multiple interpretation
of product information as different views, promotes gathering of actors'
interests, and encourages retrieved adequate information while providing
support for integration through PLM and/or SCM collaboration. In this paper, we
present our multiple viewpoints approach, and we illustrate it by an industrial
example on cyclone vessel product.
