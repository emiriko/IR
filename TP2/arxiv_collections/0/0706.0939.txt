We report the first observation of `orbital truncation rods' -- the
scattering arising from the termination of bulk orbital order at the surface of
a crystal. The x-ray measurements, performed on a cleaved, single-layered
perovskite, La0.5Sr1.5MnO4, reveal that while the crystallographic surface is
atomically smooth, the orbital `surface' is much rougher, with an r.m.s.
deviation from the average `surface' of ~0.7nm. The temperature dependence of
this scattering shows evidence of a surface-induced second order transition.
