A set of analog electronics boards for serial readout of silicon strip
sensors was fabricated. A commercially available amplifier is mounted on a
homemade hybrid board in order to receive analog signals from silicon strip
sensors. Also, another homemade circuit board is fabricated in order to
translate amplifier control signals into a suitable format and to provide bias
voltage to the amplifier as well as to the silicon sensors. We discuss
technical details of the fabrication process and performance of the circuit
boards we developed.
