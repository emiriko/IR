One of the less known facets of Ludwig Boltzmann was that of an advocate of
Aviation, one of the most challenging technological problems of his times.
Boltzmann followed closely the studies of pioneers like Otto Lilienthal in
Berlin, and during a lecture on a prestigious conference he vehemently defended
further investments in the area. In this article I discuss his involvement with
Aviation, his role in its development and his correspondence with two flight
pioneers, Otto Lilienthal e Wilhelm Kress.
