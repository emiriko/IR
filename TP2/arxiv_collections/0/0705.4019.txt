The characteristics of a MeV ion source driven by superintense, ultrashort
laser pulses with circular polarization are studied by means of
particle-in-cell simulations. Predicted features include high efficiency, large
ion density, low divergence and the possibility of femtosecond duration. A
comparison with the case of linearly polarized pulses is made.
