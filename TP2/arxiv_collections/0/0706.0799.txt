We present {\it symmetric Hamiltonians} for the degenerate Garnier systems in
two variables. For these symmetric Hamiltonians, we make the symmetry and
holomorphy conditions, and we also make a generalization of these systems
involving symmetry and holomorphy conditions inductively. We also show the
confluence process among each system by taking the coupling confluence process
of the Painlev\'e systems.
