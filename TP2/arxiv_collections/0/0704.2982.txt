In this contribution I will attempt to show that the study of galactic 6.7
and 12.2GHz methanol masers themselves, as opposed to the use of methanol
masers as signposts, can yield important conclusions contributing to the
understanding of high-mass star formation. Due to their exclusive association
with star formation, methanol masers are the best tools to do this, and their
large number allows to probe the entire Galaxy. In particular I will focus on
the determination of the luminosity function of methanol masers and on the
determination of an unambiguous signature for a circumstellar masing disc seen
edge-on. Finally I will try to point out some future fields of research in the
study of methanol masers.
