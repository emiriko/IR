We obtained a high resolution, high signal-to-noise UV-blue spectrum of the
extremely metal-poor red giant HD88609 to determine the abundances of heavy
elements. Nineteen neutron-capture elements are detected in the spectrum. Our
analysis revealed that this object has large excesses of light neutron-capture
elements while heavy neutron-capture elements are deficient. The abundance
pattern shows a continuously decreasing trend, as a function of atomic number,
from Sr to Yb, which is quite different from those in stars with excesses of
r-process elements. Such an abundance pattern is very similar to that of
HD122563 that was studied by our previous work. The results indicate that the
abundance pattern found in the two stars could represent the pattern produced
by the nucleosynthesis process that provided light neutron-capture elements in
the very early Galaxy.
