Let $\mu$ be a Gibbs measure of the doubling map $T$ of the circle. For a
$\mu$-generic point $x$ and a given sequence $\{r_n\} \subset \R^+$, consider
the intervals $(T^nx - r_n \pmod 1, T^nx + r_n \pmod 1)$. In analogy to the
classical Dvoretzky covering of the circle we study the covering properties of
this sequence of intervals. This study is closely related to the local entropy
function of the Gibbs measure and to hitting times for moving targets. A mass
transference principle is obtained for Gibbs measures which are multifractal.
Such a principle was shown by Beresnevich and Velani \cite{BV} only for
monofractal measures. In the symbolic language we completely describe the
combinatorial structure of a typical relatively short sequence, in particular
we can describe the occurrence of ''atypical'' relatively long words. Our
results have a direct and deep number-theoretical interpretation via
inhomogeneous diadic diophantine approximation by numbers belonging to a given
(diadic) diophantine class.
