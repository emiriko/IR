We analyse the occurrence of quiescent times in the temporal structure of the
Gamma-Ray-Bursts (GRBs) light curves. We show that if a long quiescent time is
present, it is possible to divide the total duration of GRBs into three
periods: the pre-quiescence emission, the quiescent time and the
post-quiescence emission. We then discuss a model of the GRBs inner engine
based on the formation of quark phases during the life of an hadronic star.
Within this model the pre-quiescence emission is interpreted as due to the
deconfinement of quark inside an hadronic star and the formation of 2SC quark
matter. The post-quiescence emission is due to the conversion of 2SC into the
Color-Flavor-Locking (CFL) phase. The temporal delay between these two
processes is connected with the nucleation time of the CFL phase in the 2SC
phase and it can be associated with the observed quiescent times in the GRBs
light curves. The stability of CFL cores in compact stars is also discussed.
