Homogeneous isotropic cosmological models with two torsion functions filled
with scalar fields and usual gravitating matter are built and investigated in
the framework of the Poincar\'e gauge theory of gravity. It is shown that by
certain restrictions on indefinite parameters of gravitational Lagrangian the
cosmological equations at asymptotics contain an effective cosmological
constant that can explain observable acceleration of cosmological expansion.
The behavior of inflationary cosmological solutions at extremely high energy
densities is analyzed, regular bouncing solutions are obtained. The role of the
space-time torsion provoking the acceleration of cosmological expansion is
discussed.
