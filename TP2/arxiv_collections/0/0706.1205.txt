We use a T-matrix approximation to calculate the single particle spectrum of
the normal state of a gas of Fermionic atoms at low temperature.
  In the strongly interacting regime of the polarized gas, we find that the
spectrum is separated in two branches, leading to a double-peaked
radiofrequency spectral feature.
