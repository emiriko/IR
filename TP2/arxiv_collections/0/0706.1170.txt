We have realized a two dimensional permanent magnetic lattice of
Ioffe-Pritchard microtraps for ultracold atoms. The lattice is formed by a
single 300 nm magnetized layer of FePt, patterned using optical lithography.
Our magnetic lattice consists of more than 15000 tightly confining microtraps
with a density of 1250 traps/mm$^2$. Simple analytical approximations for the
magnetic fields produced by the lattice are used to derive relevant trap
parameters. We load ultracold atoms into at least 30 lattice sites at a
distance of approximately 10 $\mu$m from the film surface. The present result
is an important first step towards quantum information processing with neutral
atoms in magnetic lattice potentials.
