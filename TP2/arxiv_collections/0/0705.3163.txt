In the present work, the non-spherical dust grain characteristics of comet
Levy 1990XX with different silicate grain compositions (both pyroxene and
olivine) are studied using the T-matrix method. Considering amorphous pyroxene
grain (Mg$_x$Fe$_{1-x}$SiO$_3$) with $x$ (= 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.95, 1)
and amorphous olivine grain (Mg$_{2y}$Fe$_{2-2y}$SiO$_4$) with $y$ (= 0.4, 0.5)
(Dorschner et al. 1995), the observed polarization data of comet Levy1990XX are
analyzed using the T-matrix code at $\lambda$ = 0.485 $\mu m$.
