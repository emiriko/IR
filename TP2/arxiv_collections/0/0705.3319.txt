Anchoring is a term used in psychology to describe the common human tendency
to rely too heavily (anchor) on one piece of information when making decisions.
A trading algorithm inspired by biological motors, introduced by L.
Gil\cite{Gil}, is suggested as a testing ground for anchoring in financial
markets. An exact solution of the algorithm is presented for arbitrary price
distributions. Furthermore the algorithm is extended to cover the case of a
market neutral portfolio, revealing additional evidence that anchoring is
involved in the decision making of market participants. The exposure of
arbitrage possibilities created by anchoring gives yet another illustration on
the difficulty proving market efficiency by only considering lower order
correlations in past price time series
