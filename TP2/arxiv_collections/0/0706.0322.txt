We apply the technique of S^1-equivariant localization to sheaves on loop
spaces in derived algebraic geometry, and obtain a fundamental link between two
families of categories at the heart of geometric representation theory. Namely,
we categorify the well known relationship between free loop spaces, cyclic
homology and de Rham cohomology to recover the category of D-modules on a
smooth stack X as a localization of the category of S^1-equivariant coherent
sheaves on its loop space LX. The main observation is that this procedure
connects categories of equivariant D-modules on flag varieties with categories
of equivariant coherent sheaves on the Steinberg variety and its relatives.
This provides a direct connection between the geometry of finite and affine
Hecke algebras and braid groups, and a uniform geometric construction of all of
the categorical parameters for representations of real and complex reductive
groups. This paper forms the first step in a project to apply the geometric
Langlands program to the complex and real local Langlands programs, which we
describe.
