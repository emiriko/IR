We report a molecular dynamics simulation of melting of tungsten (W)
nanoparticles. The modified embedded atom method (MEAM) interatomic potentials
are used to describe the interaction between tungsten atoms. The melting
temperature of unsupported tungsten nanoparticles of different sizes are found
to decrease as the size of the particles decreases. The melting temperature
obtained in the present study is approximately a decreasing function of inverse
radius, in a good agreement with the predictions of thermodynamic models. We
also observed that the melting of a W nanoparticle is preceded by the
premelting of its outer skin at a temperature lower than its melting
temperature.
