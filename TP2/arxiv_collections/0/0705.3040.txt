We present exact analytical and numerical results for the electronic spectra
and the Friedel oscillations around a substitutional impurity atom in a
graphene lattice. A chemical dopant in graphene introduces changes in the
on-site potential as well as in the hopping amplitude. We employ a T-matrix
formalism and find that disorder in the hopping introduces additional
interference terms around the impurity that can be understood in terms of
bound, semi-bound, and unbound processes for the Dirac electrons. These
interference effects can be detected by scanning tunneling microscopy.
