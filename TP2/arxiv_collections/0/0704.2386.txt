In this paper we introduce a variant of pushdown dimension called bounded
pushdown (BPD) dimension, that measures the density of information contained in
a sequence, relative to a BPD automata, i.e. a finite state machine equipped
with an extra infinite memory stack, with the additional requirement that every
input symbol only allows a bounded number of stack movements. BPD automata are
a natural real-time restriction of pushdown automata. We show that BPD
dimension is a robust notion by giving an equivalent characterization of BPD
dimension in terms of BPD compressors. We then study the relationships between
BPD compression, and the standard Lempel-Ziv (LZ) compression algorithm, and
show that in contrast to the finite-state compressor case, LZ is not universal
for bounded pushdown compressors in a strong sense: we construct a sequence
that LZ fails to compress signicantly, but that is compressed by at least a
factor 2 by a BPD compressor. As a corollary we obtain a strong separation
between finite-state and BPD dimension.
