Albert Einstein made fundamental contributions to the development of quantum
mechanics. However, he was never satisfied with the quantum worldview. In fact,
during most of his life he attempted to find inconsistencies and paradoxes
within quantum mechanics. His famous quote "God does not play dice" shows how
disturbing was to Einstein one of the most important aspects of quantum
mechanics: non-determinism. In this paper we will present the basic concepts of
quantum mechanics, we will describe Einstein's attempts to destroy it and we
will discuss why we can nowadays state that, in this regard, Albert Einstein
was not right.
