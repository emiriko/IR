The paper makes a thermal predictive analysis of the electric power system
security for a day ahead. This predictive analysis is set as a thermal
computation of the expected security. This computation is obtained by
cointegrating the daily electric power systen load and the weather, by finding
the daily electric power system thermodynamics and by introducing tests for
this thermodynamics. The predictive analysis made shows the electricity
consumers' wisdom.
