The greatest challenge in the interpretation of galaxy clustering data from
any surveys is galaxy bias. Using a simple Fisher matrix analysis, we show that
the bispectrum provides an excellent determination of linear and non-linear
bias parameters of intermediate and high-z galaxies, when all measurable
triangle configurations down to mildly non-linear scales, where perturbation
theory is still valid, are included. The bispectrum is also a powerful probe of
primordial non-Gaussianity. The planned galaxy surveys at z>2 should yield
constraints on non-Gaussian parameters, f_{NL}^{loc.} and f_{NL}^{eq.}, that
are comparable to, or even better than, those from CMB experiments. We study
how these constraints improve with volume, redshift range, as well as the
number density of galaxies. Finally, we show that a halo occupation
distribution may be used to improve these constraints further by lifting
degeneracies between gravity, bias, and primordial non-Gaussianity.
