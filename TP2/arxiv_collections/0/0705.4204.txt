We investigate the noise properties of pump currents through molecular wires
and coupled quantum dots. As a model we employ a two level system that is
connected to electron reservoirs and is non-adiabatically driven. Concerning
the electron-electron interaction, we focus on two limits: non-interacting
electrons and strong Coulomb repulsion. While the former case is treated within
a Floquet scattering formalism, we derive for the latter case a master equation
formalism for the computation of the current and the zero-frequency noise. For
a pump operated close to internal resonances, the differences between the
non-interacting and the strongly interacting limit turn out to be surprisingly
small.
