The triplet and singlet low-energy parameters in the effective-range
expansion for neutron--proton scattering are determined by using the latest
experimental data on respective phase shifts from the SAID nucleon--nucleon
database. The results differ markedly from the analogous parameters obtained on
the basis of the phase shifts of the Nijmegen group and contradict the
parameter values that are presently used as experimental ones. The values found
with the aid of the phase shifts from the SAID nucleon--nucleon database for
the total cross section for the scattering of zero-energy neutrons by protons,
$\sigma_{0}=20.426 $b, and the neutron--proton coherent scattering length,
$f=-3.755 $fm, agree perfectly with the experimental cross-section values
obtained by Houk, $\sigma_{0}=20.436\pm 0.023 $b, and experimental
scattering-length values obtained by Houk and Wilson, $f=-3.756\pm 0.009 $fm,
but they contradict cross-section values of $\sigma_{0}=20.491\pm 0.014 $b
according to Dilg and coherent-scattering-length values of $f=-3.7409\pm 0.0011
$fm according to Koester and Nistler.
