A criterion is given for a type in a finite rank stable theory to be (almost)
internal to a given nonmodular minimal type. The motivation comes from results
of Campana which give criteria for compact complex analytic spaces to be
algebraic (namely Moishezon), in terms of the existence of "generating"
families of algebraic subvarieties. A model-theoretic anologue/generalisation
of Campana's results is given under the hypothesis that the theory has the
"canonical base property" (CBP), a property that is conjectured to hold in all
stable finite rank theories and which states that the type of the canonical
base over a realisation is almost internal to the minimal types of the theory.
