We study behaviors of a compact dimension and the $T$-duality, in the
presence of the wrapped closed bosonic strings. When the closed strings
interact and form another system of strings, the radius of compactification
increases. This modifies the $T$-duality, which we call it as $T$-duality-like.
Some effects of the $T$-duality-like will be studied.
