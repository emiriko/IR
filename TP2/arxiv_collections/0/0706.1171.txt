The present paper provides an overview of results obtained in four recent
papers by the authors. These papers address the problem of intermittency for
the Parabolic Anderson Model in a \emph{time-dependent random medium},
describing the evolution of a ``reactant'' in the presence of a ``catalyst''.
Three examples of catalysts are considered: (1) independent simple random
walks; (2) symmetric exclusion process; (3) symmetric voter model. The focus is
on the annealed Lyapunov exponents, i.e., the exponential growth rates of the
successive moments of the reactant. It turns out that these exponents exhibit
an interesting dependence on the dimension and on the diffusion constant.
