We study the effects of a high-frequency (HF) signal on the response of a
noisy bistable system to a low-frequency subthreshold sinusoidal signal. We
show that, by conveniently choosing the ratio of the amplitude of the HF signal
to its frequency, stochastic resonance gains greater than unity can be measured
at the low-frequency value. Thus, the addition of the HF signal can entail an
improvement in the detection of weak monochromatic signals. The results are
explained in terms of an effective model and illustrated by means of numerical
simulations.
