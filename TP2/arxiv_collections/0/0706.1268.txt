We report interlayer tunneling measurements between very dilute
two-dimensional GaAs hole layers. Surprisingly, the shape and
temperature-dependence of the tunneling spectrum can be explained with a Fermi
liquid-based tunneling model, but the peak amplitude is much larger than
expected from the available hole band parameters. Data as a function of
parallel magnetic field reveal additional anomalous features, including a
recurrence of a zero-bias tunneling peak at very large fields. In a
perpendicular magnetic field, we observe a robust and narrow tunneling peak at
total filling factor $\nu_T=1$, signaling the formation of a bilayer quantum
Hall ferromagnet.
