The gravitational phenomenon, founded on the assumption of absorption of a
flux of gravitons through the matter, led to a law of attraction comprising a
term of attenuation of gravity. The attenuation effect, which depends on the
distribution of mass elements into the Sun, was compared with the relativistic
effect for the orbital elements of planets. The calculations carried out with
our modified law of Newton, lead to a perfect agreement for the advance of the
perihelion of planets, and give an interaction cross section with the matter of
3.2x10^-17 m2/kg (approximately 10^-40 cm2/nucleon). The effect of attenuation
during a solar eclipse will produce a local reduction in the soli-lunar
attraction of 0.13 microgal. This small variation of gravity during the eclipse
can lead to distortions of the geoid of about ten millimetres of which effect
on gravity, estimated at a few microgals, is compatible with the observed
gravitational anomalies. The gravimetric measurements taken in the area of
Montreal during the Sun eclipse of May 10, 1994, show the existence of an
anomaly of 2.4 microgals that coincides perfectly with the period of the
eclipse.
