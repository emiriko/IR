The electronic dispersion for Bi2Sr2CaCu2O(8+d) has been determined from
angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES). From this dispersion we
calculate the entropy and superfluid density. Even with no adjustable
parameters we obtain an exceptional match with experimental data across the
entire phase diagram, thus indirectly confirming both the ARPES and
thermodynamic data. The van Hove singularity is crossed in the overdoped region
giving a distinctive linear-in-T temperature dependence in the superfluid
density there.
