We investigate the role of long range ferromagnetic order in the electronic
structure of Sr$_{1-x}$Ca$_x$RuO$_3$ using high resolution photoemission
spectroscopy. SrRuO$_3$ is a ferromagnetic metal but isostructural,
isoelectronic CaRuO$_3$ is an enhanced paramagnet. Surface spectra of CaRuO$_3$
exhibit temperature induced modifications. This is not significant in other
compositions. This may be attributed to the structural changes observed in
previous studies. Interestingly, the bulk spectra reveal unusual spectral
changes exhibiting large decrease in the coherent feature intensity
corresponding to only ferromagnetic samples, although the Ru moment is very
similar in all the compositions.
