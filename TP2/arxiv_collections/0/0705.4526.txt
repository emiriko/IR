The energies of the excited states in very neutron-rich $^{42}$Si and
$^{41,43}$P have been measured using in-beam $\gamma$-ray spectroscopy from the
fragmentation of secondary beams of $^{42,44}$S at 39 A.MeV. The low 2$^+$
energy of $^{42}$Si, 770(19) keV, together with the level schemes of
$^{41,43}$P provide evidence for the disappearance of the Z=14 and N=28
spherical shell closures, which is ascribed mainly to the action of
proton-neutron tensor forces. New shell model calculations indicate that
$^{42}$Si is best described as a well deformed oblate rotor.
