Nonequilibrium steady-state currents, unlike their equilibrium counterparts,
continuously dissipate energy into their physical surroundings leading to
entropy production and time-reversal symmetry breaking. This letter discusses
these issues in the context of quantum impurity models driven out of
equilibrium by attaching the impurity to leads at different chemical potentials
and temperatures. We start by pointing out that entropy production is often
hidden in traditional treatments of quantum-impurity models. We then use simple
thermodynamic arguments to define the rate of entropy production. Using the
scattering framework recently developed by the authors we show that the rate of
entropy production has a simple information theoretic interpretation in terms
of the Shannon entropy and Kullback-Leibler divergence of nonequilibrium
distribution function. This allows us to show that the entropy production is
strictly positive for any nonequilibrium steady-state. We conclude by applying
these ideas to the Resonance Level Model and the Kondo model.
