The positive and not completely positive maps of density matrices, which are
contractive maps, are discussed as elements of a semigroup. A new kind of
positive map (the purification map), which is nonlinear map, is introduced. The
density matrices are considered as vectors, linear maps among matrices are
represented by superoperators given in the form of higher dimensional matrices.
Probability representation of spin states (spin tomography) is reviewed and
U(N)-tomogram of spin states is presented. Properties of the tomograms as
probability distribution functions are studied. Notion of tomographic purity of
spin states is introduced. Entanglement and separability of density matrices
are expressed in terms of properties of the tomographic joint probability
distributions of random spin projections which depend also on unitary group
parameters. A new positivity criterion for hermitian matrices is formulated. An
entanglement criterion is given in terms of a function depending on unitary
group parameters and semigroup of positive map parameters. The function is
constructed as sum of moduli of U(N)-tomographic symbols of the hermitian
matrix obtained after action on the density matrix of composite system by a
positive but not completely positive map of the subsystem density matrix. Some
two-qubit and two-qutritt states are considered as examples of entangled
states. The connection with the star-product quantisation is discussed. The
structure of the set of density matrices and their relation to unitary group
and Lie algebra of the unitary group are studied. Nonlinear quantum evolution
of state vector obtained by means of applying purification rule of density
matrices evolving via dynamical maps is considered. Some connection of positive
maps and entanglement with random matrices is discussed and used.
