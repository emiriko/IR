We construct the phase diagrams of the quark-antiquark and diquark
condensates at finite temperature and density in the 3D (dimensional) 2-flavor
Gross Neveu model. We found that, in contrast to the case of the 4D Nambu
Jona-Lasinio model, there is no region where the quark-antiquark and diquark
condensates coexist. The phase diagrams obtained for some parameter region show
similar structure with the 4D QCD phase diagram.
