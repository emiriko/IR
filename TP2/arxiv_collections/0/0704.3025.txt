A two-staged, uniaxial magnetoresistive effect has been discovered in
SrCo6O11 having a layered hexagonal structure. Conduction electrons and
localized Ising spins are in different sublattices but their interpenetration
makes the conduction electrons sensitively pick up the stepwise
field-dependence of magnetization. The stepwise field-dependence suggests two
competitive interlayer interactions between ferromagnetic Ising-spin layers,
i.e., a ferromagnetic nearest-layer interaction and an antiferromagnetic
next-nearest-layer interaction. This oxide offers a unique opportunity to study
nontrivial interplay between conduction electrons and Ising spins, the coupling
of which can be finely controlled by a magnetic field of a few Tesla.
