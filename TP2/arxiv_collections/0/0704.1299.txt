We review the X-ray studies of the highest redshift quasars, focusing on the
results obtained with Chandra and XMM-Newton. Overall, the X-ray and broad-band
properties of z>4 quasars and local quasars are similar, suggesting that the
small-scale X-ray emission regions of AGN are insensitive to the significant
changes occurring at z=0-6.
