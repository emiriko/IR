We evaluate the two-loop corrections to Bhabha scattering from fermion loops
in the context of pure Quantum Electrodynamics. The differential cross section
is expressed by a small number of Master Integrals with exact dependence on the
fermion masses me, mf and the Mandelstam invariants s,t,u. We determine the
limit of fixed scattering angle and high energy, assuming the hierarchy of
scales me^2 << mf^2 << s,t,u. The numerical result is combined with the
available non-fermionic contributions. As a by-product, we provide an
independent check of the known electron-loop contributions.
