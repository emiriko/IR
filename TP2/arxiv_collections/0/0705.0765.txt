A new symplectic variational approach is developed for modeling dissipation
in kinetic equations. This approach yields a double bracket structure in phase
space which generates kinetic equations representing coadjoint motion under
canonical transformations. The Vlasov example admits measure-valued
single-particle solutions. Such solutions are reversible; and the total entropy
is a Casimir, and thus is preserved.
