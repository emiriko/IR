A simple optical method is presented for identifying and measuring the
effective optical properties of nanometer-thick, graphene-based materials,
based on the use of substrates consisting of a thin dielectric layer on
silicon. High contrast between the graphene-based materials and the substrate
is obtained by choosing appropriate optical properties and thickness of the
dielectric layer. The effective refractive index and optical absorption
coefficient of graphene oxide, thermally reduced graphene oxide, and graphene
are obtained by comparing the predicted and measured contrasts.
