A practical scheme for entanglement creation between distant atoms located
inside a single-mode optical cavity is discussed. We show that the degree of
entanglement and the time it takes for the entanglement to reach its optimum
value is a sensitive function the initial conditions and the position of the
atoms inside the cavity mode. It is found that the entangled properties of the
two atoms can readily be extracted from dynamics of a simple two-level system.
Effectively, we engineer two coupled qubits whose the dynamics are analogous to
that of a driven single two-level system. It is found that spatial variations
of the coupling constants actually help to create transient entanglement which
may appear on the time scale much longer than that predicted for the case of
equal coupling constants. When the atoms are initially prepared in an entangled
state, they may remain entangled for all times. We also find that the
entanglement exhibits an interesting phenomenon of diffraction when the the
atoms are located between the nodes and antinodes of the cavity mode. The
diffraction pattern of the entanglement varies with time and we explain this
effect in terms of the quantum property of complementarity, which is manifested
as a tradeoff between the knowledge of energy of the exchanged photon versus
the evolution time of the system.
