We discuss the calculation of evanescent states in quasi-one-dimensional
quantum wires in the presence of Rashba spin-orbit interaction. We suggest a
computational algorithm devised for cases in which longitudinal and transverse
motions are coupled. The dispersion relations are given for some selected
cases, illustrating the feasibility of the proposed computational method. As a
practical application, we discuss the solutions for a wire containing a
potential step.
