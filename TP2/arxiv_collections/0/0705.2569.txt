We describe a self-biased, fully permanent magnet atom chip used to study
ultracold atoms and to produce a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). The magnetic
trap is loaded efficiently by adiabatic transport of a magnetic trap via the
application of uniform external fields. Radio frequency spectroscopy is used
for in-trap analysis and to determine the temperature of the atomic cloud. The
formation of a Bose-Einstein condensate is observed in time of flight images
and as a narrow peak appearing in the radio frequency spectrum.
