The Hamiltonian Theory of the fractional quantum Hall effect is an operator
description that subsumes many properties of Composite Fermions, applies to
gapped and gapless cases, and has been found to provide results in quantitative
accord with data on gaps, relaxation rates and polarizations at temperatures of
$300mK$ and above. The only free parameter is $\lambda$, which is related to
the sample thickness and appears in the Zhang-Das Sarma potential $v(q) = {2\pi
e^2\over \kappa q} e^{-ql\lambda}$ where $l$ and $\kappa $ are the magnetic
length and dielectric constant. Here we examine the recent data of Tracy and
Eisenstein on the nuclear magnetic resonance relaxation rate at filling factor
$\nu=\half$ deduced from resistivity measurements at temperatures as low as
$45mK$. We find that their results can be satisfactorily described by this
theory, if in addition to a $v(q)$ with $\lambda \simeq 2$, a constant disorder
width $\Gamma\simeq 100 mK$ is incorporated.
