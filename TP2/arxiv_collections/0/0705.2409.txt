A model-independent analysis of the infinite-momentum-frame charge density of
partons in the transverse plane is presented for the nucleon. We find that the
neutron parton charge density is negative at the center, so that the square of
the transverse charge radius is positive, in contrast with many expectations.
Additionally, the proton's central u quark charge density is larger than that
of the d quark by about 70 %. The proton (neutron) charge density has a long
range positively (negatively) charged component.
