Recent observations of two nearby SN-less long-duration gamma-ray bursts
(GRBs), which share no obvious characteristics in their prompt emission,
suggest a new phenomenological type of massive stellar death. Here we briefly
review the observational properties of these bursts and their proposed hosts,
and discuss whether a new GRB classification scheme is needed.
