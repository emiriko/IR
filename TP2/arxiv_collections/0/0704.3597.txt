We present results of the HST Advanced Camera for Surveys spectroscopic
ground-based redshift survey in the field of A1689. We measure 98 redshifts,
increasing the number of spectroscopically confirmed objects by sixfold. We
present two spectra from this catalog of the Sextet Arcs, images which arise
from a strongly-lensed Lyman Break Galaxy (LBG) at a redshift of z=3.038.
Gravitational lensing by the cluster magnifies its flux by a factor of ~16 and
produces six separate images with a total r-band magnitude of r_625=21.7. The
two spectra, each of which represents emission from different regions of the
LBG, show H I and interstellar metal absorption lines at the systemic redshift.
Significant variations are seen in Ly-alpha profile across a single galaxy,
ranging from strong absorption to a combination of emission plus absorption. A
spectrum of a third image close to the brightest arc shows Ly-alpha emission at
the same redshift as the LBG, arising from either another spatially distinct
region of the galaxy, or from a companion galaxy close to the LBG. Taken as a
group, the Ly-alpha equivalent width in these three spectra decreases with
increasing equivalent width of the strongest interstellar absorption lines. We
discuss how these variations can be used to understand the physical conditions
in the LBG. Intrinsically, this LBG is faint, ~0.1L*, and forming stars at a
modest rate, ~4 solar masses per year. We also detect absorption line systems
toward the Sextet Arcs at z=2.873 and z=2.534. The latter system is seen across
two of our spectra.
