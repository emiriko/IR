The knowledge of the nuclear symmetry energy of hot neutron-rich matter is
important for understanding the dynamical evolution of massive stars and the
supernova explosion mechanisms. In particular, the electron capture rate on
nuclei and/or free protons in presupernova explosions is especially sensitive
to the symmetry energy at finite temperature. In view of the above, in the
present work we calculate the symmetry energy as a function of the temperature
for various values of the baryon density, by applying a momentum-dependent
effective interaction. In addition to a previous work, the thermal effects are
studied separately both in the kinetic part and the interaction part of the
symmetry energy. We focus also on the calculations of the mean field potential,
employed extensively in heavy ion reaction research, both for nuclear and pure
neutron matter. The proton fraction and the electron chemical potential, which
are crucial quantities for representing the thermal evolution of supernova and
neutron stars, are calculated for various values of the temperature. Finally,
we construct a temperature dependent equation of state of $\beta$-stable
nuclear matter, the basic ingredient for the evaluation of the neutron star
properties.
