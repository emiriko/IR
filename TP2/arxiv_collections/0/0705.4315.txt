We will look for an implementation of new symmetries in the space-time
structure and their cosmological implications. This search will allow us to
find a unified vision for electrodynamics and gravitation. We will attempt to
develop a heuristic model of the electromagnetic nature of the electron, so
that the influence of the gravitational field on the electrodynamics at very
large distances leads to a reformulation of our comprehension of the space-
time structure at quantum level through the elimination of the classical idea
of rest. This will lead us to a modification of the relativistic theory by
introducing the idea about a universal minimum limit of speed in the space-
time. Such a limit, unattainable by the particles, represents a preferred frame
associated with a universal background field (a vacuum energy), enabling a
fundamental understanding of the quantum uncertainties. The structure of
space-time becomes extended due to such a vacuum energy density, which leads to
a negative pressure at the cosmological scales as an anti-gravity, playing the
role of the cosmological constant. The tiny values of the vacuum energy density
and the cosmological constant will be successfully obtained, being in agreement
with current observational results.
