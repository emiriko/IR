Role of axiom of choice in quantum measurement is highlighted by suggesting
that the conscious observer chooses the outcome from a mixed state. Further, in
a periodically repeating universe, these outcomes must be pre-recorded within
the non-physical conscious observers, which precludes free will. Free will
however exists in a universe with open time, It is suggested that psychology's
binding problem is connected with Cantor's original definition of set.
Influence of consciousness on material outcome through quantum processes is
discussed and interesting constraints derived. For example, it is predicted
that quantum mechanical brain states should get frozen if monitored at
sufficiently small space-time intervals - a neuro-biological version of the so
called quantum zeno effect, which has been verified in domain of micro-physics.
Existence of a very small micro-mini-black-hole in brain is predicted as a
space-time structural interface between consciousness and brain, whose
vaporization explains mass-loss reported in weighing experiments, conducting
during the moments of death.
