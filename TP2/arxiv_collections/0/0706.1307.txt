We study numerically finite-size corrections in scaling relations for
roughness distributions of various interface growth models. The most common
relation, which considers the average roughness $<w_2>$ as scaling factor, is
not obeyed in the steady states of a group of ballistic-like models in 2+1
dimensions, even when very large system sizes are considered. On the other
hand, good collapse of the same data is obtained with a scaling relation that
involves the root mean square fluctuation of the roughness, which can be
explained by finite-size effects on second moments of the scaling functions. We
also obtain data collapse with an alternative scaling relation that accounts
for the effect of the intrinsic width, which is a constant correction term
previously proposed for the scaling of $<w_2>$. This illustrates how
finite-size corrections can be obtained from roughness distributions scaling.
However, we discard the usual interpretation that the intrinsic width is a
consequence of high surface steps by analyzing data of restricted
solid-on-solid models with various maximal height differences between
neighboring columns. We also observe that large finite-size corrections in the
roughness distributions are usually accompanied by huge corrections in height
distributions and average local slopes, as well as in estimates of scaling
exponents. The molecular-beam epitaxy model of Das Sarma and Tamborenea in 1+1
dimensions is a case example in which none of the proposed scaling relations
works properly, while the other measured quantities do not converge to the
expected asymptotic values. Thus, although roughness distributions are clearly
better than other quantities to determine the universality class of a growing
system, it is not the final solution for this task.
