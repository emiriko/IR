We outline a practical scheme for measuring the thermodynamic properties of a
Bose-Einstein condensate as a function of internal energy. We propose using
Bragg scattering and controlled trap manipulations to impart a precise amount
of energy to a near zero temperature condensate. After thermalisation the
temperature can be measured using standard techniques to determine the state
equation $T(U,N,\omega)$. Our analysis accounts for interaction effects and the
excitation of constants of motion which restrict the energy available for
thermalisation.
