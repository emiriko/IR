Motivated by recent experiments on BaCuSi2O6, we investigate magnetic
excitations and quantum phase transitions of layered dimer magnets with
inter-layer frustration. We consider two scenarios, (A) a lattice with one
dimer per unit cell and perfect inter-layer frustration, and (B) an enlarged
unit cell with inequivalent layers, with and without perfect frustration. In
all situations, the critical behavior at asymptotically low temperatures is
three-dimensional, but the corresponding crossover scale may be tiny. Magnetic
ordering in case (B) can be discussed in terms of two condensates; remarkably,
perfect frustration renders the proximity effect ineffective. Then, the
ordering transition will be generically split, with clear signatures in
measurable properties. Using a generalized bond-operator method, we calculate
the low-temperature magnetic properties in the paramagnetic and
antiferromagnetic phases. Based on the available experimental data on
BaCuSi2O6, we propose that scenario (B) with inequivalent layers and imperfect
frustration is realized in this material, likely with an additional modulation
of the inter-layer couling along the c axis.
