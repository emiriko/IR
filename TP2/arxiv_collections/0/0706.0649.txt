We investigate the braneworld model with induced gravity to clarify the role
of the cross-over length scale \ell in the possible explanation of the
dark-matter phenomenon in astrophysics and in cosmology. Observations of the 21
cm line from neutral hydrogen clouds in spiral galaxies reveal that the
rotational velocities remain nearly constant at a value v_c ~ 10^{-3}--10^{-4}
in the units of the speed of light in the region of the galactic halo. Using
the smallness of v_c, we develop a perturbative scheme for reconstructing the
metric in a galactic halo. In the leading order of expansion in v_c, at the
distances r \gtrsim v_c \ell, our result reproduces that obtained in the
Randall-Sundrum braneworld model. This inequality is satisfied in a real spiral
galaxy such as our Milky Way for distances r ~ 3 kpc, at which the rotational
velocity curve becomes flat, v_c ~ 7 \times 10^{-4}, if \ell \lesssim 2 Mpc.
The gravitational situation in this case can be approximately described by the
Einstein equations with the so-called Weyl fluid playing the role of dark
matter. In the region near the gravitating body, we derive a closed system of
equations for static spherically symmetric situation under the approximation of
zero anisotropic stress of the Weyl fluid. We find the Schwarzschild metric to
be an approximate vacuum solution of these equations at distances r \lesssim
(r_g \ell^2)^{1/3}. The value \ell \lesssim 2 Mpc complies well with the
solar-system tests. At the same time, in cosmology, a low-density braneworld
with \ell of this order of magnitude can mimic the expansion properties of the
high-density LCDM (lambda + cold dark matter) universe at late times. Combined
observations of galactic rotation curves and gravitational lensing can possibly
discriminate between the higher-dimensional effects and dark matter.
