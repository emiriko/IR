In these lectures I will review some theoretical results that have been
obtained for spin glasses. I will concentrate my attention on the formulation
of the mean field approach and on its numerical and experimental verifications.
I will present the various hypothesis at the basis of the theory and I will
discuss their mathematical and physical status.
