The viscosity and self-diffusion constant of a mesoscale hydrodynamic method,
dissipative particle dynamics (DPD), are investigated. The viscosity of DPD
with finite time step, including the Lowe-Anderson thermostat, is derived
analytically for the ideal-gas equation of state and phenomenologically for
systems with soft repulsive potentials. The results agree well with numerical
data. The scaling of the local relative velocity in molecular dynamics
simulations is shown to be useful to obtain faster diffusion than for the DPD
thermostat.
