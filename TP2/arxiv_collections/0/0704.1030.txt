The effect of etching time scale of glass surface on its statistical
properties has been studied using atomic force microscopy technique. We have
characterized the complexity of the height fluctuation of a etched surface by
the stochastic parameters such as intermittency exponents, roughness, roughness
exponents, drift and diffusion coefficients and find their variations in terms
of the etching time.
