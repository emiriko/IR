We performed phase-reference very long baseline interferometry (VLBI)
observations on five radio-loud narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1s) at 8.4
GHz with the Japanese VLBI Network (JVN). Each of the five targets (RXS
J08066+7248, RXS J16290+4007, RXS J16333+4718, RXS J16446+2619, and B3
1702+457) in milli-Jansky levels were detected and unresolved in
milli-arcsecond resolutions, i.e., with brightness temperatures higher than
10^7 K. The nonthermal processes of active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity,
rather than starbursts, are predominantly responsible for the radio emissions
from these NLS1s. Out of the nine known radio-loud NLS1s, including the ones
chosen for this study, we found that the four most radio-loud objects
exclusively have inverted spectra. This suggests a possibility that these NLS1s
are radio-loud due to Doppler beaming, which can apparently enhance both the
radio power and the spectral frequency.
