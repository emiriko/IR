We study the Stokes-Einstein (SE) and the Stokes-Einstein-Debye (SED)
relations using molecular dynamics simulations of the extended simple point
charge model of water. We find that both the SE and SED relations break down at
low temperature. To explore the relationship between these breakdowns and
dynamical heterogeneities (DH), we also calculate the SE and SED relations for
subsets of the 7% ``fastest'' and 7% ``slowest'' molecules. We find that the SE
and SED relations break down in both subsets, and that the breakdowns occur on
all scales of mobility. Thus these breakdowns appear to be generalized
phenomena, in contrast with the view where only the most mobile molecules are
the origin of the breakdown of the SE and SED relations, embedded in an
inactive background where these relations hold. At low temperature, the SE and
SED relations in both subsets of molecules are replaced with ``fractional'' SE
and SED relations, $D_t\sim(\tau/T)^{-\xi_t}$ and $D_r\sim(\tau/T)^{-\xi_r}$
where $\xi_t\approx0.84<1$ and $\xi_r\approx0.75<1$. We also find that there is
a decoupling between rotational and translational motion, and that this
decoupling occurs in both fastest and slowest subsets of molecules. We also
find that when the decoupling increases, upon cooling, the probability of a
molecule being classified as both translationally and rotationally fastest also
increases. To study the effect of time scale for SE and SED breakdown and
decoupling, we introduce a time-dependent version of the SE and SED relations,
and a time-dependent function that measures the extent of decoupling. Our
results suggest that both the decoupling and SE and SED breakdowns are
originated at the time scale corresponding to the end of the cage regime, when
diffusion starts. This is also the time scale when the DH are more relevant.
