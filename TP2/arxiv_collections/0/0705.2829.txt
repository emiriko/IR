We prove that Prym varieties are characterized geometrically by the existence
of a symmetric pair of quadrisecant planes of the associated Kummer variety. We
also show that Prym varieties are characterized by certain (new)
theta-functional equations. For this purpose we construct and study a
difference-differential analog of the Novikov-Veselov hierarchy.
