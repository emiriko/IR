Key-exchange protocols have been overlooked as a possible means for
implementing oblivious transfer (OT). In this paper we present a protocol for
mutual exchange of secrets, 1-out-of-2 OT and coin flipping similar to
Diffie-Hellman protocol using the idea of obliviously exchanging encryption
keys. Since, Diffie-Hellman scheme is widely used, our protocol may provide a
useful alternative to the conventional methods for implementation of oblivious
transfer and a useful primitive in building larger cryptographic schemes.
