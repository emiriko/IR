We study electrical excitation of nonlinear plasma waves in heterostructures
with two-dimensional electron channels and with split gates, and the
propagation of these waves using hydrodynamic equations for electron transport
coupled with two-dimensional Poisson equation for self-consistent electric
potential. The term related to electron collisions with impurities and phonons
as well as the term associated with viscosity are included into the
hydrodynamic equations. We demonstrate the formation of shock and soliton-like
waves as a result of the evolution of strongly nonuniform initial electron
density distribution. It is shown that the shock wave front and the shape of
soliton-like pulses pronouncedly depend on the coefficient of viscosity, the
thickness of the gate layer and the nonuniformity of the donor distribution
along the channel. The electron collisions result in damping of the shock and
soliton-like waves, while they do not markedly affect the thickness of the
shock wave front.
