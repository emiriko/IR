The coherent hadron production analogous to Cherenkov radiation of photons
gives rise to the ring-like events. Being projected on the ring diameter they
produce the two-bump structure recently observed for the away-side jets at
RHIC. The position of the peaks and their height determine such properties of
the hadronic medium as its nuclear refractive index, the parton density, the
free path length and the energy loss of Cherenkov gluons. Cherenkov gluons may
be responsible for the asymmetry of dilepton mass spectra near rho-meson
observed in experiment. Beside comparatively low energy gluons observed at
RHIC, there could be high energy gluons at LHC, related to the high energy
region of positive real part of the forward scattering amplitude and possessing
different characteristics. This would allow to scan (x, Q^2)-plane determining
the parton densities in its various regions.
