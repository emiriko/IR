The purpose of this paper is to determine the asymptotic of the average
energy of a configuration of N zeros of system of random polynomials of degree
N as N tends to infinity and more generally the zeros of random holomorphic
sections of a line bundle L over any Riemann surface M. And we compare our
results to the well-known minimum of energies.
