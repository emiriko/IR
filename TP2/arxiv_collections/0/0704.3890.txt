We introduce a distributed algorithm for clock synchronization in sensor
networks. Our algorithm assumes that nodes in the network only know their
immediate neighborhoods and an upper bound on the network's diameter.
Clock-synchronization messages are only sent as part of the communication,
assumed reasonably frequent, that already takes place among nodes. The
algorithm has the gradient property of [2], achieving an O(1) worst-case skew
between the logical clocks of neighbors. As in the case of [3,8], the
algorithm's actions are such that no constant lower bound exists on the rate at
which logical clocks progress in time, and for this reason the lower bound of
[2,5] that forbids constant skew between neighbors does not apply.
