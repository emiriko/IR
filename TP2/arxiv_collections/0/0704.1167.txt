We study electronic transport properties of ferromagnetic nanoparticle arrays
and nanodomain materials near the Curie temperature in the limit of weak
coupling between the grains. We calculate the conductivity in the Ohmic and
non-Ohmic regimes and estimate the magnetoresistance jump in the resistivity at
the transition temperature. The results are applicable for many emerging
materials, including artificially self-assembled nanoparticle arrays and a
certain class of manganites, where localization effects within the clusters can
be neglected.
