This paper is the second in the series of papers on near-infrared (NIR)
stellar spectral library produced by reducing the observations carried out with
1.2 meter Gurushikhar Infrared Telescope (GIRT), at Mt. Abu, India using a
NICMOS3 HgCdTe 256 X 256 NIR array based spectrometer. In paper I (Ranade et
al. 2004), H-band spectra of 135 stars at a resolution of ~16 Ang were
presented. The K-band library being released now consists of 114 stars covering
spectral types O7--M7 and luminosity classes I--V. The spectra have a moderate
resolution of ~22 Ang in the K band and have been continuum shape corrected to
their respective effective temperatures. We hope to release the remaining
J-band spectra soon. The complete H and K-Band library is available online at:
