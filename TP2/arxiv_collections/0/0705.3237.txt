In this work, we present a general procedure, which is able to generate new
exact solitonic models in 1+1 dimensions, from a known one, consisting of two
coupled scalar fields. An interesting consequence of the method, is that of the
appearing of nontrivial extensions, where the deformed systems presents other
BPS solitons than that appearing in the original model. Finally we take a
particular example, in order to check the above mentioned features.
