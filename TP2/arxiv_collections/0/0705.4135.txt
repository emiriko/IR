We perform first-principles quantum simulations of dissociation of trapped,
spatially inhomogeneous Bose-Einstein condensates of molecular dimers.
Specifically, we study spatial pair correlations of atoms produced in
dissociation after time of flight. We find that the observable correlations may
significantly degrade in systems with spatial inhomogeneity compared to the
predictions of idealized uniform models. We show how binning of the signal can
enhance the detectable correlations and lead to the violation of the classical
Cauchy-Schwartz inequality and relative number squeezing.
