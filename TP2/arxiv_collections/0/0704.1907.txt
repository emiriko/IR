High dispersion near-infrared spectra have been taken of seven
highly-evolved, variable, intermediate-mass (4-6 Msun) AGB stars in the LMC and
SMC in order to look for C, N and O variations that are expected to arise from
third dredge-up and hot-bottom burning. The pulsation of the objects has been
modelled, yielding stellar masses, and spectral synthesis calculations have
been performed in order to derive abundances from the observed spectra. For two
stars, abundances of C, N, O, Na, Al, Ti, Sc and Fe were derived and compared
with the abundances predicted by detailed AGB models. Both stars show very
large N enhancements and C deficiencies. These results provide the first
observational confirmation of the long-predicted production of primary nitrogen
by the combination of third dredge-up and hot-bottom burning in
intermediate-mass AGB stars. It was not possible to derive abundances for the
remaining five stars: three were too cool to model, while another two had
strong shocks in their atmospheres which caused strong emission to fill the
line cores and made abundance determination impossible. The latter occurrence
allows us to predict the pulsation phase interval during which observations
should be made if successful abundance analysis is to be possible.
