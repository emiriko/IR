A cohomology theory of the adjoint of Hopf algebras, via deformations, is
presented by means of diagrammatic techniques. Explicit calculations are
provided in the cases of group algebras, function algebras on groups, and the
bosonization of the super line. As applications, solutions to the YBE are given
and quandle cocycles are constructed from groupoid cocycles.
