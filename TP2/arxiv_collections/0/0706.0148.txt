Quasars (of type I) are the luminous analogs of type I Seyfert galaxies.
Within the framework of unified models of active galaxies, the population of
quasars of type II recently discovered with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey are
the luminous analogs of type II Seyfert galaxies. Since our knowledge and
understanding of the radio properties of these type II quasars are very
limited, we have performed Very Large Array observations for a sub-sample of
such sources. Our detection rate of 61% is consistent with the detection rate
for other AGN samples. We do not find a correlation between radio and [O III]
$\lambda$5007 luminosities for these sources. Although the distribution of
spectral indices is similar to that of the 3C sources, the lack of dependence
of radio luminosity on [O III] $\lambda$5007 luminosity suggests that not all
sources in the sample are genuine AGNs.
