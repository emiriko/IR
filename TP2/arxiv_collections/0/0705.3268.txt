We illustrate that open quantum systems composed of neutral, ultracold atoms
in one-dimensional optical lattices can exhibit behavior analogous to
semiconductor electronic circuits. A correspondence is demonstrated for bosonic
atoms, and the experimental requirements to realize these devices are
established. The analysis follows from a derivation of a quantum master
equation for this general class of open quantum systems.
