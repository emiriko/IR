Black hole production at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is an interesting
consequence of TeV-scale gravity models. The predicted values, or lower limits,
for the fundamental Planck scale and number of extra dimensions will depend
directly on the accuracy of the black hole production cross-section. We give a
range of lower limits on the fundamental Planck scale that could be obtained at
LHC energies. In addition, we examine the effects of parton electric charge on
black hole production using the trapped-surface approach of general relativity.
Accounting for electric charge of the partons could reduce the black hole
cross-section by one to four orders of magnitude at the LHC.
