In this paper, we used the multiconfiguration Dirac-Fock method to compute
with high precision the influence of the hyperfine interaction on the
$[Ar]3d^{10} 4s4p ^3P_0$ level lifetime in Zn-like ions for stable and some
quasi-stable isotopes of nonzero nuclear spin between Z=30 and Z=92. The
influence of this interaction on the $[Ar]3d^{10} 4s4p ^3P_1 - [Ar]3d^{10} 4s4p
^3P_0$ separation energy is also calculated for the same ions.
