Through polarization observations masers are unique probes of the magnetic
field in a variety of different astronomical objects, with the different maser
species tracing different physical conditions. In recent years maser
polarization observations have provided insights in the magnetic field strength
and morphology in, among others, the envelopes around evolved stars, Planetary
Nebulae (PNe), massive star forming regions and supernova remnants. More
recently, maser observations have even been used to determine the magnetic
field in megamaser galaxies. This review will present an overview of maser
polarization observations and magnetic field determinations of the last several
years and discuss the implications of the magnetic field measurements for
several important fields of study, such as aspherical PNe creation and massive
star formation.
