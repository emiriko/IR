Let (\Omega,\mathcal{B},P) be a probability space, \mathcal{A} a
sub-sigma-field of \mathcal{B}, and \mu a regular conditional distribution for
P given \mathcal{A}. For various, classically interesting, choices of
\mathcal{A} (including tail and symmetric) the following 0-1 law is proved:
There is a set A_0 in \mathcal{A} such that P(A_0)=1 and \mu(\omega)(A) is 0 or
1 for all A in \mathcal{A} and \omega in A_0. Provided \mathcal{B} is countably
generated (and certain regular conditional distributions exist), the result
applies whatever P is.
