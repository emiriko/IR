We consider interactions that generate a universal set of quantum gates on
logical qubits encoded in a collective-dephasing-free subspace, and discuss
their implementations with trapped ions. This allows for the removal of the
by-far largest source of decoherence in current trapped-ion experiments,
collective dephasing. In addition, an explicit parametrization of all two-body
Hamiltonians able to generate such gates without the system's state ever
exiting the protected subspace is provided.
