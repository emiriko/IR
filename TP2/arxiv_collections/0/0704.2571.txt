Author offers and researches a new, cheap method for the extraction of
freshwater from the Earth atmosphere. The suggected method is fundamentally
dictinct from all existing methods that extract freshwater from air. All other
industrial methods extract water from a saline water source (in most cases from
seawater). This new method may be used at any point in the Earth except Polar
Zones. It does not require long-distance freshwater transportation. If seawater
is not utilized for increasing its productivity, this inexpensive new method is
very environment-friendly. The author method has two working versions: (1) the
first variant the warm (hot) atmospheric air is lifted by the inflatable tube
in a high altitude and atmospheric steam is condenced into freswater: (2) in
the second version, the warm air is pumped 20-30 meters under the sea-surface.
In the first version, wind and solar heating of air are used for causing air
flow. In version (2) wind and propeller are used for causing air movment.
  The first method does not need energy, the second needs a small amount.
Moreover, in variant (1) the freshwater has a high pressure (>30 or more atm.)
and can be used for production of energy such as electricity and in that way
the freshwater cost is lower. For increasing the productivity the seawater is
injected into air and solar air heater may be used. The solar air heater
produces a huge amount of electricity as a very powerful electricity generation
plant. The offered electricity installation in 100 - 200 times cheaper than any
common electric plant of equivalent output.
  Key words: Extraction freshwater, method of getting freshwater, receiving
energy from atmosphere, powerful renewal electric plant.
