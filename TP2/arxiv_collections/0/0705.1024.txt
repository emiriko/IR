This works presents results of activation-aided determination of threshold
reaction rates in 92 209Bi, natPb, 197Au, 181Ta, 169Tm, natIn, 93Nb, 64Zn,
65Cu, 63Cu, 59Co, 19F, and 12C samples and in 121 27Al samples. All the samples
were aligned with the proton beam axis inside and outside the demountable 92-cm
thick Pb target of 15-cm diameter assembled of 23 4-cm thick discs. The samples
were placed on 12 target disks to reproduce the long axis distribution of
protons and neutrons. In June 2006, the target was exposed for 18 hours to a
800-MeV proton beam extracted from the ITEP U-10 accelerator. The proton
fluence and the proton beam shape were determined using the 27Al(p,x)7Be
monitor reaction. The reaction rates were determined by the direct
gamma-spectrometry techniques. In total, 1196 gamma-spectra have been measured,
and about 1500 reaction rates determined. The measured reaction rates were
simulated by the MCNPX code using the following databases: ENDF/B6 for neutrons
below 20 MeV, MENDL2 for 20-100 MeV neutrons, and MENDL2P for proton cross
sections up to 200 MeV. An acceptable agreement of simulations with
experimental data has been found.
