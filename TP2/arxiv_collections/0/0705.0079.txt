In some models of supersymmetry breaking, modulus fields are heavy enough to
decay before BBN. But the large entropy produced via moduli decay significantly
dilutes the preexisting baryon asymmetry of the universe. We study whether
Affleck-Dine mechanism can provide enough baryon asymmetry which survives the
dilution, and find several situations in which desirable amount of baryon
number remains after the dilution. The possibility of non-thermal dark matter
is also discussed. This provides the realistic cosmological scenario with heavy
moduli.
