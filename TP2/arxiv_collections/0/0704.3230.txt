We report molecular dynamics simulations of the segregation of two
overlapping chains in cylindrical confinement. We find that the entropic
repulsion between the chains can be sufficiently strong to cause segregation on
a time scale that is short compared to the one for diffusion. This result
implies that entropic driving forces are sufficiently strong to cause rapid
bacterial chromosome segregation.
