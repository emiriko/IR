Pumping of charge current by spin dynamics in the presence of the Rashba
spin-orbit interaction is theoretically studied. Considering disordered
electron, the exchange coupling and spin-orbit interactions are treated
perturbatively. It is found that dominant current induced by the spin dynamics
is interpreted as a consequence of the conversion from spin current via the
inverse spin Hall effect. We also found that the current has an additional
component from a fictitious conservative field. Results are applied to the case
of moving domain wall.
