We test the Yilmaz theory of gravitation by working out the corresponding
Friedmann-type equations generated by assuming the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker
cosmological metrics. In the case that space is flat the theory is consistent
only with either a completely empty universe or a negative energy vacuum that
decays to produce a constant density of matter. In both cases the total energy
remains zero at all times, and in the latter case the acceleration of the
expansion is always negative. To obtain a more flexible and potentially more
realistic cosmology, the equation of state relating the pressure and energy
density of the matter creation process must be different from the vacuum, as
for example is the case in the steady-state models of Gold, Bondi, Hoyle and
others. The theory does not support the cosmological principle for curved space
