The Minkowski Question Mark function can be characterized as the unique
homeomorphism of the real unit interval that conjugates the Farey map with the
tent map. We construct an n-dimensional analogue of the Minkowski function as
the only homeomorphism of an n-simplex that conjugates the piecewise-fractional
map associated to the Monkemeyer continued fraction algorithm with an
appropriate tent map.
