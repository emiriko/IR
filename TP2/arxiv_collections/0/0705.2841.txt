Just as a coherent state may be considered as a quantum point, its
restriction to a factor space of the full Hilbert space can be interpreted as a
quantum plane. The overlap of such a factor coherent state with a full pure
state is akin to a quantum section. It defines a reduced pure state in the
cofactor Hilbert space. The collection of all the Wigner functions
corresponding to a full set of parallel quantum sections defines the
Husimi-Wigner reresentation. It occupies an intermediate ground between drastic
suppression of nonclassical features, characteristic of Husimi functions, and
the daunting complexity of higher dimensional Wigner functions. After analysing
these features for simpler states, we exploit this new representation as a
probe of numerically computed eigenstates of chaotic Hamiltonians. The
individual two-dimensional Wigner functions resemble those of semiclassically
quantized states, but the regular ring pattern is broken by dislocations.
