In 1980 Jimbo and Miwa evaluated the diagonal two-point correlation function
of the square lattice Ising model as a $\tau$-function of the sixth Painlev\'e
system by constructing an associated isomonodromic system within their theory
of holonomic quantum fields. More recently an alternative isomonodromy theory
was constructed based on bi-orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle with
regular semi-classical weights, for which the diagonal Ising correlations arise
as the leading coefficient of the polynomials specialised appropriately. Here
we demonstrate that the next-to-diagonal correlations of the anisotropic Ising
model are evaluated as one of the elements of this isomonodromic system or
essentially as the Cauchy-Hilbert transform of one of the bi-orthogonal
polynomials.
