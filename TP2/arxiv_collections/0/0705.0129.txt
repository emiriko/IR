In a recent paper [B. A. Piot et al., Phys. Rev. B 72, 245325 (2005)], we
have shown that the lifting of the electron spin degeneracy in the integer
quantum Hall effect at high filling factors should be interpreted as a
magnetic-field-induced Stoner transition. In this work, we extend the analysis
to investigate the influence of the single-particle Zeeman energy on the
quantum Hall ferromagnet at high filling factors. The single-particle Zeeman
energy is tuned through the application of an additional in-plane magnetic
field. Both the evolution of the spin polarization of the system and the
critical magnetic field for spin splitting are well described as a function of
the tilt angle of the sample in the magnetic field.
