The heavy-fermion metal CePd_{1-x}Rh_x evolves from ferromagnetism at x=0 to
a non-magnetic state at some critical concentration x_c. Utilizing the
quasiparticle picture and the concept of fermion condensation quantum phase
transition (FCQPT), we address the question about non-Fermi liquid (NFL)
behavior of ferromagnet CePd_{1-x}Rh_x and show that it coincides with that of
both antiferromagnet YbRh_2(Si_{0.95}Ge_{0.05})_2 and paramagnet CeRu_2Si_2 and
CeNi_2Ge_2. We conclude that the NFL behavior being independent of the
peculiarities of specific alloy, is universal, while numerous quantum critical
points assumed to be responsible for the NFL behavior of different HF metals
can be well reduced to the only quantum critical point related to FCQPT.
