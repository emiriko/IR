Maser emission from the SiO molecule has been widely observed in the
near-circumstellar envelopes of late-type, evolved stars. VLBI images can
resolve individual SiO maser spots, providing information about the kinematics
and magnetic field in the extended atmospheres of these stars. This poster
presents full polarization images of several SiO maser lines towards the
supergiant star VY CMa. VY CMa is a particularly strong SiO maser source and
allows observations of a wide range of maser transitions. We discuss
implications of these observations for VY CMa morphology, polarization, and
pumping models.
