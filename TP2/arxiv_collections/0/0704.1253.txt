Suzaku observations of two hard X-ray (> 10 keV) selected nearby Seyfert 2
galaxies are presented. Both sources were clearly detected with the PIN Hard
X-ray Detector up to several tens of keV, allowing for a fairly good
characterization of the broad band X-ray continuum. Both sources are heavily
obscured, one of which (NGC 5728) being Compton thick, while at lower energies
the shape and intensity of the scattered/reflected continuum is very different.
Strong iron Kalpha lines are detected in both sources. There are also hints for
the presence of a broad relativistic iron line in NGC 4992.
