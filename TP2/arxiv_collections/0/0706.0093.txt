Context: Dwarf galaxies can arise from self-gravitating structures emerging
from tidal tails. What fraction of the known dwarf galaxies in the Local
Universe can have this origin is still a matter of debate. Aims: In our effort
to understand the origin and evolution of tidal dwarf galaxies and their
correspondence with local objects, the first step is to understand how these
galaxies (which are supposed to have a limited amount of dark matter) react to
the feedback of the ongoing star formation. Methods: We make use of 2-D
chemodynamical calculations in order to study the early evolution of isolated,
dark matter-free dwarf galaxies. We present models in which feedback parameters
are varied. We also compare the results with dark matter-dominated dwarf galaxy
models. Results: All the considered models show that the star formation
proceeds for more than 300 Myr, therefore dwarf galaxies without large dark
matter halos are not necessarily quickly destroyed. The chemical evolution of
these objects is consistent with the main chemical properties of the dSphs of
the Local Group. Models with large dark matter halos show results consistent
with models free of dark matter, indicating that the distribution of gas is
more important than the depth of the potential well in determining the global
behaviour of dSph-sized dwarf galaxies.
