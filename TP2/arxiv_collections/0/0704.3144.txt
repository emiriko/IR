In the general context of complex data processing, this paper reviews a
recent practical approach to the continuous wavelet formalism on the sphere.
This formalism notably yields a correspondence principle which relates wavelets
on the plane and on the sphere. Two fast algorithms are also presented for the
analysis of signals on the sphere with steerable wavelets.
