We will present an extension of the standard model of particle physics in its
almost-commutative formulation. This extension is guided by the minimal
approach to almost-commutative geometries employed in [13], although the model
presented here is not minimal itself.
  The corresponding almost-commutative geometry leads to a Yang-Mills-Higgs
model which consists of the standard model and two new fermions of opposite
electro-magnetic charge which may possess a new colour like gauge group. As a
new phenomenon, grand unification is no longer required by the spectral action.
