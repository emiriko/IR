The Variable Star One-shot Project (VSOP) aimed at providing to the
world-wide stellar community the necessary one-shot spectrum of unstudied
variable stars, too often classified as such by an analysis of photometric data
only. The VSOP has established an new kind of observational model, where all
steps from observations to spectral analysis, are automatized (or are underway
to be fully automatized). The project is centralized on a collaborative wiki
website. The VSOP operational model is very successful, data is continously
flowing and being analyszed, and VSOP is now a worldwide open collaboration of
people with very different and complementary skills and expertise. The idea of
a central wiki website has been extended by one of us to propose a new service
to the whole astronomical community, called Wikimbad. Wikimbad is an open wiki
website aimed at collecting, organizing and making publicly available all kind
of reduced and published astronomical data. Its strengths and a comparison with
the Virtual Observatory are discussed. See: http://vsop.sc.eso.org and
