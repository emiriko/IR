This is an incomplete survey of some non-Abelian discrete symmetries which
have been used recently in attempts to understand the flavor structure of
leptons and quarks. To support such symmetries, new scalar particles are
required. In some models, they are very massive, in which case there may not be
much of a trace of their existence at the TeV scale. In other models, they are
themselves at the TeV scale, in which case there is a reasonable chance for
them to be revealed at the LHC (Large Hadron Collider) at CERN.
