GRB 060614 is a remarkable GRB observed by Swift with puzzling properties,
which challenge current progenitor models. The lack of any bright SN down to
very strict limits and the vanishing spectral lags are typical of short GRBs,
strikingly at odds with the long (102s) duration of this event. Here we present
spectral and temporal analysis of the Swift observations. We show that the
burst presents standard optical, UV and X-ray afterglows. An achromatic break
is observed simultaneously in optical and X-rays, at a time consistent with the
break in the R-band light curve measured by the VLT. The achromatic behaviour
and the consistent post-break decay slopes make GRB 060614 one of the best
examples of a jet break for a Swift burst. The optical, UV and X-rays afterglow
light curves have also an earlier break at ~30 ks. In the optical, there is
strong spectral evolution around this break, suggesting the passage of a break
frequency through the optical/UV band. The very blue spectrum at early times
and the trend in the light curves (rising at low frequencies, and decaying at
higher energies) suggest this may be the injection frequency. The early X-ray
light curve is well interpreted as the X-ray counterpart of the burst extended
emission. Spectral analysis of BAT/XRT data in the 80s overlap time show that
the Ep of the burst has decreased to as low as 8keV at the beginning of the XRT
observation. The Ep continues to decrease through the XRT energy band and exits
it at about 500s after the trigger. The average Ep of the burst is likely < 24
keV but larger than 8 keV. The initial peak observed by BAT is however
distinctly harder than the rest with Ep ~300 keV as measured by Konus Wind.
Considering the time-averaged spectral properties, GRB 060614 is consistent
with the Eiso-Ep_rest, Egamma-Ep_rest, and Liso-Ep correlations.
