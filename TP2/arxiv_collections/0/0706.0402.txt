We derive four sum-rule expressions for spectra measured in electron
energy-loss near edge structure experiments. These sum-rules permit the
determination spin and orbital magnetic moments, spin-orbit interaction and
number of states, analogously to the sum rules of x-ray magnetic circular
dichroism. The derivation of the sum-rules is based on dynamical electron
diffraction theory and the properties of the mixed dynamic form-factor. The
accuracy of the sum-rules is tested by a complete evaluation of the thickness
dependent electron energy-loss spectra for iron, cobalt, and nickel crystals.
We find that the sum-rules reproduce both spin and orbital moments with very
good accuracy. Our results provide a foundation for the use of the energy loss
magnetic chiral dichroism technique as a quantitative probe of element specific
magnetic properties.
