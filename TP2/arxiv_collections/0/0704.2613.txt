The conditions for N=1 supersymmetry in type II supergravity have been
previously reformulated in terms of generalized complex geometry. We improve
that reformulation so as to completely eliminate the remaining explicit
dependence on the metric. Doing so involves a natural generalization of the
Dolbeault operator. As an application, we present some general arguments about
supersymmetric moduli. In particular, a subset of them are then classified by a
certain cohomology. We also argue that the Dolbeault reformulation should make
it easier to find existence theorems for the N=1 equations.
