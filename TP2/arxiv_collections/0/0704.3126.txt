We study theoretically the Josephson effect in d-wave superconductor /
diffusive normal metal /insulator/ diffusive normal metal/ d-wave
superconductor (D/DN/I/DN/D) junctions. This model is aimed to describe
practical junctions in high-$T_C$ cuprate superconductors, in which the product
of the critical Josephson current ($I_C$) and the normal state resistance ($R$)
(the so-called $I_{\rm C}R$ product) is very small compared to the prediction
of the standard theory. We show that the $I_{\rm C}R$ product in D/DN/I/DN/D
junctions can be much smaller than that in d-wave superconductor / insulator /
d-wave superconductor junctions and formulate the conditions necessary to
achieve large $I_{\rm C}R$ product in D/DN/I/DN/D junctions. The proposed
theory describes the behavior of $I_{\rm C}R$ products quantitatively in
high-$T_{\rm C}$ cuprate junctions.
