Nucleon-ion and ion-ion collisions at non relativistic bombarding energies
can be described by means of Monte Carlo approaches, such as those based on the
Quantum Molecular Dynamics (QMD) model. We have developed a QMD code, to
simulate the fast stage of heavy-ion reactions, and we have coupled it to the
de-excitation module available in the FLUKA Monte Carlo transport and
interaction code. The results presented in this work span the projectile
bombarding energy range within 200 - 600 MeV/A, allowing to investigate the
capabilities and limits of our non-relativistic QMD approach.
