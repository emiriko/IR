A class of exact static solution around a global monopole resulting from the
breaking of a global S0(3) symmetry is obtained in the context of Lyra
geometry. Our solution is shown to possess an interesting feature like
wormholes space-time. It has been shown that the global monopole exerts no
gravitational force on surrounding non-relativistic matter.
