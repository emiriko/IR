In recent years, the availability of highly pure stable isotopes has made
possible the investigation of the dependence of the physical properties of
crystals, in particular semiconductors, on their isotopic composition.
Following the investigation of the specific heat ($C_p$, $C_v$) of monatomic
crystals such as diamond, silicon, and germanium, similar investigations have
been undertaken for the tetrahedral diatomic systems ZnO and GaN (wurtzite
structure), for which the effect of the mass of the cation differs from that of
the anion. In this article we present measurements for a semiconductor with
rock salt structure, namely lead sulfide. Because of the large difference in
the atomic mass of both constituents ($M_{\rm Pb}$= 207.21 and ($M_{\rm
S}$=32.06 a.m.u., for the natural isotopic abundance) the effects of varying
the cation and that of the anion mass are very different for this canonical
semiconductor. We compare the measured temperature dependence of $C_p \approx
C_v$, and the corresponding derivatives with respect to ($M_{\rm Pb}$ and
$M_{\rm S}$), with \textit{\textit{ab initio}} calculations based on the
lattice dynamics obtained from the local density approximation (LDA) electronic
band structure. Quantitative deviations between theory and experiment are
attributed to the absence of spin-orbit interaction in the ABINIT program used
for the electronic band structure calculations.
