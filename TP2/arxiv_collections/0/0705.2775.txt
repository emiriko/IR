We present a new class of exact nonsingular solutions for the Maxwell
equations in vacuum, which describe the electromagnetic field of the
counterpropagating focused laser beams and the subperiod focused laser pulse.
These solutions are derived by the use of a modification of the "complex source
method", investigated and visualized.
