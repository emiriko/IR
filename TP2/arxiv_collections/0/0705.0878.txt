We present the 2nd version of the Catalogue of Radial Velocities with
Astrometric Data (CRVAD-2). This is the result of the cross-identification of
stars from the All-Sky Compiled Catalogue of 2.5 Million Stars (ASCC-2.5) with
the General Catalogue of Radial Velocities and with other recently published
radial velocity lists and catalogues. The CRVAD-2 includes accurate J2000
equatorial coordinates, proper motions and trigonometric parallaxes in the
Hipparcos system, $B, V$ photometry in the Johnson system, spectral types,
radial velocities (RVs), multiplicity and variability flags for 54907 ASCC-2.5
stars. We have used the CRVAD-2 for a new determination of mean RVs of 363 open
clusters and stellar associations considering their established members from
proper motions and photometry in the ASCC-2.5. For 330 clusters and
associations we compiled previously published mean RVs from the literature,
critically reviewed and partly revised them. The resulting Catalogue of Radial
Velocities of Open Clusters and Associations (CRVOCA) contains about 460 open
clusters and about 60 stellar associations in the Solar neighbourhood. These
numbers still represent less than 30% of the total number of about 1820 objects
currently known in the Galaxy. The mean RVs of young clusters are generally
better known than those of older ones.
