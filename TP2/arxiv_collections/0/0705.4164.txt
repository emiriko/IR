A mechanism for the formation of a new type of stationary state with
macroscopical number of phonons in condensed atomic gases is proposed. This
mechanism is based on generating longitudinal phonons as a result of parametric
resonance caused by a permanent modulation of the transverse trap frequency in
an elongated trap. The phonon-phonon interaction predetermines the
self-consistent evolution which is completed with macroscopic population of one
from all levels within the energy interval of parametric amplification. This
level proves to be shifted to the edge of this interval. All other levels end
the evolution with zero population.
