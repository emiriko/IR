Bragg spectroscopy is used to measure excitations of a trapped,
quantum-degenerate gas of 87Rb atoms in a 3-dimensional optical lattice. The
measurements are carried out over a range of optical lattice depths in the
superfluid phase of the Bose-Hubbard model. For fixed wavevector, the resonant
frequency of the excitation is found to decrease with increasing lattice depth.
A numerical calculation of the resonant frequencies based on Bogoliubov theory
shows a less steep rate of decrease than the measurements.
