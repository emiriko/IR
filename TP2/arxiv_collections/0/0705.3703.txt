We measure the time dependence of the scintillator light-emission pulses in
NaI(Tl) crystals at different temperatures, after activation by gamma rays. We
confirm that there are two main nonexponential components to the time decay and
find that their amplitude ratio shows Arrhenius temperature dependence. We
explain these nonexponential components as arising from two competing
mechanisms of carrier transport to the Tl activation levels. The total light
output of the NaI(Tl) detectors shows a linear temperature dependence explained
by our model.
