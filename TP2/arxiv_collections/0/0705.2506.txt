We study the induced odd-frequency pairing states in ballistic normal
metal/superconductor (N/S) junctions where a superconductor has even-frequency
symmetry in the bulk and a normal metal layer has an arbitrary length. Using
the quasiclassical Green's function formalism, we demonstrate that, quite
generally, the pair amplitude in the junction has an admixture of an
odd-frequency component due to the breakdown of translational invariance near
the N/S interface where the pair potential acquires spatial dependence. If a
superconductor has even-parity pair potential (spin-singlet s-wave state), the
odd-frequency pairing component with odd-parity is induced near the N/S
interface, while in the case of odd-parity pair potential (spin-triplet
$p_{x}$-wave or spin-singlet $d_{xy}$-wave) the odd-frequency component with
even-parity is generated. We show that in conventional s-wave junctions, the
amplitude of the odd-frequency pairing state is enhanced at energies
corresponding to the peaks in the local density of states (LDOS). In $p_x$- and
$d_{xy}$-wave junctions, the amplitude of the odd-frequency component on the S
side of the N/S interface is enhanced at zero energy where the midgap Andreev
resonant state (MARS) appears due to the sign change of the pair potential. The
odd-frequency component extends into the N region and exceeds the
even-frequency component at energies corresponding to the LDOS peak positions,
including the MARS.
