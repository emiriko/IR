We calculate the s-wave part of the pion-nucleus optical potential using a
unitarized chiral approach that has been previously used to simultaneously
describe pionic hydrogen and deuterium data as well as low energy pi N
scattering in the vacuum. This energy dependent model allows for additional
isoscalar parts in the potential from multiple rescattering. We consider Pauli
blocking and pion polarization in an asymmetric nuclear matter environment.
Also, higher order corrections of the pi N amplitude are included. The model
can accommodate the repulsion required by phenomenological fits, though the
theoretical uncertainties are bigger than previously thought. At the same time,
we also find an enhancement of the isovector part compatible with empirical
determinations.
