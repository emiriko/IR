Axions are expected to be produced in the sun via the Primakoff process. They
may be detected through the inverse process in the laboratory, under the
influence of a strong magnetic field, giving rise to X-rays of energies in the
range of a few keV. Such an Axion detector is the CERN Axion Solar Telescope
(CAST), collecting data since 2003. Results have been published, pushing the
axion-photon coupling g$_{a\gamma}$ below the 10$^{-10}$ GeV$^{-1}$ limit at
95% CL, for axion masses less than 0.02 eV. This limit is nearly an order of
magnitude lower than previous experimental limits and surpassed for the first
time limits set from astrophysical arguments based on the energy-loss concept.
The experiment is currently exploring axion masses in the range of 0.02 eV $<
m_a <$ 1.1 eV. In the next run, currently under preparation, the axion mass
explored will be extended up to the limit of 1.1 eV, testing for the first time
the region of theoretical axion models with the axion helioscope method.
