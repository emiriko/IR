From an experimental point of view, room temperature ferroelectricity in
BiFeO3 is raising many questions. Electric measurements made a long time ago on
solid-solutions of BiFeO3 with Pb(Ti,Zr)O3 indicate that a spontaneous electric
polarization exists in BiFeO3 below the Curie temperature TC=1143K. Yet in most
reported works, the synthesised samples are too conductive at room temperature
to get a clear polarization loop in the bulk without any effects of extrinsic
physical or chemical parameters. Surprisingly, up to now there has been no
report of a P(E) (polarization versus electric field) loop at room temperature
on single crystals of BiFeO3. We describe here our procedure to synthesize
ceramics and to grow good quality sizeable single crystals by a flux method. We
demonstrate that BiFeO3 is indeed ferroelectric at room-temperature through
evidence by Piezoresponse Force Microscopy and P(E) loops. The polarization is
found to be large, around 60 microC/cm2, a value that has only been reached in
thin films. Magnetic measurements using a SQUID magnetometer and Mossbauer
spectroscopy are also presented. The latter confirms the results of NMR
measurements concerning the anisotropy of the hyperfine field attributed to the
magnetic cycloidal structure.
