We have used the Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) on the Spitzer Space Telescope
to obtain spectra of HD 100764, an apparently single carbon star with a
circumstellar disk. The spectrum shows emission features from polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) that are shifted to longer wavelengths than
normally seen, as characteristic of ``class C'' systems in the classification
scheme of Peeters et al. All seven of the known class C PAH sources are
illuminated by radiation fields that are cooler than those which typically
excite PAH emission features. The observed wavelength shifts are consistent
with hydrocarbon mixtures containing both aromatic and aliphatic bonds. We
propose that the class C PAH spectra are distinctive because the carbonaceous
material has not been subjected to a strong ultraviolet radiation field,
allowing relatively fragile aliphatic materials to survive.
