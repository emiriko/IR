We compare several optical implementations of phase-covariant cloning
machines. The experiments are based on copying of the polarization state of a
single photon in bulk optics by special unbalanced beam splitter or by balanced
beam splitter accompanied by a state filtering. Also the all-fiber based setup
is discussed, where the information is encoded into spatial modes, i.e., the
photon can propagate through two optical fibers. Each of the four
implementations possesses some advantages and disadvantages that are discussed.
