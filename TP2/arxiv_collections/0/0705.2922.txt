The accuracy and precision of current atom-interferometric inertialsensors
rival state-of-the-art conventional devices using artifact-based test masses .
Atomic sensors are well suited for fundamental measurements of gravito-inertial
fields. The sensitivity required to test gravitational theories can be achieved
by extending the baseline of the interferometer. The I.C.E.
(Interf\'erom\'etrie Coh\'erente pour l'Espace) interferometer aims to achieve
long interrogation times in compact apparatus via reduced gravity. We have
tested a cold-atom source during airplane parabolic flights. We show that this
environment is compatible with free-fall interferometric measurements using up
to 4 second interrogation time. We present the next-generation apparatus using
degenerate gases for low release-velocity atomic sources in space-borne
experiments.
