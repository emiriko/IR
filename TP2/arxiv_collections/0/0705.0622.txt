The zero temperature transport properties of two-dimensional lattice systems
with static random magnetic flux per plaquette and zero mean are investigated
numerically. We study the two-terminal conductance and its dependence on
energy, sample size, and magnetic flux strength. The influence of boundary
conditions and of the oddness of the number of sites in the transverse
direction is also studied. We confirm the existence of a critical chiral state
in the middle of the energy band and calculate the critical exponent nu=0.35
+/- 0.03 for the divergence of the localization length. The sample averaged
scale independent critical conductance <g>_c turns out to be a function of the
amplitude of the flux fluctuations whereas the variance of the respective
conductance distributions appears to be universal. All electronic states
outside of the band center are found to be localized.
