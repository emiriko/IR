We detected X-ray emission from the 50-kyr-old pulsar J1809-1917 and resolved
its pulsar wind nebula (PWN) with Chandra. The pulsar spectrum fits PL+BB model
with the photon index of 1.2 and the BB temperature of 2 MK for n_{H}=0.7\times
10^{22} cm^{-2}. The luminosities are(4\pm 1)\times 10^{31} ergs s^{-1} for the
PL component (in the 0.5-8 keV band) and ~1\times 10^{32} ergs s^{-1} for the
BB component (bolometric) at a plausible distance of 3.5 kpc. The bright inner
PWN component of a 3''\times12'' size is elongated in the north-south
direction, with the pulsar close to its south end. This component is immersed
in a larger (20''\times40''), similarly elongated outer PWN component of lower
surface brightness. The elongated shape of the compact PWN can be explained by
the ram pressure confinement of the pulsar wind due to the supersonic motion of
the pulsar. The PWN spectrum fits a PL model with photon index of 1.4\pm0.1 and
0.5-8 keV luminosity of 4\times10^{32} ergs s^{-1}. The compact PWN appears to
be inside a large-scale (~4'\times4') emission more extended to the south of
the pulsar, i.e. in the direction of the alleged pulsar motion. To explain the
extended X-ray emission ahead of the moving pulsar, one has to invoke strong
intrinsic anisotropy of the pulsar wind or assume that this emission comes from
a relic PWN swept by the asymmetrical reverse SNR shock. The pulsar and its PWN
are located within the extent of the unidentified TeV source HESS J1809-193
whose brightest part is offset by ~8' to the south of the pulsar, i.e. in the
same direction as the large-scale X-ray emission. Although the association
between J1809-1917 and HESS J1809-193 is plausible, an alternative source of
relativistic electrons powering HESS J1809-193 might be the serendipitously
discovered X-ray source CXOU J180940.7-192544.
