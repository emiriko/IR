The spectral function of the closed-shell Neon atom is computed by expanding
the electron self-energy through a set of Faddeev equations. This method
describes the coupling of single-particle degrees of freedom with correlated
two-electron, two-hole, and electron-hole pairs. The excitation spectra are
obtained using the Random Phase Approximation, rather than the Tamm-Dancoff
framework employed in the third-order algebraic diagrammatic contruction
[ADC(3)] method. The difference between these two approaches is studied, as
well as the interplay between ladder and ring diagrams in the self-energy.
Satisfactory results are obtained for the ionization energies as well as the
energy of the ground state with the Faddeev-RPA scheme that is also appropriate
for the high-density electron gas.
