We investigate the phenomenology of the Randall-Sundrum radion in realistic
models of electroweak symmetry breaking with bulk gauge and fermion fields,
since the radion may turn out to be the lightest particle in such models. We
calculate the coupling of the radion in such scenarios to bulk fermion and
gauge modes. Special attention needs to be devoted to the coupling to massless
gauge fields (photon, gluon), since it is well known that loop effects may be
important for these fields. We also present a detailed explanation of these
couplings from the CFT interpretation. We then use these couplings to determine
the radion branching fractions and discuss some of the discovery potential of
the LHC for the radion. We find that the gamma-gamma signal is enhanced over
most of the range of the radion mass over the gamma-gamma signal of a SM Higgs,
as long as the RS scale is sufficiently low. However, the signal significance
depends strongly on free parameters that characterize the magnitude of bare
brane-localized kinetic terms for the massless gauge fields. In the absence of
such terms, the signal can be be enhanced over the traditional RS1 models
(where all standard model fields are localized on the IR brane), but the signal
can also be reduced compared to RS1 if the brane localized terms are sizeable.
We also show that for larger radion masses, where the gamma-gamma signal is no
longer significant, one can use the usual 4 lepton signal to discover the
radion.
