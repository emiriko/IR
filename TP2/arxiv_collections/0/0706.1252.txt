It is shown using a method based on a modified version of the mean field
theory of Miklavic Marcelja that it should be possible for osmotic pressure due
to the counterions associated with the two polyelectrolyte polymer brush coated
surfaces to support a reasonable load (i.e., about $10^6 Pa$) with the brushes
held sufficiently far apart to prevent entanglement of polymers belonging to
the two brushes, thus avoiding what is believed to be the dominant mechanisms
for static and dry friction.
