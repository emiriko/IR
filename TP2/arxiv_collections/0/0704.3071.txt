In most vertebrate species, the body axis is generated by the formation of
repeated transient structures called somites. This spatial periodicity in
somitogenesis has been related to the temporally sustained oscillations in
certain mRNAs and their associated gene products in the cells forming the
presomatic mesoderm. The mechanism underlying these oscillations have been
identified as due to the delays involved in the synthesis of mRNA and
translation into protein molecules [J. Lewis, Current Biol. {\bf 13}, 1398
(2003)]. In addition, in the zebrafish embryo intercellular Notch signalling
couples these oscillators and a longitudinal positional information signal in
the form of an Fgf8 gradient exists that could be used to transform these
coupled temporal oscillations into the observed spatial periodicity of somites.
Here we consider a simple model based on this known biology and study its
consequences for somitogenesis. Comparison is made with the known properties of
somite formation in the zebrafish embryo . We also study the effects of
localized Fgf8 perturbations on somite patterning.
