We propose a scheme which implements a controllable change of the state of
the target spin qubit in such a way that both the control and the target spin
qubits remain in their ground states. The interaction between the two spins is
mediated by an auxiliary spin, which can transfer to its excited state. Our
scheme suggests a possible relationship between the gate and adiabatic quantum
computation.
