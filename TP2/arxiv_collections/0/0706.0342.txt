Transport of quantum information in linear spin chains has been the subject
of much theoretical work. Experimental studies by nuclear spin systems in
solid-state by NMR (a natural implementation of such models) is complicated
since the dipolar Hamiltonian is not solely comprised of nearest-neighbor
XY-Heisenberg couplings. We present here a similarity transformation between
the XY-Heisenberg Hamiltonian and the grade raising Hamiltonian, an interaction
which is achievable with the collective control provided by radio-frequency
pulses in NMR. Not only does this second Hamiltonian allows us to simulate the
information transport in a spin chain, but it also provides a means to observe
its signature experimentally.
