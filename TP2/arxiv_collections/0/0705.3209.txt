Up till now very few dying sources were known, presumably because the dying
phase is short at centimeter wavelengths. We therefore have tried to improve
the statistics on sources that have ceased to be active, or are intermittently
active. The latter sources would partly consist of a fossil radio plasma left
over from an earlier phase of activity, plus a recently restarted core and
radio jets. Improving the statistics of dying sources will give us a better
handle on the evolution of radio sources, in particular the frequency and time
scales of radio activity. We have used the WENSS and NVSS surveys, in order to
find sources with steep spectral indices, associated with nearby elliptical
galaxies. In the cross correlation we presently used only unresolved sources,
with flux densities at 1.4 GHz larger than 10 mJy. The eleven candidates thus
obtained were observed with the VLA in various configurations, in order to
confirm the steepness of the spectra, and to check whether active structures
like flat-spectrum cores and jets are present, perhaps at low levels. We
estimated the duration of the active and relic phases by modelling the
integrated radio spectra using the standard models of spectral evolution. We
have found six dying sources and three restarted sources, while the remaining
two candidates remain unresolved also with the new VLA data and may be Compact
Steep Spectrum sources, with an unusually steep spectrum. The typical age of
the active phase, as derived by spectral fits, is in the range 10^7 - 10^8
years. For our sample of dying sources, the age of the relic phase is on
average shorter by an order of magnitude than the active phase.
