We introduce a new method for estimating the growth of various quantities
arising in dynamical systems. We apply our method to polygonal billiards on
surfaces of constant curvature. For instance, we obtain power bounds of degree
two plus epsilon in length for the number of billiard orbits between almost all
pairs of points in a planar polygon.
