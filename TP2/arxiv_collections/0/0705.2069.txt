We determine the radio-frequency (RF) spectra for non-stationary states of a
fermionic condensate produced by a rapid switch of the scattering length. The
RF spectrum of the nonequilibrium state with constant BCS order parameter has
two features in contrast to equilibrium where there is a single peak. The
additional feature reflects the presence of excited pairs in the steady state.
In the state characterized by periodically oscillating order parameter
RF-absorption spectrum contains two sequences of peaks spaced by the frequency
of oscillations. Satellite peaks appear due to a process where an RF photon in
addition to breaking a pair emits/absorbs oscillation quanta.
