We find sharp bounds for the norm inequality on a Pseudo-hermitian manifold,
where the L^2 norm of all second derivatives of the function involving
horizontal derivatives is controlled by the L^2 norm of the sub-Laplacian.
Perturbation allows us to get a-priori bounds for solutions to sub-elliptic PDE
in non-divergence form with bounded measurable coefficients. The method of
proof is through a Bochner technique. The Heisenberg group is seen to be en
extremal manifold for our inequality in the class of manifolds whose Ricci
curvature is non-negative.
