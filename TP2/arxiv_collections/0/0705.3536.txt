We consider Yang-Mills theory with the U(1) gauge group on a non-commutative
plane. Perturbatively it was observed that the invariance of this theory under
area-preserving diffeomorphisms (APDs) breaks down to a rigid subgroup SL(2,R).
Here we present explicit results for the APD symmetry breaking at finite gauge
coupling and finite non-commutativity. They are based on lattice simulations
and measurements of Wilson loops with the same area but with a variety of
different shapes. Our results are consistent with the expected loss of
invariance under APDs. Moreover, they strongly suggest that non-perturbatively
the SL(2,R) symmetry does not persist either.
