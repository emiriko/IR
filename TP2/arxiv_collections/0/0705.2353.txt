We review various inequalities on the order and the spacing of energy levels,
wave function at the origin, etc... which were obtained since 1977 in the
framework of the Schrodinger equation and applied to quarkonium and also to
muonic atoms and alcaline atoms. We also present a fit of mesons and baryons
made of b, c, s quarks and antiquarks, keeping the 1981 parameters and
comparing with present experimental data.
