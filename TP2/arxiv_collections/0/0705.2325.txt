We propose a Curvature Principle to describe the dynamics of interacting
universes in a multi-universe scenario and show, in the context of a simplified
model, how interaction drives the cosmological constant of one of the universes
toward a vanishingly small value. We also conjecture on how the proposed
Curvature Principle suggests a solution for the entropy paradox of a universe
where the cosmological constant vanishes.
