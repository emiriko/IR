In order to improve the phasing of the comparable-mass waveform as we
approach the last stable orbit for a system, various re-summation methods have
been used to improve the standard post-Newtonian waveforms. In this work we
present a new family of templates for the detection of gravitational waves from
the inspiral of two comparable-mass black hole binaries. These new adiabatic
templates are based on re-expressing the derivative of the binding energy and
the gravitational wave flux functions in terms of shifted Chebyshev
polynomials. The Chebyshev polynomials are a useful tool in numerical methods
as they display the fastest convergence of any of the orthogonal polynomials.
In this case they are also particularly useful as they eliminate one of the
features that plagues the post-Newtonian expansion. The Chebyshev binding
energy now has information at all post-Newtonian orders, compared to the
post-Newtonian templates which only have information at full integer orders. In
this work, we compare both the post-Newtonian and Chebyshev templates against a
fiducially exact waveform. This waveform is constructed from a hybrid method of
using the test-mass results combined with the mass dependent parts of the
post-Newtonian expansions for the binding energy and flux functions. Our
results show that the Chebyshev templates achieve extremely high fitting
factors at all PN orders and provide excellent parameter extraction. We also
show that this new template family has a faster Cauchy convergence, gives a
better prediction of the position of the Last Stable Orbit and in general
recovers higher Signal-to-Noise ratios than the post-Newtonian templates.
