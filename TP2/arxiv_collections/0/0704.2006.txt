We consider two quantum coherent conductors interacting weakly via long range
Coulomb forces. We describe the interaction in terms of two-particle collisions
described by a two-particle scattering matrix. As an example we determine the
transmission probability and correlations in a two-particle scattering
experiment and find that the results can be expressed in terms of the
density-of-states matrices of the non-interacting scatterers.
