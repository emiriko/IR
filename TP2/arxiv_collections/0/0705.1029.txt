It has long been known that once you cross the event horizon of a black hole,
your destiny lies at the central singularity, irrespective of what you do.
Furthermore, your demise will occur in a finite amount of proper time. In this
paper, the use of rockets in extending the amount of time before the collision
with the central singularity is examined. In general, the use of such rockets
can increase your remaining time, but only up to a maximum value; this is at
odds with the ``more you struggle, the less time you have'' statement that is
sometimes discussed in relation to black holes. The derived equations are
simple to solve numerically and the framework can be employed as a teaching
tool for general relativity.
