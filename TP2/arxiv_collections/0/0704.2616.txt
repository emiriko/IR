The dual observation of the Omega production in central Au+Au collisions
having both an exponential p_T distribution and also associated particles above
the background has been referred to as the Omega puzzle. We give a quantitative
description of how that puzzle can be understood in terms of phantom jets,
where only ridges without peaks are produced to give rise to both the Omega
trigger and its associated particles. In the framework of recombination of
thermal partons we are able to reproduce both the \Delta\phi distribution and
the trigger-momentum dependence of the yield of the associated particles. We
make predictions on other observables that can be checked by further analyses
of the data.
