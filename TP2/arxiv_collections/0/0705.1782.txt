The perturbative QCD approach has achieved great success in the study of
hadronic B decays. Utilizing the constrained parameters in these well measured
decay channels, we study most of the possible charmless $B_s \to PP$, $PV$ and
$VV$ decay channels in the perturbative QCD approach. In addition to the
branching ratios and CP asymmetries, we also give predictions to the
polarization fractions of the vector meson final states. The size of SU(3)
breaking effect is also discussed. All of these predictions can be tested by
the future LHCb experiment.
