Three-dimensional (3D) chromatin structure is closely related to genome
function, in particular transcription. However, the folding path of the
chromatin fiber in the interphase nucleus is unknown. Here, we systematically
measured the 3D physical distance between pairwise labeled genomic positions in
gene-dense, highly transcribed domains and gene-poor less active areas on
chromosomes 1 and 11 in G1 nuclei of human primary fibroblasts, using
fluorescence in situ hybridization. Interpretation of our results and those
published by others, based on polymer physics, shows that the folding of the
chromatin fiber can be described as a polymer in a globular state (GS),
maintained by intra-polymer attractive interactions that counteract
self-avoidance forces. The GS polymer model is able to describe chromatin
folding in as well the highly expressed domains as the lowly expressed ones,
indicating that they differ in Kuhn length and chromatin compaction. Each type
of genomic domain constitutes an ensemble of relatively compact globular
folding states, resulting in a considerable cellto- cell variation between
otherwise identical cells. We present evidence for different polymer folding
regimes of the chromatin fiber on the length scale of a few mega base pairs and
on that of complete chromosome arms (several tens of Mb). Our results present a
novel view on the folding of the chromatin fiber in interphase and open the
possibility to explore the nature of the intra-chromatin fiber interactions.
