The RICE experiment seeks to measure ultra-high energy neutrinos (E(nu)>10
PeV) by detection of the radio wavelength Cherenkov radiation produced by
neutrino-ice collisions within Antarctic ice. An array of 16 dipole antennas,
buried at depths of 100-400 m, and sensitive over the 100-500 MHz frequency
range, has been continuously taking data for the last seven years. We herein
describe the design and performance of the RICE experiment's event trigger and
data acquisition system, highlighting elements not covered as extensively in
previous publications.
