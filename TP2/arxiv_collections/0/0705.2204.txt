We present cosmological perturbation theory in neutrino probe interacting
dark-energy models, and calculate cosmic microwave background anisotropies and
matter power spectrum. In these models, the evolution of the mass of neutrinos
is determined by the quintessence scalar field, which is responsible for the
cosmic acceleration today. We consider several types of scalar field potentials
and put constraints on the coupling parameter between neutrinos and dark
energy. Assuming the flatness of the universe, the constraint we can derive
from the current observation is $\sum m_{\nu} < 0.87 eV$ at the 95 % confidence
level for the sum over three species of neutrinos.
