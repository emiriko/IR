Recently H. Georgi has introduced an unparticle $\unpart$ in order to
describe the low energy physics of a nontrivial scale invariant sector of an
effective theory. In this work we have explored the phenomenology of an
unparticle using the lepton flavour violating decay $\mu^{-}\to e^{-} e^{+}
e^{-}$, and found that the branching ratio of this decay is strongly dependent
on the scaling dimension.
