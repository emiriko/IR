Motivated by recent experimental and numerical studies of coherent structures
in wall-bounded shear flows, we initiate a systematic exploration of the
hierarchy of unstable invariant solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations. We
construct a dynamical, 10^5-dimensional state-space representation of plane
Couette flow at Re = 400 in a small, periodic cell and offer a new method of
visualizing invariant manifolds embedded in such high dimensions. We compute a
new equilibrium solution of plane Couette flow and the leading eigenvalues and
eigenfunctions of known equilibria at this Reynolds number and cell size. What
emerges from global continuations of their unstable manifolds is a surprisingly
elegant dynamical-systems visualization of moderate-Reynolds turbulence. The
invariant manifolds tessellate the region of state space explored by
transiently turbulent dynamics with a rigid web of continuous and discrete
symmetry-induced heteroclinic connections.
