The h^*-polynomial of a lattice polytope is the numerator of the generating
function of the Ehrhart polynomial. Let P be a lattice polytope with
h^*-polynomial of degree d and with linear coefficient h^*_1. We show that P
has to be a lattice pyramid over a lower-dimensional lattice polytope, if the
dimension of P is greater or equal to h^*_1 (2d+1) + 4d-1. This result has a
purely combinatorial proof and generalizes a recent theorem of Batyrev.
