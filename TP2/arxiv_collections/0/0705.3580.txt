Fourier transform of the generalized parton distributions (GPDs) at zero
skewness with respect to the transverse momentum transfer gives the
distribution of partons in the impact parameter space. We investigate the GPDs
as well as the impact parameter dependent parton distributions (ipdpdfs) by
expressing them in terms of overlaps of light front wave functions (LFWFs) and
present a comparative study using three different model LFWFs.
