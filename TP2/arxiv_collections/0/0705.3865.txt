We present the analysis of the temperature and metallicity profiles of 12
galaxy clusters in the redshift range 0.1--0.3 selected from the Chandra
archive with at least ~20,000 net ACIS counts and kT>6 keV. We divide the
sample between 7 Cooling-Core (CC) and 5 Non-Cooling-Core (NCC) clusters
according to their central cooling time. We find that single power-laws can
describe properly both the temperature and metallicity profiles at radii larger
than 0.1 r_180 in both CC and NCC systems, showing the NCC objects steeper
profiles outwards. A significant deviation is only present in the inner 0.1
r_180. We perform a comparison of our sample with the De Grandi & Molendi
BeppoSAX sample of local CC and NCC clusters, finding a complete agreement in
the CC cluster profile and a marginally higher value (at ~1sigma) in the inner
regions of the NCC clusters. The slope of the power-law describing kT(r) within
0.1 r_180 correlates strongly with the ratio between the cooling time and the
age of the Universe at the cluster redshift, being the slope >0 and
tau_c/tau_age<=0.6 in CC systems.
