The structures of globular clusters (GCs) reflect their dynamical states and
past histories. High-resolution imaging allows the exploration of morphologies
of clusters in other galaxies. Surface brightness profiles from new Hubble
Space Telescope observations of 34 globular clusters in M31 are presented,
together with fits of several different structural models to each cluster. M31
clusters appear to be adequately fit by standard King models, and do not
obviously require alternate descriptions with relatively stronger halos, such
as are needed to fit many GCs in other nearby galaxies. The derived structural
parameters are combined with corrected versions of those measured in an earlier
survey to construct a comprehensive catalog of structural and dynamical
parameters for M31 GCs with a sample size similar to that for the Milky Way.
Clusters in M31, the Milky Way, Magellanic Clouds, Fornax dwarf spheroidal and
NGC 5128 define a very tight fundamental plane with identical slopes. The
combined evidence for these widely different galaxies strongly reinforces the
view that old globular clusters have near-universal structural properties
regardless of host environment.
