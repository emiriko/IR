In this paper we find new examples of Riemannian manifolds with outermost
apparent horizons with nonspherical topology, in dimensions four and above.
More precisely, for any $n,m\ge1$, we construct asymptotically flat, scalar
flat Riemannian manifolds containing smooth outermost minimal hypersurfaces
with topology $S^n\times S^{m+1}$. In the context of general relativity these
hypersurfaces correspond to outermost apparent horizons of black holes.
