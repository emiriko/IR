We study the radiative lepton flavor violating l_i -> l_j\gamma decays in the
two Higgs doublet model, respecting the Randall Sundrum scenario and estimate
the contributions of the KK modes of left (right) handed charged lepton
doublets (singlets) on the branching ratios. We observe that the branching
ratios are sensitive to the contributions of the charged lepton KK modes.
