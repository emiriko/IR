The magnetic focusing of electrons has proven its utility in fundamental
studies of electron transport. Here we report the direct imaging of magnetic
focusing of electron waves, specifically in a two-dimensional electron gas
(2DEG). We see the semicircular trajectories of electrons as they bounce along
a boundary in the 2DEG, as well as fringes showing the coherent nature of the
electron waves. Imaging flow in open systems is made possible by a cooled
scanning probe microscope. Remarkable agreement between experiment and theory
demonstrates our ability to see these trajectories and to use this system as an
interferometer. We image branched electron flow as well as the interference of
electron waves. This technique can visualize the motion of electron waves
between two points in an open system, providing a straightforward way to study
systems that may be useful for quantum information processing and spintronics.
