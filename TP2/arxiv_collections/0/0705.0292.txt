We investigate the relation between the scaling of block entropies and the
efficient simulability by Matrix Product States (MPS), and clarify the
connection both for von Neumann and Renyi entropies (see Table I). Most
notably, even states obeying a strict area law for the von Neumann entropy are
not necessarily approximable by MPS. We apply these results to illustrate that
quantum computers might outperform classical computers in simulating the time
evolution of quantum systems, even for completely translational invariant
systems subject to a time independent Hamiltonian.
