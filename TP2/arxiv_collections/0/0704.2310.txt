Superfluidity and superconductivity are genuine many-body manifestations of
quantum coherence. For finite-size systems the associated pairing gap
fluctuates as a function of size or shape. We provide a parameter free
theoretical description of pairing fluctuations in mesoscopic systems
characterized by order/chaos dynamics. The theory accurately describes
experimental observations of nuclear superfluidity (regular system), predicts
universal fluctuations of superconductivity in small chaotic metallic grains,
and provides a global analysis in ultracold Fermi gases.
