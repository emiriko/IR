We investigate a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) based on
carbon nanotubes in a fork geometry [J.-P. Cleuziou {\it et al.}, Nature
Nanotechnology {\bf 1}, 53 (2006)], involving tunneling of evanescent
quasiparticles through a superconductor over a distance comparable to the
superconducting coherence length, with therefore ``non local'' processes
generalizing non local Andreev reflection and elastic cotunneling. Non local
processes induce a reduction of the critical current and modify the
current-phase relation. We discuss arbitrary interface transparencies. Such
devices in fork geometries are candidates for probing the phase coherence of
crossed Andreev reflection.
