Capacitance-voltage (C-V) characteristics are important for understanding
fundamental electronic structures and device applications of nanomaterials. The
C-V characteristics of graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) are examined using
self-consistent atomistic simulations. The results indicate strong dependence
of the GNR C-V characteristics on the edge shape. For zigzag edge GNRs, highly
non-uniform charge distribution in the transverse direction due to edge states
lowers the gate capacitance considerably, and the self-consistent electrostatic
potential significantly alters the band structure and carrier velocity. For an
armchair edge GNR, the quantum capacitance is a factor of 2 smaller than its
corresponding zigzag carbon nanotube, and a multiple gate geometry is less
beneficial for transistor applications. Magnetic field results in pronounced
oscillations on C-V characteristics.
