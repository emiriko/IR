New cross sections for the reaction $ep \to e'\eta p$ are reported for total
center of mass energy $W$=1.5--2.3 GeV and invariant squared momentum transfer
$Q^2$=0.13--3.3 GeV$^2$. This large kinematic range allows extraction of new
information about response functions, photocouplings, and $\eta N$ coupling
strengths of baryon resonances. A sharp structure is seen at $W\sim$ 1.7 GeV.
The shape of the differential cross section is indicative of the presence of a
$P$-wave resonance that persists to high $Q^2$. Improved values are derived for
the photon coupling amplitude for the $S_{11}$(1535) resonance. The new data
greatly expands the $Q^2$ range covered and an interpretation of all data with
a consistent parameterization is provided.
