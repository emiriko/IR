Compton scattering of X-rays in the bulk flow of the accretion column in
magnetic cataclysmic variables (mCVs) can significantly shift photon energies.
We present Monte Carlo simulations based on a nonlinear algorithm demonstrating
the effects of Compton scattering on the H-like, He-like and neutral Fe K alpha
lines produced in the post-shock region of the accretion column. The peak line
emissivities of the photons in the post-shock flow are taken into consideration
and frequency shifts due to Doppler effects are also included. We find that
line profiles are most distorted by Compton scattering effects in strongly
magnetized mCVs with a low white dwarf mass and high mass accretion rate and
which are viewed at an oblique angle with respect to the accretion column. The
resulting line profiles are most sensitive to the inclination angle. We have
also explored the effects of modifying the accretion column width and using a
realistic emissivity profile. We find that these do not have a significant
overall effect on the resulting line profiles. A comparison of our simulated
line spectra with high resolution Chandra/HETGS observations of the mCV GK Per
indicates that a wing feature redward of the 6.4 keV line may result from
Compton recoil near the base of the accretion column.
