Statistical properties of outgoing light pulses are studies after they have
been stored in a medium of atoms in the tripod configuration. A generalized
Hong-Ou-Mandel interference, storing of squeezed states and homodyne signal
analysis are discussed in the context of their dependence on the parameters of
the control fields used for light storage and release.
