The Thorium abundance for the red giant COS82 in the Ursa Minor dwarf
spheroidal galaxy is determined based on a high resolution spectrum. This is
the first detection of actinides in an extra Galactic object. A detailed
abundance pattern is determined for 12 other neutron-capture elements from the
atomic number 39 to 68. These elements are significantly over-abundant with
respect to other metals like Fe (> 1 dex) and their abundance pattern agrees
well with those of the r-process-enhanced, very metal-poor stars known in the
Galactic halo, while the metallicity of this object ([Fe/H] ~ -1.5) is much
higher than these field stars ([Fe/H] ~ -3.0). The results indicate that the
mechanism and the astrophysical site that are responsible for neutron-capture
elements in COS82 is similar to that for field r-process-enhanced stars, while
the condition of low mass star formation is quite different. An estimate of the
age of this object based on the Th abundance ratio is discussed.
