We show that one of the key characteristics of interacting one-dimensional
electronic quantum systems, the separation of spin and charge, can be observed
in a two-component system of bosonic ultracold atoms even close to a competing
phase separation regime. To this purpose we determine the real-time evolution
of a single particle excitation and the single-particle spectral function using
density-matrix renormalization group techniques. Due to efficient bosonic
cooling and good tunability this setup exhibits very good conditions for
observing this strong correlation effect. In anticipation of experimental
realizations we calculate the velocities for spin and charge perturbations for
a wide range of parameters.
