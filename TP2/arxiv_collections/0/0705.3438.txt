We have measured the absolute proper motions of globular clusters NGC 2808,
3201, 4372, 4833, 5927 and 5986. The proper motions are on the Hipparcos system
and they are the first determinations ever made for these low Galactic latitude
clusters. The proper motion uncertainties range from 0.3 to 0.5 mas/yr. The
inferred orbits indicate that 1) the single metal rich cluster in our sample,
NGC 5927, dynamically belongs to the thick disk, 2) the remaining metal poor
clusters have rather low-energy orbits of high eccentricity; among these, there
appear to be two "pairs" of dynamically associated clusters, 3) the most
energetic cluster in our sample, NGC 3201 is on a highly retrograde orbit --
which had already been surmised from its radial velocity alone -- with an
apocentric distance of 22 kpc, and 4) none of the metal poor clusters appear to
be associated with the recently detected SDSS streams, or with the Monoceros
structure.
  These are the first results of the Southern Proper-Motion Program (SPM) where
the second-epoch observations are taken with the CCD camera system recently
installed on the double astrograph at El Leoncito, Argentina.
