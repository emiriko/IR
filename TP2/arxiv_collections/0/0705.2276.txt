Using the data sets of 17.3 pb$^{-1}$ collected at $\sqrt{s}=$ 3.773 GeV and
6.5 pb$^{-1}$ collected at $\sqrt{s}=$ 3.650 GeV with the BESII detector at the
BEPC collider, we have measured the observed cross sections for 18 exclusive
light hadron final states produced in $e^+e^-$ annihilation at the two energy
points.
