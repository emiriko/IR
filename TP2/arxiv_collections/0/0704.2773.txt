Motivated by concerns regarding possible two-body contributions to the
recently-measured inclusive Upsilon(nS)->gamma+X (n=1, 2, 3) direct photon
spectra, we report on a new study of exclusive radiative decays of these narrow
Upsilon(nS) resonances into two-body final states R+gamma, with R a narrow
resonant hadronic state decaying into four or more charged particles. Such
two-body processes are not explicitly addressed in the extant theoretical
frameworks used to calculate the inclusive direct photon spectra, and must also
be explicitly inserted into Monte Carlo simulations. Using data collected from
the CLEO III detector at the Cornell Electron Storage Ring, we present upper
limits of order 0.01 per cent for such bottomonium two-body decays as a
function of the R recoil mass.
