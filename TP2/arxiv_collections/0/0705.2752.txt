Using the tight-binding model with long-range Coulomb interactions between
electrons, we study some of the electronic properties of graphene. The Coulomb
interactions are treated with the renormalized-ring-diagram approximation. By
self-consistently solving the integral equations for the Green function, we
calculate the spectral density. The obtained result is in agreement with
experimental observation. In addition, we also compute the density of states,
the distribution functions, and the ground-state energy. Within the present
approximation, we find that the imaginary part of the self-energy fixed at the
Fermi momentum varies as quadratic in energy close to the chemical potential,
regardless the system is doped or not. This result appears to indicate that the
electrons in graphene always behave like a moderately correlated Fermi liquid.
