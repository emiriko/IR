The purpose of this article is to establish regularity and pointwise upper
bounds for the (relative) fundamental solution of the heat equation associated
to the weighted dbar-operator in $L^2(C^n)$ for a certain class of weights. The
weights depend on a parameter, and we find pointwise bounds for heat kernel, as
well as its derivatives in time, space, and the parameter. We also prove
cancellation conditions for the heat semigroup. We reduce the $n$-dimensional
case to the one-dimensional case, and the estimates in one-dimensional case are
achieved by Duhamel's principle and commutator properties of the operators. As
an application, we recover estimates of heat kernels on polynomial models in
$C^2$.
