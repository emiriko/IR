We establish existence and various estimates of fundamental matrices and
Green's matrices for divergence form, second order strongly parabolic systems
in arbitrary cylindrical domains under the assumption that solutions of the
systems satisfy an interior H\"{o}lder continuity estimate. We present a
unified approach valid for both the scalar and the vectorial cases.
