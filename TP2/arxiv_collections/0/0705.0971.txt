High-dynamic range radio observations of Westerlund 1 are presented that
detect a total of 21 stars in the young massive stellar cluster, the richest
population of radio emitting stars known for any young massive galactic cluster
in the Galaxy. We will discuss some of the more remarkable objects, including
the highly radio luminous supergiant B[e] star W9, with an estimated mass-loss
rate ~10^{-3} solarmass/yr, comparable to that of eta Carina, along with the
somewhat unusual detection of thermal emission from almost all the cool red
supergiants and yellow hypergiants. There is strong supporting evidence from
X-ray observations that each of the WR stars with radio emission are likely to
be colliding-wind binaries
