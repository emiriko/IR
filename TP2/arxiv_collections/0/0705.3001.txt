OH(1720 MHz) and methanol masers are now recognized to be excellent probes of
the interactions of supernova remnants with molecular clouds and tracers of
massive star formation, respectively. To better understand the nature of star
formation activity in the central region of the Galaxy, we have used these two
classes of masers combined with the IRAC and MIPS data to study prominent sites
of ongoing star formation in the nuclear disk. The nuclear disk is
characterized by massive GMCs with elevated gas temperatures, compared to their
dust temperatures. We note an association between methanol masers and a class
of mid-infrared ``green sources''. These highly embedded YSOs show enhanced
4.5micron emission due to excited molecular lines. The distribution of methanol
masers and supernova remnants suggest a low efficiency of star formation (with
the exception of Sgr B2), which we believe is due to an enhanced flux of cosmic
ray electrons impacting molecular clouds in the nuclear disk. We also highlight
the importance of cosmic rays in their ability to heat molecular clouds, and
thus increase the gas temperature.
