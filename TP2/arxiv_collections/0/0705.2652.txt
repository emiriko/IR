We propose a scheme to generate temporal vector optical solitons in a
lifetime broadened five-state atomic medium via electromagnetically induced
transparency. We show that this scheme, which is fundamentally different from
the passive one by using optical fibers, is capable of achieving
distortion-free vector optical solitons with ultraslow propagating velocity
under very weak drive conditions. We demonstrate both analytically and
numerically that it is easy to realize Manakov temporal vector solitons by
actively manipulating the dispersion and self- and cross-phase modulation
effects of the system.
