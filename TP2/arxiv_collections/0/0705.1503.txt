If the baryon asymmetry of the Universe is produced by leptogenesis, CP
violation is required in the lepton sector. In the seesaw extension of the
Standard Model with three hierarchical right-handed neutrinos, we show that the
baryon asymmetry is insensitive to the PMNS phases: thermal leptogenesis can
work for any value of the observable phases. This result was well-known when
there are no flavour effects in leptogenesis; we show that it remains true when
flavour effects are included.
