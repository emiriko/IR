It is proposed to apply a recently developed concept of local wave velocities
to the dynamical field characteristics, especially for the canonical field
energy density. It is shown that local energy velocities can be derived from
the lagrangian directly. The local velocities of zero- and first- order for
energy propagation has been obtained for special cases of scalar and vector
fields. Some important special cases of these results are discussed.
