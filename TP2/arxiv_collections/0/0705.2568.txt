The purpose of this article is to show that the introduction of hidden
variables to describe individual events is fully consistent with the
statistical predictions of quantum theory. We illustrate the validity of this
assertion by discussing two fundamental experiments on correlated photons which
are believed to behave ``violently non-classical''. Our considerations carry
over to correlated pairs of neutral particles of spin one-half in a singlet
state. Much in the spirit of Einstein's conviction we come to the conclusion
that the state vector of a system does not provide an exhaustive description of
the individual physical system. We also briefly discuss an experiment on
``quantum teleportation'' and demonstrate that our completely local approach
leads to a full understanding of the experiment indicating the absence of any
teleportation phenomenon. We caution that the indiscriminated use of the term
``Quantum Theory'' tends to obscure distinct differences between the quantum
mechanics of massive particles and the propagation of photons. It is emphasized
that the properties of polarizers, beam splitters, halfwave plates etc. used in
photon-correlation experiments are defined by the laws of classical optics.
Hence, understanding the outcome of those experiments requires a well-founded
interconnection between classical and quantum electrodynamics free from
unnecessary hypotheses.
