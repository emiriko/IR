We study general aspects of active motion with fluctuations in the speed and
the direction of motion in two dimensions. We consider the case in which
fluctuations in the speed are not correlated to fluctuations in the direction
of motion, and assume that both processes can be described by independent
characteristic time-scales. We show the occurrence of a complex transient that
can exhibit a series of alternating regimes of motion, for two different
angular dynamics which correspond to persistent and directed random walks. We
also show additive corrections to the diffusion coefficient. The characteristic
time-scales are also exposed in the velocity autocorrelation, which is a sum of
exponential forms.
