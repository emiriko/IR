The Hamiltonian approach to the General Relativity and the Standard Model is
studied in the context of its consistency with the Newton law, the Higgs
effect, the Hubble cosmological evolution and the Cosmic Microwave Background
radiation physics.
  The version of the Higgs potential is proposed, where its constant parameter
is replaced by the dynamic zeroth Fourier harmonic of the very Higgs field. In
this model, the extremum of the Coleman--Weinberg effective potential obtained
from the unit vacuum--vacuum transition amplitude immediately predicts mass of
Higgs field and removes tremendous vacuum cosmological density.
  We show that the relativity principles unambiguously treat the Planck epoch,
in the General Relativity, as the present-day one. It was shown that there are
initial data of the Electro-Weak epoch compatible with supposition that all
particles in the Universe are final products of decays of primordial Higgs
particles and W-, Z-vector bosons created from vacuum at the instant treated as
the "Big-Bang".
