The aim of this work is to study the structure of the magnetic field vector
in the internetwork and search for the presence of small-scale loops. We invert
1.56 micron spectropolarimetric observations of internetwork regions at disc
centre by applying the SIR code. This allows us to recover the atmospheric
parameters that play a role in the formation of these spectral lines. We are
mainly interested in the structure of the magnetic field vector. We find that
many opposite polarity elements of the internetwork are connected by short
(2-6''), low-lying (photospheric) loops. These loops connect at least the 10-20
% of the internetwork flux visible in our data. Also we have some evidence that
points towards a dynamic scenario which can be produced by the emergence of
internetwork magnetic flux.
