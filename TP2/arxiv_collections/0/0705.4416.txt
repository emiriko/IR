Invasiveness, one of the hallmarks of tumor progression, represents the
tumor's ability to expand into the host tissue by means of several complex
biochemical and biomechanical processes. Since certain aspects of the problem
present a striking resemblance with well known physical mechanisms, such as the
mechanical insertion of a solid inclusion in an elastic material specimen [1,
2] or a water drop impinging on a surface [3], we propose here an analogy
between these physical processes and a cancer system's invasive branching into
the surrounding tissue. Accounting for its solid and viscous properties, we
present a unifying concept that the tumor behaves as a granular solid. While
our model has been explicitly formulated for multicellular tumor spheroids in
vitro, it should also contribute to a better understanding of tumor invasion in
vivo.
