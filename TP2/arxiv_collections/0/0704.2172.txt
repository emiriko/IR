The complete list of electroweak chiral Lagrangian up to order of p4 for
left-right symmetric models with a neutral light higgs is provided. The
connection of these operators to left and right gauge boson mixings and masses
is made and their contribution to conventional generalized electroweak chiral
Lagrangian with a neutral light higgs included in is estimated.
