A model-independent search for deviations from the Standard Model prediction
is performed in e-p collisions at HERA II using H1 data recorded during the
years 2005 and 2006, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 159 inv.pb.
All event topologies involving isolated electrons, photons, muons, neutrinos
and jets with high transverse momenta are investigated in a single analysis.
Events are assigned to exclusive classes according to their final state. A
statistical algorithm is used to search for deviations from the Standard Model
in the distributions of the scalar sum of transverse momenta or invariant mass
of final state particles and to quantify their significance. A good agreement
with the Standard Model prediction is observed in most of the event classes. No
significant deviation is found in the phase-space and event topologies covered
by this analysis.
