A large sample of pulsars has been observed to study their subpulse
modulation at an observing wavelength (when achievable) of both 21 and 92 cm
using the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope. In this paper we present the
92-cm data and a comparison is made with the already published 21-cm results.
We analysed 191 pulsars at 92 cm using fluctuation spectra. The sample of
pulsars is as unbiased as possible towards any particular pulsar
characteristics. For 15 pulsars drifting subpulses are discovered for the first
time and 26 of the new drifters found in the 21-cm data are confirmed. We
discovered nulling for 8 sources and 8 pulsars are found to intermittently emit
single pulses that have pulse energies similar to giant pulses. It is estimated
that at least half of the total population of pulsars have drifting subpulses
when observations with a high enough signal-to-noise ratio would be available.
It could well be that the drifting subpulse mechanism is an intrinsic property
of the emission mechanism itself, although for some pulsars it is difficult or
impossible to detect. Drifting subpulses are in general found at both
frequencies, although the chance of detecting drifting subpulses is possibly
slightly higher at 92 cm. It appears that the youngest pulsars have the most
disordered subpulses and the subpulses become more and more organized into
drifting subpulses as the pulsar ages. The correlations with the modulation
indices are argued to be consistent with the picture in which the radio
emission can be divided in a drifting subpulse signal plus a quasi-steady
signal which becomes, on average, stronger at high observing frequencies. The
measured values of P3 at the two frequencies are highly correlated, but there
is no evidence for a correlation with other pulsar parameters.
