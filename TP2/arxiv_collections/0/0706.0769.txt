We study Chern numbers to characterize the ground state of strongly
interacting systems on a lattice. This method allows us to perform a numerical
characterization of bosonic fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states on a lattice
where conventional overlap calculation with known continuum case such as
Laughlin state, breaks down due to the lattice structure or dipole-dipole
interaction. The non-vanishing Chern number indicates the existence of a
topological order in the degenerate ground state manifold.
