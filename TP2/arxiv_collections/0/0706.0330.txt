The evolution of magnetic fields in Ap stars during the main sequence phase
is presently mostly unconstrained by observation because of the difficulty of
assigning accurate ages to known field Ap stars.
  We are carrying out a large survey of magnetic fields in cluster Ap stars
with the goal of obtaining a sample of these stars with well-determined ages.
In this paper we analyse the information available from the survey as it
currently stands.
  We select from the available observational sample the stars that are probably
(1) cluster or association members and (2) magnetic Ap stars. For the stars in
this subsample we determine the fundamental parameters T_eff, log(L/L_o), and
M/M_o. With these data and the cluster ages we assign both absolute age and
fractional age (the fraction of the main sequence lifetime completed). For this
purpose we have derived new bolometric corrections for Ap stars.
  Magnetic fields are present at the surfaces of Ap stars from the ZAMS to the
TAMS. Statistically for the stars with M > 3 M_o the fields decline with
advancing age approximately as expected from flux conservation together with
increased stellar radius, or perhaps even faster than this rate, on a time
scale of about 3 10^7 yr. In contrast, lower mass stars show no compelling
evidence for field decrease even on a timescale of several times 10^8 yr.
  Study of magnetic cluster stars is now a powerful tool for obtaining
constraints on evolution of Ap stars through the main sequence. Enlarging the
sample of known cluster magnetic stars, and obtaining more precise RMS fields,
will help to clarify the results obtained so far. Further field observations
are in progress.
