This article presents an overview of experimental efforts in recent years
related to multidimensional solitons in Bose-Einstein condensates. We discuss
the techniques used to generate and observe multidimensional nonlinear waves in
Bose-Einstein condensates with repulsive interactions. We further summarize
observations of planar soliton fronts undergoing the snake instability, the
formation of vortex rings, and the emergence of hybrid structures.
