Doped graphene sheets are pseudochiral two-dimensional Fermi liquids with
abnormal electron-electron interaction physics. We address graphene's Fermi
liquid properties quantitatively using a microscopic random-phase-approximation
theory and comment on the importance of using exchange-correlation potentials
based on the properties of a chiral two-dimensional electron gas in
density-functional-theory applications to graphene nanostructures.
