The morphological and spectroscopic properties of the giant (>60 kpc)
Ly-alpha nebulae associated with three radio galaxies at z~2.5 (MRC 1558-003,
MRC 2025-218 and MRC 0140-257) have been investigated using integral field
spectroscopic data obtained with VIMOS on VLT.
  The morphologies are varied. The nebula of one source has a centrally peaked,
rounded appearance. In the other two objects, it consists of two spatial
components. The three nebulae are aligned with the radio axis within <30 deg.
The total Ly-alpha luminosities are in the range (0.3-3.4) x 1e44 erg s-1. The
Ly-alpha spectral profile shows strong variation through the nebulae, with FWHM
values in the range ~400-1500 km s-1 and velocity shifts V~120-600 km s-1.
  We present an infall model which can explain successfully most Ly-alpha
morphological and spectroscopic properties of the nebula associated with MRC
1558-003. This adds further support to our previous conclusion that the
_quiescent_ giant nebulae associated with this and other high redshift powerful
radio galaxies are in infall. A problem for this model is the difficulty to
reproduce the large Ly-alpha FWHM values.
  We have discovered a giant (~85 kpc) Ly-alpha nebula associated with the
radio galaxy MRC 0140-257 at z=2.64. It shows strikingly relaxed kinematics
(FWHM< 300 km s-1 and V<120 km s-1), unique among high z (>2) radio galaxies.
