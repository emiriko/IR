This article introduces new algorithms for the uniform random generation of
labelled planar graphs. Its principles rely on Boltzmann samplers, as recently
developed by Duchon, Flajolet, Louchard, and Schaeffer. It combines the
Boltzmann framework, a suitable use of rejection, a new combinatorial bijection
found by Fusy, Poulalhon and Schaeffer, as well as a precise analytic
description of the generating functions counting planar graphs, which was
recently obtained by Gim\'enez and Noy. This gives rise to an extremely
efficient algorithm for the random generation of planar graphs. There is a
preprocessing step of some fixed small cost. Then, the expected time complexity
of generation is quadratic for exact-size uniform sampling and linear for
approximate-size sampling. This greatly improves on the best previously known
time complexity for exact-size uniform sampling of planar graphs with $n$
vertices, which was a little over $O(n^7)$.
