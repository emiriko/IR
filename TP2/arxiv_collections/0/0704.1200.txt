We prove dispersive estimates for the low frequency part of the Schrodinger
group for a large class of potentials in dimensions greater or equal to four.
As a consequence, we extend the result of Journe, Sofer and Sogge to a larger
class of potentials. In this revised version a mistake in the proof of the
estimate (B.4) is removed.
