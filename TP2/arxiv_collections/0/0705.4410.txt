Stellar evolution in close binary systems is strongly influenced by mass
transfer from one star to the other when one component fills its zero-velocity
surface or Roche Lobe. SS Lep is a fairly nearby close binary showing the Algol
paradox and a shell spectrum, both indicative of (past) mass transfer. To study
the process of mass transfer and its evolutionary consequences, we aim at a
direct characterisation of the spatial dimensions of the different components
of SS Lep with IR interferometry. We use VINCI/VLTI interferometric
observations in the K band and photometric observations from the UV to the
far-IR. The visibilities are interpreted with simple geometrical models and the
Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) is decomposed into the three main
components: A star, M star and dust shell/disk. From the SED, we find that the
main emitters in the K band are the M star and the circumstellar environment.
Both are spatially resolved with the VINCI observations, showing the excess to
be circumbinary and showing the M star to have a size equal to its Roche Lobe.
We conclude that we have, for the first time, directly resolved a star filling
its Roche Lobe. The resulting mass transfer is probably the cause of (1) the
circumbinary dust disk of which we see the hot inner region spatially resolved
in our observations, (2) the unusually high luminosity of the A star and (3)
the shell spectrum seen in the UV and optical spectra.
