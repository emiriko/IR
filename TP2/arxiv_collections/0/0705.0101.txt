In light of the recent data from BES collaboration for $\chi_{c0}\to VV$,
$PP$ and $SS$, and from CLEO-c for $\eta\eta$, $\eta^\prime\eta^\prime$ and
$\eta\eta^\prime$, we present a detailed analysis of the decays of heavy
quarkonia into light meson pairs such as $\chi_{c0,2}\to VV$, $PP$ and $SS$ in
a recently proposed parametrization scheme. An overall agreement with the data
is achieved in $\chi_{c0,2}\to VV$ and $PP$, while in $\chi_{c0}\to SS$ we find
that a possible existence of glueball-$q\bar{q}$ mixings is correlated with the
OZI-rule violations, which can be further examined at CLEO-c and BESIII in
$\chi_{c0}\to SS$ measurement.
