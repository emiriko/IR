Based on the concept of a nonequilibrium steady state, we present a novel
method to experimentally determine energy landscapes acting on colloidal
systems. By measuring the stationary probability distribution and the current
in the system, we explore potential landscapes with barriers up to several
hundred $\kT$. As an illustration, we use this approach to measure the
effective diffusion coefficient of a colloidal particle moving in a tilted
potential.
