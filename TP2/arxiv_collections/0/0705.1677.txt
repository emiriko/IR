In this paper we present our results of a comprehensive spectroscopicanalysis
of WASP-1, the host star to the exoplanet WASP-1b. We derive T_eff = 6110 +/-
45 K, log g = 4.28 +/- 0.15, and [M/H] = 0.23 +/- 0.08, and also a high
abundance of lithium, log n(Li) = 2.91 +/- 0.05. These parameters suggests an
age for the system of 1-3 Gyr and a stellar mass of 1.25-1.35 M_sun. This means
that WASP-1 has properties very similar to those of HD 149026, the host star
for the highest density planet yet detected. Moreover, their planets orbit at
comparable distances and receive comparable irradiating fluxes from their host
stars. However, despite the similarity of WASP-1 with HD 149026, their planets
have strongly different densities. This suggests that gas-giant planet density
is not a simple function of host-star metallicity or of radiation environment
at ages of ~2 Gyr.
