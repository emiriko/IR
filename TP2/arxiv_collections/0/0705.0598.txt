We have explored the magnetic flux evolution and temperature variation in a
coronal-hole region, using Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO) deep magnetograms
and {\it SOHO}/EIT images observed from 2005 October 10 to 14. For comparison,
we also investigated a neighboring quiet region of the Sun. The coronal hole
evolved from its mature stage to its disappearance during the observing period.
We have obtained the following results: (1) When the coronal hole was well
developed on October 10, about 60 % of the magnetic flux was positive. The EUV
brightness was 420 counts pixel$^{-1}$, and the coronal temperature, estimated
from the line ratio of the EIT 195 {\AA} and 171 {\AA} images, was 1.07 MK. (2)
On October 14, when the coronal hole had almost disappeared, 51 % of the
magnetic flux was positive, the EUV radiance was 530 counts pixel$^{-1}$, and
the temperature was 1.10 MK. (3) In the neighboring quiet region, the fraction
of positive flux varied between 0.49 and 0.47. The EUV brightness displayed an
irregular variation, with a mean value of 870 counts pixel$^{-1}$. The
temperature was almost constant at 1.11 MK during the five-day observation. Our
results demonstrate that in a coronal hole less imbalance of the magnetic flux
in opposite polarities leads to stronger EUV brightness and higher coronal
temperatures.
