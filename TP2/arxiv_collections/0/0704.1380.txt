We theoretically investigate the dependence of exciton transition energies on
dielectric constant of surrounding materials. We make a simple model for the
relation between dielectric constant of environment and a static dielectric
constant describing the effects of electrons in core states, $\sigma$ bonds and
surrounding materials. Although the model is very simple, calculated results
well reproduce experimental transition energy dependence on dielectric constant
of various surrounding materials.
