The network of resonant bar detectors of gravitational waves resumed
coordinated observations within the International Gravitational Event
Collaboration (IGEC-2). Four detectors are taking part in this collaboration:
ALLEGRO, AURIGA, EXPLORER and NAUTILUS. We present here the results of the
search for gravitational wave bursts over 6 months during 2005, when IGEC-2 was
the only gravitational wave observatory in operation. The network data analysis
implemented is based on a time coincidence search among AURIGA, EXPLORER and
NAUTILUS, keeping the data from ALLEGRO for follow-up studies. With respect to
the previous IGEC 1997-2000 observations, the amplitude sensitivity of the
detectors to bursts improved by a factor about 3 and the sensitivity bandwidths
are wider, so that the data analysis was tuned considering a larger class of
detectable waveforms. Thanks to the higher duty cycles of the single detectors,
we decided to focus the analysis on three-fold observation, so to ensure the
identification of any single candidate of gravitational waves (gw) with high
statistical confidence. The achieved false detection rate is as low as 1 per
century. No candidates were found.
