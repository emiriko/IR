We discuss two new observational techniques that use observations of the
Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) to place constraints upon the mass, distance,
and size distribution of small objects in the Kuiper Belt and inner Oort Cloud,
collectively known as Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs). The first new technique
considers the spectral distortion of the isotropic, or monopole, CMB by TNOs
that have been heated by solar radiation to temperatures above that of the CMB.
We apply this technique to the spectral measurements of the CMB by the Far
Infrared Absolute Spectrophotometer (FIRAS) on the Cosmic Background Explorer
(COBE). The second technique utilizes the change in amplitude of the TNO signal
due to the orbital motion of the observer to separate the TNO signal from the
invariant extra-galactic CMB and construct a map of the mass distribution in
the outer Solar System. We estimate the ability of future CMB experiments to
create such a map.
