We propose a method for quantum state transfer from one atom laser beam to
another via an intermediate optical field, using Raman incoupling and
outcoupling techniques. Our proposal utilises existing experimental
technologies to teleport macroscopic matter waves over potentially large
distances without shared entanglement.
