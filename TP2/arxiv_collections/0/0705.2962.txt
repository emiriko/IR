Accreting X-ray pulsars provide us with laboratories for the study of extreme
gravitational and magnetic fields, hence accurate descriptions of their
observational properties contribute to our understanding of this group of
objects. We aim to detect a cyclotron resonance scattering feature in the
Be/X-ray binary Cep X-4 and to investigate pulse profile and spectral changes
through the outburst. Spectral fitting and timing analysis are employed to
probe the properties of Cep X-4 during an outburst in 2002 June. A previously
announced cyclotron feature at 30.7 keV is confirmed, while the source shows
spectral behaviour and luminosity related changes similar to those observed in
previous outbursts. The long-term X-ray lightcurve shows a periodicity at 20.85
d, which could be attributed to the orbit in this Be system.
