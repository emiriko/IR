Excited B mesons B_1 and B_2* are observed directly for the first time as two
separate states in fully reconstructed decays to B+(*) pi-. The mass of B_1 is
measured to be (5720.6 +- 2.4 +- 1.4) MeV/c^2 and the mass difference DeltaM
between B_2* and B_1 is (26.2 +- 3.1 +- 0.9) MeV/c^2, giving the mass of the
B_2* as (5746.8 +- 2.4 +- 1.7) MeV/c^2. The production rate for B_1 and B_2*
mesons is determined to be a fraction (13.9 +- 1.9 +- 3.2)% of the production
rate of the B+ meson.
