In this work we show that is possible to obtain Total Quantum Zeno Effect in
an unstable systems for times larger than the correlation time of the bath. The
effect is observed for some particular systems in which one can chose
appropriate observables which frequent measurements freeze the system into the
initial state. For a two level system in a squeezed bath one can show that
there are two bath dependent observables displaying Total Zeno Effect when the
system is initialized in some particular states. We show also that these states
are intelligent states of two conjugate observables associated to the
electromagnetic fluctuations of the bath.
