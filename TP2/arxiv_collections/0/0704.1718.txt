We consider the transverse Ising model in one dimension with
nearest-neighbour interaction and calculate exactly the longitudinal spin-spin
correlation for a class of excited states. These states are known to play an
important role in the perturbative treatment of one-dimensional transverse
Ising model with frustrated second-neighbour interaction. To calculate the
correlation, we follow the earlier procedure of Wu, use Szego's theorem and
also use Fisher-Hartwig conjecture. The result is that the correlation decays
algebraically with distance ($n$) as $1/\surd n$ and is oscillatory or
non-oscillatory depending on the magnitude of the transverse field.
