In an earlier paper we constructed a Cartier divisor on the theta divisor of
a principally polarised abelian variety whose support is precisely the
ramification locus of the Gauss map. In this note we discuss a Green's function
associated to this locus. For jacobians we relate this Green's function to the
canonical Green's function of the corresponding Riemann surface.
