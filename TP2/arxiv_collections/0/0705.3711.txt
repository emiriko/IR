The left-right polarization-dependent asymmetry of the weak interaction mass
is investigated. Based on the Standard Model, the calculation shows that the
weak interaction mass of left-handed polarized fermions is always greater than
that of right-handed polarized fermions in flight with the same velocity in any
inertial frame. The asymmetry of the weak interaction mass might be very
important to the investigation of neutrino mass and would have an important
significance for understanding the parity nonconservation in weak interactions.
