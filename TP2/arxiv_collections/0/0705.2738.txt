Because of spin-orbit interaction, an electrical current is accompanied by a
spin current resulting in spin accumulation near the sample edges. Due again to
spin-orbit interaction this causes a small decrease of the sample resistance.
An applied magnetic field will destroy the edge spin polarization leading to a
positive magnetoresistance. This effect provides means to study spin
accumulation by electrical measurements. The origin and the general properties
of the phenomenological equations describing coupling between charge and spin
currents are also discussed.
