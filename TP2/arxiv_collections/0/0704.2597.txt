We reduce the question whether a given quantum mixed state is separable or
entangled to the problem of existence of a certain full family of commuting
normal matrices whose matrix elements are partially determined by components of
the pure states constituting a decomposition of the considered mixture. The
method reproduces many known entanglement and/or separability criteria, and
provides yet another geometrical characterization of mixed separable states.
