The time dependent entropy (or Leipnik's entropy) of harmonic and damped
harmonic oscillators is extensively investigated by using time dependent wave
function obtained by the Feynman path integral method. Our results for simple
harmonic oscillator are in agrement with the literature. However, the joint
entropy of damped harmonic oscillator shows remarkable discontinuity with time
for certain values of damping factor. According to the results, the envelop of
the joint entropy curve increases with time monotonically. This results is the
general properties of the envelop of the joint entropy curve for quantum
systems.
