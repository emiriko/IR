High resolution topographic images obtained by scanning tunneling microscope
in the insulating state of Pr0.68Pb0.32MnO3 single crystals showed regular
stripe-like or zigzag patterns on a width scale of 0.4 - 0.5 nm confirming a
high temperature polaronic state. Spectroscopic studies revealed inhomogeneous
maps of zero-bias conductance with small patches of metallic clusters on length
scale of 2 - 3 nm only within a narrow temperature range close to the
metal-insulator transition. The results give a direct observation of polarons
in the insulating state, phase separation of nanometer-scale metallic clusters
in the paramagnetic metallic state, and a homogeneous ferromagnetic state.
