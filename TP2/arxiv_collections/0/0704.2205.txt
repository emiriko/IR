With the use of the AdS/CFT dictionary, a five-dimensional effective
description of dynamical electro-weak symmetry breaking with walking behavior
is constructed. The minimal model contains only two new parameters, the
confinement scale and the effective coupling of the new strong sector. This
parameter space is restricted by the precision electro-weak constraints and by
the requirement that the five-dimensional coupling be perturbative
(corresponding to the large-N regime in four-dimensional language). The
lightest observable new states are a set of four nearly degenerate spin-1
states with the same quantum numbers as the standard-model electro-weak gauge
bosons, and masses in the few TeV range. Their decay rate is dominated by
two-fermion final states. The number of pp -> mu mu and pp -> mu nu events is
studied as a function of the LHC integrated luminosity and of the two free
parameters. Discovery at the LHC is possible over a significant part of the
allowed parameter space up to masses of 4 TeV already with 10/fm of integrated
luminosity.
