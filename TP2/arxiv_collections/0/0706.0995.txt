The atomic bomb American program known as Manhattan Project has been studied
in detail. Historians argue that the beginning of this program is rooted in the
letter Einstein sent to American President Roosevelt in the summer of 1939.
This article examines Einstein's activities before 1933 as radical pacifist in
favor of the principles of universal disarmament and outspoken supporter of
individual war resistance and the shift of this posture when Hitler came to
power in 1933. In this context, we discuss the role played by nuclear
physicists during the Second World War and Einstein's decision to promote the
construction of an atomic weapon in the United States. Finally, the article
analyzes Einstein's struggle against the atomic race during the beginning of
the cold war.
