We study the thermodynamics of two flavor color superconducting (2SC) quark
matter within a nonlocal chiral quark model, using both instantaneous and
covariant nonlocal interactions. For applications to compact stars, we impose
conditions of electric and color charge neutrality as well as beta equilibrium
and construct a phase transition to the hadronic matter phase described within
the Dirac-Brueckner-Hartree-Fock (DBHF) approach. We obtain mass-radius
relations for hybrid star configurations which fulfill modern observational
constraints, including compact star masses above 2 M_sun.
