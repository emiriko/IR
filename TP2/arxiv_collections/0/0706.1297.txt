We present a theoretical study of bose condensation of non-interacting bosons
in finite lattices in quartic potentials in one, two, and three dimensions. We
investigate dimensionality effects and quartic potential effects on single
boson density of energy states, condensation temperature, condensate fraction,
and specific heat. The results obtained are compared with corresponding results
for lattice bosons in harmonic traps.
