AC Josephson effect in one-dimensional Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL)
adiabatically connected to superconducting electrodes is theoretically
investigated. It is found that density fluctuations due to repulsive
electron-electron interactions in TLL inhibit Josephson oscillations, whereas
they do not affect time-independent current part. We also show that the
fluctuations reduce supercurrent noise caused by multiple Andreev reflections.
This indicates that the quantum fluctuations in TLL disturb the superconducting
phase coherence spreading across the junction.
