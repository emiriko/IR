We describe an experimental setup designed to produce ultracold trapped gas
clouds of fermionic 6Li and bosonic 87Rb. This combination of alkali metals has
the potential to reach deeper Fermi degeneracy with respect to other mixtures
since it allows for improved heat capacity matching which optimizes sympathetic
cooling efficiency. Atomic beams of the two species are independently produced
and then decelerated by Zeeman slowers. The slowed atoms are collected into a
magneto-optical trap and then transferred into a quadrupole magnetic trap. An
ultracold Fermi gas with temperature in the 10^-3 T_F range should be
attainable through selective confinement of the two species via a properly
detuned laser beam focused in the center of the magnetic trap.
