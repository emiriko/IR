An autocatalytic reacting system with particles interacting at a finite
distance is studied. We investigate the effects of the discrete-particle
character of the model on properties like reaction rate, quenching phenomenon
and front propagation, focusing on differences with respect to the continuous
case. We introduce a renormalized reaction rate depending both on the
interaction radius and the particle density, and we relate it to macroscopic
observables (e.g., front speed and front thickness) of the system.
