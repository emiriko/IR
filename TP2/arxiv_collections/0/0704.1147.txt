I discuss several aspects of information theory and its relationship to
physics and neuroscience. The unifying thread of this somewhat chaotic essay is
the concept of Kolmogorov or algorithmic complexity (Kolmogorov Complexity, for
short). I argue that it is natural to interpret cognition as the art of finding
algorithms that apprach the Solomonoff-Kolmogorov-Chaitin (algorithmic)
Complexity limit with appropriate tradeoffs. In addition, I claim that what we
call the universe is an interpreted abstraction--a mental construct--based on
the observed coherence between multiple sensory input streams and our own
interactions. Hence, the notion of Universe is itself a model.
