Qualitative comparison of source sizes from pi-Xi correlations analyses in
d+Au and Au+Au collisions at sqrt(s_NN)=200G GeV and sqrt(s_NN)=62 GeV is
presented. For the most central Au+Au collisions at sqrt(s_NN)=200 GeV we
report first quantitative results concerning size of the pi-Xi source and
relative shift of the average emission points between pi and Xi showing that
the homogeneity region of Xi source is smaller then that of pion and
significantly shifted in the transverse direction.
