(Abridged) Galaxies form in hierarchically assembling dark matter halos. With
cosmological three dimensional adaptive mesh refinement simulations, we explore
in detail the virialization of baryons in the concordance cosmology, including
optically thin primordial gas cooling. We focus on early protogalaxies with
virial temperatures of 10^4 K and their progenitors. Without cooling, virial
heating occurs in shocks close to the virial radius for material falling in
from voids. Material in dense filaments penetrates deeper to about half that
radius. With cooling the virial shock position shrinks and also the filaments
reach scales as small as a third the virial radius. The temperatures in
protogalaxies found in adiabatic simulations decrease by a factor of two from
the center and show flat entropy cores. In cooling halos the gas reaches virial
equilibrium with the dark matter potential through its turbulent velocities. We
observe turbulent Mach numbers ranging from one to three in the cooling cases.
This turbulence is driven by the large scale merging and interestingly remains
supersonic in the centers of these early galaxies even in the absence of any
feedback processes. The virial theorem is shown to approximately hold over 3
orders of magnitude in length scale with the turbulent pressure prevailing over
the thermal energy. The turbulent velocity distributions are Maxwellian and by
far dominate the small rotation velocities associated with the total angular
momentum of the galaxies. Decomposing the velocity field using the
Cauchy-Stokes theorem, we show that ample amounts of vorticity are present
around shocks even at the very centers of these objects.
