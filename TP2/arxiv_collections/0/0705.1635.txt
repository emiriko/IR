The formation of hydrogen-like muonium (Mu) has been studied as a function of
implantation energy in intrinsic Si, thin films of condensed van der Waals
gases (N2, Ne, Ar, Xe), fused and crystalline quartz and sapphire. By varying
the initial energy of positive muons (mu+) between 1 and 30 keV the number of
electron-hole pairs generated in the ionization track of the mu+ can be tuned
between a few and several thousand. The results show the strong suppression of
the formation of those Mu states that depend on the availability of excess
electrons. This indicates, that the role of H-impurity states in determining
electric properties of semiconductors and insulators depends on the way how
atomic H is introduced into the material.
