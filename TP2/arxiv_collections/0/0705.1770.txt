We compute the initial energy density and net baryon number density in 5%
most central Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt s=5.5$ TeV from pQCD + (final state)
saturation, and describe the evolution of the produced system with
boost-invariant transversely expanding hydrodynamics. In addition to the total
multiplicity at midrapidity, we give predictions for the multiplicity of
charged hadrons, pions, kaons and (anti)protons, for the total transverse
energy and net-baryon number, as well as for the $p_T$-spectrum of charged
hadrons, pions and kaons. We also predict the region of applicability of
hydrodynamics by comparing these results with high-$p_T$ hadron spectra
computed from pQCD and energy losses.
