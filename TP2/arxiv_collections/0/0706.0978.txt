Some of the more powerful results of mathematical statistics are becoming of
increasing importance in statistical mechanics. Here the use of the central
limit theorem in conjunction with the canonical ensemble is shown to lead to an
interesting and important new insight into results associated with the
canonical ensemble. This theoretical work is illustrated numerically and it is
shown how this numerical work can form the basis of an undergraduate laboratory
experiment which should help to implant ideas of statistical mechanics in
students' minds.
