In this paper, we have explained transverse electro-optic effect by
quantum-photonic model (QPM). This model interpret this effect by
photon-electron interaction in attosecond regime. We simulate applied electric
field on molecule and crystal by Monte-Carlo method in time domain when a light
beam is propagated through the waveguide. We show how the waveguide response to
an optical signal with different wavelengths when a transverse electric field
applied to the waveguide.
