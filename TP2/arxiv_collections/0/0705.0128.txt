In this paper, pilot-assisted transmission over Gauss-Markov Rayleigh fading
channels is considered. A simple scenario, where a single pilot signal is
transmitted every T symbols and T-1 data symbols are transmitted in between the
pilots, is studied. First, it is assumed that binary phase-shift keying (BPSK)
modulation is employed at the transmitter. With this assumption, the training
period, and data and training power allocation are jointly optimized by
maximizing an achievable rate expression. Achievable rates and energy-per-bit
requirements are computed using the optimal training parameters. Secondly, a
capacity lower bound is obtained by considering the error in the estimate as
another source of additive Gaussian noise, and the training parameters are
optimized by maximizing this lower bound.
