The main objective of this work is to investigate theoretically how tilting
of an easy axis of a single-molecule magnet (SMM) from the orientation
collinear with magnetic moments of the leads affects the switching process
induced by current flowing through the system. To do this we consider a model
system that consists of a SMM embedded in the nonmagnetic barrier of a magnetic
tunnel junction. The anisotropy axis of the SMM forms an arbitrary angle with
magnetic moments of the leads (the latter ones are assumed to be collinear).
The reversal of the SMM's spin takes place due to exchange interaction between
the molecule and electrons tunneling through the barrier. The current flowing
through the system as well as the average z-component of the SMM's spin are
calculated in the second-order perturbation description (Fermi golden rule).
