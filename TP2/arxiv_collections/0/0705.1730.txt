The fastest pulsar and the slowest nova; the oldest galaxies and the youngest
stars; the weirdest life forms and the commonest dwarfs; the highest energy
particles and the lowest energy photons. These were some of the extremes of
Astrophysics 2006. We attempt also to bring you updates on things of which
there is currently only one (habitable planets, the Sun, and the universe) and
others of which there are always many, like meteors and molecules, black holes
and binaries.
