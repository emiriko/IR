We present spatial distribution of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and
ionized gas within the Galactic giant HII region NGC3603. Using the IRS
instrument on board the Spitzer Space Telescope, we study in particular the PAH
emission features at ~5.7, 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, and 11.3um, and the [ArII] 6.99um,
[NeII] 12.81um, [ArIII] 8.99um, and [SIV] 10.51um forbidden emission lines. The
observations probe both ionized regions and photodissociation regions. Silicate
emission is detected close to the central cluster while silicate absorption is
seen further away. We find no significant variation of the PAH ionization
fraction across the whole region. The emission of very small grains lies closer
to the central stellar cluster than emission of PAHs. The PAH/VSG ratio
anticorrelates with the hardness of the interstellar radiation field suggesting
a destruction mechanism of the molecules within the ionized gas, as shown for
low-metallicity galaxies by Madden et al. (2006).
