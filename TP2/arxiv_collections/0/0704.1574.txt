Retarded electromagnetic potentials are derived from Maxwell's equations and
the Lorenz condition. The difference found between these potentials and the
conventional Li\'{e}nard-Wiechert ones is explained by neglect, for the latter,
of the motion-dependence of the effective charge density. The corresponding
retarded fields of a point-like charge in arbitary motion are compared with
those given by the formulae of Heaviside, Feynman, Jefimenko and other authors.
The fields of an accelerated charge given by the Feynman are the same as those
derived from the Li\'{e}nard-Wiechert potentials but not those given by the
Jefimenko formulae. A mathematical error concerning partial space and time
derivatives in the derivation of the Jefimenko equations is pointed out.
