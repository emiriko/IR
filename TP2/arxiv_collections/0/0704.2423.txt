The Mathematica toolkit AMBRE derives Mellin-Barnes (MB) representations for
Feynman integrals in d=4-2eps dimensions. It may be applied for tadpoles as
well as for multi-leg multi-loop scalar and tensor integrals. AMBRE uses a
loop-by-loop approach and aims at lowest dimensions of the final MB
representations. The present version of AMBRE works fine for planar Feynman
diagrams. The output may be further processed by the package MB for the
determination of its singularity structure in eps. The AMBRE package contains
various sample applications for Feynman integrals with up to six external
particles and up to four loops.
