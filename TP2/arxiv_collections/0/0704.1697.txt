Reflectance, transmittance and absorbance of a symmetric light pulse, the
carrying frequency of which is close to the frequency of interband transitions
in a quantum well, are calculated. Energy levels of the quantum well are
assumed discrete, and two closely located excited levels are taken into
account. A wide quantum well (the width of which is comparable to the length of
the light wave, corresponding to the pulse carrying frequency) is considered,
and the dependance of the interband matrix element of the momentum operator on
the light wave vector is taken into account. Refractive indices of barriers and
quantum well are assumed equal each other. The problem is solved for an
arbitrary ratio of radiative and nonradiative lifetimes of electronic
excitations. It is shown that the spatial dispersion essentially affects the
shapes of reflected and transmitted pulses. The largest changes occur when the
radiative broadening is close to the difference of frequencies of interband
transitions taken into account.
