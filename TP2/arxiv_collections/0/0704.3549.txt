Semiclassical calculations using the Herman-Kluk initial value treatment are
performed to determine energy eigenvalues of bound and resonance states of the
collinear helium atom. Both the $eZe$ configuration (where the classical motion
is fully chaotic) and the $Zee$ configuration (where the classical dynamics is
nearly integrable) are treated. The classical motion is regularized to remove
singularities that occur when the electrons collide with the nucleus. Very good
agreement is obtained with quantum energies for bound and resonance states
calculated by the complex rotation method.
