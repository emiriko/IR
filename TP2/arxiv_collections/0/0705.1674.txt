This paper investigates the use of evolutionary optimisation techniques to
register a template with a scene image. An error function is created to measure
the correspondence of the template to the image. The problem presented here is
to optimise the horizontal, vertical and scaling parameters that register the
template with the scene. The Genetic Algorithm, Simulated Annealing and
Particle Swarm Optimisations are compared to a Nelder-Mead Simplex optimisation
with starting points chosen in a pre-processing stage. The paper investigates
the precision and accuracy of each method and shows that all four methods
perform favourably for image registration. SA is the most precise, GA is the
most accurate. PSO is a good mix of both and the Simplex method returns local
minima the most. A pre-processing stage should be investigated for the
evolutionary methods in order to improve performance. Discrete versions of the
optimisation methods should be investigated to further improve computational
performance.
