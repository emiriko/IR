Spin Hamiltonians with degenerate ground states are one potential system for
the storage of quantum information at low temperatures. Trapped ions can be
used to simulate the dynamics of these Hamiltonians, but the
coherence-preserving properties will be lost. This illustrates that a quantum
simulation performed in an interaction frame will not thermalize with its
environment.
