A geometric approach to time-dependent optimal control problems is proposed.
This formulation is based on the Skinner and Rusk formalism for Lagrangian and
Hamiltonian systems. The corresponding unified formalism developed for optimal
control systems allows us to formulate geometrically the necessary conditions
given by Pontryagin's Maximum Principle, provided that the differentiability
with respect to controls is assumed and the space of controls is open.
Furthermore, our method is also valid for implicit optimal control systems and,
in particular, for the so-called descriptor systems (optimal control problems
including both differential and algebraic equations).
