The MiniBooNE Collaboration reports first results of a search for $\nu_e$
appearance in a $\nu_\mu$ beam. With two largely independent analyses, we
observe no significant excess of events above background for reconstructed
neutrino energies above 475 MeV. The data are consistent with no oscillations
within a two neutrino appearance-only oscillation model.
