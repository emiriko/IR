Evolutionary Learning proceeds by evolving a population of classifiers, from
which it generally returns (with some notable exceptions) the single
best-of-run classifier as final result. In the meanwhile, Ensemble Learning,
one of the most efficient approaches in supervised Machine Learning for the
last decade, proceeds by building a population of diverse classifiers. Ensemble
Learning with Evolutionary Computation thus receives increasing attention. The
Evolutionary Ensemble Learning (EEL) approach presented in this paper features
two contributions. First, a new fitness function, inspired by co-evolution and
enforcing the classifier diversity, is presented. Further, a new selection
criterion based on the classification margin is proposed. This criterion is
used to extract the classifier ensemble from the final population only
(Off-line) or incrementally along evolution (On-line). Experiments on a set of
benchmark problems show that Off-line outperforms single-hypothesis
evolutionary learning and state-of-art Boosting and generates smaller
classifier ensembles.
