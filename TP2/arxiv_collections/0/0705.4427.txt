Mortality, birth rates and retirement play a major role in demographic
changes. In most cases, mortality rates decreased in the past century without
noticeable decrease in fertility rates, this leads to a significant increase in
population growth. In many poor countries like Palestinian territories the
number of births has fallen and the life expectancy increased.
  In this article we concentrate on measuring, analyzing and extrapolating the
age structure in Palestine a few decades ago into future. A Fortran program has
been designed and used for the simulation and analysis of our statistical data.
This study of demographic change in Palestine has shown that Palestinians will
have in future problems as the strongest age cohorts are the above-60-year
olds. We therefore recommend the increase of both the retirement age and women
employment.
