A large number of pulsars and X-rays sources are detected in globular
clusters. To understand the structure and content of these clusters, accurate
distances are required. We derive the distances of Terzan 5, Liller 1 and UKS 1
using as a reference a recent distance determination of NGC 6528, based on
HST/NICMOS and NTT/SOFI infrared photometry. The distance of the metal-poor
cluster Terzan 4 was derived from a comparison with M92 in NICMOS bands.
Distances of the metal-rich clusters are obtained by comparison of the
Horizontal Branch (HB) level of the clusters, relative to the reddening line
passing through the HB of NGC 6528. We use methods based on NICMOS bands and
transformations to J and H magnitudes with different assumptions. Liller~1 and
Terzan~4 are found to be at the central bulge distance, UKS~1 is beyond the
Galactic center, while Terzan 5 is closer to the Sun than the other four
clusters. The distance of Terzan 5 is of paramount importance, given the impact
of its population of 21 pulsars, which is related to the high cluster density.
The distance of Terzan 5 is found to be d$_{\odot}$=5.5$\pm$0.9 kpc from the
Sun, thus closer to us than values given in studies of pulsars in Terzan 5. As
a consequence, the higher cluster density is even more favourable for formation
of the millisecond pulsars recently detected in this cluster.
