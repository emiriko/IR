We propose a technique aimed at cooling a harmonically oscillating mirror to
its quantum mechanical ground state starting from room temperature. Our method,
which involves the two-sided irradiation of the vibrating mirror inside an
optical cavity, combines several advantages over the two-mirror arrangements
being used currently. For comparable parameters the three-mirror configuration
provides a stiffer trap for the oscillating mirror. Furthermore it prevents
bistability from limiting the use of higher laser powers for mirror trapping,
and also partially does so for mirror cooling. Lastly, it improves the
isolation of the mirror from classical noise so that its dynamics are perturbed
mostly by the vacuum fluctuations of the optical fields. These improvements are
expected to bring the task of achieving ground state occupation for the mirror
closer to completion.
