We resolve an old problem about the existence of hidden parameters in a
three-dimensional quantum system by constructing an appropriate Bell's type
inequality. This reveals a nonclassical nature of most spin-$1$ states. We
shortly discuss some physical implications and an underlying cause of this
nonclassical behavior, as well as a perspective of its experimental
verification.
