New physics at the weak scale that can couple to quarks typically gives rise
to unacceptably large flavor changing neutral currents. An attractive way to
avoid this problem is to impose the principal of minimal flavor violation
(MFV). Recently it was noted that in MFV only scalars with the same gauge
quantum numbers as the standard model Higgs doublet or color octet scalars with
the same weak quantum numbers as the Higgs doublet can couple to quarks. In
this paper we compute the one-loop rate for production of a single color octet
scalar through gluon fusion at the LHC, which can become greater than the tree
level pair production rate for octet scalar masses around a TeV. We also
calculate the precision electroweak constraint from Z decays to a b and anti-b
quark; this constraint on color octet mass and Yukawa coupling affects the
allowed range for single octet scalar production through gluon fusion.
