We explore a new origin of neutrino dark energy and baryon asymmetry in the
universe. The neutrinos acquire small masses through the Dirac seesaw
mechanism. The pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson associated with neutrino
mass-generation provides a candidate for dark energy. The puzzle of
cosmological baryon asymmetry is resolved via neutrinogenesis.
