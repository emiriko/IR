In this paper we apply the instanton representation method to the
construction of spherically symmetric blackhole general relativity solutions.
The instanton representation implies the existence of additional Type D
solutions which are axially symmetric. We explicitly construct these solutions,
which are fully consistent with Birkhoff's theorem.
