We report the direct evidence of the possibility of charge segregation in
manganites. The high contrast of electric-field-induced local charged states is
observed during more than 100 hours at room temperature. These induced states
display a piezoelectric response and polar properties. This effect may be an
example of a new kind of polar ordering in solid state.
