A computer simulation technique, suited to replicate real adsorption
experiments, was applied to pure simulated silica in order to gain insight into
the fractal regime of its surface. The previously reported experimental fractal
dimension was closely approached and the hitherto uncharted lower limit of
fractal surface behaviour is reported herein.
