The present paper aims at introducing the innovative technologies, based on
the concept of "sensory substitution" or "perceptual supplementation", we are
developing in the fields of human disability and biomedical engineering.
Precisely, our goal is to design, develop and validate practical assistive
biomedical and/technical devices and/or rehabilitating procedures for persons
with disabilities, using artificial tongue-placed tactile biofeedback systems.
Proposed applications are dealing with: (1) pressure sores prevention in case
of spinal cord injuries (persons with paraplegia, or tetraplegia); (2) ankle
proprioceptive acuity improvement for driving assistance in older and/or
disabled adults; and (3) balance control improvement to prevent fall in older
and/or disabled adults. This paper presents results of three feasibility
studies performed on young healthy adults.
