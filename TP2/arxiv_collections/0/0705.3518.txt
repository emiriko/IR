The existence of scale invariant physics would lead to new phenomena in
particle physics that could be detected at the LHC. In this paper we exploit
the effects of these unparticles in $WW \to WW$ scattering. From the
requirement of unitarity we derive constraints on unparticle physics. We show
that the existence of unparticles would lead to deviations in differential
cross sections which can be measured. These deviations are sensitive on the
scale dimension and on the spin characteristics of the unparticles.
