Using experimental longitudinal and transverse velocities data for very high
Reynolds number turbulence, we study both anisotropy and asymmetry of
turbulence. These both seem to be related to small scale turbulent structures,
and to intermittency. We may assume that the large scale velocity shear gives
an impact into the small scale turbulence, resulting in non-locality, and
related anomalous events.
