In response to the proposed high helium content stars as an explanation for
the double main sequence observed in Omega Centauri, we investigated the
consequences of such stars elsewhere on the color-magnitude diagram. We
concentrated on the horizontal branch where the effects of high helium are
expected to show themselves more clearly. In the process, we developed a
procedure for comparing the mass loss suffered by differing stellar populations
in a physically motivated manner. High helium stars in the numbers proposed
seem absent from the horizontal branch of Omega Centauri unless their mass loss
history is very different from that of the majority metal-poor stars. It is
possible to generate a double main sequence with existing Omega Centauri stars
via accretion of helium rich pollution consistent with the latest AGB ejecta
theoretical yields, and such polluted stars are consistent with the observed HB
morphology of Omega Centauri. Polluted models are consistent with observed
merging of the main sequences as opposed to our models of helium rich stars.
Using the (B-R)/(B+V+R) statistic, we find that the high helium bMS stars
require an age difference compared to the rMS stars that is too great, whereas
the pollution scenario stars have no such conflict for inferred Omega Centauri
mass losses.
