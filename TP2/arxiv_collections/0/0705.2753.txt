The (e,n)-complexity functions describe total instability of trajectories in
dynamical systems. They reflect an ability of trajectories going through a
Borel set to diverge on the distance $\epsilon$ during the time interval n.
Behavior of the (e, n)-complexity functions as n goes to infinity is reflected
in the properties of special measures. These measures are constructed as limits
of atomic measures supported at points of (e,n)-separated sets. We study such
measures. In particular, we prove that they are invariant if the
(e,n)-complexity function grows subexponentially.
