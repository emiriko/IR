We investigate the non-equilibrium fluid structure mediated forces between
two colloids driven through a suspension of mutually non-interacting Brownian
particles as well as between a colloid and a wall in stationary situations. We
solve the Smoluchowski equation in bispherical coordinates as well as with a
method of reflections, both in linear approximation for small velocities and
numerically for intermediate velocities, and we compare the results to a
superposition approximation considered previously. In particular we find an
enhancement of the friction (compared to the friction on an isolated particle)
for two colloids driven side by side as well as for a colloid traveling along a
wall. The friction on tailgating colloids is reduced. Colloids traveling side
by side experience a solute induced repulsion while tailgating colloids are
attracted to each other.
