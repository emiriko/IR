We discuss different arguments that have been raised against the viability of
the big trip process, reaching the conclusions that this process can actually
occur by accretion of phantom energy onto the wormholes and that it is stable
and might occur in the global context of a multiverse model. We finally argue
that the big trip does not contradict any holographic bounds on entropy and
information.
