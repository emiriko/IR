The secular perturbations exerted by an inclined satellite orbiting in a gap
in a broad planetary ring tends to excite the inclinations of the nearby ring
particles, and the ring's self-gravity can allow that disturbance to propagate
away in the form of a spiral bending wave. The amplitude of this spiral bending
wave is determined, as well as the wavelength, which shrinks as the waves
propagate outwards due to the effects of the central planet's oblateness. The
excitation of these bending waves also damps the satellite's inclination I.
This secular I damping is also compared to the inclination excitation that is
due to the satellite's many other vertical resonances in the ring, and the
condition for inclination damping is determined. The secular I damping is
likely responsible for confining the orbits of Saturn's two known gap-embedded
moons, Pan and Daphnis, to the ring plane.
