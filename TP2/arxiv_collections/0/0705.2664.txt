Patterns of flavor violation induced by neutrino Yukawa couplings are
discussed in realistic ``minimal'' SUSY SU(5) models, obtained by adding
nonrenormalizable operators to the minimal one, in order to fix the fermion
spectrum and suppress proton decay. Results are presented for the three
possible implementations of the seesaw mechanisms, i.e. of Type I, II and III.
