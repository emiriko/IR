We present a new catalog of star cluster candidates in the nearby spiral
galaxy M33. It is based on eight existing catalogs wherein we have
cross-referenced identifications and endeavored to resolve inconsistencies
between them. Our catalog contains 451 candidates of which 255 are confirmed
clusters based on HST and high resolution ground-based imaging. The catalog
contains precise cluster positions (RA and Dec), magnitudes and colors in the
UBVRIJHKs filters, metallicities, radial velocities, masses and ages, where
available, and galactocentric distances for each cluster. The color
distribution of the M33 clusters appears to be similar to those in the Large
Magellanic Cloud with major peaks at (B-V)o~0.15, and (B-V)o~0.65. The
intrinsic colors are correlated with cluster ages, which range from 10^{7.5} to
10^{10.3} years. The age distribution of the star clusters supports the notion
of rapid cluster disruption with a slope of alpha=-1.09 +/- 0.07 in the
dN_{cluster}/dt ~ t^{alpha} relation. In addition, comparison to theoretical
single stellar population models suggests the presence of an age-metallicity
relation among these clusters with younger clusters being more metal-rich.
Analysis of the radial distribution of the clusters yields some evidence that
younger clusters (age <~ 1 Gyr) may be more concentrated toward the center of
M33 than older ones. A similar comparison with the radial profile of the M33
field stars shows the clusters to be more centrally concentrated at the greater
than 99.9% confidence level. Possible reasons for this are presented and
discussed; however, the overwhelming conclusion seems to be that a more
complete and thorough cluster search is needed covering at least 4 square
degrees centered on M33.
