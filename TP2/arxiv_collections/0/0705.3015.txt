Real-time access to accurate and reliable timing information is necessary to
profile scientific applications, and crucial as simulations become increasingly
complex, adaptive, and large-scale. The Cactus Framework provides flexible and
extensible capabilities for timing information through a well designed
infrastructure and timing API. Applications built with Cactus automatically
gain access to built-in timers, such as gettimeofday and getrusage,
system-specific hardware clocks, and high-level interfaces such as PAPI. We
describe the Cactus timer interface, its motivation, and its implementation. We
then demonstrate how this timing information can be used by an example
scientific application to profile itself, and to dynamically adapt itself to a
changing environment at run time.
