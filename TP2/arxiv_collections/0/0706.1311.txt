We present a method for compactifying stacks of $\PGL_n$-torsors (Azumaya
algebras) on algebraic spaces. In particular, when the ambient space is a
smooth projective surface we use our methods to show that various moduli spaces
are irreducible and carry natural virtual fundamental classes. We also prove a
version of the Skolem-Noether theorem for certain algebra objects in the
derived category, which allows us to give an explicit description of the
boundary points in our compactified moduli problem.
