We present XMM-Newton observations of the eclipsing polar V2301 Oph which
cover nearly 2.5 binary orbital cycles and 2 eclipses. This polar is believed
to have the lowest magnetic field strength (7 MG) of any known polar. We find
evidence for structure in the X-ray eclipse profile which shows a `standstill'
feature lasting 26+/-4 sec. This allows us to place an upper limit on the mass
of the white dwarf of ~1.2 Msun. We find no evidence for QPOs in the frequency
range 0.02-10 Hz. This coupled with the absence of QPOs in RXTE data suggest
that, if present, any oscillations in the shock front have a minimal effect on
the resultant X-ray flux. We find no evidence for a distinct soft X-ray
component in its spectrum - it therefore joins another 7 systems which do not
show this component. We suggest that those systems which are asynchronous, have
low mass transfer rates, or have accretion occurring over a relatively large
fraction of the white dwarf are more likely to show this effect. We find that
the specific mass transfer rate has to be close to 0.1 g cm^-2 s^-1 to predict
masses which are consistent with that derived from our eclipse analysis. This
maybe due to the fact that the low magnetic field strength allows accretion to
take place along a wide range of azimuth.
