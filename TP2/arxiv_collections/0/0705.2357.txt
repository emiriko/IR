There are fundamental reasons as to why there should exist a reformulation of
quantum mechanics which does not refer to a classical spacetime manifold. It
follows as a consequence that quantum mechanics as we know it is a limiting
case of a more general nonlinear quantum theory, with the nonlinearity becoming
significant at the Planck mass/energy scale. This nonlinearity is responsible
for a dynamically induced collapse of the wave-function, during a quantum
measurement, and it hence falsifies the many-worlds interpretation of quantum
mechanics. We illustrate this conclusion using a mathematical model based on a
generalized Doebner-Goldin equation. The non-Hermitian part of the Hamiltonian
in this norm-preserving, nonlinear, Schrodinger equation dominates during a
quantum measurement, and leads to a breakdown of linear superposition.
