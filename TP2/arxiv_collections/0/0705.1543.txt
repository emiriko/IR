Using the hierarchy picture of the fractional quantum Hall effect, we study
the the ground state periodicity of a finite size quantum Hall droplet in a
quantum Hall fluid of a different filling factor. The droplet edge charge is
periodically modulated with flux through the droplet and will lead to a
periodic variation in the conductance of a nearby point contact, such as occurs
in some quantum Hall interferometers. Our model is consistent with experiment
and predicts that superperiods can be observed in geometries where no
interfering trajectories occur. The model may also provide an experimentally
feasible method of detecting elusive neutral modes and otherwise obtaining
information about the microscopic edge structure in fractional quantum Hall
states.
