An analysis of the redshift maps of galaxies and quasars has revealed
large-scale self-similar skeletal structures of the Universe of the same
topology which had been found earlier in a wide range of phenomena, spatial
scales and environments. The "cartwheel" type of structure with diameter ~ 1.5
10^27 cm is discovered in this analysis by means of the method of multi-level
dynamical contrasting. Similar skeletal structures in size up to 1.5 10^28 cm
are found also in the redshift maps of quasars.
