Neutron- and proton-induced fission cross-sections of separated isotopes of
tungsten (182W, 183W, 184W, and 186W) and 181Ta relative to 209Bi have been
measured in the incident nucleon energy region 50 - 200 MeV using fission
chambers based on thin-film breakdown counters (TFBC) using quasi-monoenergetic
neutrons from the 7Li(p,n) reaction and at the proton beams of The Svedberg
Laboratory (TSL), Uppsala University (Uppsala, Sweden). The results are
compared with predictions by the CEM03.01 event generator, as well as with the
recent data for nuclei in the lead-bismuth region. The effect of "compound
nucleus" in the intermediate energy region is discussed, displaying in
exponential dependence of nucleon-induced fission cross-sections on the
parameter Z^2/A of the composite system (projectile+target nucleus), and in
other characteristics of the fission process for which parameter Z^2/A plays a
role similar to the one of the usual liquid-drop parameter Z^2/A of compound
nuclei.
