In the framework of the effective field theory method, we use the
experimental data and the perturbative unitarity bounds to determine the values
and uncertainty of all the 11 chiral coefficients ($\al_i, i=0, ..., 10$) of
the standard electroweak chiral Lagrangian. Up to linear terms in $\al_i$, we
provide the one-loop renormalization group equations of all the chiral
coefficients, which are calculated in the Feynman-'t Hooft gauge using the
modified minimal subtraction scheme. With the improved renormalization group
equations to sum over the logarithmic corrections, we analyze the current
experimental uncertainty of oblique correction parameters, $S(\Lambda)$ and
$T(\Lambda)$. We find that, due to the large uncertainty in the triple
gauge-boson coupling measurements, the parameter space of positive $S(\Lambda)$
for $\Lambda > 1$ TeV is still allowed by the current experimental data.
$T(\Lambda)$ tends to increase with $\Lambda$ even in the presence of the
operators that contribute to the triple and quartic gauge-boson couplings.
