We calculate the tunneling density of states for a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid
placed under a strong bias voltage. For the tunneling through a side-coupled
point contact, one can observe the power law singularities in the tunneling
density of states separately for the right- and left-movers despite the
point-like tunnel contact. Deviations of the nonequilibrium tunneling exponents
from the equilibrium case are discussed.
