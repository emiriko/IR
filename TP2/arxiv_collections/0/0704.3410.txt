In this brief note, we will investigate the number of points of bounded
(twisted) height in a projective variety defined over a function field, where
the function field comes from a projective variety of dimension greater than or
equal to 2. A first step in this investigation is to understand the $p$-adic
analytic properties of the height zeta function. In particular, we will show
that for a large class of projective varieties this function is $p$-adic
meromorphic.
