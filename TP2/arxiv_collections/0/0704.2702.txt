We investigate the influence of spin-orbit interaction on ballistic transport
through chaotic cavities by using semiclassical methods. Our approach is based
on the Landauer formalism and the Fisher-Lee relations, appropriately
generalized to spin-orbit interaction, and a semiclassical representation of
Green functions. We calculate conductance coefficients by exploiting ergodicity
and mixing of suitably combined classical spin-orbit dynamics, and making use
of the Sieber-Richter method and its most recent extensions. That way we obtain
weak anti-localization and confirm previous results obtained in the symplectic
ensemble of Random Matrix Theory.
