We investigate the dielectrophoretic motion of charge-neutral, polarizable
nanocolloids through molecular dynamics simulations. Comparison to analytical
results derived for continuum systems shows that the discrete charge
distributions on the nanocolloids have a significant impact on their coupling
to the external field. Aggregation of nanocolloids leads to enhanced
dielectrophoretic transport, provided that increase in the dipole moment upon
aggregation can overcome the related increase in friction. The dimer
orientation and the exact structure of the nanocolloid charge distribution are
shown to be important in the enhanced transport.
