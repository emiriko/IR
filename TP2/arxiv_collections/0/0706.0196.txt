We report an Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) study on thick multi lamellar
stacks of approx. 10 mum thickness (about 1500 stacked membranes) of DMPC
(1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phoshatidylcholine) deposited on silicon wafers.
These thick stacks could be stabilized for measurements under excess water or
solution. From force curves we determine the compressional modulus B and the
rupture force F_r of the bilayers in the gel (ripple), the fluid phase and in
the range of critical swelling close to the main transition. AFM allows to
measure the compressional modulus of stacked membrane systems and values for B
compare well to values reported in the literature. We observe pronounced
ripples on the top layer in the Pbeta' (ripple) phase and find an increasing
ripple period Lambda_r when approaching the temperature of the main phase
transition into the fluid Lalpha phase at about 24 C. Metastable ripples with
2Lambda_r are observed. Lambda_r also increases with increasing osmotic
pressure, i.e., for different concentrations of polyethylene glycol (PEG).
