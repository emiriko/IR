Color confinement and chiral symmetry specify some important territory for
the study of hadronic physics. Any hadron can be defined as a color-singlet
composite system of qurks and gluons, the fundamental fields of qcd, while the
landscape of the hadronic spectrum is dominated by the fact that two quark
flavors, u and d, are characterized by masses small compared to the fundamental
scale of this theory. Measurements sensitive to the orbital angular momenta of
the color constituents of the nucleon display the interplay of chiral dynamics
and confinement in a unique manner. This pageant can be explored by an
evaluation, within the context of the Georgi-Manohar chiral quark model, of the
normalization of the orbital structure functions and the normalization of the
Boer-Mulders functions for different quark flavors. The resolution structures
in the chiral quark model represent an evaluation of Collins functions for a
confined system defined by the quantum numbers of the nucleon in the
constituent quark model. The orbital structure functions for antiquarks can
also be specified within the basic framework of this approach while the
normalization of the gluon orbital structure function requires some additional
assumptions.
