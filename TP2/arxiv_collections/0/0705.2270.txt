This paper characterizes the effect of finite rate channel state feedback on
the sum rate of a multi-access multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system. We
propose to control the users jointly, specifically, we first choose the users
jointly and then select the corresponding beamforming vectors jointly. To
quantify the sum rate, this paper introduces the composite Grassmann manifold
and the composite Grassmann matrix. By characterizing the distortion rate
function on the composite Grassmann manifold and calculating the logdet
function of a random composite Grassmann matrix, a good sum rate approximation
is derived. According to the distortion rate function on the composite
Grassmann manifold, the loss due to finite beamforming decreases exponentially
as the feedback bits on beamforming increases.
