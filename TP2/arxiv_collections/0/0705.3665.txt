An array of Neutral-Current Detectors (NCDs) has been built in order to make
a unique measurement of the total active flux of solar neutrinos in the Sudbury
Neutrino Observatory (SNO). Data in the third phase of the SNO experiment were
collected between November 2004 and November 2006, after the NCD array was
added to improve the neutral-current sensitivity of the SNO detector. This
array consisted of 36 strings of proportional counters filled with a mixture of
$^3$He and CF$_4$ gas capable of detecting the neutrons liberated by the
neutrino-deuteron neutral current reaction in the D$_2$O, and four strings
filled with a mixture of $^4$He and CF$_4$ gas for background measurements. The
proportional counter diameter is 5 cm. The total deployed array length was 398
m. The SNO NCD array is the lowest-radioactivity large array of proportional
counters ever produced. This article describes the design, construction,
deployment, and characterization of the NCD array, discusses the electronics
and data acquisition system, and considers event signatures and backgrounds.
