GREGOR is a new open solar telescope with an aperture of 1.5m. It replaces
the former 45-cm Gregory Coude telescope on the Canary island Tenerife. The
optical concept is that of a double Gregory system. The main and the elliptical
mirrors are made from a silicon-carbide material with high thermal
conductivity. This is important to keep the mirrors on the ambient temperature
avoiding local turbulence. GREGOR will be equipped with an adaptive optics
system. The new telescope will be ready for operation in 2008. Post-focus
instruments in the first stage will be a spectrograph for polarimetry in the
near infrared and a 2-dimensional spectrometer based on Fabry-Perot
interferometers for the visible.
