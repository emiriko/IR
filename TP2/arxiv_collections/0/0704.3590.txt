A time series delta(n), the fluctuation of the nth unfolded eigenvalue was
recently characterized for the classical Gaussian ensembles of NxN random
matrices (GOE, GUE, GSE). It is investigated here for the beta-Hermite ensemble
as a function of beta (zero or positive) by Monte Carlo simulations. The
fluctuation of delta(n) and the autocorrelation function vary logarithmically
with n for any beta>0 (1<<n<<N). The simple logarithmic behavior reported for
the higher-order moments of delta(n) for the GOE (beta=1) and the GUE (beta=2)
is valid for any positive beta and is accounted for by Gaussian distributions
whose variances depend linearly on ln(n). The 1/f noise previously demonstrated
for delta(n) series of the three Gaussian ensembles, is characterized by
wavelet analysis both as a function of beta and of N. When beta decreases from
1 to 0, for a given and large enough N, the evolution from a 1/f noise at
beta=1 to a 1/f^2 noise at beta=0 is heterogeneous with a ~1/f^2 noise at the
finest scales and a ~1/f noise at the coarsest ones. The range of scales in
which a ~1/f^2 noise predominates grows progressively when beta decreases.
Asymptotically, a 1/f^2 noise is found for beta=0 while a 1/f noise is the rule
for beta positive.
