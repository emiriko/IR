We investigate the dissipative real-time evolution of the order parameter for
the deconfining transition in the pure SU(2) gauge theory. The approach to
equilibrium after a quench to temperatures well above the critical one is
described by a Langevin equation. To fix completely the markovian Langevin
dynamics we choose the dissipation coefficient, that is a function of the
temperature, guided by preliminary Monte Carlo simulations for various
temperatures. Assuming a relationship between Monte Carlo time and real time,
we estimate the delay in thermalization brought about by dissipation and noise.
