The stability of (C20)N chains with N = 3 - 7 is analyzed by numerical
simulation using a tight-binding potential and molecular dynamics. Various
channels of losing the cluster-chain structure of the (C20)N complexes are
observed, including the decay of C20 clusters, their coalescence, and the
separation of one C20 fullerene from the chain.
