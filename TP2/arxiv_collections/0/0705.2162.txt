We present an analysis of noisy atomic channels involving qutrits. We choose
a three-level atom with V-configuration to be the qutrit state. Gell-Mann
matrices and a generalized Bloch vector (8-dimensional) are used to describe
the qutrit density operator. We introduce quantum quasi-distributions for
qutrits that provide a simple description of entanglement. Studying the
time-evolution for the atomic variables we find the Kraus representation of
spontaneous emission quantum channel (SE channel). Furthermore, we consider a
generalized Werner state of two qutrits and investigate the separability
condition in the presence of spontaneous emission noise. The influence of
spontaneous emission on the separability of Werner states for qutrit and qubit
states is compared.
