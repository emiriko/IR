We study a three dimensional Z(3)-symmetric effective theory of high
temperature QCD. The exact lattice-continuum relations, needed in order to
perform lattice simulations with physical parameters, are computed to order
O(a^0) in lattice perturbation theory. Lattice simulations are performed to
determine the phase structure of a subset of the parameter space.
