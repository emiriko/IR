The prototype of a workflow system for the submission of content to a digital
object repository is here presented. It is based entirely on open-source
standard components and features a service-oriented architecture. The front-end
consists of Java Business Process Management (jBPM), Java Server Faces (JSF),
and Java Server Pages (JSP). A Fedora Repository and a mySQL data base
management system serve as a back-end. The communication between front-end and
back-end uses a SOAP minimal binding stub. We describe the design principles
and the construction of the prototype and discuss the possibilities and
limitations of work ow creation by administrators. The code of the prototype is
open-source and can be retrieved in the project escipub at
http://sourceforge.net
