It is shown that a relativistic multiple scattering theory for hadron-nucleus
scattering can be consistently formulated in four-dimensions in the context of
meson exchange. We give a multiple scattering series for the optical potential
and discuss the differences between the relativistic and non-relativistic
versions. We develop the relativistic multiple scattering series by separating
out the one boson exchange term from the rest of the Feynman series. However
this particular separation is not absolutely necessary and we discuss how to
include other terms. We then show how to make a three-dimensional reduction for
hadron-nucleus scattering calculations and we find that the relative energy
prescription used in the elastic scattering equation should be consistent with
the one used in the free two-body t-matrix involved in the optical potential.
We also discuss what assumptions are involved in making a Dirac Relativistic
Impulse Approximation (RIA).
