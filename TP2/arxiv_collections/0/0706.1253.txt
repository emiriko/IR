We consider a trapped Fermi gas with population imbalance at finite
temperatures and map out the detailed phase diagram across a wide Feshbach
resonance. We take the Larkin-Ovchinnikov-Fulde-Ferrel (LOFF) state into
consideration and minimize the thermodynamical potential to ensure stability.
Under the local density approximation, we conclude that a stable LOFF state is
present only on the BCS side of the Feshbach resonance, but not on the BEC side
or at unitarity. Furthermore, even on the BCS side, a LOFF state is restricted
at low temperatures and in a small region of the trap, which makes a direct
observation of LOFF state a challenging task.
