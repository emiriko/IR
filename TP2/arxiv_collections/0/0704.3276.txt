I argue that the (extended) Standard Model (SM) of particle physics and the
renormalizable Feynman-Weinberg theory of quantum gravity comprise a theory of
everything. I show that imposing the appropriate cosmological boundary
conditions make the theory finite. The infinities that are normally
renormalized away and the series divergence infinities are both eliminated by
the same mechanism. Furthermore, this theory can resolve the horizon, flatness,
and isotropy problems of cosmology. Joint mathematical consistency naturally
yields a scale-free, Gaussian, adiabatic perturbation spectrum, and more matter
than antimatter. I show that mathematical consistency of the theory requires
the universe to begin at an initial singularity with a pure $SU(2)_L$ gauge
field. I show that quantum mechanics requires this field to have a Planckian
spectrum whatever its temperature. If this field has managed to survive
thermalization to the present day, then it would be the CMBR. If so, then we
would have a natural explanation for the dark matter and the dark energy. I
show that isotropic ultrahigh energy (UHE) cosmic rays are explained if the
CMBR is a pure $SU(2)_L$ gauge field. The $SU(2)_L$ nature of the CMBR may have
been seen in the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect. I propose several simple
experiments to test the hypothesis.
