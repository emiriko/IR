Two types of phase synchronization (accordingly, two scenarios of breaking
phase synchronization) between coupled stochastic oscillators are shown to
exist depending on the discrepancy between the control parameters of
interacting oscillators, as in the case of classical synchronization of
periodic oscillators. If interacting stochastic oscillators are weakly detuned,
the phase coherency of the attractors persists when phase synchronization
breaks. Conversely, if the control parameters differ considerably, the chaotic
attractor becomes phase-incoherent under the conditions of phase
synchronization break.
