Relativistic jets from Active Galactic Nuclei are known since decades, but
the study of the connection between accretion and ejection in these systems is
hampered by the long time scales associated to these events. The past decade
has seen a rapid advancement due to the observation of similar radio jets in
galactic X-ray binaries, where the time scales are much shorter. A clear
connection between accretion and ejection has been found for these systems,
together with a solid characterization of the phenomenological properties of
their outbursts. This wealth of new results has led to a detailed comparison
between X-ray binaries and AGN, from which a number of correlations and scaling
laws has been established. Here I briefly review the current observational
status.
