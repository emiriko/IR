Yukawa potentials may be long ranged when the Debye screening length is
large. In computer simulations, such long ranged potentials have to be taken
into account with convenient algorithms to avoid systematic bias in the
sampling of the phase space. Recently, we have provided Ewald sums for
quasi-two dimensional systems with Yukawa interaction potentials [M. Mazars,
{\it J. Chem. Phys.}, {\bf 126}, 056101 (2007) and M. Mazars, {\it Mol. Phys.},
Paper I]. Sometimes, Lekner sums are used as an alternative to Ewald sums for
Coulomb systems. In the present work, we derive the Lekner sums for quasi-two
dimensional systems with Yukawa interaction potentials and we give some
numerical tests for pratical implementations. The main result of this paper is
to outline that Lekner sums cannot be considered as an alternative to Ewald
sums for Yukawa potentials. As a conclusion to this work : Lekner sums should
not be used for quasi-two dimensional systems with Yukawa interaction
potentials.
