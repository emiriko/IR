High resolution molecular line observations of CS, HCO+, C18O and N2H+ were
obtained toward the starless globule FeSt 1-457 in order to investigate its
kinematics and chemistry. The HCO+ and CS spectra show clear self-reversed and
asymmetric profiles across the face of the globule. The sense of the observed
asymmetry is indicative of the global presence of expansion motions in the
outer layers of the globule. These motions appear to be subsonic and
significantly below the escape velocity of the globule. Comparison of our
observations with near-infrared extinction data indicate that the globule is
gravitationally bound. Taken together these considerations lead us to suggest
that the observed expansion has its origin in an oscillatory motion of the
outer layers of the globule which itself is likely in a quasi-stable state near
hydrostatic equilibrium. Analysis of the observed linewidths of CO and N2H+
confirm that thermal pressure is the dominant component of the cloud's internal
support. A simple calculation suggests that the dominant mode of pulsation
would be an l = 2 mode with a period of 0.3 Myr. Deformation of the globule due
to the large amplitude l = 2 oscillation may be responsible for the
double-peaked structure of the core detected in high resolution extinction
maps. Detailed comparison of the molecular-line observations and extinction
data provides evidence for significant depletion of C18O and perhaps HCO+ while
N2H+ may be undepleted to a cloud depth of about 40 magnitudes of visual
extinction.
