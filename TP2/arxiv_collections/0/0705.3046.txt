Using the photometric data on FR II radio galaxies obtained in the Big Trio
Program and data from other sources, we confirmed the stable correlation
between the spectroscopic and photometric redshifts up to z~4 determined from
the evolutionary synthetic spectra of elliptical galaxies. This is a
confirmation for the theoretical predictions of the existence of a stellar
population at high redshifts and its subsequent evolution corresponding to the
population of giant elliptical galaxies.
