We give a presentation of the moduli stack of toric vector bundles with fixed
equivariant total Chern class as a quotient of a fine moduli scheme of framed
bundles by a linear group action. This fine moduli scheme is described
explicitly as a locally closed subscheme of a product of partial flag varieties
cut out by combinatorially specified rank conditions. We use this description
to show that the moduli of rank three toric vector bundles satisfy Murphy's
Law, in the sense of Vakil. The preliminary sections of the paper give a
self-contained introduction to Klyachko's classification of toric vector
bundles.
