It has been recently shown that Hoyle-Narlikar's C-field theory admits
wormhole geometry. We derive the deflection angle of light rays caused by
C-field wormhole in the strong field limit approach of gravitational lensing
theory. The linearized stability of C-field wormhole under spherically
symmetric perturbations about static equilibrium is also explored.
