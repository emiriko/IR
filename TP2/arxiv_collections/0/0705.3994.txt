An open quantum system consisting of a quantum dot with a Coulomb interaction
and two leads without interactions is studied. The many-body scattering states
are constructed with the Bethe-ansatz approach. The expectation value of the
electric current is exactly calculated for the scattering states to observe
resonance peaks due to many-body scattering.
