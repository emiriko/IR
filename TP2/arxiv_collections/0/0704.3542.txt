Integral formulae for polynomial solutions of the quantum
Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations associated with the R-matrix of the six-vertex
model are considered. It is proved that when the deformation parameter q is
equal to e^{+- 2 pi i/3} and the number of vertical lines of the lattice is
odd, the solution under consideration is an eigenvector of the inhomogeneous
transfer matrix of the six-vertex model. In the homogeneous limit it is a
ground state eigenvector of the antiferromagnetic XXZ spin chain with the
anisotropy parameter Delta equal to -1/2 and odd number of sites. The obtained
integral representations for the components of this eigenvector allow to prove
some conjectures on its properties formulated earlier. A new statement relating
the ground state components of XXZ spin chains and Temperley-Lieb loop models
is formulated and proved.
