We review the relations between the full counting statistics and the field
theory of electric circuits. We demonstrate that for large conductances the
counting statistics is determined by non-trivial saddle-point of the field.
Coulomb effects in this limit are presented as quantum corrections that can
stongly renormalize the action at low energies.
