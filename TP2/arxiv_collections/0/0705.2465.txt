After the nontrivial quantum parameters $\Omega_{n}$ and quantum potentials
$V_{n}$ obtained in our previous research, the circumstance of a real scalar
wave in the bulk is studied with the similar method of Brevik (2001). The
equation of a massless scalar field is solved numerically under the boundary
conditions near the inner horizon $r_{e}$ and the outer horizon $r_{c}$. Unlike
the usual wave function $\Psi_{\omega l}$ in 4D, quantum number $n$ introduces
a new functions $\Psi_{\omega l n}$, whose potentials are higher and wider with
bigger n. Using the tangent approximation, a full boundary value problem about
the Schr$\ddot{o}$dinger-like equation is solved. With a convenient replacement
of the 5D continuous potential by square barrier, the reflection and
transmission coefficients are obtained. If extra dimension does exist and is
visible at the neighborhood of black holes, the unique wave function
$\Psi_{\omega l n}$ may say something to it.
