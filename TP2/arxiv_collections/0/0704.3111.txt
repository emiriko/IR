Momentum resolved inelastic resonant x-ray scattering is used to map the
evolution of charge excitations over a large range of energies, momenta and
doping levels in the electron doped Mott insulator class
Nd$_{2-x}$Ce$_x$CuO$_4$. As the doping induced AFM-SC
(antiferromagnetic-superconducting) transition is approached, we observe an
anisotropic softening of collective charge modes over a large energy scale
along the Gamma to (\pi,\pi)-direction, whereas the modes exhibit broadening
($\sim$ 1 eV) with relatively little softening along Gamma to (\pi,0) with
respect to the parent Mott insulator (x=0). Our study indicates a systematic
collapse of the gap consistent with the scenario that the system dopes
uniformly with electrons even though the softening of the modes involves an
unusually large energy scale.
