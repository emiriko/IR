OH masers at 1720 MHz have proven to be excellent indicators of interactions
between supernova remnants and molecular clouds. Recent calculations suggest
that the 6049 MHz OH maser line is excited for higher column densities than for
the 1720 MHz line. It is therefore a potentially valuable indicator of
remnant-cloud interaction.
  We present preliminary results of a survey using the Parkes Methanol
Multibeam receiver for 6049 MHz and 6035/6030 MHz OH masers towards 36
supernova remnants and 4 fields in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. While
no 6049 MHz masers have been found, three new sites of 6035 and 6030 MHz OH
maser emission have been discovered in star-forming regions.
