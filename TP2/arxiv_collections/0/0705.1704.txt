We observe experimentally higher-order solitons in waveguide arrays with
defocusing saturable nonlinearity. Such solitons can comprise several in-phase
bright spots and are stable above a critical power threshold. We elucidate the
impact of the nonlinearity saturation on the domains of existence and stability
of the observed complex soliton states.
