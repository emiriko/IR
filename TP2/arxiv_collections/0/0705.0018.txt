Overlap fermions have an exact chiral symmetry on the lattice and are thus an
appropriate tool for investigating the chiral and topological structure of the
QCD vacuum. We study various chiral and topological aspects of quenched gauge
field configurations. This includes the localization and chiral properties of
the eigenmodes, the local structure of the ultraviolet filtered field strength
tensor, as well as the structure of topological charge fluctuations. We
conclude that the vacuum has a multifractal structure.
