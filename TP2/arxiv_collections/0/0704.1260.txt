The puzzling behavior of the transition phase through a quantum dot can be
understood in a natural way via a formation of the electron molecule in the
quantum dot. In this case the resonance tunneling takes place through the
quasi-stationary (doorway) state, which emerges when the number of electrons
occupying the dot reaches a certain ``critical'' value, $N_{cr}$. Our
estimation of this quantity agrees with the experimental data. The dependence
of $N_{cr}$ on the dot's size is predicted as well.
