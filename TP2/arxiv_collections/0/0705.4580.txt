A formally exact relation is derived which connects thermodynamically
non-equilibrium evolution of gas density distribution after its arbitrary
strong spatially non-uniform perturbation and evolution of many-particle
correlations between path of some marked particle and its surroundings in
equilibrium gas. This relation directly confirms significance of the
many-particle correlations even under the Boltzmann-Grad limit and thus
validates the earlier suggested revision of kinetics.
