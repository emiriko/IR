Two evolutionary lineages: Machiavellian and Bohrian intelligence
  Mutation and natural selection are the two most basic processes of evolution,
yet the study of their interplay remains a challenge for theoretical and
empirical research. Darwinian evolution favors genotypes with high replication
rates, a process called survival of the fittest representing lineage of the
Machiavellian inteligence. According to quasi-species theory, selection favors
the cloud of genotypes, interconnected by mutation, whose average replication
rate is highest: mutation acts as a selective agent to shape the entire genome
so that is robust with respect to mutation. Thus survival of the flattest and
inventivest representing lineage of the Bohrian intelligence at high mutation
rates. Quasi-species theory predicts that, under appropriate conditions (high
mutation pressure), such a mutation can be fixed in an evolving population,
despite its lower replication rate.
