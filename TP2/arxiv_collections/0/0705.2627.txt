In realistic continuous variable quantum key distribution protocols, an
eavesdropper may exploit the additional Gaussian noise generated during
transmission to mask her presence. We present a theoretical framework for a
post-selection based protocol which explicitly takes into account excess
Gaussian noise. We derive a quantitative expression of the secret key rates
based on the Levitin and Holevo bounds. We experimentally demonstrate that the
post-selection based scheme is still secure against both individual and
collective Gaussian attacks in the presence of this excess noise.
