A comparative study between two distinct perturbative series expansions for
the pair-creation contact process is presented. In contrast to the ordinary
contact process, whose supercritical series expansions provide accurate
estimates for its critical behavior, the supercritical approach does not work
properly when applied to the pair-creation process. To circumvent this problem
a procedure is introduced in which one-site creation is added to the
pair-creation. An alternative method is the generation of subcritical series
expansions which works even for the case of the pure pair-creation process.
Differently from the supercritical case, the subcritical series yields
estimates that are compatible with numerical simulations.
