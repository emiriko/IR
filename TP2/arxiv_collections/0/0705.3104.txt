The studies of the generalized Einstein Lagrangian densities without torsion
are extended to those of the more generalized Lagrangian densities with
torsion. The properties of the more generalized Lagrangian densities are
studied systematically and thoroughly. The dynamical laws of a gravitational
system such as the gravitational field equations, the conservation laws of the
energy-momentum tensor densities, the conservation laws of the spin densities
and the equations of motion for test particle are all derived from the
Lagrangian densities. The differences between the more generalized Lagrangian
densities and the generalized Einstein Lagrangian densities are discussed.
