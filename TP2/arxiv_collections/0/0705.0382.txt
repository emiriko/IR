The ATLAS detector at CERN will provide a high-resolution
longitudinally-segmented calorimeter and precision tracking for the upcoming
study of heavy ion collisions at the LHC (sqrt(s_NN)=5520 GeV). The calorimeter
covers |eta|<5 with both electromagnetic and hadronic sections, while the inner
detector spectrometer covers |eta|<2.5. ATLAS will study a full range of
observables necessary to characterize the hot and dense matter formed at the
LHC. Global measurements (particle multiplicities, collective flow) will
provide access into its thermodynamic and hydrodynamic properties. Measuring
complete jets out to 100's of GeV will allow detailed studies of energy loss
and its effect on jets. Quarkonia will provide a handle on deconfinement
mechanisms. ATLAS will also study the structure of the nucleon and nucleus
using forward physics probes and ultraperipheral collisions, both enabled by
segmented Zero Degree Calorimeters.
