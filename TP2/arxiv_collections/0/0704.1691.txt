In the recent progress [BE1], [Me] and [Z2], the well-known JC (Jacobian
conjecture) ([BCW], [E]) has been reduced to a VC (vanishing conjecture) on the
Laplace operators and HN (Hessian nilpotent) polynomials (the polynomials whose
Hessian matrix are nilpotent). In this paper, we first show that the vanishing
conjecture above, hence also the JC, is equivalent to a vanishing conjecture
for all 2nd order homogeneous differential operators $\Lambda$ and
$\Lambda$-nilpotent polynomials $P$ (the polynomials $P(z)$ satisfying
$\Lambda^m P^m=0$ for all $m\ge 1$). We then transform some results in the
literature on the JC, HN polynomials and the VC of the Laplace operators to
certain results on $\Lambda$-nilpotent polynomials and the associated VC for
2nd order homogeneous differential operators $\Lambda$. This part of the paper
can also be read as a short survey on HN polynomials and the associated VC in
the more general setting. Finally, we discuss a still-to-be-understood
connection of $\Lambda$-nilpotent polynomials in general with the classical
orthogonal polynomials in one or more variables. This connection provides a
conceptual understanding for the isotropic properties of homogeneous
$\Lambda$-nilpotent polynomials for the 2nd order homogeneous full rank
differential operators $\Lambda$ with constant coefficients.
