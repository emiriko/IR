We investigate the phases of the ionic Hubbard model in a two-dimensional
square lattice using determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC). At half-filling,
when the interaction strength or the staggered potential dominate we find Mott
and band insulators, respectively. When these two energies are of the same
order we find a metallic region. Charge and magnetic structure factors
demonstrate the presence of antiferromagnetism only in the Mott region,
although the externally imposed density modulation is present everywhere in the
phase diagram. Away from half-filling, other insulating phases are found.
Kinetic energy correlations do not give clear signals for the existence of a
bond-ordered phase.
