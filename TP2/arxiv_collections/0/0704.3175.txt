The onset of an "eye-phase" and its role during the DNA unzipping is studied
when a force is applied to the interior of the chain. The directionality of the
hydrogen bond introduced here shows oscillations in force-extension curve
similar to a "saw-tooth" kind of oscillations seen in the protein unfolding
experiments. The effects of intermediates (hairpins) and stacking energies on
the melting profile have also been discussed.
