We find that the modified sine-Gordon equation belonging to the class of the
soliton equations describes the propagation of extremely short transverse
acoustic pulses through the low-temperature crystal containing paramagnetic
impurities with effective spin S=1/2 in the Voigt geometry case. The features
of nonlinear dynamics of strain field and effective spins, which correspond to
the different kinds of acoustic solitons, are studied.
