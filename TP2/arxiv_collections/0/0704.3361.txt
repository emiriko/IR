To better understand our Galaxy, we investigate the pertinency of describing
the sys tem of nearby disk stars in terms of a two-components Schwarzschild
velocity distributio n.Using the proper motion and parallax information of
Hipparcos database, we determine t he parameters characterizing the local
stellar velocity field of a sample of 22000 disk stars. The sample we use is
essentially the same as the one described by the criteria ad opted to study the
LSR and the stream motion of the nearby stellar population
