We show that a quantum state may be represented as the sum of a joint
probability and a complex quantum modification term. The joint probability and
the modification term can both be observed in successive projective
measurements. The complex modification term is a measure of measurement
disturbance. A selective phase rotation is needed to obtain the imaginary part.
This leads to a complex quasiprobability, the Kirkwood distribution. We show
that the Kirkwood distribution contains full information about the state if the
two observables are maximal and complementary. The Kirkwood distribution gives
a new picture of state reduction. In a nonselective measurement, the
modification term vanishes. A selective measurement leads to a quantum state as
a nonnegative conditional probability. We demonstrate the special significance
of the Schwinger basis.
