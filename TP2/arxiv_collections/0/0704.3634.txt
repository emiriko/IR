We utilize a recent formulation of a spherically symmetric spacetime endowed
with a general decomposition of the energy momentum tensor [Phys. Rev. D, 75,
024031 (2007)] to derive equations governing spherically symmetric
distributions of electromagnetic matter. We show the system reduces to the
Reissner-Nordstrom spacetime in general, spherically symmetric coordinates in
the vacuum limit. Furthermore, we show reduction to the charged Vaidya
spacetime in non-null coordinates when certain equations of states are chosen.
A model of gravitational collapse is discussed whereby a charged fluid resides
within a boundary of finite radial extent on the initial hypersurface, and is
allowed to radiate charged particles. Our formalism allows for the discussion
of all regions in this model without the need for complicated matching schemes
at the interfaces between successive regions. As further examples we consider
the collapse of a thin shell of charged matter onto a Reissner-Nordstrom black
hole. Finally, we reduce the entire system of equations to the static case such
that we have the equations for hydrostatic equilibrium of a charged fluid.
