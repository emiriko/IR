We calculate the lowest order cross--section for Dirac magnetic monopole
production from photon fusion in p p-bar collisions at sqrt{s}=1.96 TeV, p p
collisions at sqrt{s}=14 TeV, and we compare photon fusion with Drell--Yan (DY)
production. We find the total photon fusion cross--section is comparable with
DY at sqrt{s}=1.96 TeV and dominates DY by a factor ~50 at sqrt{s}=14 TeV. We
conclude that both the photon fusion and DY processes allow for a monopole mass
limit m>370 GeV based upon the null results of the recent monopole search at
the Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF). We also conclude that photon fusion is
the leading production mechanism to be considered for direct monopole searches
at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).
