Carbon nanotube (CNT) Josephson junctions in the open quantum dot limit
exhibit superconducting switching currents which can be controlled with a gate
electrode. Shapiro voltage steps can be observed under radiofrequency current
excitations, with a damping of the phase dynamics that strongly depends on the
gate voltage. These measurements are described by a standard RCSJ model showing
that the switching currents from the superconducting to the normal state are
close to the critical current of the junction. The effective dynamical
capacitance of the nanotube junction is found to be strongly gate-dependent,
suggesting a diffusive contact of the nanotube.
