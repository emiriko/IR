(Abridged) I report new light curves and determine the rotations and phase
functions of several large Kuiper Belt objects, including the dwarf planet Eris
(2003 UB313). (120348) 2004 TY364 shows a light curve which if double-peaked
has a period of 11.70+-0.01 hours and peak-to-peak amplitude of 0.22+-0.02
magnitudes. (84922) 2003 VS2 has a well defined double-peaked light curve of
7.41+-0.02 hours with a 0.21+-0.02 magnitude range. (126154) 2001 YH140 shows
variability of 0.21+-0.04 magnitudes with a possible 13.25+-0.2 hour
single-peaked period. The seven new KBOs in the sample which show no
discernible variations within the uncertainties on short rotational time scales
are 2001 UQ18, (55565) 2002 AW197, (119979) 2002 WC19, (120132) 2003 FY128,
(136108) Eris 2003 UB313, (90482) Orcus 2004 DW, and (90568) 2004 GV9. The
three medium to large sized Kuiper Belt objects 2004 TY364, Orcus and 2004 GV9
show fairly steep linear phase curves (~0.18 to 0.26 mags per degree) between
phase angles of 0.1 and 1.5 degrees. The extremely large dwarf planet Eris
(2003 UB313) shows a shallower phase curve (0.09+-0.03 mags per degree) which
is more similar to the other known dwarf planet Pluto. It appears the surface
properties of the largest dwarf planets in the Kuiper Belt maybe different than
the smaller Kuiper Belt objects. This may have to do with the larger objects
ability to hold more volatile ices as well as sustain atmospheres. The absolute
magnitudes obtained using the measured phase slopes are a few tenths of
magnitudes different from those given by the MPC.
