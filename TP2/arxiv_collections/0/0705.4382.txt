A first principles analysis of order-disorder transition in alloys shows that
ordering energy is a function of temperature due to thermal vibrations. The
inter-nuclear potential energy term converges if zero point vibrations are
incorporated and this method can replace the Ewald sum method. Core energy
contributions to the ordering energy are stored exclusively in superlattice
lines. The effect of electron-phonon interactions on ordering energy is of the
same order of magnitude as ordering energy near transition temperatures and
cannot be ignored. Ising model and variants are incorrect in explaining alloy
phase transitions as they ignore the role of electron-phonon interactions
without justification. A theoretical formalism that incorporates the
Debye-Waller Factor component of electron-phonon interactions in electronic
structure calculations already exists and must be adopted when modeling
temperature dependent phenomena. It is suggested that DWF correction will
account substantially for the discrepancy between experimental and theoretical
ordering energy in Ni3V. Thermal vibrations alter magnetic ordering energy at
finite temperatures. The role of electron-phonon interactions in alloy and
magnetic phase transitions cannot be ignored and must be incorporated in all
models. This will also ensure consistency with x-ray and electron diffraction
(alloy transitions) and neutron diffraction (magnetic transitions) results. An
isotope effect is predicted for (magnetic) phase transitions if the transition
temperature is below Debye temperature. Recent observations of an isotope
effect in magnetic phase transitions confirm our above conclusions and imply
that the role of electron-phonon interactions must be incorporated in all
theories and models of magnetism to avoid contradictions.
