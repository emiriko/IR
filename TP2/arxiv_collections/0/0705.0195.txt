The temperature variation effect of shape anisotropy on the coercivity,
HC(T), for the aligned Stoner-Wohlfarth (SW) soft ferromagnets, such as fcc Ni,
fcc Co and bcc Fe, are investigated within the framework of Neel-Brown (N-B)
analysis. An extended N-B equation is thus proposed,by introducing a single
dimensionless correction function, the reduced magnetization, m(\tao) =
MS(T)/MS(0), in which \tao = T/TC is the reduced temperature, MS(T) is the
saturation magnetization, and TC is the Curie temperature. The factor, m(\tao),
accounts for the temperature-dependent effect of the shape anisotropy. The
constants, H0 and E0, are for the switching field at zero temperature and the
potential barrier at zero field, respectively. According to this newly derived
equation, the blocking temperature above which the properties of
superparamagnetism show up is described by the expression, TB =
E0m^2(\tao)/[kBln(t/t0)], with the extra correction factor m^2(\tao). The
possible effect on HC(T) and the blocking temperature, TB, attributed to the
downshift of TC resulting from the finite size effect has been discussed also.
