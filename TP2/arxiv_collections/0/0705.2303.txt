We investigate the optical properties of one-dimensional (1D) dimerized Mott
insulators using the 1D dimerized extended Hubbard model. Numerical
calculations and a perturbative analysis from the decoupled-dimer limit clarify
that there are three relevant classes of charge-transfer (CT) states generated
by photoexcitation: interdimer CT unbound states, interdimer CT exciton states,
and intradimer CT exciton states. This classification is applied to
understanding the optical properties of an organic molecular material,
1,3,5-trithia-2,4,6-triazapentalenyl (TTTA), which is known for its
photoinduced transition from the dimerized spin-singlet phase to the regular
paramagnetic phase. We conclude that the lowest photoexcited state of TTTA is
the interdimer CT exciton state and the second lowest state is the intradimer
CT exciton state.
