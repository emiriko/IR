We study the Planck scale effects on Jarlskog determinant. Quantum
gravitational (Planck scale) effects lead to an effective SU(2)_{L}\times U(1)
invariant dimension-5 Lagrangian involving neutrino and Higgs fields, which
gives rise to additional terms in neutrino mass matrix on electroweak symmetry
breaking. We assume that gravitational interaction is flavor blind and compute
the Jarlskog determinant due to the Planck scale effects. In the case of
neutrino sector, the strength of CP violation is measured by Jarlskog
determinant. In this paper, we assume CP violation arise from Planck scale
effects. We applied our approach to study Jarlskog determinant due to the
Planck scale effects.
