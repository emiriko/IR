We analyze the $\gamma p \to \eta p$ process from threshold up to 1.2 GeV,
employing an effective Lagrangian approach that allows for a mixing of eta
couplings of pseudoscalar and pseudovector nature. The mixing ratio of the
couplings may serve as a quantitative estimation of the $SU_L(3)\times SU_R(3)$
extended chiral symmetry violation in this energy regime. The data analyzed
(differential cross sections and asymmetries) show a preference for the
pseudoscalar coupling
  -- 91% of pseudoscalar coupling component for the best fit. We stress that a
more conclusive answer to this question requires a more complete
electromagnetic multipole database than the presently available one.
