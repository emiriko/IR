Hartman and Nissim-Sabat have argued that Mach's idea of the relativity of
rotational motion suffers from internal inconsistencies and leads to a
contradiction that there cannot be a stationary bucket in a rotating universe.
They also claimed that non-inertial electromagnetic and stellar aberration
observations can distinguish between a rotating and a stationary universe,
whereas according to Mach there cannot be any observable way to distinguish
these two cases. We contest these objections.
