Although conservation of energy is fundamental in physics, its principles
seem to be violated in the field of wave propagation in turbid media by the
energy enhancement of the coherent backscattering cone. In this letter we
present experimental data which show that the energy enhancement of the cone is
balanced by an energy cutback at all scattering angles. Moreover, we give a
complete theoretical description, which is in good agreement with these data.
The additional terms needed to enforce energy conservation in this description
result from an interference effect between incident and multiply scattered
waves, which is reminiscent of the optical theorem in single scattering.
