A quantum algorithm is a set of instructions for a quantum computer, however,
unlike algorithms in classical computer science their results cannot be
guaranteed. A quantum system can undergo two types of operation, measurement
and quantum state transformation, operations themselves must be unitary
(reversible). Most quantum algorithms involve a series of quantum state
transformations followed by a measurement. Currently very few quantum
algorithms are known and no general design methodology exists for their
construction.
