In this paper we estimate the influence of nonlinear gluon evolution in the
production of prompt photons at the LHC pp collider. We assume the validity of
collinear factorization and consider the EHKQS parton distributions, which are
solutions of the GLR-MQ evolution equations and describe quite well the DESY
$ep$ HERA data, as input in our calculations. We find that both single and
double photon production are enhanced for low-$p_T$ photons and central
rapidities, while this effect is absent for the high-$p_T$ photons. The
implications of this effect for the Quark-Gluon Plasma searches and for the QCD
background to Higgs are also discussed.
