In this Letter, we present a physical scheme for implementing the discrete
quantum Fourier transform in a coupled semiconductor double quantum dot system.
The main controlled-R gate operation can be decomposed into many simple and
feasible unitary transformations. The current scheme would be a useful step
towards the realization of complex quantum algorithms in the quantum dot
system.
