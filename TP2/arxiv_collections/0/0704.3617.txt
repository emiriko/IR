We present an atlas of the central regions of 75 Seyfert galaxies imaged in
the near-UV with the Advanced Camera for Surveys of the Hubble Space Telescope
at an average resolution of ~10pc. These data complement archival high
resolution data from the Space Telescope at optical and near-IR wavelengths,
creating an extremely valuable dataset for astronomers with a broad range of
scientific interests. Our goal is to investigate the nature of the near-UV
light in these objects, its relation to the circumnuclear starburst phenomenon,
and the connection of this to the evolution and growth of the galaxy bulge and
central black hole. In this paper, we describe the near-UV morphology of the
objects and characterize the near-UV emission. We estimate the size and the
luminosity of the emitting regions and extract the luminosity profile. We also
determine the presence of unresolved compact nuclei. In addition, the
circumnuclear stellar cluster population is identified, and the contribution of
the stellar clusters to the total light, at this wavelength, is estimated. The
size of the sample allows us to draw robust statistical conclusions. We find
that {Seyfert 1} galaxies are completely dominated by its bright and compact
nucleus, that remains point-like at this resolution, while we find almost no
unresolved nucleus in Seyfert 2. The Seyfert types 1 and 2 are quite segregated
in an asymmetry vs compactness plot. Stellar clusters are found somewhat more
frequently in Sy2 (in ~70% of the galaxies) than in Sy1 (~57%), and contribute
more to the total light in Sy2, but this two differences seem to be mostly due
to the large contribution of the compact nucleus in Sy1, as the luminosity
distribution of the clusters is similar in both Sy types.
