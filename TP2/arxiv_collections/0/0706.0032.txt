We study the photo-association of Bose-Einstein condensed atoms into
molecules using an optical cavity field. The driven cavity field introduces a
new dynamical degree of freedom into the photoassociation process, whose role
in determining the stationary behavior has not previously been considered. The
semiclassical stationary solutions for the atom and molecules as well as the
intracavity field are found and their stability and scaling properties are
determined in terms of experimentally controllable parameters including driving
amplitude of the cavity and the nonlinear interactions between atoms and
molecules. For weak cavity driving, we find a bifurcation in the atom and
molecule number occurs that signals a transition from a stable steady state to
nonlinear Rabi oscillations. For a strongly driven cavity, there exists
bistability in the atom and molecule number.
