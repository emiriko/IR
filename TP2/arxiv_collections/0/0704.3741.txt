We present time-resolved photoluminescence measurements on two series of
oligo-p-phenylenevinylene materials that self-assemble into supramolecular
nanostructures with thermotropic reversibility in dodecane. One set of
derivatives form chiral, helical stacks while the second set form less
organised, frustrated stacks. Here we study the effects of supramolecular
organisation on the resonance energy transfer rates. We measure these rates in
nanoassemblies formed with mixed blends of oligomers and compare them with the
rates predicted by Foerster theory. Our results and analysis show that control
of supramolecular order in the nanometre lengthscale has a dominant effect on
the efficiency and dimentionality of resonance energy transfer.
