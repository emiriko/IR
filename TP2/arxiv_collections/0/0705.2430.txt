We discuss massive scalar perturbations of a Schwarzschild black hole. We
argue that quantum effects alter the effective potential near the horizon
resulting in Poincare recurrences in Green functions. Results at the
semi-classical level are independent of the details of the modification of the
potential provided its minimum near the horizon is inversely proportional to
the square of the Poincare time. This modification may be viewed as a change in
the near-horizon geometry. We consider explicitly the examples of a brick wall,
a smooth cutoff and a wormhole-like modification showing that they all lead to
the same results at leading order.
