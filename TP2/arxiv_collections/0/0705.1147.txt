The transverse broadening of jets produced in deep-inelastic scattering (DIS)
off a large nucleus is studied in the collinear limit. A class of medium
enhanced higher twist corrections are re-summed to calculate the transverse
momentum distribution of the produced collinear jet. In contrast to previous
approaches, resummation of the leading length enhanced higher twist corrections
is shown to lead to a two dimensional diffusion equation for the transverse
momentum of the propagating jet. Results for the average transverse momentum
obtained from this approach are then compared to the broadening expected from a
classical Langevin analysis for the propagation of the jet under the action of
the fluctuating color Lorentz force inside the nucleons. The set of
approximations that lead to identical results from the two approaches are
outlined. The relationship between the momentum diffusion constant $D$ and the
transport coefficient $\hat{q}$ is explicitly derived.
