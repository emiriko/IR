A new necessary minimality condition for the Mumford-Shah functional is
derived by means of second order variations. It is expressed in terms of a sign
condition for a nonlocal quadratic form on $H^1_0(\Gamma)$, $\Gamma$ being a
submanifold of the regular part of the discontinuity set of the critical point.
Two equivalent formulations are provided: one in terms of the first eigenvalue
of a suitable compact operator, the other involving a sort of nonlocal capacity
of $\Gamma$. A sufficient condition for minimality is also deduced. Finally, an
explicit example is discussed, where a complete characterization of the domains
where the second variation is nonnegative can be given.
