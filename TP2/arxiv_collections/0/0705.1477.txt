In 1981, David Mermin described a cleverly simplified version of Bell's
theorem. It pointed out in a straightforward way that interpreting entanglement
from a local realist point of view can be problematic. I propose here an
extended version of Mermin's device that can actually be given a simple local
realist interpretation through a sample selection bias, and I argue that we
still have no scientific reason to believe that the moon could possibly not be
there when nobody looks.
