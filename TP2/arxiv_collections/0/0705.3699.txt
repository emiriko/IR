One of the options for creating a Deep Underground Science and Engineering
Laboratory (DUSEL) is a site in the Mt. Stuart batholith, a granodiorite and
tonalite rock mass in the Cascade mountain range in Washington State. The
batholith's 100-year history in hard-rock tunneling includes the construction
of the longest and deepest tunnels in the U.S., the parallel Cascade and
Pioneer tunnels. The laboratory plan would utilize these two tunnels to produce
a laboratory that has many desirable features, including dedicated, clean,
horizontal access, container-module transport, and low operations costs.
Various aspects of the site help to reduce geotechnical, environmental, and
safety risks.
