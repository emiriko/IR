We develop our novel model of cosmology based on the Bose-Einstein
condensation. This model unifies the Dark Energy and the Dark Matter, and
predicts multiple collapse of condensation, followed by the final acceleration
regime of cosmic expansion. We first explore the generality of this model,
especially the constraints on the boson mass and condensation conditions. We
further argue the robustness of this model over the wide range of parameters of
mass, self coupling constant and the condensation rate. Then the dynamics of
BEC collapse and the preferred scale of the collapse are studied. Finally, we
describe possible observational tests of our model, especially, the periodicity
of the collapses and the gravitational wave associated with them.
