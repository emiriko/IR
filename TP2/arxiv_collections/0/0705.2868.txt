The family of metric operators, constructed by Musumbu {\sl et al} (2007 {\sl
J. Phys. A: Math. Theor.} {\bf 40} F75), for a harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian
augmented by a non-Hermitian $\cal PT$-symmetric part, is re-examined in the
light of an su(1,1) approach. An alternative derivation, only relying on
properties of su(1,1) generators, is proposed. Being independent of the
realization considered for the latter, it opens the way towards the
construction of generalized non-Hermitian (not necessarily $\cal PT$-symmetric)
oscillator Hamiltonians related by similarity to Hermitian ones. Some examples
of them are reviewed.
