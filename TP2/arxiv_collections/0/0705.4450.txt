Equation for evolution of the four-component Stokes vector in weakly
anisotropic and smoothly inhomogeneous media is derived on the basis of
quasi-isotropic approximation of the geometrical optics method, which provides
consequent asymptotic solution of Maxwell equations. Our equation generalizes
previous results, obtained for the normal propagation of electromagnetic waves
in stratified media. It is valid for curvilinear rays with torsion and is
capable to describe normal modes conversion in the inhomogeneous media.
Remarkably, evolution of the Stokes vector is described by the
Bargmann-Michel-Telegdi equation for relativistic spin precession, whereas the
equation for the three-component Stokes vector resembles the Landau-Lifshitz
equation for spin precession in ferromegnetic systems. General theory is
applied for analysis of polarization evolution in a magnetized plasma. We also
emphasize fundamental features of the non-Abelian polarization evolution in
anisotropic inhomogeneous media and illustrate them by simple examples.
