The electron transport in inhomogeneous quasi-one-dimensional conducting
channels on the liquid helium surface are studied in the temperature range
0.6-1.5 K. Inhomogeneities are created by charging the substrate on which the
conducting channels are formed. It has been established that the electron
conductivity practically does not depend on temperature at some substrate
charge. The results obtained are explained by localization of carriers and
creation of electron polarons.
