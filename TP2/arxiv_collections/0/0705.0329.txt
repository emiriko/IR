We exploit theoretical results on the meson spectrum within the framework of
a Bethe-Salpeter (BS) formalism adjusted for QCD, in order to extract an
``experimental'' coupling \alpha_s^{exp}(Q^2) below 1 GeV by comparison with
the data. Our results for \alpha_s^{exp}(Q^2) exhibit a good agreement with the
infrared safe Analytic Perturbation Theory (APT) coupling from 1 GeV down to
200 MeV. As a main result, we claim that the combined BS-APT theoretical scheme
provides us with a rather satisfactory correlated understanding of very high
and low energy phenomena.
