We report on the measurement of element-specific magnetic resonance spectra
at gigahertz frequencies using x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD). We
investigate the ferrimagnetic precession of Gd and Fe ions in Gd-substituted
Yttrium Iron Garnet, showing that the resonant field and linewidth of Gd
precisely coincide with Fe up to the nonlinear regime of parametric
excitations. The opposite sign of the Gd x-ray magnetic resonance signal with
respect to Fe is consistent with dynamic antiferromagnetic alignment of the two
ionic species. Further, we investigate a bilayer metal film,
Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$(5 nm)/Ni(50 nm), where the coupled resonance modes of Ni and
Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$ are separately resolved, revealing shifts in the resonance
fields of individual layers but no mutual driving effects. Energy-dependent
dynamic XMCD measurements are introduced, combining x-ray absorption and
magnetic resonance spectroscopies.
