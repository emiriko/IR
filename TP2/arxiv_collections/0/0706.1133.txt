Motivated by recent experimental results on charm physics we investigate
implications of the updated constraints of new physics in rare charm meson
decays. We first reconsider effects of the MSSM in $c\to u \gamma$ constrained
by the recent experimental evidence on $\Delta m_D$ and find, that due to the
dominance of long distance physics, $D \to V \gamma$ decay rates cannot be
modified by MSSM contributions. Then we consider effects of the extra heavy up
vector-like quark models on the decay spectrum of $D^+ \to \pi^+ l^+ l^-$ and
$D_s^+ \to K^+ l^+ l^-$ decays. We find a possibility for the tiny increase of
the differential decay rate in the region of large dilepton mass. The R-parity
violating supersymmetric model can also modify short distance dynamics in $c
\to u l^+ l^-$ decays. We constrain relevant parameters using current upper
bound on the $D^+ \to \pi^+ l^+ l^-$ decay rate and investigate impact of that
constraint on the $D_s^+ \to K^+ l^+ l^-$ differential decay dilepton
distribution. Present bounds still allow small modification of the standard
model differential decay rate distribution.
