Higgs algebras are used to construct rotational Hamiltonians. The
correspondence between the spectrum of a triaxial rotor and the spectrum of a
cubic Higgs algebra is demonstrated. It is shown that a suitable choice of the
parameters of the polynomial algebra allows for a precise identification of
rotational properties. The harmonic limit is obtained by a contraction of the
algebra, leading to a linear symmetry.
