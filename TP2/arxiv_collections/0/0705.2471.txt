We investigate a Lie algebra-type $ \kappa$-deformed Minkowski space-time
with undeformed Lorentz algebra and mutually commutative vector-like Dirac
derivatives. There are infinitely many realizations of $ \kappa$-Minkowski
space. The coproduct and the star product corresponding to each of them are
found. Utilizing the properties of the {\em{natural}} realization, we construct
a scalar field theory on $ \kappa$-deformed Minkowski space and show that it is
equivalent to the scalar, nonlocal, relativistically invariant field theory on
the ordinary Minkowski space.
