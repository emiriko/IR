Synchrotron X-ray diffraction patterns were measured and analyzed for a
polycrystalline sample of the room-temperature ferromagnet Sr3.12Er0.88Co4O10.5
from 300 to 650 K, from which two structural phase transitions were found to
occur successively. The higher-temperature transition at 509 K is driven by
ordering of the oxygen vacancies, which is closely related to the metallic
state at high temperatures. The lower-temperature transition at 360 K is of
first order, at which the ferromagnetic state suddenly appears with exhibiting
a jump in magnetization and resistivity. Based on the refined structure,
possible spin and orbital models for the magnetic order are proposed.
