The paper deals with the study of labor market dynamics, and aims to
characterize its equilibriums and possible trajectories. The theoretical
background is the theory of the segmented labor market. The main idea is that
this theory is well adapted to interpret the observed trajectories, due to the
heterogeneity of the work situations.
