We study the flow response to an externally imposed homogeneous magnetic
field in a turbulent swirling flow of liquid sodium -- the VKS2 experiment in
which magnetic Reynolds numbers Rm up to 50 are reached. Induction effects are
larger than in the former VKS1 experiment. At Rm larger than about 25, the
local amplitude of induced field components supersedes that of the applied
field, and exhibits non-Gaussian fluctuations. Slow dynamical instationarities
and low-frequency bimodal dynamics are observed in the induction, presumably
tracing back to large scale fluctuations in the hydrodynamic flow.
