The spectrum of the normalized graph Laplacian yields a very comprehensive
set of invariants of a graph. In order to understand the information contained
in those invariants better, we systematically investigate the behavior of this
spectrum under local and global operations like motif doubling, graph joining
or splitting. The eigenvalue 1 plays a particular role, and we therefore
emphasize those constructions that change its multiplicity in a controlled
manner, like the iterated duplication of nodes.
