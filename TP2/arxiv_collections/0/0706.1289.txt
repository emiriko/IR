We revisit our earlier work on the AKSZ formulation of topological sigma
model on generalized complex manifolds, or Hitchin model. We show that the
target space geometry geometry implied by the BV master equations is
Poisson--quasi--Nijenhuis geometry recently introduced and studied by Sti\'enon
and Xu (in the untwisted case). Poisson--quasi--Nijenhuis geometry is more
general than generalized complex geometry and comprises it as a particular
case. Next, we show how gauging and reduction can be implemented in the Hitchin
model. We find that the geometry resulting form the BV master equation is
closely related to but more general than that recently described by Lin and
Tolman, suggesting a natural framework for the study of reduction of
Poisson--quasi--Nijenhuis manifolds.
