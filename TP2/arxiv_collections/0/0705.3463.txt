In an ensemble of non-interacting Brownian particles, a finite systematic
average velocity may temporarily develop, even if it is zero initially. The
effect originates from a small nonlinear correction to the dissipative force,
causing the equation for the first moment of velocity to couple to moments of
higher order. The effect may be relevant when a complex system dissociates in a
viscous medium with conservation of momentum.
