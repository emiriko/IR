We evaluate the predictive power of the neutrino mass matrices arising from
seesaw mechanism subjected to texture zero and satisfying a cyclic permutation
invariant. We found that only two from eight possible patterns of the neutrino
mass matrices are invariant under a cyclic permutation. The two resulted
neutrino mass matrices which are invariant under a cyclic permutation can be
used qualitatively to explain the neutrino mixing phenomena for solar neutrino
and to derive the mixing angle that agress with the experimental data.
