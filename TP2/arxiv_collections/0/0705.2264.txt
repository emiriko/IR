Based on the S-R indeterminacy relations in conjugation with the partial
transposition, we derive a class of inequalities for detecting entanglement in
several tripartite systems, including bosonic, SU(2), and SU(1,1) systems.
These inequalities are in general stronger than those based on the usual
Heisenberg relations for detecting entanglement. We also discuss the reduction
from SU(2) and SU(1,1) to bosonic systems and the generalization to
multipartite case.
