Production of $D_{sJ}$(2317) mesons in relativistic heavy ion collisions at
RHIC is studied. Using the quark coalescence model, we first determine the
initial number of $D_{sJ}$(2317) mesons produced during hadronization of
created quark-gluon plasma. The predicted $D_{sJ}$(2317) abundance depends
sensitively on the quark structure of the $D_{sJ}$(2317) meson. An
order-of-magnitude larger yield is obtained for a conventional two-quark than
for an exotic four-quark $D_{sJ}$(2317) meson. To include the hadronic effect
on the $D_{sJ}$(2317) meson yield, we have evaluated the absorption cross
sections of the $D_{sJ}$(2317) meson by pion, rho, anti-kaon, and vector
anti-kaon in a phenomenological hadronic model. Taking into consideration the
absorption and production of $D_{sJ}$(2317) mesons during the hadronic stage of
heavy ion collisions via a kinetic model, we find that the final yield of
$D_{sJ}$(2317) mesons remains sensitive to its initial number produced from the
quark-gluon plasma, providing thus the possibility of studying the quark
structure of the $D_{sJ}$(2317) meson and its production mechanism in
relativistic heavy ion collisions.
