We present general analytical expressions of Stokes and anti-Stokes spectral
photon-flux densities that are spontaneously generated by a single
monochromatic pump wave propagating in a single-mode optical fiber. We validate
our results by comparing them with experimental data. Limiting cases of the
general expressions corresponding to interesting physical situations are
discussed.
