UBVRI photoelectric observations have been made of 109 stars around the sky,
centered more or less at -50 degrees declination. The majority of the stars
fall in the magnitude range 10.4 < V < 15.5 and in the color index range -0.33
< (B - V) < +1.66. These new broadband photometric standard stars average 16.4
measurements each from data taken on 116 different nights over a period of 4
yr. Similar data are tabulated for 19 stars of interest that were not observed
often enough to make them well-defined standard stars.
