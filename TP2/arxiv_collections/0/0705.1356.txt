Recycled dwarf galaxies can form in the collisional debris of massive
galaxies. Theoretical models predict that, contrary to classical galaxies, they
should be free of non-baryonic Dark Matter. Analyzing the observed gas
kinematics of such recycled galaxies with the help of a numerical model, we
demonstrate that they do contain a massive dark component amounting to about
twice the visible matter. Staying within the standard cosmological framework,
this result most likely indicates the presence of large amounts of unseen,
presumably cold, molecular gas. This additional mass should be present in the
disks of their progenitor spiral galaxies, accounting for a significant part of
the so-called missing baryons.
