We prove that the nonlocal gauge invariant mass dimension two operator
$F_{\mu\nu} (D^2)^{-1} F_{\mu\nu}$ can be consistently added to the
Gribov-Zwanziger action, which implements the restriction of the path
integral's domain of integration to the first Gribov region when the Landau
gauge is considered. We identify a local polynomial action and prove the
renormalizability to all orders of perturbation theory by employing the
algebraic renormalization formalism. Furthermore, we also pay attention to the
breaking of the BRST invariance, and to the consequences that this has for the
Slavnov-Taylor identity.
