We present a new code for calculating the Fe Kalpha line profiles from
relativistic accretion disks with finite thickness around a rotating black
hole. The thin Keplerian accretion disk must become thicker and sub-Keplerian
with increasing accretion rates. We here embark on, for the first time, a fully
relativistic computation which is aimed at gaining an insight into the effects
of geometrical thickness and the sub-Keplerian orbital velocity on the line
profiles. This code is also well-suited to produce accretion disk images.
