Unparticles proposed by Georgi carry CP conserving phases in their
propagators. We demonstrate that these peculiar phases have an important impact
on CP violation. Without including the strong QCD phases, we study the
unparticle phase effects on the direct CP asymmetries in the exclusive decays
of $\bar B_d\to \pi^{+} \pi^{-}$ and $B\to \pi K$, in which the flavor changing
neutral currents are forbidden at tree level but induced by one-loop diagrams.
Interesting and consistent results comparing to the data are obtained. In
addition, we find that unparticles will significantly enhance the differential
branching ratio of $b\to s \ell^{+} \ell^{-}$ at the small invariant mass of
$\ell^{+} \ell^{-}$. The forward-backward asymmetries for $b\to s \ell^{+}
\ell^{-}$ due to unparticles are also explored.
