The influence of nonmagnetic central node defect on dynamical properties of
regular square-shaped 5 x 5 segment of magnetic dot array under the thermal
activation is investigated via computer simulations. Using stochastic
Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation we simulate hysteresis and relaxation
processes. The remarkable quantitative and qualitative differences between
magnetic dot arrays with nonmagnetic central node defect and magnetic dot
arrays without defects have been found.
