We present a general strategy that allows a more flexible method for the
construction of fully additive multipartite entanglement monotones than the
ones so far reported in the literature of axiomatic entanglement measures.
Within this framework we give a proof of a conjecture of outstanding
implications in information theory: the full additivity of the Entanglement of
Formation.
