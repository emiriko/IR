The spontaneous emergence of enhanced responses and local orders are
properties often associated with complex matter where nonlinearities and
spatial inhomogeneities dominate. We discuss these phenomena in quantum devices
realized with superconducting Josephson junction networks and cold atoms in
optical lattices. We evidence how the pertinent engineering of the network's
shape induces the enhancement of the zero-voltage Josephson critical currents
in superconducting arrays as well as the emergence of spatially localized
condensates for cold atoms in inhomogeneous optical lattices.
