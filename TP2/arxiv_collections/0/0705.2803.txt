This paper investigates the sound production in a system made of a bore
coupled with a reed valve. Extending previous work (Debut, 2004), the input
impedance of the bore is projected on the modes of the air column. The acoustic
pressure is therefore calculated as the sum of modal components. The
airr&#114;&#64258;ow blown into the bore is modulated by reed motion, assuming
the reed to be a single degree of freedom oscillator. Calculation of
self-sustained oscillations controlled by time-varying mouth pressure and
player's embouchure parameter is performed using ODE solvers. Results emphasize
the par ticipation of the whole set of components in the mode locking process.
Another impor tant feature is the mutual inn&#110;&#64258;uence of reed and
bore resonance during growing blowing pressure transients, oscillation
threshold being altered by the reed natural frequency and the reed damping.
Steady-state oscillations are also investigated and compared with results given
by harmonic balance method and by digital sound synthesis.
