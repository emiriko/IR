We discuss the energy loss of energetic parton jets in quark-gluon plasma
above the deconfinement temperature $T_c$ by the interaction with scalar and
pseudoscalar glueballs. It is shown that the loss by this mechanism is quite
important and may play the important role of the observed jet-quenching.
