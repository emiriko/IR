We introduce two algorithms for accurately evaluating powers to a positive
integer in floating-point arithmetic, assuming a fused multiply-add (fma)
instruction is available. We show that our log-time algorithm always produce
faithfully-rounded results, discuss the possibility of getting correctly
rounded results, and show that results correctly rounded in double precision
can be obtained if extended-precision is available with the possibility to
round into double precision (with a single rounding).
