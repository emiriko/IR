A Higgs boson produced in association with one or more bottom quarks is of
great theoretical and experimental interest to the high-energy community. A
precise prediction of its total and differential cross-section can have a great
impact on the discovery of a Higgs boson with large bottom-quark Yukawa
coupling, like the scalar (h^0 and H^0) and pseudoscalar (A^0) Higgs bosons of
the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) in the region of large
\tan\beta. In this paper we apply the threshold resummation formalism to
determine both differential and total cross-sections for b g \to b\Phi (where
\Phi = h^0, H^0), including up to next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (NNNLO)
soft plus virtual QCD corrections at next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL)
accuracy. We present results for both the Fermilab Tevatron and the CERN Large
Hadron Collider (LHC).
