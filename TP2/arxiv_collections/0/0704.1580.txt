We study Gaussian valence bond states of continuous variable systems,
obtained as the outputs of projection operations from an ancillary space of M
infinitely entangled bonds connecting neighboring sites, applied at each of $N$
sites of an harmonic chain. The entanglement distribution in Gaussian valence
bond states can be controlled by varying the input amount of entanglement
engineered in a (2M+1)-mode Gaussian state known as the building block, which
is isomorphic to the projector applied at a given site. We show how this
mechanism can be interpreted in terms of multiple entanglement swapping from
the chain of ancillary bonds, through the building blocks. We provide optical
schemes to produce bisymmetric three-mode Gaussian building blocks (which
correspond to a single bond, M=1), and study the entanglement structure in the
output Gaussian valence bond states. The usefulness of such states for quantum
communication protocols with continuous variables, like telecloning and
teleportation networks, is finally discussed.
