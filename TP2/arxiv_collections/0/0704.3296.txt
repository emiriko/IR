In the present paper the problem of the radiative association of atoms of
carbon C with electrons $e^{-}$ for kinetic temperatures $T_{c}$ of $100 <
T_{c} < 3000$ K is considered. The calculation of the rate rate constant of the
radiative associations is made with principle of detailed balance. It is shown
that the rate has correct behavior (it increase with the temperature) and its
behavior is look-like that for the $H^{-}$ formation rate coefficient, which
also increase with the temperature.
