While observational cosmology has recently progressed fast, it revealed a
serious dilemma called dark energy: an unknown source of exotic energy with
negative pressure driving a current accelerating phase of the universe. All
attempts so far to find a convincing theoretical explanation have failed, so
that one of the last hopes is the yet to be developed quantum theory of
gravity. In this article, loop quantum gravity is considered as a candidate,
with an emphasis on properties which might play a role for the dark energy
problem. Its basic feature is the discrete structure of space, often associated
with quantum theories of gravity on general grounds. This gives rise to
well-defined matter Hamiltonian operators and thus sheds light on conceptual
questions related to the cosmological constant problem. It also implies typical
quantum geometry effects which, from a more phenomenological point of view, may
result in dark energy. In particular the latter scenario allows several
non-trivial tests which can be made more precise by detailed observations in
combination with a quantitative study of numerical quantum gravity. If the
speculative possibility of a loop quantum gravitational origin of dark energy
turns out to be realized, a program as outlined here will help to hammer out
our ideas for a quantum theory of gravity, and at the same time allow
predictions for the distant future of our universe.
