The properties of inhomogeneous nuclear matter are investigated considering
the self-consistent Skyrme Hartree-Fock approach with inclusion of pairing
correlations. For a comparison we also consider a relativistic mean field
approach. The inhomogeneous infinite matter is described in terms of cubic
Wigner-Seitz cells, which leads to a smooth transition to the limit of
homogeneous nuclear matter. The possible existence of various structures in the
so-called pasta phase is investigated within this self-consistent approach and
a comparison is made to results obtained within the Thomas-Fermi approximation.
Results for the proton abundances and the pairing properties are discussed for
densities for which clustering phenomena are obtained.
