We prove a dynamical version of the Mordell-Lang conjecture for subvarieties
of the affine space A^g over a p-adic field, endowed with polynomial actions on
each coordinate of A^g. We use analytic methods similar to the ones employed by
Skolem, Chabauty, and Coleman for studying diophantine equations.
