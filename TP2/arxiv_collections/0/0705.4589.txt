We prove the energy identity for min-max sequences of the Sacks-Uhlenbeck and
the biharmonic approximation of harmonic maps from surfaces into general target
manifolds. The proof relies on Hopf-differential type estimates for the two
approximations and on estimates for the concentration radius of bubbles.
