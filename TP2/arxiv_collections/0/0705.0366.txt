In a recent Letter (Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{98}, 083601 (2007),
arXiv:cond-mat/0610804), O. Assaf and E. Akkermans claim that the angular
correlations of the light intensity scattered by a cloud of cold atoms with
internal degeneracy (Zeeman sublevels) of the ground state overcome the usual
Rayleigh law. More precisely, they found that they become exponentially large
with the size of the sample. In what follows, we will explain why their results
are wrong and, in contrary, why the internal degeneracy leads to lower
intensity correlations.
