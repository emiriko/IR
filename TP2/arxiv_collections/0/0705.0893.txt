We predict the nature (attractive or repulsive) and range (exponentially
screened or long-range power law) of the electrostatic interactions of
oppositely charged and planar plates as a function of the salt concentration
and surface charge densities (whose absolute magnitudes are not necessarily
equal). An analytical expression for the crossover between attractive and
repulsive pressure is obtained as a function of the salt concentration. This
condition reduces to the high-salt limit of Parsegian and Gingell where the
interaction is exponentially screened and to the zero salt limit of Lau and
Pincus in which the important length scales are the inter-plate separation and
the Gouy-Chapman length. In the regime of low salt and high surface charges we
predict - for any ratio of the charges on the surfaces - that the attractive
pressure is long-ranged as a function of the spacing. The attractive pressure
is related to the decrease in counter-ion concentration as the inter-plate
distance is decreased. Our theory predicts several scaling regimes with
different scaling expressions for the pressure as function of salinity and
surface charge densities. The pressure predictions can be related to surface
force experiments of oppositely charged surfaces that are prepared by coating
one of the mica surfaces with an oppositely charged polyelectrolyte.
