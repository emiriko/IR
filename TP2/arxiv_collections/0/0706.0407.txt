We present two-dimensional Febry-Perot observations of emission-line
distribution and kinematics in nearly spiral galaxies. We have developed and
demonstrated the utility of a number of analysis tools which have general
applicability, but which we have, so far, applied to only one galaxy (M 74,
Fathi et al. 2007). In this galaxy, we have found kinematic signatures of
radial motions caused by an m=2 perturbation. Such a perturbation may well be
responsible for the inflow of material forming the nuclear ring and the inner
rapidly rotating disc-like structure. The latter, in turn, could help build a
pseudo-bulge. In the second paper in this series, we will apply the kinematic
analysis tools to a sample of 9 late-type spiral galaxies observed with the
FaNTOmM Fabry-Perot spectrometer at the Canada-France-Hawaii telescope.
