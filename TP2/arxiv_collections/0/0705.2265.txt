Data assimilation refers to the process of obtaining an estimate of a
system's state using a model for the system's time evolution and a time series
of measurements that are possibly noisy and incomplete. However, for practical
reasons, the high dimensionality of large spatiotemporally chaotic systems
prevents the use of classical data assimilation techniques. Here, via numerical
computations on the paradigmatic example of large aspect ratio Rayleigh-Benard
convection, we demonstrate the applicability of a recently developed data
assimilation method designed to circumvent this difficulty. In addition, we
describe extensions of the algorithm for estimating unknown system parameters.
Our results suggest the potential usefulness of our data assimilation technique
to a broad class of situations in which there is spatiotemporally chaotic
behavior.
