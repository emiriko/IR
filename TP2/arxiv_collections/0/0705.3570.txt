We reinvestigate the 2D problem of the inhomogeneous incipient infinite
cluster where, in an independent percolation model, the density decays to p_c
with an inverse power, \lambda, of the distance to the origin. Assuming the
existence of critical exponents (as is known in the case of the triangular site
lattice) if the power is less than 1/\nu, with \nu the correlation length
exponent, we demonstrate an infinite cluster with scale dimension given by
D_H=2-\beta\lambda. Further, we investigate the critical case \lambda_c=1/\nu
and show that iterated logarithmic corrections will tip the balance between the
possibility and impossibility of an infinite cluster.
