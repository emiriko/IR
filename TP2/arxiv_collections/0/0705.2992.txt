The paper 0705.0332v1 seeks to study the effect of non-trivial spatial
curvature in homogeneous and isotropic models. We note that the space
considered is not homogeneous, and that the equations of motion used are
inconsistent with the metric. Also, we explain why the spatial curvature of
homogeneous and isotropic spacetimes always evolves like 1/a^2, contrary to the
central assumption of 0705.0332v1.
