In Biology, all motor enzymes operate on the same principle: they trap
favourable brownian fluctuations in order to generate directed forces and to
move. Whether it is possible or not to copy one such strategy to play the
market was the starting point of our investigations. We found the answer is
yes. In this paper we describe one such strategy and appraise its performance
with historical data from the European Monetary System (EMS), the US Dow Jones,
the german Dax and the french Cac40.
