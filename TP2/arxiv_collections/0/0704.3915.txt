N-body simulations give us a rough idea of how the shape of a simulated
object appears in three-dimensional space. From an observational point of view
this may give us a misleading picture. The faint stars may be the most common
stars in the system but the morphological information obtained by observations
of an object may be dominated by the color properties of the bright stars. Due
to dynamical effects, such as energy equipartition, different masses of stars
may populate different regions in the object. Since stars are evolving in mass
the stellar evolution may also influence the dynamics of the system. Hence, if
one is interested in simulating what the morphology will look like through a
telescope, one needs to simulate in addition evolving stars and weight them by
their luminosity. Therefore we need to combine simulations of the dynamical
evolution and a stellar population synthesis at the same time. For the
dynamical evolution part we use a parallel version of a direct N-body code,
NBODY6++. This code also includes stellar evolution. We link the parameters
from this stellar evolution routine to the BaSeL 2.0 stellar library. For
isolated clusters we found results assimilable to standard stellar population
synthesis codes such as the PEGASE code. For clusters in a tidal field we found
that the integrated colors become relatively bluer due to energy equipartition
effects. In the time shortly before dissolution of the cluster the stellar M/L
ratio becomes lower compared to isolated clusters. We compared the results of
our simulations to integrated spectra of galactic globular clusters. For the
cluster NGC 1851 we found good agreement between simulation and observation.
For extragalactic clusters in M81 and M31 we looked at medium band spectral
energy distributions and found for some clusters also a good agreement.
