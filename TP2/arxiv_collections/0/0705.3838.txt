We study the symmetric-side-channel-assisted private capacity of a quantum
channel, for which we provide a single-letter formula. This capacity is
additive, convex, and, for degradable channels, equal to the unassisted private
capacity. While a channel's (unassisted) capacity for for private classical
communication may be strictly larger than its quantum capacity, we will show
that these capacities are equal for degradable channels, thus demonstrating the
equivalence of privacy and quantum coherence in this context. We use these
ideas to find new bounds on the key rate of quantum key distribution protocols
with one-way classical post-processing. For the Bennett-Brassard-84 (BB84)
protocol, our results demonstrate that collective attacks are strictly stronger
than individual attacks.
