We performed high-pressure transport measurements on high-quality single
crystals of KOs2O6, a beta-pyrochlore superconductor. While the resistivity at
high temperatures might approach saturation, there is no sign of saturation at
low temperatures, down to the superconducting phase. The anomalous resistivity
is accompanied by a nonmetallic behavior in the thermoelectric power (TEP) up
to temperatures of at least 700 K, which also exhibits a broad hump with a
maximum at 60 K. The pressure influences mostly the low-energy electronic
excitations. A simple band model based on enhanced density of states in a
narrow window around the Fermi energy (EF) explains the main features of this
unconventional behavior in the transport coefficients and its evolution under
pressure.
