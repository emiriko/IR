In this paper we show how the rescattering of CMB photons after cosmic
reionization can give a significant linear contribution to the
temperature-matter cross-correlation measurements. These anisotropies, which
arise via a late time Doppler effect, are on scales much larger than the
typical scale of non-linear effects at reionization; they can contribute to
degree scale cross-correlations and could affect the interpretation of similar
correlations resulting from the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect. While expected
to be small at low redshifts, these correlations can be large given a probe of
the density at high redshift, and so could be a useful probe of the cosmic
reionization history.
