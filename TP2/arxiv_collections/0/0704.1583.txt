Codes to compute mean opacities and radiative accelerations for arbitrary
chemical mixtures using the Opacity Project recently revised data have been
restructured in a client--server architecture and transcribed as a subroutine
library. This implementation increases efficiency in stellar modelling where
element stratification due to diffusion processes is depth dependent, and thus
requires repeated fast opacity reestimates. Three user modes are provided to
fit different computing environments, namely a web browser, a local workstation
and a distributed grid.
