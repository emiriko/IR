The quantum Markovian master equation of the reduced dynamics of a harmonic
oscillator coupled to a thermal reservoir is shown to possess thermal symmetry.
This symmetry is revealed by a Bogoliubov transformation that can be
represented by a hyperbolic rotation acting on the Liouville space of the
reduced dynamics. The Liouville space is obtained as an extension of the
Hilbert space through the introduction of tilde variables used in the
thermofield dynamics formalism. The angle of rotation depends on the
temperature of the reservoir, as well as the value of Planck's constant. This
symmetry relates the thermal states of the system at any two temperatures. This
includes absolute zero, at which purely quantum effects are revealed. The
Caldeira-Leggett equation and the classical Fokker-Planck equation also possess
thermal symmetry. We compare the thermal symmetry obtained from the Bogoliubov
transformation in related fields and discuss the effects of the symmetry on the
shape of a Gaussian wave packet.
