Vscape is an interactive tool for studying the one-loop effective potential
of an ungauged supersymmetric model of chiral multiplets. The program allows
the user to define a supersymmetric model by specifying the superpotential. The
F-terms and the scalar and fermionic mass matrices are calculated symbolically.
The program then allows you to search numerically for (meta)stable minima of
the one-loop effective potential. Additional commands enable you to further
study specific minima, by e.g. computing the mass spectrum for those vacua.
Vscape combines the flexibility of symbolic software, with the speed of a
numerical package.
