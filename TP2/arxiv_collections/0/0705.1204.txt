We calculate electron-hole generation and recombination rates for Coulomb
scattering (Auger recombination and impact ionization) in Graphene. The
conduction and valence band dispersion relation in Graphene together with
energy and momentum conservation requirements restrict the phase space for
Coulomb scattering so that electron-hole recombination times can be much longer
than 1 ps for electron-hole densities smaller than $10^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$.
