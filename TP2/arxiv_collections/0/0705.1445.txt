This article reports about a novel extension of dissipative particle dynamics
(DPD) that allows the study of the collective dynamics of complex chemical and
structural systems in a spatially resolved manner with a combinatorially
complex variety of different system constituents. We show that introducing
multipolar interactions between particles leads to extended membrane structures
emerging in a self-organized manner and exhibiting both the necessary
mechanical stability for transport and fluidity so as to provide a
two-dimensional self-organizing dynamic reaction environment for kinetic
studies in the context of cell biology. We further show that the emergent
dynamics of extended membrane bound objects is in accordance with scaling laws
imposed by physics.
