We present the full in-plane phonon dispersion of graphite obtained from
inelastic x-ray scattering, including the optical and acoustic branches, as
well as the mid-frequency range between the $K$ and $M$ points in the Brillouin
zone, where experimental data have been unavailable so far. The existence of a
Kohn anomaly at the $K$ point is further supported. We fit a fifth-nearest
neighbour force-constants model to the experimental data, making improved
force-constants calculations of the phonon dispersion in both graphite and
carbon nanotubes available.
