We make a systematic analysis of the XMM-Newton X-ray spectra of intermediate
polars (IPs) and find that, contrary to the traditional picture, most show a
soft blackbody component. We compare the results with those from AM Her stars
and deduce that the blackbody emission arises from reprocessing of hard X-rays,
rather than from the blobby accretion sometimes seen in AM Hers. Whether an IP
shows a blackbody component appears to depend primarily on geometric factors: a
blackbody is not seen in those that have accretion footprints that are always
obscured by accretion curtains or are only visible when foreshortened on the
white-dwarf limb. Thus we argue against previous suggestions that the blackbody
emission characterises a separate sub-group of IPs which are more akin to AM
Hers, and develop a unified picture of the blackbody emission in these stars.
