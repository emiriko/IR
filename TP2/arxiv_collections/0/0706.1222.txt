We present a semiclassical method to treat the proton breakup from a weakly
bound state in an exotic nucleus. The Coulomb interactions between the proton,
core and target are treated to all orders and including the full multipole
expansion of the Coulomb potential. The nuclear proton-target interaction is
also treated to all orders. The core-target interaction is included as an
absorption. The method is semi-analytical thus allowing for a detailed
understanding of the short range and long range effects of the interactions in
the reaction dynamics. It explains also the origin of possible asymmetries in
the core parallel momentum distributions when the full multipole expansion of
the Coulomb potential is used. Calculations are compared to results of other,
fully numerical, methods and to experimental data in order to establish the
accuracy and reliability of the method.
