The equations that govern the dynamics of the universe in the modified
unimodular theory of gravity are derived. We find a mechanism for inflation in
the early universe without postulating a false vacuum state during the first
$10^{-35}$ seconds after the Big Bang. In addition, we find a natural
explanation for the acceleration of the universe without resorting to dark
energy.
