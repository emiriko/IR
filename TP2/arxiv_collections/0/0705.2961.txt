The effects of interpreting classical phase space distributions as Wigner
functions, which is common in models of multiparticle production, are
discussed. The temperature for the classical description is always higher than
that for its Wigner function interpretation. A rough estimate shows that the
corresponding correction is proportional to R^(-2), where R is the radius of
the interaction region, and that it is negligible for heavy ion scattering, but
at the few percent level for e^+e^- annihilations.
