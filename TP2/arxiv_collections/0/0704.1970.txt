We present a study of thermoelectric coefficients in CeCoIn_5 down to 0.1 K
and up to 16 T in order to probe the thermoelectric signatures of quantum
criticality. In the vicinity of the field-induced quantum critical point, the
Nernst coefficient nu exhibits a dramatic enhancement without saturation down
to lowest measured temperature. The dimensionless ratio of Seebeck coefficient
to electronic specific heat shows a minimum at a temperature close to threshold
of the quasiparticle formation. Close to T_c(H), in the vortex-liquid state,
the Nernst coefficient behaves anomalously in puzzling contrast with other
superconductors and standard vortex dynamics.
