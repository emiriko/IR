Shor's powerful quantum algorithm for factoring represents a major challenge
in quantum computation and its full realization will have a large impact on
modern cryptography. Here we implement a compiled version of Shor's algorithm
in a photonic system using single photons and employing the non-linearity
induced by measurement. For the first time we demonstrate the core processes,
coherent control, and resultant entangled states that are required in a
full-scale implementation of Shor's algorithm. Demonstration of these processes
is a necessary step on the path towards a full implementation of Shor's
algorithm and scalable quantum computing. Our results highlight that the
performance of a quantum algorithm is not the same as performance of the
underlying quantum circuit, and stress the importance of developing techniques
for characterising quantum algorithms.
