For a simple model we derive analytic expressions of entropy exchange and
coherent information, from which relations between them and the concurrence are
drawn. We find that in the quantum evolution the entropy exchange exhibits
behavior \textsl{opposite} to that of the concurrence, whereas the coherent
information shows features very similar to those of the concurrence. The
meaning of this result for general systems is discussed.
