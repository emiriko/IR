The exclusive process ^3He(e,e^\prime p)^2H has been analyzed using realistic
few-body wave functions corresponding to the AV18 interaction and treating the
final state interaction (FSI) within the Eikonal Approximation to describe the
multiple rescattering of the struck nucleon with the nucleons of the spectator
two-nucleon system. Calculations have been performed in momentum space so that
the nucleon electromagnetic current could be left in the fully covariant form
avoiding by this way non relativistic reductions and the factorization
approximation. The results of calculations, which are compared with recent JLab
experimental data, show that the left-right asymmetry exhibit a clear
dependence upon the multiple scattering in the final state and demonstrate the
breaking down of the factorization approximation at \phi=0 i.e. for "negative"
and large \geq 300MeV/c values of the missing momentum.
