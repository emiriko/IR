The Einstein relation connecting the diffusion constant and the mobility is
violated beyond the linear response regime. For a colloidal particle driven
along a periodic potential imposed by laser traps, we test the recent
theoretical generalization of the Einstein relation to the non-equilibrium
regime which involves an integral over measurable velocity correlation
functions.
