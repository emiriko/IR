In SU(3) simplest little Higgs model, a characteristic particle is the light
pseudoscalar boson eta, it leads interesting signals in the LHC/ILC and is
studied in literature with different parameterizations. In this work, we show
that these different descriptions for eta particle are equivalent up to some
SU(3) rotations as long as we suitably redefine the pseudo Goldstone boson
fields. We evaluate the necessary SU(3) rotations and built up explicit
expressions for redefined fields.
