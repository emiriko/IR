We show that toroidal compactification of type II string theory to six
dimensions admits axionic euclidean wormhole solutions. These wormholes can be
inserted into $AdS_3 \times S^3 \times T^4$ backgrounds, which have a
well-defined CFT dual. AdS/CFT duality then suggests that the wormhole
solutions cannot be interpreted using $\alpha$ parameters as originally
suggested by Coleman.
