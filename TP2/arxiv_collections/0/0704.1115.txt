The recent parity-violating $ep$ forward-scattering elastic asymmetry data
from Jefferson Lab (HAPPEx and G0), when combined with the $\nu p$ elastic
cross section data from Brookhaven (E734), permit an extraction of the
strangeness contribution to the vector and axial nucleon form factors for
momentum transfers in the range $0.45 < Q^2 < 1.0$ GeV$^2$. These results,
combined with the recent determination of the strange vector form factors at
$Q^2 = 0.1$ GeV$^2$ (SAMPLE, HAPPEx, PVA4, G0) have been interpreted in terms
of $uuds\bar{s}$ configurations very different from the kaon-loop
configurations usually associated with strangeness in the nucleon. New
experiments are being proposed to improve the state of our knowledge of the
$\nu p$ elastic cross section -- these new experiments will push the range of
$Q^2$ to much lower values, and greatly increase the precision of the $\nu p$
elastic data. One outcome of this can be a measurement of the strangeness
contribution to the nucleon spin, $\Delta s$. Nuclear targets (e.g. C or Ar)
are to be used in these neutrino experiments, and so a deep understanding of
the nuclear physics, particularly in regard to final state effects, is needed
before the potential of these precision experiments can be fully realized.
