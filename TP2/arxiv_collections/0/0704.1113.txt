[Abridged] We have studied the optical spectra of 28 O- and early B-type
stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud, 22 of which are associated with the young
star-forming region N11. Stellar parameters are determined using an automated
fitting method, combining the stellar atmosphere code FASTWIND with the
genetic-algorithm optimisation routine PIKAIA. Results for stars in the LH9 and
LH10 associations of N11 are consistent with a sequential star formation
scenario, in which activity in LH9 triggered the formation of LH10. Our sample
contains four stars of spectral type O2, of which the hottest is found to be
~49-54 kK (cf. ~45-46 kK for O3 stars). The masses of helium-enriched dwarfs
and giants are systematically lower than those implied by non-rotating
evolutionary tracks. We interpret this as evidence for efficient
rotationally-enhanced mixing, leading to the surfacing of primary helium and to
an increase of the stellar luminosity. This result is consistent with findings
for SMC stars by Mokiem et al. For bright giants and supergiants no such
mass-discrepancy is found, implying that these stars follow tracks of modestly
(or non-)rotating objects. Stellar mass-loss properties were found to be
intermediate to those found in massive stars in the Galaxy and the SMC, and
comparisons with theoretical predictions at LMC metallicity yielded good
agreement over the luminosity range of our targets, i.e. 5.0 < log L/L(sun) <
6.1.
