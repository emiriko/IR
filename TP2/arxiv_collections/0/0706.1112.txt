The theory of optical dispersive shocks generated in propagation of light
beams through photorefractive media is developed. Full one-dimensional
analytical theory based on the Whitham modulation approach is given for the
simplest case of sharp step-like initial discontinuity in a beam with
one-dimensional strip-like geometry. This approach is confirmed by numerical
simulations which are extended also to beams with cylindrical symmetry. The
theory explains recent experiments where such dispersive shock waves have been
observed.
