We show that randomly choosing the matrices in a completely positive map from
the unitary group gives a quantum expander. We consider Hermitian and
non-Hermitian cases, and we provide asymptotically tight bounds in the
Hermitian case on the typical value of the second largest eigenvalue. The key
idea is the use of Schwinger-Dyson equations from lattice gauge theory to
efficiently compute averages over the unitary group.
