We present a theoretical study of the electronic transport through a
many-level quantum dot driven by time-dependent signals applied at the contacts
to the leads. If the barriers oscillate out of phase the system operates like a
turnstile pump under a finite constant bias, as observed in the experiments of
Kouwenhoven {\it et al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 67}, 1626 (1991)]. The
time-dependent currents and their averages over succesive pumping periods are
computed from the Keldysh formalism for tight-binding models. The calculation
considers a sudden application of the pumping potentials at $t=0$ which leads
to transient features of the time-dependent and averaged currents during the
first pumping cycles which turn out to be important in the high-frequency
regime. We show that in the transient regime the efficiency of the system as a
pump is rather poor because it mainly absorbs charge from both leads in order
to fill the levels located below the bias window. Under a finite bias and a
low-frequency pumping signal the charge transferred across the system depends
on the number of levels located within the bias window. The internal charge
dynamics and the role of energy sidebands are investigated. The so called
satellite peaks of the averaged current are observed also in the transient
regime.
