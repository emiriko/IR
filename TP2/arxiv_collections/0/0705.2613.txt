If we distribute n qubits between two parties, which quantum pure states and
distributions of qubits would allow all-versus-nothing (or
Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger-like) proofs of Bell's theorem using only
single-qubit measurements? We show a necessary and sufficient condition for the
existence of these proofs for any number of qubits, and provide all distinct
proofs up to n=7 qubits. Remarkably, there is only one distribution of a state
of n=4 qubits, and six distributions, each for a different state of n=6 qubits,
which allow these proofs.
