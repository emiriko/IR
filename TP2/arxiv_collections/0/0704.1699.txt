Recent development of a hydrodynamic model is discussed by putting an
emphasis on realistic treatment of the early and late stages in relativistic
heavy ion collisions. The model, which incorporates a hydrodynamic description
of the quark-gluon plasma with a kinetic approach of hadron cascades, is
applied to analysis of elliptic flow data at the Relativistic Heavy Ion
Collider energy. It is predicted that the elliptic flow parameter based on the
hybrid model increases with the collision energy up to the Large Hadron
Collider energy.
