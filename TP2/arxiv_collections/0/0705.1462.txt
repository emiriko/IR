In the work, the new method for the design of the wavelength division
multiplexer on the basis of 2D photonic crystal integrated circuit for the
ultra-short pulses channel separation is proposed and investigated. The method
is based on the analysis of full photonic bandgap maps that allows defining the
ultra-short pulse demultiplexer parameters selection. For the method
approbation, there was synthesized the device in which the wideband filters are
used for the channel separation. As it was expected, the device effectively
separates 50 fs pulse channels with 1.31 and 1.55 microns wavelengths. The
obtained spectral characteristics and pulse pattern responses validate the
efficiency of the proposed method and the applicability of such devices to the
integrated photonic information processing circuits.
