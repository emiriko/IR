We report on the observed differences in production rates of strange and
multi-strange baryons in Au+Au collisions at sqrts = 200 GeV compared to pp
interactions at the same energy. The strange baryon yields in Au+Au collisions,
then scaled down by the number of participating nucleons, are enhanced relative
to those measured in pp reactions. The enhancement observed increases with the
strangeness content of the baryon, and increases for all strange baryons with
collision centrality. The enhancement is qualitatively similar to that observed
at lower collision energy sqrts =17.3 GeV. The previous observations are for
the bulk production, while at intermediate pT, 1 < pT< 4 GeV/c, the strange
baryons even exceed binary scaling from pp yields.
