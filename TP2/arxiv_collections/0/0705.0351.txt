In the purely affine formulation of gravity, the gravitational field is
represented by the symmetric part of the Ricci tensor of the affine connection.
The classical electromagnetic field can be represented in this formulation by
the second Ricci tensor of the connection. Such a construction is dynamically
equivalent to the sourceless Einstein-Maxwell equations. We generalize this
construction to the case with sources, represented by the derivative of the
affine Lagrangian density with respect to the connection. We show that the
Maxwell equations with sources emerge for the simplest affine Lagrangian for
matter, while the Einstein and Lorentz equations arise if mass has
electromagnetic origin. We also show that the Maxwell equations replace the
unphysical constraint imposed by the projective invariance of purely affine
Lagrangians that depend explicitly on the connection.
