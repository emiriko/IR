We give a scheme for loss tolerantly building a linear optical quantum memory
which itself is tolerant to qubit loss. We use the encoding recently introduced
in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 97, 120501, (2006)] and give a method for efficiently
achieving this. The entire approach resides within the "One-way" model for
quantum computing. Our results suggest that it is possible to build a loss
tolerant quantum memory, such that if the requirement is to keep the data
stored over arbitrarily long times then this is possible with only polynomially
increasing resources and logarithmically increasing individual photon life
times.
