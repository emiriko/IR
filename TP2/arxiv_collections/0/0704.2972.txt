A state of an excitonic insulator with the electric current is studied.
Initially, in the metallic phase, the electrons and holes are assumed to be
moving in the opposite directions, so as the electric current exists. This
state is supported by an external condition (the specimen is in an electric
circuit with the current). When the temperature decreases, the transition to
the ordering state due to formation of the electron--hole pairs is possible
(similar to the ordinary state of the excitonic insulator). The properties of
the state at zero temperature are investigated. The spectrum of elementary
excitations has a gap, and so the conclusion can be made that obtained state is
superconducting one. Thus, depending on the external conditions, excitonic
insulator behaves itself like the insulator or superconductor. That is correct
in the limit of strong overlapping of the electron--hole pairs.
