Electrons moving in a strong periodic electromagnetic field (e.g., laser or
undulator) may convert quantum vacuum fluctuations into pairs of entangled
photons, which can be understood as a signature of the Unruh effect. Apart from
verifying this striking phenomenon, the considered effect may allow the
construction of a table-top source for entangled photons (``photon pair
laser'') and the associated quantum-optics applications in the multi-keV regime
with near-future facilities. 04.62.+v, 12.20.Fv, 41.60.-m, 42.50.Dv.
