Very recently, we have performed a couple of experiments, {\it{KEK
PS-E549/E570}}, for the detailed study of the strange tribaryon $S^0(3115)$
obtained in {\it{KEK PS-E471}}. These experiments were performed to accumulate
much higher statistics with improved experimental apparatusespecially for the
better proton spectroscopy of the $^4$He({\it{stopped K}}$^-$, {\it{N}})
reaction. In contrast to the previous proton spectrum, no narrow ($\sim$ 20
MeV) peak structure was found either in the inclusive $^4$He({\it{stopped
K}}$^-$, {\it{p}}) or in the semi-inclusive $^4$He({\it{stopped K}}$^-$,
{\it{p}}$X^\pm$) reaction channel, which is equivalent to the previous $E471$
event trigger condition. Detailed analysis of the present data and simulation
shows that the peak, corresponding to $S^0(3115)$, has been an experimental
artifact. Present analysis does not exclude the possible existence of a much
wider structure. To be sensitive to such structure and for better understanding
of the non-mesonic $K^-$ absorption reaction channel, detailed analysis of the
data is in progress.
