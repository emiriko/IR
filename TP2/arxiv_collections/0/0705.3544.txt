A method is proposed for detecting from univariate data the presence of
synchronization of a self-sustained oscillator by external driving with varying
frequency. The method is based on the analysis of difference between the
oscillator instantaneous phases calculated using continuous wavelet transform
at time moments shifted by a certain constant value relative to each other. We
apply our method to a driven asymmetric van der Pol oscillator, experimental
data from a driven electronic oscillator with delayed feedback and human
heartbeat time series. In the latest case, the analysis of the heart rate
variability data reveals synchronous regimes between the respiration and slow
oscillations in blood pressure.
