We show that a classical algorithm efficiently simulating the modular
exponentiation circuit, for certain product state input and with measurements
in a general product state basis at the output, can efficiently simulate Shor's
factoring algorithm. This is done by using the notion of the semi-classical
Fourier transform due to Griffith and Niu, and further discussed in the context
of Shor's algorithm by Browne.
