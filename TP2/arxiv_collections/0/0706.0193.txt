We present preliminary results of particle-in-cell simulations of
collisionless magnetic reconnection for conditions that apply to magnetically
dominated pair plasma jets such as those in gamma-ray bursts. We find similar
behaviour to previous authors but with reduced reconnection efficiency. This
results because we include the full electromagnetic field dynamically and allow
electric field fluctuations to grow. Although weak, these fluctuations impede
early x-point formation by periodically decelerating and even reversing the
inflow.
