Thirty years of a deepening information paradox suggest the need to revise
our basic physical framework. Multiple indicators point toward reassessment of
the principle of locality: lack of a precise definition in quantum gravity,
behavior of high-energy scattering, hints from strings and AdS/CFT, conundrums
of quantum cosmology, and finally lack of good alternative resolutions of the
paradox. A plausible conjecture states that the non-perturbative dynamics of
gravity is unitary but nonlocal. String theory may directly address these
issues but so far important aspects remain elusive. If this viewpoint is
correct, critical questions are to understand the "correspondence" limit where
nonlocal physics reduces to local quantum field theory, and beyond, to unveil
principles of an underlying nonlocal theory.
