We report a first in modeling and simulation of the effects of the HIV
proteins on the (caspase dependent) apoptotic pathway in infected cells. This
work is novel and is an extension on the recent reports and clarifications on
the FAS apoptotic pathway from the literature. We have gathered most of the
reaction rates and initial conditions from the literature, the rest of the
constants have been computed by fitting our model to the experimental results
reported. Using the model obtained we have then run the simulations for the
infected memory T cells, called also latent T cells, which, at the moment,
represent the major obstacle to finding a cure for HIV. We can now report that
the infected latent T cells have an estimated lifetime of about 42 hours from
the moment they are re-activated. As far as we know this is the first result of
this type obtained for the infected memory T cells.
