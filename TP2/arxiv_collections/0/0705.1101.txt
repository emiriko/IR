The magnetic field due to the photon rest mass $m_{ph}$ modifies the standard
results of the Aharonov-Bohm effect for electrons, and of other recent quantum
effects. For the effect involving a coherent superposition of beams of
particles with opposite electromagnetic properties, by means of a table-top
experiment, the limit $m_{ph}x10^{-51}g$ is achievable, improving by 6 orders
of magnitude that derived by Boulware and Deser for the Aharonov-Bohm effect.
