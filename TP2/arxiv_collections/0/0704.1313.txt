We prove that if a finite order knot invariant does not distinguish mutant
knots, then the corresponding weight system depends on the intersection graph
of a chord diagram rather than on the diagram itself. The converse statement is
easy and well known. We discuss relationship between our results and certain
Lie algebra weight systems.
