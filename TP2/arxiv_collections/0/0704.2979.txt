The Kondo effect observed in recent STM experiments on transport through CoPc
and TBrPP-Co molecules adsorbed on Au(111) and Cu(111) surfaces, respectively,
is discussed within the framework of a simple model (Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 97},
076806 (2006)). It is shown that, in the Kondo regime and by varying the
adequate model parameters, it is possible to produce a crossover from a
conductance Kondo peak (CoPc) to a conductance Fano dip (TBrPP-Co). In the case
of TBrPP-Co/Cu(111) we show that the model reproduces the changes in the shape
of the Fano dip, the raising of the Kondo temperature and shifting to higher
energies of the dip minimum when the number of nearest neighbors molecules is
lowered. These features are in line with experimental observations indicating
that our simple model contains the essential physics underlying the transport
properties of such complex molecules.
