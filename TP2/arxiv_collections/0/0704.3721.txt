We conduct a review of experimental results on Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays
(UHECR's) including measurements of the features of the spectrum, the
composition of the primary particle flux and the search for anisotropy in event
arrival direction. We find that while there is a general consensus on the
features in the spectrum -- the Second Knee, the Ankle, and (to a lesser
extent) the GZK Cutoff -- there is little consensus on the composition of the
primaries that accompany these features. This lack of consensus on the
composition makes interpretation of the agreed upon features problematic. There
is also little direct evidence about potential sources of UHECRs, as early
reports of arrival direction anisotropies have not been confirmed in
independent measurements.
