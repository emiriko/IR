We calculate shadowing using new data on the gluon density of the Pomeron
recently measured with high precision at HERA. The calculations are made in a
Glauber-Gribov framework and Pomeron tree-diagrams are summed up within a
unitarity-conserving procedure. The total cross section of $\vphot A$
interaction is then found in a parameter-free description, employing gluon
diffractive and inclusive distribution functions as input. A strong shadowing
effect is obtained, in good agreement with several other models. Impact
parameter dependence of gluon shadowing is also presented.
