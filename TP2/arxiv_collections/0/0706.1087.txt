Today's computer-based annotation systems implement a wide range of
functionalities that often go beyond those available in traditional
paper-and-pencil annotations. Conceptually, annotation systems are based on
thoroughly investigated psycho-sociological and pedagogical learning theories.
They offer a huge diversity of annotation types that can be placed in textual
as well as in multimedia format. Additionally, annotations can be published or
shared with a group of interested parties via well-organized repositories.
Although highly sophisticated annotation systems exist both conceptually as
well as technologically, we still observe that their acceptance is somewhat
limited. In this paper, we argue that nowadays annotation systems suffer from
several fundamental problems that are inherent in the traditional
paper-and-pencil annotation paradigm. As a solution, we propose to shift the
annotation paradigm for the implementation of annotation system.
