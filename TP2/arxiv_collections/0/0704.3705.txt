We introduce a model-checking tool intended specially for the analysis of
quantum information protocols. The tool incorporates an efficient
representation of a certain class of quantum circuits, namely those expressible
in the so-called stabiliser formalism. Models of protocols are described using
a simple, imperative style simulation language which includes commands for the
unitary operators in the Clifford group as well as classical integer and
boolean variables. Formulas for verification are expressed using a subset of
quantum computational tree logic (QCTL). The model-checking procedure treats
quantum measurements as the source of non-determinism, leading to multiple
protocol runs, one for each outcome. Verification is performed for each run.
