Fuzzy sketches, introduced as a link between biometry and cryptography, are a
way of handling biometric data matching as an error correction issue. We focus
here on iris biometrics and look for the best error-correcting code in that
respect. We show that two-dimensional iterative min-sum decoding leads to
results near the theoretical limits. In particular, we experiment our
techniques on the Iris Challenge Evaluation (ICE) database and validate our
findings.
