The existence of magnetosonic solitons in dusty plasmas is investigated. The
nonlinear magnetohydrodynamic equations for a warm dusty magnetoplasma are thus
derived. A solution of the nonlinear equations is presented. It is shown that,
due to the presence of dust, static structures are allowed. This is in sharp
contrast to the formation of the so called shocklets in usual magnetoplasmas. A
comparatively small number of dust particles can thus drastically alter the
behavior of the nonlinear structures in magnetized plasmas.
