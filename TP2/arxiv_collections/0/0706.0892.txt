We present preliminary results of Upsilon production in p+p collisions at
sqrt(s)=200 GeV at central rapidity. This measurement was performed at the STAR
experiment through the Upsilon->e^+e^- decay channel. In this manuscript we
describe the experimental details, from the development of a specially designed
trigger setup to the analysis methods used to discriminate electrons from
hadrons. The production cross-section obtained B*{(dsigma/dy)|(y=0)}=91(28)(22)
pb is compatible with our expectations based on pQCD calculations.
