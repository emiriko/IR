The goal of this paper is to define the n-connected regions in the Cartesian
workspace of fully-parallel manipulators, i.e. the maximal regions where it is
possible to execute point-to-point motions. The manipulators considered in this
study may have multiple direct and inverse kinematic solutions. The N-connected
regions are characterized by projection, onto the Cartesian workspace, of the
connected components of the reachable configuration space defined in the
Cartesian product of the Cartesian space by the joint space. Generalized octree
models are used for the construction of all spaces. This study is illustrated
with a simple planar fully-parallel manipulator.
