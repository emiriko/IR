In this paper, it is shown that the cosmological model that was introduced in
a sequence of three earlier papers under the title, A Dust Universe Solution to
the Dark Energy Problem, can be used to resolve the problem of the great
mismatch of numerical values between dark energy from cosmology and zero point
energy from quantum theory. It is shown that, if the zero point energies for
the cosmic microwave background and for all the rest of the universe that is
not cosmic microwave background are introduced into this model as two entities,
their separate values appear within this theory in the form of a numerical
difference. It is this difference that gives the numerical value for the zero
point value of Einstein's dark energy density. Consequently, although the two
zero point energies may be large, their difference can give the known small
dark energy value from cosmology for dark energy density. Issues relating to
interpretation, calculation and measurement associated with this result and an
interpretation of dark energy as a measure of polarisation of the vacuum are
discussed. In the first appendix to this paper, problems associated with the
standard model of cosmology are solved by redefining temperature in the dust
universe model. In the second appendix of this paper, an examination of the
dark matter problem in relation to a general relativistic generalisation of
Newton's inverse square law is undertaken. In the third appendix to this paper,
the formalism is used to derive a formula that gives a possible value for the
mass of the universe in terms of Newton's gravitation constant, Einstein's
Lambda and the velocity of light. All three appendices have their own detailed
abstracts.
