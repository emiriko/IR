Molecular dynamics simulations are used to study fluidization of a vertically
vibrated, three-dimensional shallow granular layer. As the container
acceleration is increased above g, the granular temperature and root mean
square particle displacement increase, gradually fluidizing the layer. For
nearly elastic particles, or low shaking frequencies, or small layer depths,
the end of the fluidization process is marked by an abrupt increase in the
granular temperature and rms particle displacement. The layer is then fully
fluidized since macroscopic, fluid-like phenomena such as convection rolls and
surface waves are observed. Increasing the total dissipation (by either
decreasing the restitution coefficient or increasing the total number of
particles) decreases the increase in granular temperature and rms particle
displacement at fluidization, and shifts the increase to higher accelerations.
Increasing the frequency also decreases the magnitude of the jump, and shifts
the change to lower accelerations.
