A brief introduction is given to the subject of brane induced gravity. The 5D
example is discussed in detail. The 4D laws of gravity are obtained on a brane
embedded in an infinite volume extra space, where the problem of stabilization
of the volume modulus is absent. The theory has two classically disjoint
branches of solutions -- the conventional and self-accelerated one. The
conventional branch gives a perturbatively stable model of a metastable
graviton, with potentially testable predictions within the Solar system. The
self-accelerated branch, on the other hand, provides an existence proof for an
idea that the accelerated expansion of the Universe could be due to modified
gravity. The issue of perturbative stability of the self-accelerated branch is
obscured by a breakdown of the conventional perturbative expansion. However, a
certain exact non-perturbative solution found in hep-th/0612016 exhibits a net
negative gravitational mass, while this mass is positive on the conventional
branch. This suggest that the self-accelerated solution must be
non-perturbatively unstable. A proposal to overcome this problem in an
extension of the original model, that also allows for the quantum gravity scale
to be unrestricted, is briefly discussed.
