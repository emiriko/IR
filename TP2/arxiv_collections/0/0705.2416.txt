The diffusivity $D(t)$ of finite-range asymmetric exclusion processes on
$\mathbb Z$ with non-zero drift is expected to be of order $t^{1/3}$.
Sepp\"{a}l\"ainen and Bal\'azs recently proved this conjecture for the nearest
neighbor case. We extend their results to general finite range exclusion by
proving that the Laplace transform of the diffusivity is of the conjectured
order. We also obtain a pointwise upper bound for $D(t)$ the correct order.
