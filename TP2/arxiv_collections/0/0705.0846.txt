We consider the simplest generalizations of the valence bond physics of SU(2)
singlets to SU(N) singlets that comprise objects with N sites -- these are
SU(N) singlet plaquettes with N=3 and N=4 in three spatial dimensions.
Specifically, we search for a quantum mechanical liquid of such objects -- a
resonating singlet valence plaquette phase that generalizes the celebrated
resonating valence bond phase for SU(2) spins. We extend the Rokhsar-Kivelson
construction of the quantum dimer model to the simplest SU(4) model for valence
plaquette dynamics on a cubic lattice. The phase diagram of the resulting
quantum plaquette model is analyzed both analytically and numerically. We find
that the ground state is solid everywhere, including at the Rokhsar-Kivelson
point where the ground state is an equal amplitude sum. By contrast, the equal
amplitude sum of SU(3) singlet triangular plaquettes on the face centered cubic
lattice is liquid and thus a candidate for describing a resonating single
valence plaquette phase, given a suitably defined local Hamiltonian.
