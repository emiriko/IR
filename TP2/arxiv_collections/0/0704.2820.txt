We have analyzed the HI aperture synthesis image of the Large Magellanic
Cloud (LMC), using an objective and quantitative measure of topology to
understand the HI distribution hosting a number of holes and clumps of various
sizes in the medium. The HI distribution shows different topology at four
different chosen scales. At the smallest scales explored (19-29 pc), the HI
mass is distributed in such a way that numerous clumps are embedded on top of a
low density background. At the larger scales from 73 to 194 pc, it shows a
generic hole topology. These holes might have been formed mainly by stellar
winds from hot stars. At the scales from 240 to 340 pc, slightly above the disk
scale-height of the gaseous disk, major clumps in the HI map change the
distribution to have a slight clump topology. These clumps include the giant
cloud associations in the spiral arms and the thick filaments surrounding
superholes. At the largest scales studied (390-485 pc), the hole topology is
present again. Responsible to the hole topology at this scale are a few
superholes which seem mainly associated with supernova explosions in the outer
disk. The gaps between the bar and spiral arms have a minor effect on the
topology at this scale.
