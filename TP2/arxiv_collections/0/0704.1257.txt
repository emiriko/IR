We prove a double-exponential upper bound on the degree and on the complexity
of constructing a Janet basis of a $D$-module. This generalizes a well known
bound on the complexity of a Gr\"obner basis of a module over the algebra of
polynomials. We would like to emphasize that the obtained bound can not be
immediately deduced from the commutative case.
