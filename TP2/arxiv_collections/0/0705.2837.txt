We present calculations on the magnetocapacitance of the two-dimensional
electron gas in a lateral semiconductor superlattice under two-dimensional weak
periodic potential modulation in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic
field. Adopting a Gaussian broadening of magnetic-field-dependent width in the
density of states, we present explicit and simple expressions for the
magnetocapacitance, valid for the relevant weak magnetic fields and modulation
strengths. As the modulation strength in both directions increase, beats of the
magnetocapacitance oscillations are observed, in the low magnetic field range
(Weiss-oscillations regime), which are absent in the one-dimensional weak
modulation case.
