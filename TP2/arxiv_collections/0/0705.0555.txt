We demonstrate a unique prospect for inducing anisotropic vortex pinning and
manipulating the directional motion of vortices using the stripe domain
patterns of a uniaxial magnetic film in a the superconducting/ferromagnetic
hybrid. Our observations can be described by a model, which considers
interactions between magnetic charges of vortices and surface magnetic charges
of domains resulting in the enhanced pinning of vortices on domain walls.
