Using spin-polarized low-energy electron microscopy to study magnetization in
epitaxial layered systems, we found that the area vs perimeter relationship of
magnetic domains in the top Fe layers of Fe/NiO/Fe(100) structures follows a
power-law distribution, with very small magnetic domain cutoff radius (about 40
nm) and domain wall thickness. This unusual magnetic microstructure can be
understood as resulting from the competition between antiferromagnetic and
ferromagnetic exchange interactions at the Fe/NiO interfaces, rather than from
mechanisms involving the anisotropy and dipolar forces that govern length
scales in conventional magnetic domain structures. Statistical analysis of our
measurements validates a micromagnetic model that accounts for this interfacial
exchange coupling.
