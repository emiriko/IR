Holography gives us a tool to view the Hawking effect from a new, classical
perspective. In the context of Randall-Sundrum braneworld models, we show that
the basic features of four-dimensional evaporating solutions are nicely
translated into classical five-dimensional language. This includes the dual
bulk description of particles tunneling through the horizon.
