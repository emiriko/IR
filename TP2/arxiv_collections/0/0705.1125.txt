XTE J1748-288 is a black hole X-ray transient which went into outburst in
1998 June. The X-ray lightcurves showed canonical morphologies, with minor
variations on the ``Fast Rise Exponential Decay'' profile. The radio source,
however, reached an unusually high flux density of over 600 mJy. This high
radio flux was accompanied by an exceptional (>20%) fractional linear
polarisation, the variability of which was anti-correlated with the flux
density. We use this variability to discuss possible depolarisation mechanisms
and to predict the underlying behaviour of the (unresolved) core/jet
components.
