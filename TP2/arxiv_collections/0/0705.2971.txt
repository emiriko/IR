A strong emission line at 6703A has been detected in the optical spectrum for
the host galaxy (R=23.1) of the radio source RC J0311+0507 (4C+04.11). This
radio galaxy, with a spectral index of 1.31 in the frequency range 365-4850
MHz, is one of the ultrasteep spectrum objects from the deep survey of a sky
strip conducted with RATAN-600 in 1980-1981. We present arguments in favor of
the identification of this line with Ly\alpha at redshift z=4.514. In this
case, the object belongs to the group of extremely distant radio galaxies of
ultrahigh radio luminosity (P_{1400}=1.3 x 10^{29}W Hz^{-1}). Such power can be
provided only by a fairly massive black hole (~10^9M_\sun}) that formed in a
time less than the age of the Universe at the observed z(1.3 Gyr) or had a
primordial origin.
