In this paper, the performance of signaling strategies with high
peak-to-average power ratio is analyzed in both coherent and noncoherent fading
channels. Two recently proposed modulation schemes, namely on-off binary
phase-shift keying and on-off quaternary phase-shift keying, are considered.
For these modulation formats, the optimal decision rules used at the detector
are identified and analytical expressions for the error probabilities are
obtained. Numerical techniques are employed to compute the error probabilities.
It is concluded that increasing the peakedness of the signals results in
reduced error rates for a given power level and hence improve the energy
efficiency.
