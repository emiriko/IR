We calculate the Z boson propagator correction, as described by the S
parameter, in technicolor theories with extended technicolor interactions
included. Our method is to solve the Bethe-Salpeter equation for the requisite
current-current correlation functions. Our results suggest that the inclusion
of extended technicolor interactions has a relatively small effect on S.
