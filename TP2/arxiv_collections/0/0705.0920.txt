We study the action of metaplectic operators on Wiener amalgam spaces, giving
upper bounds for their norms. As an application, we obtain new fixed-time
estimates in these spaces for Schr\"odinger equations with general quadratic
Hamiltonians and Strichartz estimates for the Schr\"odinger equation with
potentials $V(x)=\pm|x|^2$.
