Following the recent insight in the material structure of comets,
protoplanetesimals are assumed to have low densities and to be highly porous
agglomerates. It is still unclear if planetesimals can be formed from these
objects by collisional growth. Therefore, it is important to study numerically
the collisional outcome from low velocity impacts of equal sized porous
agglomerates which are too large to be examined in a laboratory experiment. We
use the Lagrangian particle method Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics to solve the
equations that describe the dynamics of elastic and plastic bodies.
Additionally, to account for the influence of porosity, we follow a previous
developed equation of state and certain relations between the material strength
and the relative density. Collisional growth seems possible for rather low
collision velocities and particular material strengths. The remnants of
collisions with impact parameters that are larger than 50% of the radius of the
colliding objects tend to rotate. For small impact parameters, the colliding
objects are effectively slowed down without a prominent compaction of the
porous structure, which probably increases the possibility for growth. The
protoplanetesimals, however, do not stick together for the most part of the
employed material strengths. An important issue in subsequent studies has to be
the influence of rotation to collisional growth. Moreover, for realistic
simulations of protoplanetesimals it is crucial to know the correct material
parameters in more detail.
