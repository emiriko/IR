We propose and analyze a probabilistic scheme to entangle two spatially
separated topological qubits in a $p_{x}+ip_{y}$ superfluid using controlled
collisions between atoms in movable dipole traps and unpaired atoms inside
vortex cores in the superfluid. We discuss how to test the violation of Bell's
inequality with the generated entanglement. A set of universal quantum gates is
shown to be implementable \textit{deterministically} using the entanglement
despite the fact that the entangled states can only be created
probabilistically.
