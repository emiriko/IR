Many important applications are available for nonlinear reaction-diffusion
equation especially in the area of biology and engineering. Therefore a
mathematical model for Lie symmetry reduction of system of nonlinear
reaction-diffusion equation with respect to one-dimensional Algebra is carried
out in this work. Some classes of analytical and numerical solutions are
obtained and expressed using suitable graphs.
