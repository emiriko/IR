The paper addresses kinematic and geometrical aspects of the Orthoglide, a
three-DOF parallel mechanism. This machine consists of three fixed linear
joints, which are mounted orthogonally, three identical legs and a mobile
platform, which moves in the Cartesian x-y-z space with fixed orientation. New
solutions to solve inverse/direct kinematics are proposed and a detailed
workspace analysis is performed taking into account specific joint limit
constraints.
