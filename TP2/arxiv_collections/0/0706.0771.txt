We investigate fully nonlinear, non-Abelian excitations of quark-antiquark
plasma, using relativistic fluid theory in cold plasma approximation. There are
mainly three important nonlinearities, coming from various sources such as
non-Abelian interactions of Yang-Mills (YM) fields, Wong's color dynamics and
plasma nonlinearity, in our model. By neglecting nonlinearities due to plasma
and color dynamics we get back the earlier results of Blaizot {\it et. al.},
Phys. Rev. Lett. 72, 3317 (1994). Similarly, by neglecting YM fields
nonlinearity and plasma nonlinearity, it reduces to the model of Gupta {\it et.
al.}, Phys. Lett. B498, 223 (2005). Thus we have the most general non-Abelian
mode of quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Further, our model resembles the problem of
propagation of laser beam through relativistic plasma, Physica 9D, 96 (1983).
in the absence of all non-Abelian interactions.
