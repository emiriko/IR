Motivated by the work of Salvetti and Settepanella we introduce certain total
orderings of the faces of any shellable regular CW-complex (called
`shelling-type orderings') that can be used to explicitly construct maximum
acyclic matchings of the poset of cells of the given complex. Building on an
application of this method to the classical zonotope shellings we describe a
class of maximum acyclic matchings for the Salvetti complex of a linear
complexified arrangement. To do this, we introduce and study a new
combinatorial stratification of the Salvetti complex. For the obtained acyclic
matchings we give an explicit description of the critical cells that depends
only on the chosen linear extension of the poset of regions. It is always
possible to choose the linear extension so that the critical cells can be
explicitly constructed from the chambers of the arrangement via the bijection
to no-broken-circuit sets defined by Jewell and Orlik. Our method can be
generalized to arbitraty oriented matroids.
