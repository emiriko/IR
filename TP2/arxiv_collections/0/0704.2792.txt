Single crystal samples of L-leucine, C6H13NO2, a fundamental aliphatic amino
acid of the human body, have been studied by Raman spectroscopy at temperatures
from 300 to 430 K over the spectral range from 50 to 3100 cm-1. A tentative
assignment of all bands is given. For high temperatures, several modifications
on the Raman spectra were observed at about 353 K, giving evidence that the
L-leucine crystal undergoes a structural phase transition.
