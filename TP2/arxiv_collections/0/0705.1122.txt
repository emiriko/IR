Results from electric charge correlations studied with the Balance Function
method in A+A collisions from 20\emph{A} to 158\emph{A} GeV are presented in
two different rapidity intervals: In the mid-rapidity region we observe a
decrease of the width of the Balance Function distribution with increasing
centrality of the collision, whereas this effect vanishes in the forward
rapidity region.
  Results from the energy dependence study in central Pb+Pb collisions show
that the narrowing of the Balance Function expressed by the normalised width
parameter \textit{W} increases with energy towards the highest SPS and RHIC
energies.
  Finally we compare our experimental data points with predictions of several
models. The hadronic string models UrQMD and HIJING do not reproduce the
observed narrowing of the Balance Function. However, AMPT which contains a
quark-parton transport phase before hadronization can reproduce the narrowing
of the BF's width with centrality. This confirms the proposed sensitivity of
the Balance Function analysis to the time of hadronization.
