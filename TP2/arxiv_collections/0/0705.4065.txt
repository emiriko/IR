Preparing observing proposals is a classical exercise in an observational
astronomer's life. In this paper, we summarize the general requirements to
write a good proposal for the ESO telescopes, and eventually obtain telescope
time. We detail in particular the different proposal types, how they are
evaluated by ESO, what they should contain and what to avoid. The advice given
in the present paper are applicable to observing proposals for the AMBER and
MIDI instruments of the VLTI, but also to other ESO instruments, and to some
extent to other observatories.
