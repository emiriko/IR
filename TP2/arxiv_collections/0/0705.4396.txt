This report provides the results of an extensive and important study of the
potential for a U.S. scientific program that will extend our knowledge of
neutrino oscillations well beyond what can be anticipated from ongoing and
planned experiments worldwide. The program examined here has the potential to
provide the U.S. particle physics community with world leading experimental
capability in this intensely interesting and active field of fundamental
research. Furthermore, this capability could be unique compared to anywhere
else in the world because of the available beam intensity and baseline
distances. The present study was initially commissioned in April 2006 by top
research officers of Brookhaven National Laboratory and Fermi National
Accelerator Laboratory and, as the study evolved, it also provided responses to
questions formulated and addressed to the study group by the Neutrino
Scientific Advisory Committee (NuSAG) of the U.S. DOE and NSF. The participants
in the study, its Charge and history, plus the study results and conclusions
are provided in this report and its appendices. A summary of the conclusions is
provided in the Executive Summary.
