By a combination of geometrical and configurational analysis we study the
properties of absolute minimal and equilibrium states of general Mumford-Shah
functionals, with applications to models of quasistatic brittle fracture
propagation. The main results concern the mathematical relations between
physical quantities as energy release rate and energy concentration for 3D
cracks with complex shapes, seen as outer measures living on the crack edge.
