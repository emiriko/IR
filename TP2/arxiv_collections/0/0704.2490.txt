Supersymmetry breaking together by constant boundary superpotentials and by
the O'Raifeartaigh model is studied in a warped space model. It is shown that
the contribution of constant boundary superpotentials enables the moduli of
chiral supermultiplets to be stabilized and that the vacuum at the stationary
point has zero cosmological constant in a wide region of parameters.
