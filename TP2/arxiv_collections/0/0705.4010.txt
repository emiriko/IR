We present X-ray spectral analyses of low mass X-ray binary Cir X-1 during
X-ray dips, using the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) data. Each dip was
divided into several segments, and the spectrum of each segment was fitted with
a three-component blackbody model, in which two components are affected by
partial covering and the third one is unaffected. A Gaussian emission line is
also included in the spectral model to represent the Fe Ka line at ~ 6.4 keV.
The fitted temperatures of the two partially covered components are about 2 keV
and 1 keV, while the uncovered component has a temperature of ~ 0.5-0.6 keV.
The equivalent blackbody emission radius of the hottest component is the
smallest and that of the coolest component is the biggest. During dips, the
fluxes of the two hot components are linearly correlated, while that of the
third component doesn't show any significant variation. The Fe line flux
remains constant within errors during the short dips. However, during the long
dips the line flux changes significantly and is positively correlated with the
fluxes of the two hot components. These results suggest: (1) the temperature of
the X-ray emitting region decreases with radius, (2) the Fe Ka line emitting
region is close to the hot continuum emitting region, and (3) the size of the
Fe line emitting region is bigger than the size of the obscuring matters
causing short dips but smaller than the sizes of those causing long dips.
