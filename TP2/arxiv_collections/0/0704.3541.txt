We present in this paper the changes in the room temperature magnetic
property of ZnO on Mn doping prepared using solvo-thermal process. The zero
field cooled (ZFC) and field cooled (FC) magnetisation of undoped ZnO showed
bifurcation and magnetic hysteresis at room temperature. Upon Mn doping the
magnetic hysteresis at room temperature and the bifurcation in ZFC-FC
magnetization vanishes. The results seem to indicate that undoped ZnO is
ferromagnetic while on the other hand the Mn doped ZnO is not a ferromagnetic
system. We observe that on addition of Mn atoms the system shows
antiferromagnetism with very giant magnetic moments.
