The first result of the neutrino magnetic moment measurement at the
Kalininskaya Nuclear Power Plant (KNPP) with the GEMMA spectrometer is
presented. An antineutrino-electron scattering is investigated. A high-purity
germanium detector of 1.5 kg placed 13.9 m away from the 3 GW reactor core is
used in the spectrometer. The antineutrino flux is $2.73\times 10^{13} \nu_e /
cm^2 / s$. The differential method is used to extract the $\nu$-e
electromagnetic scattering events. The scattered electron spectra taken in 6200
and 2064 hours for the reactor ON and OFF periods are compared. The upper limit
for the neutrino magnetic moment $\mu_\nu < 5.8\times 10^{-11}$ Bohr magnetons
at 90{%} CL is derived from the data processing.
