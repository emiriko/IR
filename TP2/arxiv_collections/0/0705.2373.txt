In this letter it is proposed to study the Bekenstein's $\xi(4)$ calculation
of the $S/E$ bound for more general geometries. It is argued that, using some
relations among eigenvalues obtained in the context of Spectral Geometry, it is
possible to estimate $\xi(4)$ without an exact analytical knowledge of the
spectrum. Finally it is claimed that isospectrality can define a class of
domains with the same ratio $S/E$.
