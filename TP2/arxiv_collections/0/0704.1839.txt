ALHEP is the symbolic algebra program for high-energy physics. It deals with
amplitudes calculation, matrix element squaring, Wick theorem, dimensional
regularization, tensor reduction of loop integrals and simplification of final
expressions. The program output includes: Fortran code for differential cross
section, Mathematica files to view results and intermediate steps and TeX
source for Feynman diagrams. The PYTHIA interface is available. The project
website http://www.hep.by/alhep contains up-to-date executables, manual and
script examples.
