Magnetic fields have been observed on all scales in our Galaxy, from AU to
kpc. With pulsar dispersion measures and rotation measures, we can directly
measure the magnetic fields in a very large region of the Galactic disk. The
results show that the large-scale magnetic fields are aligned with the spiral
arms but reverse their directions many times from the inner-most arm (Norma) to
the outer arm (Perseus). The Zeeman splitting measurements of masers in HII
regions or star-formation regions not only show the structured fields inside
clouds, but also have a clear pattern in the global Galactic distribution of
all measured clouds which indicates the possible connection of the large-scale
and small-scale magnetic fields.
