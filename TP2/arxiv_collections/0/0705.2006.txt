The nitrogen-vacancy (N-V) center in diamond is promising as an electron spin
qubit due to its long-lived coherence and optical addressability. The ground
state is a spin triplet with two levels ($m_s = \pm 1$) degenerate at zero
magnetic field. Polarization-selective microwave excitation is an attractive
method to address the spin transitions independently, since this allows
operation down to zero magnetic field. Using a resonator designed to produce
circularly polarized microwaves, we have investigated the polarization
selection rules of the N-V center. We first apply this technique to N-V
ensembles in [100] and [111]-oriented samples. Next, we demonstrate an imaging
technique, based on optical polarization dependence, that allows rapid
identification of the orientations of many single N-V centers. Finally, we test
the microwave polarization selection rules of individual N-V centers of known
orientation.
