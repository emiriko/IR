We show explicitly in two dimensional spacetime (d = 2) that the N = 2
Volkov-Akulov model is equivalent to the spontaneously broken linear
supersymmetry (LSUSY) interacting gauge theory for N = 2 vector and N = 2
scalar supermultiplets. The local gauge interaction of LSUSY is induced by the
specific composite structure of the auxiliary fields and the consequent
transformations.
