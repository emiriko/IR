We report on the detection of an ~5900 s quasi-periodic variation in the
extensive photometry of TX Col spanning 12 years. We discuss five different
models to explain this period. We favour a mechanism where the quasi-periodic
variation results from the beating of the Keplerian frequency of the `blobs'
orbiting in the outer accretion disc with the spin frequency, and from
modulated accretion of these `blobs' taking place in a shocked region near the
disc/magnetosphere boundary.
