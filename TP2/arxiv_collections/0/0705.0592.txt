We explore the possibility that a magnetar may owe its strong magnetic field
to a magnetized core which, as indicated by certain equations of state, may
form due to phase transitions at high density mediated by strong interaction
within a sufficiently massive neutron star. We argue that the field derived
from such a core could explain several inferred evolutionary behaviors of
magnetars.
