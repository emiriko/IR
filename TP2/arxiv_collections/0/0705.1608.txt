We consider the quantum mechanical transport of (coherent) excitons on
small-world networks (SWN). The SWN are build from a one-dimensional ring of N
nodes by randomly introducing B additional bonds between them. The exciton
dynamics is modeled by continuous-time quantum walks and we evaluate
numerically the ensemble averaged transition probability to reach any node of
the network from the initially excited one. For sufficiently large B we find
that the quantum mechanical transport through the SWN is, first, very fast,
given that the limiting value of the transition probability is reached very
quickly; second, that the transport does not lead to equipartition, given that
on average the exciton is most likely to be found at the initial node.
