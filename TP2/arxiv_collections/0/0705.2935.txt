In this paper we re-investigate the core of Schroedinger's 'cat paradox'. We
argue that one has to distinguish clearly between superpositions of macroscopic
cat states and superpositions of entangled states which comprise both the state
of the cat. It is shown, that in the first instance recurrence to decoherence
or other mechanisms is not necessary in this special case in order to explain
the absence of macroscopic superpositions. Additionally, we present modified
versions of two quantum optical experiments as experimenta crucis. Applied
rigorously, quantum mechanical formalism reduces the problem to a mere
pseudo-paradox.
