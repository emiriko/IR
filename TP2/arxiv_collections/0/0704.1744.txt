We present the preliminary results from two new surveys of blazars that have
direct implications on the GLAST detection of extragalactic sources from two
different perspectives: microwave selection and a combined deep X-ray/radio
selection. The first one is a 41 GHz flux-limited sample extracted from the
WMAP 3-yr catalog of microwave point sources. This is a statistically well
defined sample of about 200 blazars and radio galaxies, most of which are
expected to be detected by GLAST. The second one is a new deep survey of
Blazars selected among the radio sources that are spatially coincident with
serendipitous sources detected in deep X-ray images (0.3-10 keV) centered on
the Gamma Ray Bursts (GRB) discovered by the Swift satellite. This sample is
particularly interesting from a statistical viewpoint since a) it is unbiased
as GRBs explode at random positions in the sky, b) it is very deep in the X-ray
band (\fx \simgt $10^{-15}$ \ergs) with a position accuracy of a few
arc-seconds, c) it will cover a fairly large (20-30 square deg.) area of sky,
d) it includes all blazars with radio flux (1.4 GHz) larger than 10 mJy, making
it approximately two orders of magnitude deeper than the WMAP sample and about
one order of magnitude deeper than the deepest existing complete samples of
radio selected blazars, and e) it can be used to estimate the amount of
unresolved GLAST high latitude gamma-ray background and its anisotropy
spectrum.
