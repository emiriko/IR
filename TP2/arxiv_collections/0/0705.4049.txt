The indeterministic character of physical laws is generally considered to be
the most important consequence of quantum physics. A deterministic point of
view, however, together with the possibility of well defined Hamiltonian
trajectories, emerges as the most natural one from the analysis of the
time-independent Helmholtz-like equations encountered both in Classical
Electromagnetism and in Wave Mechanics. In the case of particle beams a
suitable pattern of trajectories is provided (for any set of boundary
conditions) by a set of dynamical laws containing the classical ones as a
simple limiting case.
