Lead clusters deposited on Si(111) substrates have been studied at low
temperatures using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy. The
current-voltage characteristics exhibit current peaks that are irregularly
spaced and varied in height. The statistics of the distribution of peak heights
and spacings are in agreement with random matrix theory for several clusters.
The distributions have also been studied as a function of cluster shape.
