Recent rapid localizations of short, hard gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) by the
Swift and HETE satellites have led to the observation of the first afterglows
and the measurement of the first redshifts from this type of burst. Detection
of >100 GeV counterparts would place powerful constraints on GRB mechanisms.
Seventeen short duration (< 5 s) GRBs detected by satellites occurred within
the field of view of the Milagro gamma-ray observatory between 2000 January and
2006 December. We have searched the Milagro data for >100 GeV counterparts to
these GRBs and find no significant emission correlated with these bursts. Due
to the absorption of high-energy gamma rays by the extragalactic background
light (EBL), detections are only expected for redshifts less than ~0.5. While
most long duration GRBs occur at redshifts higher than 0.5, the opposite is
thought to be true of short GRBs. Lack of a detected VHE signal thus allows
setting meaningful fluence limits. One GRB in the sample (050509b) has a likely
association with a galaxy at a redshift of 0.225, while another (051103) has
been tentatively linked to the nearby galaxy M81. Fluence limits are corrected
for EBL absorption, either using the known measured redshift, or computing the
corresponding absorption for a redshift of 0.1 and 0.5, as well as for the case
of z=0.
