One-flavour QCD - a gauge theory with SU(3) colour gauge group and a fermion
in the fundamental representation - is studied by Monte Carlo simulations. The
mass spectrum of hadronic bound states is investigated in a volume with
extensions of L ~ 4.4r_0 (~2.2fm) at two different lattice spacings: a ~
0.37r_0 (~0.19fm) and a ~ 0.27r_0 (~0.13fm). The lattice action is Symanzik
tree-level-improved Wilson action for the gauge field and (unimproved) Wilson
action for the fermion.
