In this work the dynamics of a freely jointed random chain which fluctuates
at constant temperature in some viscous medium is studied. The chain is
regarded as a system of small particles which perform a brownian motion and are
subjected to rigid constraints which forbid the breaking of the chain. For
simplicity, all interactions among the particles have been switched off and the
number of dimensions has been limited to two. The problem of describing the
fluctuations of the chain in the limit in which it becomes a continuous system
is solved using a path integral approach, in which the constraints are imposed
with the insertion in the path integral of suitable Dirac delta functions. It
is shown that the probability distribution of the possible conformations in
which the fluctuating chain can be found during its evolution in time coincides
with the partition function of a field theory which is a generalization of the
nonlinear sigma model in two dimensions. Both the probability distribution and
the generating functional of the correlation functions of the positions of the
beads are computed explicitly in a semiclassical approximation for a
ring-shaped chain.
