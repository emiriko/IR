Experiments show that macroscopic systems in a stationary nonequilibrium
state exhibit long range correlations of the local thermodynamic variables. In
previous papers we proposed a Hamilton-Jacobi equation for the nonequilibrium
free energy as a basic principle of nonequilibrium thermodynamics. We show here
how an equation for the two point correlations can be derived from the
Hamilton-Jacobi equation for arbitrary transport coefficients for dynamics with
both external fields and boundary reservoirs. In contrast with fluctuating
hydrodynamics, this approach can be used to derive equations for correlations
of any order. Generically, the solutions of the equation for the correlation
functions are non-trivial and show that long range correlations are indeed a
common feature of nonequilibrium systems. Finally, we establish a criterion to
determine whether the local thermodynamic variables are positively or
negatively correlated in terms of properties of the transport coefficients.
