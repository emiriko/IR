The combination of quantum teleportation and quantum memory of photonic
qubits is essential for future implementations of large-scale quantum
communication and measurement-based quantum computation. Both steps have been
achieved separately in many proof-of-principle experiments, but the
demonstration of memory-built-in teleportation of photonic qubits remains an
experimental challenge. Here, we demonstrate teleportation between photonic
(flying) and atomic (stationary) qubits. In our experiment, an unknown
polarization state of a single photon is teleported over 7 m onto a remote
atomic qubit that also serves as a quantum memory. The teleported state can be
stored and successfully read out for up to 8 micro-second. Besides being of
fundamental interest, teleportation between photonic and atomic qubits with the
direct inclusion of a readable quantum memory represents a step towards an
efficient and scalable quantum network.
