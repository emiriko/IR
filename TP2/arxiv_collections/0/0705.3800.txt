We present photometric and spectroscopic data of the interacting starburst
galaxy NGC 6052 obtained with the Spitzer Space Telescope. The mid-infrared
(MIR) spectra of the three brightest spatially resolved regions in the galaxy
are remarkably similar and are consistent with dust emission from young nearly
coeval stellar populations. Analysis of the brightest infrared region of the
system, which contributes ~18.5 % of the total 16\micron flux, indicates that
unlike similar off-nuclear infrared-bright regions found in Arp 299 or NGC
4038/9, its MIR spectrum is inconsistent with an enshrouded hot dust (T > 300K)
component. Instead, the three brightest MIR regions all display dust continua
of temperatures less than ~ 200K. These low dust temperatures indicate the dust
is likely in the form of a patchy screen of relatively cold material situated
along the line of sight. We also find that emission from polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons (PAHs) and the forbidden atomic lines is very similar for each
region. We conclude that the ionization regions are self-similar and come from
young (about 6 Myr) stellar populations. A fourth region, for which we have no
MIR spectra, exhibits MIR emission similar to tidal tail features in other
interacting galaxies.
