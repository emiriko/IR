The problems of stripper target behavior in the nonstationary intense
particle beams are considered. The historical sketch of studying of radiation
damage failure of carbon targets under ion bombardment is presented. The simple
model of evaporation of a target by an intensive pulsing beam is supposed.
Stripper foils lifetimes in the nonstationary intense particle can be described
by two failure mechanisms: radiation damage accumulation and evaporation of
target. At the maximal temperatures less than 2500K the radiation damage are
dominated; at temperatures above 2500K the mechanism of evaporation of a foil
prevails. The proposed approach has been applied to the discription of
behaviour of stripper foils in the BNL linac and SNS conditions.
