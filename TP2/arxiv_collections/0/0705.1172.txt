We derive some consequences of very recent results of Cordero and Nicola on
the metaplectic representation, the Wiener amalgam spaces, (whose definition is
due to Feichtinger), and their applications to the regularity of the solutions
of Schroedinger equation with quadratic Weyl symbol. We do not however discuss
the validity of Cordero and Nicola's claims.
