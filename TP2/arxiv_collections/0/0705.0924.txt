Karolyhazy uncertainty relation, which can be viewed also as a relation
between UV and IR scales in the framework of an effective quantum field theory
satisfying a black hole entropy bound, strongly favors the existence of dark
energy with its observed value. Here we estimate the dynamics of dark energy
predicted by the Karolyhazy relation during the cosmological evolution of the
universe.
