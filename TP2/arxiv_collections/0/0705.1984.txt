The relation between Radon transform and orthogonal expansions of a function
on the unit ball in $\RR^d$ is exploited. A compact formula for the partial
sums of the expansion is given in terms of the Radon transform, which leads to
algorithms for image reconstruction from Radon data. The relation between
orthogonal expansion and the singular value decomposition of the Radon
transform is also exploited.
