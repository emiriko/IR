In this paper, a novel decoding algorithm for low-density parity-check (LDPC)
codes based on convex optimization is presented. The decoding algorithm, called
interior point decoding, is designed for linear vector channels. The linear
vector channels include many practically important channels such as inter
symbol interference channels and partial response channels. It is shown that
the maximum likelihood decoding (MLD) rule for a linear vector channel can be
relaxed to a convex optimization problem, which is called a relaxed MLD
problem. The proposed decoding algorithm is based on a numerical optimization
technique so called interior point method with barrier function. Approximate
variations of the gradient descent and the Newton methods are used to solve the
convex optimization problem. In a decoding process of the proposed algorithm, a
search point always lies in the fundamental polytope defined based on a
low-density parity-check matrix. Compared with a convectional joint message
passing decoder, the proposed decoding algorithm achieves better BER
performance with less complexity in the case of partial response channels in
many cases.
