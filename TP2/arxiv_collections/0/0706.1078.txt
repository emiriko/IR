We model a sheared disordered solid using the theory of Shear Transformation
Zones (STZs). In this mean-field continuum model the density of zones is
governed by an effective temperature that approaches a steady state value as
energy is dissipated. We compare the STZ model to simulations by Shi, et
al.(Phys. Rev. Lett. 98 185505 2007), finding that the model generates
solutions that fit the data,exhibit strain localization, and capture important
features of the localization process. We show that perturbations to the
effective temperature grow due to an instability in the transient dynamics, but
unstable systems do not always develop shear bands. Nonlinear energy
dissipation processes interact with perturbation growth to determine whether a
material exhibits strain localization. By estimating the effects of these
interactions, we derive a criterion that determines which materials exhibit
shear bands based on the initial conditions alone. We also show that the shear
band width is not set by an inherent diffusion length scale but instead by a
dynamical scale that depends on the imposed strain rate.
