We extend the technique of constructive expansions to compute the connected
functions of matrix models in a uniform way as the size of the matrix
increases. This provides the main missing ingredient for a non-perturbative
construction of the $\phi^{\star 4}_4$ field theory on the Moyal four
dimensional space.
