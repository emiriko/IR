We have attempted to constrain the progenitors of all supernova types,
through correlations of the positions of historical supernovae with recent star
formation, as traced by H-alpha emission. Through pixel statistics we have
found that a large fraction of the SNII population do not show any association
with current star formation, which we put down to a 'runaway' fraction of these
progenitors. The SNIb/c population accurately traces the H-alpha emission, with
some suggestion that the SNIc progenitors show a higher degree of correlation
than the SNIb, suggesting higher mass progenitors for the former. Overall the
SNIa population only show a weak correlation to the positions of HII regions,
but as many as a half may be associated with a young stellar population.
