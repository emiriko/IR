We report on detection of negative superhumps in KR Aur which is the
representative member of the VY Scl stars. The observations were obtained with
the multi-channel photometer during 107 h. The analysis of the data clearly
revealed brightness variations with a period of 3.771 +/- 0.005 h. This is 3.5
per cent less than the orbital period, suggesting it is a negative superhump.
Negative superhumps in VY Scl stars are widely spread. The discovery of
powerful soft X-rays from V751 Cyg demonstrates that VY Scl stars may contain
white dwarfs, at which nuclear burning of the accreted material occur. If this
suspicion is correct, we then can suppose that the powerful radiation emerging
from the white dwarf may cause the tilt of the accretion disk to the orbital
plane, and its retrograde precession may produce negative superhumps in VY Scl
stars.
