Observations by the Cores to Disk Legacy Team with the Spitzer Space
Telescope have identified a low luminosity, mid-infrared source within the
dense core, Lynds 1014, which was previously thought to harbor no internal
source. Followup near-infrared and submillimeter interferometric observations
have confirmed the protostellar nature of this source by detecting scattered
light from an outflow cavity and a weak molecular outflow. In this paper, we
report the detection of cm continuum emission with the VLA. The emission is
characterized by a quiescent, unresolved 90 uJy 6 cm source within 0.2" of the
Spitzer source. The spectral index of the quiescent component is $\alpha =
0.37\pm 0.34$ between 6 cm and 3.6 cm. A factor of two increase in 6 cm
emission was detected during one epoch and circular polarization was marginally
detected at the $5\sigma$ level with Stokes {V/I} $= 48 \pm 16$% . We have
searched for 22 GHz H2O maser emission toward L1014-IRS, but no masers were
detected during 7 epochs of observations between June 2004 and December 2006.
L1014-IRS appears to be a low-mass, accreting protostar which exhibits cm
emission from a thermal jet or a wind, with a variable non-thermal emission
component. The quiescent cm radio emission is noticeably above the correlation
of 3.6 cm and 6 cm luminosity versus bolometric luminosity, indicating more
radio emission than expected. We characterize the cm continuum emission in
terms of observations of other low-mass protostars, including updated
correlations of centimeter continuum emission with bolometric luminosity and
outflow force, and discuss the implications of recent larger distance estimates
on the physical attributes of the protostar and dense molecular core.
