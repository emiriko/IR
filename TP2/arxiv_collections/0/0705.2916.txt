The problem of the time is one of the open issues in the quantum gravity.
This problem is particular problem in the canonical quantum gravity. Even in
the loop gravity the problem of the time remain. Our work is concerning to the
problem of the time. The Wheeler-DeWitt itself contains time evolution part,
but which part is the time evolution part is open issue. However, we can create
a method that seems to solve this problem that is up-to-down method created in
the previous works. We can derive equation relating to the time and static
restriction in this paper. As a example we treat the problem of the time of the
Friedmann universe. And we derive the static restriction in quantum gravity.
