With the technological growth of broadband wireless technology like CDMA and
UWB, a lots of development efforts towards wireless communication system and
Imaging radar system are well justified. Efforts are also being imparted
towards a Convergence Technology.. the convergence between a communication and
radar technology which will result in ITS (Intelligent Transport System) and
other applications. This encourages present authors for this development. They
are trying to utilize or converge the communication technologies towards radar
and to achieve the Interference free and clutter free quality remote images of
targets using DS-UWB wireless technology.
