We describe a new approach to logic devices interconnection by the inductive
coupling via a ferromagnetic film. The information among the distant devices is
transmitted in a wireless manner via a magnetic field produced by spin waves
propagating in the ferromagnetic film, referred to as the spin wave bus. As an
alternative approach to the transistor-based architecture, logic circuits with
spin wave bus do not use charge as an information carrier. A bit of information
can be encoded into the phase or the amplitude of the spin wave signal. We
present experimental data demonstrating inductive coupling through the 100nm
thick NiFe and CoFe films at room temperature. The performance of logic
circuits with spin wave bus is illustrated by numerical modeling based on the
experimental data. Potentially, logic circuits with spin wave bus may resolve
the interconnect problem and provide "wireless" read-in and read-out. Another
expected benefit is in the enhanced logic functionality. A set of NOT, AND, and
OR logic gates can be realized in one device structure. The coupling between
the circuits and the spin wave bus can be controlled. We present the results of
numerical simulations showing the controllable switching of a bi-stable logic
cell inductively coupled to the spin wave bus. The shortcomings and limitations
of circuits with spin wave bus are also discussed.
