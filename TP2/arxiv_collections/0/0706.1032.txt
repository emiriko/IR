Starting from a classical mechanics of a ``colloid particle'' and $N$ ``water
molecules'', we study effective stochastic dynamics of the particle which jumps
between deep potential wells. We prove that the effective transition
probability satisfies (local) detailed balance condition. This enables us to
rigorously determine precise form of the transition probability when barrier
potentials have certain regularity and symmetry.
