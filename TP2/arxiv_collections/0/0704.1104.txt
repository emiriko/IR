A four-dimensional Lorentz-breaking non-Abelian Chern-Simons like action is
generated as a one-loop perturbative correction via an appropriate
Lorentz-breaking coupling of the non-Abelian gauge field to the spinor field.
This term is shown to be regularization dependent but nevertheless it can be
found unambiguously in different regularization schemes at zero and finite
temperature.
