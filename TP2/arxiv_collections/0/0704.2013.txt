We apply the conical singularity method to the two dimensional version of the
Schwarzschild metric to obtain the Kruskal coordinates of the black hole in a
very simple and direct way. Then we make use of this metric in an approximated
version and calculate the expected value of energy-momentum tensor of a
massless quantum field near the horizon, resulting in regular expressions for
its components.
