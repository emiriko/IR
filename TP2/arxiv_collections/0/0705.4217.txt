We present local tunneling spectroscopy in the optimally electron-doped
cuprate Sm2-xCexCuO4 x=0.15. A clear signature of the superconducting gap is
observed with an amplitude ranging from place to place and from sample to
sample (Delta~3.5-6meV). Another spectroscopic feature is simultaneously
observed at high energy above \pm 50meV. Its energy scale and temperature
evolution is found to be compatible with previous photoemission and optical
experiments. If interpreted as the signature of antiferromagnetic order in the
samples, these results could suggest the coexistence on the local scale of
antiferromagnetism and superconductivity on the electron-doped side of cuprate
superconductors.
