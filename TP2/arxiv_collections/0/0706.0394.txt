We study the effects of preparation of input states in a quantum tomography
experiment. We show that maps arising from a quantum process tomography
experiment (called process maps) differ from the well know dynamical maps. The
difference between the two is due to the preparation procedure that is
necessary for any quantum experiment. We study two preparation procedures,
stochastic preparation and preparation by measurements. The stochastic
preparation procedure yields process maps that are linear, while the
preparations using von Neumann measurements lead to non-linear processes, and
can only be consistently described by a bi-linear process map. A new process
tomography recipe is derived for preparation by measurement for qubits. The
difference between the two methods is analyzed in terms of a quantum process
tomography experiment. A verification protocol is proposed to differentiate
between linear processes and bi-linear processes. We also emphasize the
preparation procedure will have a non-trivial effect for any quantum experiment
in which the system of interest interacts with its environment.
