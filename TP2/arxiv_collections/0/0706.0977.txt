The region of MSSM Higgs parameter space currently excluded by the CDF
Collaboration, based on an analysis of ~1 fb^-1 of integrated luminosity, is
less than the expected sensitivity. We analyze the potential implications of
the persistence of this discrepancy within the MSSM, assuming that the soft
supersymmetry-breaking contributions to scalar masses are universal, apart from
those to the Higgs masses (the NUHM model). We find that a light heavy MSSM
Higgs signal in the unexcluded part of the sensitive region could indeed be
accommodated in this simple model, even after taking into account other
constraints from cold dark matter, electroweak precision observables and B
physics observables. In this case the NUHM suggests that supersymmetric
signatures should also be detectable in the near future in some other
measurements such as BR(B_s -> mu+ mu-), BR(b -> s gamma) and (g-2)_mu, and M_h
would have to be very close to the LEP exclusion limit. In addition, the dark
matter candidate associated with this model should be on the verge of detection
in direct detection experiments.
