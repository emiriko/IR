An explanation of the recently discovered 7 s pulsations from the isolated
neutron star RX J1856.5-3754 is presented. It is assumed that the real spin
period of this source is $\approx1$ s, whereas the observed spin-modulation is
caused by the presence of a nearly transverse, very low frequency drift waves
in the pulsar magnetosphere. It is supposed that the period of the drift wave
is equal to a recently observed one. The simulated lightcurve is plotted, the
angular parameters are defined and the value of the pulsed fraction of only
$\sim 1.2%$ is explained.
