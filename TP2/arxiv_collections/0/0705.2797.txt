We present the first study of treating b, c, and s quarks as Dirac fermions
in lattice QCD with exact chiral symmetry. For 100 gauge configurations
generated with single-plaquette action at beta = 7.2 on the 32^3 x 60 lattice,
we compute point-to-point quark propagators for 33 quark masses in the range
0.01 < m_q a < 0.85, and measure the time-correlation function of
(pseudo-)scalar, (pseudo-)vector, and tensor mesons, for symmetric and
asymmetric quark masses respectively. The lowest-lying mass spectra of mesons
with quark contents b_bbar, c_bbar, s_bbar, and c_cbar are determined, together
with the pseudoscalar decay constants. Our results are sumarized in Tables 1-5.
Furthermore, we also determine the b and c quark masses in the MS_bar scheme,
m_b = 4.65(5) GeV, and m_c = 1.16(4) GeV.
