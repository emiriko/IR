We introduce our publicly available Wide-Field-Imaging reduction pipeline
THELI. The procedures applied for the efficient pre-reduction and astrometric
calibration are presented. A special emphasis is put on the methods applied to
the photometric calibration. As a test case the reduction of optical data from
the ESO Deep Public Survey including the WFI-GOODS data is described. The
end-products of this project are now available via the ESO archive Advanced
Data Products section.
