We analyze an optimal control problem for systems of integral equations of
Volterra type with two independent variables. These systems generalize both,
the hyperbolic control problems for systems of Goursat-Darboux type, and the
optimal control of ordinary (i.e. with one independent variable) Volterra
integral equations. We prove extremal principles akin to Pontryagin's maximum
principle.
