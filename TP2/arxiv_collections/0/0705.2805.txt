We investigated the ferroelectric properties of strontium titanate (STO) thin
films deposited on SrTiO3 (001) substrate with SrRuO3 electrodes. The STO layer
was grown coherently on the SrTiO3 substrate without in-plane lattice
relaxation, but its out-of-plane lattice constant increased with a decrease in
the oxygen pressure during deposition. Using piezoresponse force microscopy and
P-V measurements, we showed that our tetragonal STO films possess
room-temperature ferroelectricity. We discuss the possible origins of the
observed ferroelectricity.
