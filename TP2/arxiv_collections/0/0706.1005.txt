Current research on micro-mechanical resonators strives for quantum-limited
detection of the motion of macroscopic objects. Prerequisite to this goal is
the observation of measurement backaction consistent with quantum metrology
limits. However, thermal noise presently dominates measurements and precludes
ground-state preparation of the resonator. Here we establish the collective
motion of an ultracold atomic gas confined tightly within a Fabry-Perot optical
cavity as a system for investigating the quantum mechanics of macroscopic
bodies. The cavity-mode structure selects a single collective vibrational mode
that is measured by the cavity's optical properties, actuated by the cavity
optical field, and subject to backaction by the quantum force fluctuations of
this field. Experimentally, we quantify such fluctuations by measuring the
cavity-light-induced heating of the intracavity atomic ensemble. These
measurements represent the first observation of backaction on a macroscopic
mechanical resonator at the standard quantum limit.
