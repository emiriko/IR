Single production of the doubly charged scalars $\Phi^{\pm\pm}$ via
$e\gamma$, $ep$ and $pp$ collisions is studied in the context of the little
Higgs$(LH)$ model. Our numerical results show that the new particles
$\Phi^{\pm\pm}$ can be abundantly produced and their possible signatures should
be detected in future high energy linear $e^{+}e^{-}$ collider$(ILC)$. The
cross section for single production of $\Phi^{\pm\pm}$ at the $LHC$ is much
smaller than that at the $ILC$ or the $THERA$.
