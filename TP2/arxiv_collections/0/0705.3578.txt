As contrasted with physicists to idolize Bell's theorem and quantum
nonlocality, we argue that quantum mechanics (QM), in reality, respects the
principles of a macroscopic realism (PMRs). The current QM to tell us that "...
the state of a system can be instantaneously changed by a distant measurement
>..." cannot be treated as a physical theory. Its key statements - that the
EPR-Bell experiments to violate Bell's inequality verify nonlocality, and
nonlocal correlations respect special relativity - are false. Both the EPR-Bell
experiments and theorems to support the "non-signalling principle" are based on
the implicit assumption that all quantum postulates and, in particular, Born's
averaging rule are fully applicable to Cat states. However, this is not the
case. Introducing observables (e.g., correlations) for Cat states violates the
correspondence principle. Pure (macro- and micro-)Cat states must be governed
both by the PMRs and superposition principle. Our (macrorealistic) model of a
one-dimensional completed scattering shows how these principles coexist with
each other, in the case of a one-electron micro-Cat state.
