We compute one of the bulk viscosity coefficients of cold CFL quark matter in
the temperature regime where the contribution of mesons, quarks and gluons to
transport phenomena is Boltzmann suppressed. In that regime dissipation occurs
due to collisions of superfluid phonons, the Goldstone modes associated to the
spontaneous breaking of baryon symmetry. We first review the hydrodynamics of
relativistic superfluids, and remind that there are at least three bulk
viscosity coefficients in these systems. We then compute the bulk viscosity
coefficient associated to the normal fluid component of the superfluid. In our
analysis we use Son's effective field theory for the superfluid phonon, amended
to include scale breaking effects proportional to the square of the strange
quark mass m_s. We compute the bulk viscosity at leading order in the scale
breaking parameter, and find that it is dominated by collinear splitting and
joining processes. The resulting transport coefficient is zeta=0.011 m_s^4/T,
growing at low temperature T until the phonon fluid description stops making
sense. Our results are relevant to study the rotational properties of a compact
star formed by CFL quark matter.
