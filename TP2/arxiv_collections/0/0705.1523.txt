We study a model ecosystem by means of dynamical techniques from disordered
systems theory. The model describes a set of species subject to competitive
interactions through a background of resources, which they feed upon.
Additionally direct competitive or co-operative interaction between species may
occur through a random coupling matrix. We compute the order parameters of the
system in a fixed point regime, and identify the onset of instability and
compute the phase diagram. We focus on the effects of variability of resources,
direct interaction between species, co-operation pressure and dilution on the
stability and the diversity of the ecosystem. It is shown that resources can be
exploited optimally only in absence of co-operation pressure or direct
interaction between species.
