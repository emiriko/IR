Within a general theoretical framework we study the effective,
deformation-induced interaction between two colloidal particles trapped at a
fluid interface in the regime of small deformations. In many studies, this
interaction has been computed with the ansatz that the actual interface
configuration for the pair is given by the linear superposition of the
interface deformations around the single particles. Here we assess the validity
of this approach and compute the leading term of the effective interaction for
large interparticle separation beyond this so-called superposition
approximation. As an application, we consider the experimentally relevant case
of interface deformations owing to the electrostatic field emanating from
charged colloidal particles. In mechanical isolation, i.e., if the net force
acting on the total system consisting of the particles plus the interface
vanishes, the superposition approximation is actually invalid. The effective
capillary interaction is governed by contributions beyond this approximation
and turns out to be attractive. For sufficiently small surface charges on the
colloids, such that linearization is strictly valid, and at asymptotically
large separations, the effective interaction does not overcome the direct
electrostatic repulsion between the colloidal particles.
