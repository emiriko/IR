We analyze the branching ratios of B to D(*) + Ds0*(Ds1) decays using the
factorization hypothesis. The B to D(*) transition form factors are taken from
a model-independent analysis done by Caprini, Lellouch and Neubert based on
heavy quark spin symmetry and dispersive constraints, including short-distance
and power corrections. The leptonic decay constants fDs0* and fDs1 are
calculated assuming a molecular structure for the Ds0* and Ds1 mesons. The
calculated branching ratios of B-meson two-body decays are compared with
experimental data and other theoretical results.
