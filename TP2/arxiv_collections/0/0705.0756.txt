A covariant gauge independent derivation of the generalized dispersion
relation of electromagnetic waves in a medium with local and linear
constitutive law is presented. A generalized photon propagator is derived. For
Maxwell constitutive tensor, the standard light cone structure and the standard
Feynman propagator are reinstated.
