This paper extends the inductive approach to the lace expansion of van der
Hofstad and Slade in order to prove Gaussian asymptotic behaviour for models
with critical dimension other than 4. The results are applied by Holmes to
study sufficiently spread-out lattice trees in dimensions d>8 and may also be
applicable to percolation in dimensions d>6.
