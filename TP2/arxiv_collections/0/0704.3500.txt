In object-oriented or object-relational databases such as multimedia
databases or most XML databases, access patterns are not static, i.e.,
applications do not always access the same objects in the same order
repeatedly. However, this has been the way these databases and associated
optimisation techniques such as clustering have been evaluated up to now. This
paper opens up research regarding this issue by proposing a dynamic object
evaluation framework (DOEF). DOEF accomplishes access pattern change by
defining configurable styles of change. It is a preliminary prototype that has
been designed to be open and fully extensible. Though originally designed for
the object-oriented model, it can also be used within the object-relational
model with few adaptations. Furthermore, new access pattern change models can
be added too. To illustrate the capabilities of DOEF, we conducted two
different sets of experiments. In the first set of experiments, we used DOEF to
compare the performances of four state of the art dynamic clustering
algorithms. The results show that DOEF is effective at determining the
adaptability of each dynamic clustering algorithm to changes in access pattern.
They also led us to conclude that dynamic clustering algorithms can cope with
moderate levels of access pattern change, but that performance rapidly degrades
to be worse than no clustering when vigorous styles of access pattern change
are applied. In the second set of experiments, we used DOEF to compare the
performance of two different object stores: Platypus and SHORE. The use of DOEF
exposed the poor swapping performance of Platypus.
