We present the cluster-type entangled coherent states (CTECS) and discuss
their properties. A cavity QED generation scheme using suitable choices of
atom-cavity interactions, obtained via detunings adjustments and the
application of classical external fields, is also presented. After the
realization of simple atomic measurements, CTECS representing nonlocal
electromagnetic fields in separate cavities can be generated.
