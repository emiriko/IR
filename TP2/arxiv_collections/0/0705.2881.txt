Wind shortwave instability of a foam layer between the atmosphere and the
ocean is examined in order to reach greater understanding of the recent
findings of the decrease in momentum transfer from hurricane winds to sea
waves. The three-fluid configuration with the high contrasts in densities of
the air, foam and water provides for an effective mechanism to stabilize the
water surface.
