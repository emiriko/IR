We present and analyse a Monte-Carlo algorithm to compute the minimal
polynomial of an $n\times n$ matrix over a finite field that requires $O(n^3)$
field operations and O(n) random vectors, and is well suited for successful
practical implementation. The algorithm, and its complexity analysis, use
standard algorithms for polynomial and matrix operations. We compare features
of the algorithm with several other algorithms in the literature. In addition
we present a deterministic verification procedure which is similarly efficient
in most cases but has a worst-case complexity of $O(n^4)$. Finally, we report
the results of practical experiments with an implementation of our algorithms
in comparison with the current algorithms in the {\sf GAP} library.
