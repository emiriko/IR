We present the results of an optical lightcurve survey of 114 Jovian Trojan
asteroids conducted to determine the fraction of contact binaries.
Sparse-sampling was used to assess the photometric range of the asteroids and
those showing the largest ranges were targeted for detailed follow-up
observations. This survey led to the discovery of two Trojan asteroids, (17365)
and (29314) displaying large lightcurve ranges (~1 magnitude) and long rotation
periods (< 2 rotations per day consistent with a contact binary nature. The
optical lightcurves of both asteroids are well matched by Roche binary
equilibrium models. Using these binary models, we find low densities of ~600
kg/m^3 and 800 kg/m^3, suggestive of porous interiors. The fraction of contact
binaries is estimated to be between 6% and 10%, comparable to the fraction in
the Kuiper Belt. The total binary fraction in the Trojan clouds (including both
wide and close pairs) must be higher.
