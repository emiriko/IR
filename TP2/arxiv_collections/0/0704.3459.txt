When CP asymmetries in $B^0(t)\to \pi^+ \pi^-$ are combined using broken
flavor SU(3) with decay rates for $B^+\to K^0\pi^+$ and/or $B^0\to K^+\pi^-$,
one can obtain stringent limits on the weak phase $\gamma$ which are consistent
with those obtained from other CKM constraints. Experimental data in the past
few years have improved to the extent that systematic errors associated with
uncertainty in SU(3) symmetry breaking dominate the determination of $\gamma$.
We obtain a value $\gamma =(73 \pm 4^{+10}_{-8})^\circ$, where the first error
is statistical while the second one is systematic.
