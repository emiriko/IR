Molecular dynamics simulations are used to investigate the influence of
molecular-scale surface roughness on the slip behavior in thin liquid films.
The slip length increases almost linearly with the shear rate for atomically
smooth rigid walls and incommensurate structures of the liquid/solid interface.
The thermal fluctuations of the wall atoms lead to an effective surface
roughness, which makes the slip length weakly dependent on the shear rate. With
increasing the elastic stiffness of the wall, the surface roughness smoothes
out and the strong rate dependence is restored again. Both periodically and
randomly corrugated rigid surfaces reduce the slip length and its shear rate
dependence.
