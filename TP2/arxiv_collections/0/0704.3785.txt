In this paper we consider the question of whether the doubling character of a
measure supported on a subset of $\RR^m$ determines the regularity of its
support (in a classical sense). This problem was studied by David, Kenig and
Toro for codimension 1 sets under the assumption that the support be flat. Here
we study the higher codimension case and remove the flatness hypothesis.
