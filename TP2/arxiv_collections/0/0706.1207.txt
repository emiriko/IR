Using effective Lagrangian arguments, I explore the qualitative behavior
expected at finite temperature for two flavor lattice QCD formulated with
Wilson fermions and a twisted mass term. A rather rich phase structure is
predicted, exhibiting Aoki's parity violating phase along with a deconfinement
region forming a conical structure in the space of coupling, hopping parameter,
and twisted mass variables.
