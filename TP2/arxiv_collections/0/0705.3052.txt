We present a semi-analytic model for shaping the nebula around eta Carinae
that accounts for the simultaneous production of bipolar lobes and an
equatorial disk through a rotating surface explosion. Material is launched
normal to the surface of an oblate rotating star with an initial kick velocity
that scales approximately with the local escape speed. Thereafter, ejecta
follow ballistic orbital trajectories, feeling only a central force
corresponding to a radiatively reduced gravity. Our model is conceptually
similar to the wind-compressed disk model of Bjorkman & Cassinelli, but we
modify it to an explosion instead of a steady line-driven wind, we include a
rotationally-distorted star, and we treat the dynamics somewhat differently.
Continuum-driving avoids the disk inhibition that normally operates in
line-driven winds. Our model provides a simple method by which rotating hot
stars can simultaneously produce intrinsically bipolar and equatorial mass
ejections, without an aspherical environment or magnetic fields. Although
motivated by eta Carinae, the model may have generic application to other LBVs,
B[e] stars, or SN1987A's nebula. When near-Eddington radiative driving is less
influential, our model generalizes to produce bipolar morphologies without
disks, as seen in many PNe.
