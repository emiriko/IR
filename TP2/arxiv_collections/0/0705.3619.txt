A new class of solutions of Einstein field equations has been investigated
for inhomogeneous cylindrically symmetric space-time with string source. To get
the deterministic solution, it has been assumed that the expansion ($\theta$)
in the model is proportional to the eigen value $\sigma^{1}_{1}$ of the shear
tensor $\sigma^{i}_{j}$. Certain physical and geometric properties of the
models are also discussed.
