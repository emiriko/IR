I review recent developements in lattice QCD at finite temperature, including
the determination of the transition temperature T_c, equation of state and
diffenet static screening lengths. The lattice data suggest that at
temperatures above 1.5T_c the quark gluon plasma can be considered as gas
consisting of quarks and gluons.
