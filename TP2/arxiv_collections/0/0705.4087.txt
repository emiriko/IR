Zero- and longitudinal-field muon spin relaxation (MuSR) experiments have
been carried out in the alloy series Pr(Os1-xRux)4Sb12 and Pr1-yLayOs4Sb12 to
elucidate the anomalous dynamic muon spin relaxation observed in these
materials. The damping rate associated with this relaxation varies with
temperature, applied magnetic field, and dopant concentrations x and y in a
manner consistent with the ``hyperfine enhancement'' of 141Pr nuclear spins
first discussed by Bleaney in 1973. This mechanism arises from Van Vleck-like
admixture of magnetic Pr3+ crystalline-electric-field-split excited states into
the nonmagnetic singlet ground state by the nuclear hyperfine coupling, thereby
increasing the strengths of spin-spin interactions between 141Pr and muon spins
and within the 141Pr spin system. We find qualitative agreement with this
scenario, and conclude that electronic spin fluctuations are not directly
involved in the dynamic muon spin relaxation.
