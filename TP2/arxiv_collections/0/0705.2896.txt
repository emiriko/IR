This paper reviews some of the most recent results from CDF and D0
experiments on searches for supersymmetry (SUSY) at the Tevatron. We focus on
searches for chargino/neutralino, stop, sbottom, and long lived massive SUSY
particles, on data samples up to ~1 fb-1. No signal was observed, and
constraints are set on the SUSY parameter space.
