We study the oxygen doping dependence of the equilibrium first-order melting
and second-order glass transitions of vortices in
Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$. Doping affects both anisotropy and
disorder. Anisotropy scaling is shown to collapse the melting lines only where
thermal fluctuations are dominant. Yet, in the region where disorder breaks
that scaling, the glass lines are still collapsed. A quantitative fit to
melting and replica symmetry breaking lines of a 2D Ginzburg-Landau model
further reveals that disorder amplitude weakens with doping, but to a lesser
degree than thermal fluctuations, enhancing the relative role of disorder.
