A quasar search in the region of the active galaxy NGC 1097 yielded 31
quasars in 1984. After completion of the 2dF survey in 2004 the number of
catalogued quasars just within 1 degree of the galaxy increased to 142. About
38 $\pm$ 10 of these are in excess of average background values.
  The evidence in 1984 is confirmed here by an increasing density of quasars as
one approaches NGC 1097. Quasars within 1 degree differ from the background by
being significantly brighter. There also appear two elliptical rings or arcs of
quasars at r $\sim$ 20'and 40'.
