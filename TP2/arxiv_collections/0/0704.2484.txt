Superfluid 3He-A shares the properties of spin nematic and chiral orbital
ferromagnet. Its order parameter is characterized by two vectors d and l. This
doubly anisotropic superfluid, when it is confined in aerogel, represents the
most interesting example of a system with continuous symmetry in the presence
of random anisotropy disorder. We discuss the Larkin-Imry-Ma state, which is
characterized by the short-range orientational order of the vector l, while the
long-range orientational order is destroyed by the collective action of the
randomly oriented aerogel strings. On the other hand, sufficiently large
regular anisotropy produced either by the deformation of the aerogel or by
applied superflow suppresses the Larkin-Imry-Ma effect leading to the uniform
orientation of the vector l. This interplay of regular and random anisotropy
allows us to study many different effects.
