In a recent work [Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 023004 (2007)] we have investigated
the influence of attractive van der Waals interaction on the pair distribution
and Penning ionization dynamics of ultracold Rydberg gases. Here we extend this
description to atoms initially prepared in Rydberg states exhibiting repulsive
interaction. We present calculations based on a Monte Carlo algorithm to
simulate the dynamics of many atoms under the influence of both repulsive and
attractive longrange interatomic forces. Redistribution to nearby states
induced by black body radiation is taken into account, changing the effective
interaction potentials. The model agrees with experimental observations, where
the ionization rate is found to increase when the excitation laser is
blue-detuned from the atomic resonance.
