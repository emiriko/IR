Spin-polarized currents can transfer spin angular momentum to a ferromagnet,
generating a torque that can efficiently reorient its magnetization. Achieving
quantitative measurements of the spin-transfer-torque vector in magnetic tunnel
junctions (MTJs) is important for understanding fundamental mechanisms
affecting spin-dependent tunneling, and for developing magnetic memories and
nanoscale microwave oscillators. Here we present direct measurements of both
the magnitude and direction of the spin torque in Co60Fe20B20/MgO/Co60Fe20B20
MTJs. At low bias V, the differential torque vector d{tau}/dV lies in the plane
defined by the electrode magnetizations, and its magnitude is in excellent
agreement with a prediction for highly-spin-polarized tunneling. With
increasing bias, the in-plane component d{tau}_{parallel}/dV remains large, in
striking contrast to the decreasing magnetoresistance ratio. The differential
torque vector also rotates out of the plane under bias; we measure a
perpendicular component tau_{perp}(V) with bias dependence proportional to V^2
for low V, that becomes as large as 30% of the in-plane torque.
