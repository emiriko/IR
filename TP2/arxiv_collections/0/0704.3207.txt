The impact of filling up the Fermi sphere with the quarks, which dynamically
generated their masses on the instanton liquid at finite temperature and
baryonic/quark number density, is investigated. It is demonstrated, in
particular, that the boundary of chiral symmetry restoration phase transition
is shifted to the larger (about 100 MeV more) value of quark chemical potential
compared to the magnitude inherent in the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model.
