In this paper, we present a spatial version of phytoplankton-zooplankton
model that includes some important factors such as external periodic forces,
noise, and diffusion processes. The spatially extended
phytoplankton-zooplankton system is from the original study by Scheffer [M
Scheffer, Fish and nutrients interplay determines algal biomass: a minimal
model, Oikos \textbf{62} (1991) 271-282]. Our results show that the spatially
extended system exhibit a resonant patterns and frequency-locking phenomena.
The system also shows that the noise and the external periodic forces play a
constructive role in the Scheffer's model: first, the noise can enhance the
oscillation of phytoplankton species' density and format a large clusters in
the space when the noise intensity is within certain interval. Second, the
external periodic forces can induce 4:1 and 1:1 frequency-locking and spatially
homogeneous oscillation phenomena to appear. Finally, the resonant patterns are
observed in the system when the spatial noises and external periodic forces are
both turned on. Moreover, we found that the 4:1 frequency-locking transform
into 1:1 frequency-locking when the noise intensity increased. In addition to
elucidating our results outside the domain of Turing instability, we provide
further analysis of Turing linear stability with the help of the numerical
calculation by using the Maple software. Significantly, oscillations are
enhanced in the system when the noise term presents. These results indicate
that the oceanic plankton bloom may partly due to interplay between the
stochastic factors and external forces instead of deterministic factors. These
results also may help us to understand the effects arising from undeniable
subject to random fluctuations in oceanic plankton bloom.
