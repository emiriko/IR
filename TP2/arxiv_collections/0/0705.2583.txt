The correlation matrix (CM) criterion is a recently derived powerful
sufficient condition for the presence of entanglement in bipartite quantum
states of arbitrary dimensions. It has been shown that it can be stronger than
the positive partial transpose (PPT) criterion, as well as the computable cross
norm or realignment (CCNR) criterion in different situations. However, it
remained as an open question whether there existed sets of states for which the
CM criterion could be stronger than both criteria simultaneously. Here, we give
an affirmative answer to this question by providing examples of entangled
states that scape detection by both the PPT and CCNR criteria whose
entanglement is revealed by the CM condition. We also show that the CM can be
used to measure the entanglement of pure states and obtain lower bounds for the
entanglement measure known as tangle for general (mixed) states.
