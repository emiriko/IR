A random matrix model to describe the coupling of m-fold symmetry in
constructed. The particular threefold case is used to analyze data on
eigenfrequencies of elastomechanical vibration of an anisotropic quartz block.
It is suggested that such experimental/theoretical study may supply powerful
means to discern intrinsic symmetries in physical systems.
