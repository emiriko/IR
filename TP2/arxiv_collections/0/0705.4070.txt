Time variability of the solar neutrino flux especially in the low and
intermediate energy sector remains an open question and, if it exists, it is
likely to be originated from the magnetic moment transition from active to
light sterile neutrinos at times of intense solar activity and magnetic field.
We examine the prospects for the SNO+ experiment to address this important
issue and to distinguish between the two classes of solar models which are
currently identified as corresponding to a high (SSM I) and a low (SSM II)
heavy element abundance. We also evaluate the predictions from these two models
for the Chlorine experiment event rate in the standard LMA and LMA+Spin Flavour
Precession (SFP) scenarios. It is found that after three years of SNO+ data
taking, the pep flux measurement will be able to discriminate between the
standard LMA and LMA+SFP scenarios, independently of which is the correct solar
model. If the LMA rate is measured, SFP with $B_0 \sim 280kG$ for the resonant
$\Delta m^2_{01}$ can be excluded at more than $4\sigma$. A low rate would
signal new physics, excluding all the 90% allowed range of the standard LMA
solution at 3$\sigma$, and a time variability would be a strong signature of
the SFP model. The CNO fluxes are the ones for which the two SSM predictions
exhibit the largest differences, so their measurement at SNO+ will be important
to favour one or the other. The distinction will be clearer after LMA or SFP
are confirmed with pep, but still, a CNO measurement at the level of SSM I/LMA
will disfavour SSM II at about $3 \sigma$. We conclude that consistency between
future pep and CNO flux measurements at SNO+ and Chlorine would either favour
an LMA+SFP scenario or favour SSM II over SSM I.
