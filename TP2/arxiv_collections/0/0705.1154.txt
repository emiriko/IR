A scenario combining a model of early (TeV) unification of quarks and leptons
with the physics of large extra dimensions provides a natural mechanism linking
quark and lepton masses at TeV scale. This has been dubbed as early
quark-lepton mass unification by one of us (PQH) in one of the two models of
early quark-lepton unification, which are consistent with data, namely SU(4)_PS
\otimes SU(2)_L \otimes SU(2)_R \otimes SU(2)_H. In particular, it focused on
the issue of naturally light Dirac neutrino. The present paper will focus on
similar issues in the other model, namely SU(4)_PS \otimes SU(3)_L \otimes
SU(3)_H.
