We study phonons in a dynamical chain of ions confined by a trap with a
time-dependent (axial) potential strength and demonstrate that they behave in
the same way as quantum fields in an expanding/contracting universe. Based on
this analogy, we present a scheme for the detection of the analogue of
cosmological particle creation which should be feasible with present-day
technology. In order to test the quantum nature of the particle creation
mechanism and to distinguish it from classical effects such as heating, we
propose to measure the two-phonon amplitude via the $2^{\rm nd}$ red side-band
and to compare it with the one-phonon amplitude ($1^{\rm st}$ red side-band).
