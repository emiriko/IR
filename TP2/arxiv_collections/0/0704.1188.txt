We investigate the quark spectrum in the quark-gluon plasma phase near color
superconducting (CS) and chiral phase transitions. Owing to the precursory soft
modes of the phase transitions, there appear novel excitaion spectra: In the CS
transition, the quark matter shows non-Fermi liquid behavior and leads to the
pseudogap in the density of states of quarks. In the chiral transition, three
collective excitations appear in the quark spectrum.
