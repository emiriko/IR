A gauge theory of gravity based on a nonlinear realization (NLR) of the local
Conform-Affine (CA) group of symmetry transformations is presented. The coframe
fields and gauge connections of the theory are obtained. The tetrads and
Lorentz group metric are used to induce a spacetime metric. The inhomogenously
transforming (under the Lorentz group) connection coefficients serve as
gravitational gauge potentials used to define covariant derivatives
accommodating minimal coupling of matter and gauge fields. On the other hand,
the tensor valued connection forms serve as auxillary dynamical fields
associated with the dilation, special conformal and deformational (shear)
degrees of freedom inherent in the bundle manifold. The bundle curvature of the
theory is determined. Boundary topological invariants are constructed. They
serve as a prototype (source free) gravitational Lagrangian. The Bianchi
identities, covariant field equations and gauge currents are obtained.
