In the context of measuring structure and morphology of intermediate redshift
galaxies with recent HST/ACS surveys, we tune, test, and compare two widely
used fitting codes (GALFIT and GIM2D) for fitting single-component Sersic
models to the light profiles of both simulated and real galaxy data. We find
that fitting accuracy depends sensitively on galaxy profile shape. Exponential
disks are well fit with Sersic models and have small measurement errors,
whereas fits to de Vaucouleurs profiles show larger uncertainties owing to the
large amount of light at large radii. We find that both codes provide reliable
fits and little systematic error, when the effective surface brightness is
above that of the sky. Moreover, both codes return errors that significantly
underestimate the true fitting uncertainties, which are best estimated with
simulations. We find that GIM2D suffers significant systematic errors for
spheroids with close companions owing to the difficulty of effectively masking
out neighboring galaxy light; there appears to be no work around to this
important systematic in GIM2D's current implementation. While this crowding
error affects only a small fraction of galaxies in GEMS, it must be accounted
for in the analysis of deeper cosmological images or of more crowded fields
with GIM2D. In contrast, GALFIT results are robust to the presence of neighbors
because it can simultaneously fit the profiles of multiple companions thereby
deblending their effect on the fit to the galaxy of interest. We find GALFIT's
robustness to nearby companions and factor of >~20 faster runtime speed are
important advantages over GIM2D for analyzing large HST/ACS datasets. Finally
we include our final catalog of fit results for all 41,495 objects detected in
GEMS.
