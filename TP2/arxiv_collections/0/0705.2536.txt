A model of Universe with a small eccentricity due to the presence of a
magnetic field at the decoupling time (i.e. an Ellipsoidal Universe) has been
recently proposed for the solution of the low quadrupole anomaly of the angular
power spectrum of cosmic microwave background anisotropies. We present a
complete statistical analysis of that model showing that the probability of
increasing of the amplitude of the quadrupole is larger than the probability of
decreasing in the whole parameters' space.
