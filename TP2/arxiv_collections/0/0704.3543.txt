DAMA is an observatory for rare processes and it is operative deep
underground at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory of the I.N.F.N. (LNGS). Here
some arguments will be presented on the investigation on dark matter particles
by annual modulation signature and on some of the realized double beta decay
searches.
