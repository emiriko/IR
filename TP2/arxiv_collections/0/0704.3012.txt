We present the first strong lensing study of the mass distribution in the
cluster MS 2053-04 based on HST archive data. This massive, X-ray luminous
cluster has a redshift z=0.583, and it is composed of two structures that are
gravitationally bound to each other. The cluster has one multiply imaged system
constituted by a double gravitational arc.
  We have performed a parametric strong lensing mass reconstruction using NFW
density profiles to model the cluster potential. We also included perturbations
from 23 galaxies, modeled like elliptical singular isothermal sphere, that are
approximately within 1'x1' around the cluster center. These galaxies were
constrained in both the geometric and dynamical parameters with observational
data. Our analysis predicts a third image which is slightly demagnified. We
found a candidate for this counter-image near the expected position and with
the same F702W-F814W colors as the gravitational arcs in the cluster. The
results from the strong lensing model shows the complex structure in this
cluster, the asymmetry and the elongation in the mass distribution, and are
consistent with previous spectrophotometric results that indicate that the
cluster has a bimodal mass distribution. Finally, the derived mass profile was
used to estimate the mass within the arcs and for comparison with X-ray
estimates.
