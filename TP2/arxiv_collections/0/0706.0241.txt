A dynamic cluster quantum Monte Carlo algorithm is used to study a spin
susceptibility representation of the pairing interaction for the
two-dimensional Hubbard model with an on-site Coulomb interaction equal to the
bandwidth for various doping levels. We find that the pairing interaction is
well approximated by ${3/2}\Ub(T)^2\chi(K-K')$ with an effective temperature
and doping dependent coupling $\Ub(T)$ and the numerically calculated spin
susceptibility $\chi(K-K')$. We show that at low temperatures, $\Ub$ may be
accurately determined from a corresponding spin susceptibility based
calculation of the single-particle self-energy. We conclude that the strength
of the d-wave pairing interaction, characterized by the mean-field transition
temperature, can be determined from a knowledge of the dressed spin
susceptibility and the nodal quasiparticle spectral weight. This has important
implications with respect to the questions of whether spin fluctuations are
responsible for pairing in the high-T$_c$ cuprates.
