We discuss fermion masses and mixings in models derived from orbifold GUTs
such that gauge coupling unification is achieved without low energy
supersymmetry by utilizing a non-canonical U(1)_Y. A gauged U(1)_X flavor
symmetry plays an essential role, and the Green-Schwarz mechanism is invoked in
anomaly cancellations. Models containing vector-like particles with masses
close to M_{GUT} are also discussed.
