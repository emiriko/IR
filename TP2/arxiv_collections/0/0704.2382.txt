A spectroscopic method for staggered fermions based on thermodynamical
considerations is proposed. The canonical partition functions corresponding to
the different quark number sectors are expressed in the low temperature limit
as polynomials of the eigenvalues of the reduced fermion matrix. Taking the
zero temperature limit yields the masses of the lowest states. The method is
successfully applied to the Goldstone pion and both dynamical and quenched
results are presented showing good agreement with that of standard
spectroscopy. Though in principle the method can be used to obtain the baryon
and dibaryon masses, due to their high computational costs such calculations
are practically unreachable.
