All core collapse supernovae are strongly aspherical. The "Bochum event,"
with velocity components displaced symmetrically about the principal H$\alpha$
line, strongly suggests that SN 1987A was a bi-polar rather than a uni-polar
explosion. While there is a general tendency to display a single prominant axis
in images and spectropolarimetry, there is also growing evidence for frequent
departures from axisymmetry. There are various mechanisms that might contribute
to large scale departures from spherical symmetry: jet-induced processes, the
spherical shock accretion instability (SASI) and associated phenomena, and
non-axisymmetric instabilities (NAXI). The MRI gives inevitable production of
large toroidal magnetic fields. In sum: no $\Omega$ without B. The role of
magnetic fields, non-axisymmetric instabilities, and of the de-leptonization
phase are discussed.
