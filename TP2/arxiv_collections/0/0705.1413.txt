With the knowledge of diffractive parton densities extracted from HERA data,
we discuss the observation of exclusive events using the dijet mass fraction as
measured by the CDF collaboration at the Tevatron. In particular the impact of
the gluon density uncertainty is analysed. Some prospects are given for
diffractive physics at the LHC.
