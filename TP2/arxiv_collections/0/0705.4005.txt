We study the mathematical evolution of a liquid fuel droplet inside a vessel.
In particular, we analyze the evolution of the droplet radius on a finite time
interval. The model problem involves an hyperbolic system coupled with the
pressure and velocity of the surrounding gas. Existence of bounded solutions
for the mass fraction of the liquid, submitted to nonlinear constraints, is
shown. Numerical simulations are given, in agreement with known physical
experiments.
