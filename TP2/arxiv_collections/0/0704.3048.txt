Assuming the Dirac-type neutrino masses m_D are related to quark or charged
lepton masses, neutrino oscillation data indicate that right handed neutrino
masses are in general strongly hierarchical. In particular, if m_D is similar
to the up-type quark masses, the mass of the lightest right handed neutrino
M_1<~10^6 GeV. We show that non-thermal leptogenesis by inflaton decay can
yield sufficient baryon asymmetry despite this constraint, and discuss how the
asymmetry is correlated with the low energy neutrino masses and CP-violating
phases.
