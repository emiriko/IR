We present a model improving the two-angle model for interphase chromatin
(E2A model). This model takes into account the cylindrical shape of the histone
octamers, the H1 histones in front of the nucleosomes and the vertical distance
$d$ between the in and outgoing DNA strands. Factoring these chromatin features
in, one gets essential changes in the chromatin phase diagram: Not only the
shape of the excluded-volume borderline changes but also the vertical distance
$d$ has a dramatic influence on the forbidden area. Furthermore, we examined
the influence of H1 defects on the properties of the chromatin fiber. Thus we
present two possible strategies for chromatin compaction: The use of very dense
states in the phase diagram in the gaps in the excluded volume borderline or
missing H1 histones which can lead to very compact fibers. The chromatin fiber
might use both of these mechanisms to compact itself at least locally. Line
densities computed within the model coincident with the experimental values.
