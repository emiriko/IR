The evolution of multicellular organisms from monocellular ancestors
represents one of the greatest advances of the history of life. The assembly of
such multicellular organisms requires signalling and response between cells:
over millions of years these signalling processes have become extremely
sophisticated and refined by evolution, such that study of modern organisms may
not be able to shed much light on the original ancient processes . Here we are
interested in determining how simple a signalling method can be, while still
achieving self-assembly. In 2D a coupled cellular automaton/differential
equation approach models organisms and chemotaxic chemicals, producing
spiralling aggregation. In 3D Lennard-Jones-like particles are used to
represent single cells, and their evolution in response to signalling is
followed by molecular dynamics. It is found that if a single cell is able to
emit a signal which induces others to move towards it, then a colony of
single-cell organisms can assemble into shapes as complex as a tower, a ball
atop a stalk, or a fast-moving slug. The similarity with the behaviour of
modern Dictyostelium slime molds signalling with cyclic adenosine monophosphate
(cAMP) is striking.
