We treat a relative version of the main theorem in my previous paper: A
transcendental approach to Koll\'ar's injectivity theorem. More explicitly, we
give a curvature condition that implies Koll\'ar type cohomology injectivity
theorems in the relative setting. To carry out this generalization, we use the
Ohsawa-Takegoshi twisted version of Nakano's identity.
