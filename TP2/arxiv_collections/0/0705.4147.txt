In this paper we have considered the Universe to be filled with Modified Gas
and the Cosmological Constant $\Lambda$ to be time-dependent with or without
the Gravitational Constant $G$ to be time-dependent. We have considered various
phenomenological models for $\Lambda$, viz., $\Lambda\propto\rho,
\Lambda\propto\frac{\dot{a}^{2}}{a^{2}}$ and
$\Lambda\propto\frac{\ddot{a}}{a}$. Using these models it is possible to show
the accelerated expansion of the Universe at the present epoch. Also we have
shown the natures of $G$ and $\Lambda$ over the total age of the Universe.
Using the statefinder parameters we have shown the diagramamtical
representation of the evolution of the Universe starting from radiation era to
$\Lambda$CDM model.
