We have discovered a long radio trail at 843 MHz which is apparently
associated with middle age pulsar PSR J1509-5850. The radio trail has a length
of ~7 arcmin. In X-rays, Chandra observations of PSR J1509-5850 reveal an
associated X-ray trail which extends in the same orientation as the radio
trail. Moreover, two clumpy structures are observed along the radio trail. The
larger one is proposed to be the supernova remnant (SNR) candidate MSC
319.9-0.7. Faint X-ray enhancement at the position of the SNR candidate is
found in the Chandra data.
