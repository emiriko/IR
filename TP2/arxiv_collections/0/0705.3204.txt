Analysis of quantum dot structures is a current topic with important
applications in solid-state digital logic design, quantum information
technology and quantum optics. In this work, we show a variational formulation
for the solution of the effective two-level approach of the analysis of
electron localization in two coupled quantum dots. Numerical results are
presented as well the use of electron localization in the realization of a
configurable logic circuit using quantum-dot cellular automata.
