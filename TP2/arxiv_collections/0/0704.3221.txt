RNA motifs typically consist of short, modular patterns that include base
pairs formed within and between modules. Estimating the abundance of these
patterns is of fundamental importance for assessing the statistical
significance of matches in genomewide searches, and for predicting whether a
given function has evolved many times in different species or arose from a
single common ancestor. In this manuscript, we review in an integrated and
self-contained manner some basic concepts of automata theory, generating
functions and transfer matrix methods that are relevant to pattern analysis in
biological sequences. We formalize, in a general framework, the concept of
Markov chain embedding to analyze patterns in random strings produced by a
memoryless source. This conceptualization, together with the capability of
automata to recognize complicated patterns, allows a systematic analysis of
problems related to the occurrence and frequency of patterns in random strings.
The applications we present focus on the concept of synchronization of
automata, as well as automata used to search for a finite number of keywords
(including sets of patterns generated according to base pairing rules) in a
general text.
