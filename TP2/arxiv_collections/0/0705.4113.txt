We present spectroscopic observations of the AndXII dwarf spheroidal galaxy
using DEIMOS/Keck-II, showing it to be moving rapidly through the Local Group
(-556 km/s heliocentric velocity, -281 km/s relative to Andromeda from the MW),
falling into the Local Group from ~115 kpc beyond Andromeda's nucleus. AndXII
therefore represents a dwarf galaxy plausibly falling into the Local Group for
the first time, and never having experienced a dense galactic environment. From
Green Bank Telescope observations, a limit on the H{I} gas mass of <3000 Msun
suggests that AndXII's gas could have been removed prior to experiencing the
tides of the Local Group galaxies. Orbit models suggest the dwarf is close to
the escape velocity of M31 for published mass models. AndXII is our best direct
evidence for the late infall of satellite galaxies, a prediction of
cosmological simulations.
