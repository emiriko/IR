The optimized single-particle wave functions contained in the parameters of
the Hubbard model (t and U) were determined for an infinite atomic chain. In
effect, the electronic properties of the chain as a function of interatomic
distance R were obtained and compared for the Lieb - Wu exact solution (LW),
the Gutzwiller-Wave-Function approximation (GWF), and the Gutzwiller-ansatz
case (GA). The ground state energy and other characteristics for the infinite
chain were also compared with those obtained earlier for a nanoscopic chain
within the Exact Diagonalization combined with an Ab Initio adjustment of the
single-particle wave functions in the correlated state (EDABI method). For the
sake of completeness, we briefly characterize also each of the solutions. Our
approach completes the Lieb-Wu solution, as it provides the system electronic
properties evolution as a function of physically controllable parameter - the
interatomic distance.
