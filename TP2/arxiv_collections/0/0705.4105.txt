We study localization properties of two-dimensional Dirac fermions subject to
a power-law-correlated random vector potential describing, e.g., the effect of
"ripples" in graphene. By using a variety of techniques (low-order perturbation
theory, self-consistent Born approximation, replicas, and supersymmetry) we
make a case for a possible complete localization of all the electronic states
and compute the density of states.
