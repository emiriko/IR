We discuss the abundance of Compton-thick AGN as estimated by the most recent
population synthesis models of the cosmic X-ray background. Only a small
fraction of these elusive objects have been detected so far, in line with the
model expectations. The advances expected by the broad band detectors on board
Suzaku are briefly reviewed.
