We find a protocol transmitting two quantum states crossly in the butterfly
network only with prior entanglement between two senders. This protocol
requires only one qubit transmission or two classical bits transmission in each
channel in the butterfly network. It is also proved that it is impossible
without prior entanglement. More precisely, an upper bound of average fidelity
is given in the butterfly network when prior entanglement is not allowed.
