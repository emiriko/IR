QUaD is a bolometric CMB polarimeter sited at the South Pole, operating at
frequencies of 100 and 150 GHz. In this paper we report preliminary results
from the first season of operation (austral winter 2005). All six CMB power
spectra are presented derived as cross spectra between the 100 and 150 GHz maps
using 67 days of observation in a low foreground region of approximately 60
square degrees. This data is a small fraction of the data acquired to date. The
measured spectra are consistent with the LCDM cosmological model. We perform
jackknife tests which indicate that the observed signal has negligible
contamination from instrumental systematics. In addition by using a frequency
jackknife we find no evidence for foreground contamination.
