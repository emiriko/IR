For general quantum systems the semiclassical behaviour of eigenfunctions in
relation to the ergodic properties of the underlying classical system is quite
difficult to understand. The Wignerfunctions of eigenstates converge weakly to
invariant measures of the classical system, the so called quantum limits, and
one would like to understand which invariant measures can occur that way,
thereby classifying the semiclassical behaviour of eigenfunctions. We introduce
a class of maps on the torus for whose quantisations we can understand the set
of quantum limits in great detail. In particular we can construct examples of
ergodic maps which have singular ergodic measures as quantum limits, and
examples of non-ergodic maps where arbitrary convex combinations of absolutely
continuous ergodic measures can occur as quantum limits. The maps we quantise
are obtained by cutting and stacking.
