The ground state of an externally confined one-component Yukawa plasma is
derived analytically using the local density approximation (LDA). In
particular, the radial density profile is computed. The results are compared
with the recently obtained mean-field (MF) density profile
\cite{henning.pre06}. While the MF results are more accurate for weak
screening, LDA with correlations included yields the proper description for
large screening. By comparison with first-principle simulations for
three-dimensional spherical Yukawa crystals we demonstrate that both
approximations complement each other. Together they accurately describe the
density profile in the full range of screening parameters.
