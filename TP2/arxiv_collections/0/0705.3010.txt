In this work we try to clarify the fundamental relationship between bits and
qubits, starting from very simple George Boole equation. We derive a generic
and compact expression for basis vectors of qubit which can be useful in
further applications. We also derive a generic form for the projection operator
in the quantum information space. The results are also extended to higher
d-level cases of qutrits and qudits.
