In this paper we present the creation of an Arabic version of Automated
Speech Recognition System (ASR). This system is based on the open source
Sphinx-4, from the Carnegie Mellon University. Which is a speech recognition
system based on discrete hidden Markov models (HMMs). We investigate the
changes that must be made to the model to adapt Arabic voice recognition.
