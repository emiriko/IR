Remarkably big increase of the substrate temperature during the
low-temperature MBE growth of GaMnAs layers is observed by means of band gap
spectroscopy. It is explained and simulated in terms of changes in the
absorption/emission characteristics of the growing layer. Options for the
temperature variation damping are discussed.
