Recently, [{arXiv:0810.3134}] is accepted and published. We show that local
realistic theories violate separability of $N$-qubit quantum states by a factor
of $3^N$. Thus we have a violation factor of 3 when N=1. Realistic theories
violate a proposition of a single qubit (a state with two-dimensional space)
system, the Bloch sphere machinery of quantum mechanics. Our method uses the
ratio of each of the scalar products. The maximal possible value of the scalar
product in local realistic theories grows exponentially larger than one in
$N$-qubit separable states when the number of qubits increases. We find the
violation factor $3^N$ when the measurement setup is entire range of settings
for each of the local observers.
