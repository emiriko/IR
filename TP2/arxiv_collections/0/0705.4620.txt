We present a new expression for the energy of the lowest collective states in
even-even nuclei throughout the entire periodic table. Our empirical formula is
extremely valid and holds universally for all of the natural parity even
multipole states. This formula depends only on the mass number and the valence
nucleon numbers with six parameters. These parameters are determined easily and
unambiguously from the data for each multipole state. We discuss the validity
of our empirical formula by comparing our results with those of other studies
and also by estimating the average and the dispersion of the logarithmic errors
of the calculated excitation energies with respect to the measured ones.
