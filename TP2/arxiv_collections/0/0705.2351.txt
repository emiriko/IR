This paper details the use of the IT Infrastructure Library Framework (ITIL)
for optimising process workflows in the IT Service Centre of Harz University in
Wernigerode, Germany, exemplified by the Release Management Process. It is
described, how, during the course of a special ITIL project, the As-Is-Status
of the various original processes was documented as part of the process life
cycle and then transformed in the To-Be-Status, according to the ITIL Best
Practice Framework. It is also shown, how the ITIL framework fits into the
four-layered-process model, that could be derived from interviews with the
universities IT support staff, and how the various modified processes
interconnect with each other to form a value chain. The paper highlights the
final results of the project and gives an outlook on the future use of ITIL as
a business modelling tool in the IT Service Centre of Harz University. It is
currently being considered, whether the process model developed during the
project could be used as a reference model for other university IT centres.
