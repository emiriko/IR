We present a purely theoretical study of the morphological evolution of
self-gravitating systems formed through the dissipationless collapse of N-point
sources. We explore the effects of resolution in mass and length on the growth
of triaxial structures formed by an instability triggered by an excess of
radial orbits. We point out that as resolution increases, the equilibria shift,
from mildly prolate, to oblate. A number of particles N ~= 100000 or larger is
required for convergence of axial aspect ratios. An upper bound for the
softening, e ~ 1/256, is also identified. We then study the properties of a set
of equilibria formed from scale-free cold initial mass distributions, ro ~ r^-g
with 0 <= g <= 2. Oblateness is enhanced for initially more peaked structures
(larger values of g). We map the run of density in space and find no evidence
for a power-law inner structure when g <= 3/2 down to a mass fraction <~0.1 per
cent of the total. However, when 3/2 < g <= 2, the mass profile in equilibrium
is well matched by a power law of index ~g out to a mass fraction ~ 10 per
cent. We interpret this in terms of less-effective violent relaxation for more
peaked profiles when more phase mixing takes place at the centre. We map out
the velocity field of the equilibria and note that at small radii the velocity
coarse-grained distribution function (DF) is Maxwellian to a very good
approximation.
