We describe the current status of the search for gravitational waves from
inspiralling compact binary systems in LIGO data. We review the result from the
first scientific run of LIGO (S1). We present the goals of the search of data
taken in the second scientific run (S2) and describe the differences between
the methods used in S1 and S2.
