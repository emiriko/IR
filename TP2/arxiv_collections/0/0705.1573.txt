Chirally odd generalized parton distributions (GPDs) and the Boer-Mulders
function provide valuable information about spin-orbit correlations for quarks
in nucleons and other hadrons. We compare results for the relevant GPD
$\bar{E}^q_T$ from a variety of phenomenological models as well as recent
lattice results. We find that $\bar{E}^q_T>0$ for nucleons as well as the pion
and for both $u$ and $d$ quark. As a result, the corresponding Boer Mulders
functions are all expected to be negative. The sign of $\bar{E}^q_T$ arises
from the relative sign between the upper and lower Dirac components for the
quark wave functions.
