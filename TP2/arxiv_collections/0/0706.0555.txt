We present a detailed investigation of static dipole polarizability of
lithium clusters containing up to 22 atoms. We first build a database of
lithium clusters by optimizing several candidate structures for the ground
state geometry for each size. The full polarizability tensor is determined for
about 5-6 isomers of each cluster size using the finite-field method. All
calculations are performed using large Gaussian basis sets, and within the
generalized gradient approximation to the density functional theory, as
implemented in the NRLMOL suite of codes. The average polarizability per atom
varies from 11 to 9 Angstrom^3, within the 8-22 size range and show smoother
decrease with increase in cluster size than the experimental values. While the
average polarizability exhibits a relatively weak dependence on cluster
conformation, significant changes in the degree of anisotropy of the
polarizability tensor are observed. Interestingly, in addition to the expected
even odd (0 and 1 $\mu_B$) magnetic states, our results show several cases
where clusters with an odd number of Li atoms exhibit elevated spin states
(e.g. 3 $\mu_B$).
