We set an upper limit on the mass of a supersymmetric neutralino dark matter
particle using the MicrOMEGAS and DarkSUSY software packages and the most
recent constraints on relic density from combined WMAP and SDSS data. We
explore several different possible scenarios within the MSSM, including
coannihilation with charginos and sfermions and annihilation through a massive
Higgs resonance, using low energy mass inputs. We find that no coannihilation
scenario is consistent with dark matter in observed abundance with a mass
greater than 2.5 TeV for a wino--type particle or 1.8 TeV for a Higgsino--type.
Contrived scenarios involving Higgs resonances with finely--tuned mass
parameters can allow masses as high as 34 TeV. The resulting gamma--ray energy
distribution is not in agreement with the recent multi--TeV gamma ray spectrum
observed by H.E.S.S. originating from the center of the Milky Way. Our results
are relevent only for dark matter densities resulting from a thermal origin.
