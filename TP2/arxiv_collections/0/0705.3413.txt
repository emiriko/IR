In this paper, we study the primitive ideals of quantum algebras supporting a
rational torus action. We first prove a quantum analogue of a Theorem of
Dixmier; namely, we show that the Gelfand-Kirillov dimension of primitive
factors of various quantum algebras is always even. Next we give a
combinatorial criterion for a prime ideal that is invariant under the torus
action to be primitive. We use this criterion to obtain a formula for the
number of primitive ideals in the algebra of $2\times n$ quantum matrices that
are invariant under the action of the torus. Roughly speaking, this can be
thought of as giving an enumeration of the points that are invariant under the
induced action of the torus in the ``variety of $2\times n$ quantum matrices''.
