In this paper, redundant random matrix ensembles (abbreviated as redundant
random ensembles) are defined and their stopping set (SS) weight distributions
are analyzed. A redundant random ensemble consists of a set of binary matrices
with linearly dependent rows. These linearly dependent rows (redundant rows)
significantly reduce the number of stopping sets of small size. An upper and
lower bound on the average SS weight distribution of the redundant random
ensembles are shown. From these bounds, the trade-off between the number of
redundant rows (corresponding to decoding complexity of BP on BEC) and the
critical exponent of the asymptotic growth rate of SS weight distribution
(corresponding to decoding performance) can be derived. It is shown that, in
some cases, a dense matrix with linearly dependent rows yields asymptotically
(i.e., in the regime of small erasure probability) better performance than
regular LDPC matrices with comparable parameters.
