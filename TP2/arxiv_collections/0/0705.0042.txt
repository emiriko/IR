Point-determining graphs are graphs in which no two vertices have the same
neighborhoods, co-point-determining graphs are those whose complements are
point-determining, and bi-point-determining graphs are those both
point-determining and co-point-determining. Bicolored point-determining graphs
are point-determining graphs whose vertices are properly colored with white and
black. We use the combinatorial theory of species to enumerate these graphs as
well as the connected cases.
