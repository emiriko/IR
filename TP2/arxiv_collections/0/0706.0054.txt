High-resolution longslit Halpha spectra of the shell of the old nova DQ Her
have been obtained with the William Herschel Telescope using the ISIS
spectrograph. An equatorial expansion velocity of 370+/-14 km/s is derived from
the spectra which, in conjunction with a narrowband Halpha image of the
remnant, allows a distance estimate of 525+/-28 pc. An equatorial ring which
exhibits enhanced [NII] emission has also been detected and the inclination
angle of the shell is found to be 86.8+/-0.2 degrees with respect to the line
of sight. The spectra also reveal tails extending from the clumps in the shell,
which have a radial velocity increasing along their length. This suggests the
presence of a stellar wind, collimated in the polar direction, which ablates
fragments of material from the clumps and accelerates them into its stream up
to a terminal velocity of order 800-900 km/s.
