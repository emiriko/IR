The letter proposes a procedure for generation of strongly chaotic beats that
have been hardly obtainable hitherto. The beats are generated in a nonlinear
optical system governing second-harmonic generation of light. The proposition
is based on the concept of an optical coupler but can be easily adopted to
other nonlinear systems and Chua's circuits.
