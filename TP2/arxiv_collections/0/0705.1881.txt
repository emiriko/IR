We compute the nuclear suppression factor R_AA for charged hadrons within a
radiative energy loss picture using a hydrodynamical evolution to describe the
soft medium inducing energy loss. A minijet + saturation picture provides
initial conditions for LHC energies and leading order perturbative QCD (LO
pQCD) is used to compute the parton spectrum before distortion by energy loss.
