There has been tremendous progress in observing oscillations in solar-type
stars. In a few short years we have moved from ambiguous detections to firm
measurements. We briefly review the recent results, most of which have come
from high-precision Doppler measurements. We also review briefly the results on
giant and supergiant stars and the prospects for the future.
