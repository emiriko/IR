The standard axiomatization of quantum mechanics (QM) is not fully explicit
about the role of the time-parameter. Especially, the time reference within the
probability algorithm (the Born Rule, BR) is unclear. Using a plausible
principle P1, about the role of probability in a physical theory, and a second
principle P2 affording a most natural way to make BR precise, a logical
conflict with the standard expression for the completeness of QM can be
derived. Rejecting P1 is implausible. Rejecting P2 leads to unphysical results
and to a conflict with a generalization of P2, a principle P3. It is thus made
plausible that the standard expression of QM completeness must be revised. An
absolutely explicit form of the axioms is provided, including a precise form of
the projection postulate. An appropriate expression for QM completeness,
reflecting the restrictions of the Gleason and Kochen-Specker theorems is
proposed.
