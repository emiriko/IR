We perform a global analysis of all recent experimental data from elastic
parity-violating electron scattering at low $Q^2$. The values of the electric
and magnetic strange form factors of the nucleon are determined at $Q^2 = 0.1$
GeV/$c^2$ to be $G^s_E = -0.008 \pm 0.016$ and $G^s_M = 0.29 \pm 0.21$.
