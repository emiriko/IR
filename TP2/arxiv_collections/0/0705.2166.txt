It is conjectured that time intervals of any kind are proportional to the age
of the Universe taken at the time we are considering the interval. If this is
the case then the speed of light, in fact any speed, must decrease inversely
proportional to this age. The immediate consequence is that energy is not
conserved: the hypothesis that time is a homogeneous property implies
conservation of energy (the theorem of Noether). Nonconservation of energy
follows from the condition that any time interval is proportional to the
cosmological time, and therefore time can not be homogeneous. From the
uncertainty principle, taking the constant of Planck as a real constant, time
independent, it follows that any energy in the Universe decreases linearly with
time. We then prove that Schroedinger equation does not change, except for the
potential energy term. The future of the Universe gives for the wave functions
a long sinusoidal spatial solution, so that everything becomes unlocalized. The
relativistic absolute interval remains the same, even with a changing speed of
light, and the Universe turns out to be nonexpanding. A Mass-Boom effect is
confirmed.
