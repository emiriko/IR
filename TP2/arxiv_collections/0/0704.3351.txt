This paper introduces the concept of symbolic sensor as an extension of the
smart sensor one. Then, the links between the physical world and the symbolic
one are introduced. The creation of symbols is proposed within the frame of the
pretopology theory. In order to adapt the sensor to the measurement context, a
learning process has been used to provide an adaptive interpretation of the
measurement. Finally, an example is presented in the case of a temperature
measurement.
