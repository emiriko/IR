Einstein's field equations with variable gravitational and cosmological
``constant'' are considered in presence of perfect fluid for Bianchi type-I
spacetime. Consequences of the four cases of the phenomenological decay of
$\Lambda$ have been discussed which are consistent with observations. The
physical significance of the cosmological models have also been discussed.
