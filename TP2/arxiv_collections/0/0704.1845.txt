We construct a modification of the standard model which stabilizes the Higgs
mass against quadratically divergent radiative corrections, using ideas
originally discussed by Lee and Wick in the context of a finite theory of
quantum electrodynamics. The Lagrangian includes new higher derivative
operators. We show that the higher derivative terms can be eliminated by
introducing a set of auxiliary fields; this allows for convenient computation
and makes the physical interpretation more transparent. Although the theory is
unitary, it does not satisfy the usual analyticity conditions.
