By exact numerical and master equation approaches, we show that a central
spin-1/2 can be configured to probe internal bath dynamics. System-bath
interactions cause Rabi oscillations in the detector and periodic behavior of
fidelity. This period is highly sensitive to the strength of the bath
self-interactions, and can be used to calculate the intra-bath coupling.
