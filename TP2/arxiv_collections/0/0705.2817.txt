We define and study a class of codes obtained from scrolls over curves of any
genus over finite fields. These codes generalize Goppa codes in a natural way,
and the orthogonal complements of these codes belong to the same class. We show
how syndromes of error vectors correspond to certain vector bundle extensions,
and how decoding is associated to finding destabilizing subbundles.
