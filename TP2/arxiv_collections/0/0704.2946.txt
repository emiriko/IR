The CERN Axion Solar Telescope (CAST) experiment searches for axions from the
Sun converted into photons with energies up to around 10 keV via the inverse
Primakoff effect in the high magnetic field of a superconducting Large Hadron
Collider (LHC) prototype magnet. A backside illuminated pn-CCD detector in
conjunction with an X-ray mirror optics is one of the three detectors used in
CAST to register the expected photon signal. Since this signal is very rare and
different background components (environmental gamma radiation, cosmic rays,
intrinsic radioactive impurities in the set-up, ...) entangle it, a detailed
study of the detector background has been undertaken with the aim to understand
and further reduce the background level of the detector. The analysis is based
on measured data taken during the Phase I of CAST and on Monte Carlo
simulations of different background components. This study will show that the
observed background level (at a rate of (8.00+-0.07)10^-5 counts/cm^2/s/keV
between 1 and 7 keV) seems to be dominated by the external gamma background due
to usual activities at the experimental site, while radioactive impurities in
the detector itself and cosmic neutrons could make just smaller contribution.
