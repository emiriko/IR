We present an analysis of long-term optical monitoring observations and
optical spectroscopic observations of the counterpart to CXOU J205847.5+414637
(high mass X-ray binary system). We search for a variability in the light curve
of Be star. We used differential magnitudes in the time series analysis. The
variability search in the optical light curve was made by using different
algorithms. The reduction and analysis of spectra were done by using MIDAS and
its suitable packages. We have performed a frequency search which gave us the
value 2.404 1/day. This value is attributed to the non-radial pulsation of Be
star. H alpha emission line profiles always show double-peaked emissions with a
mean equivalent width of 2.31 \pm 0.19 \AA ~and a peak separation of 516 \pm 45
km/s. This suggests that Be star disk is still present. CXOU J205847.5+414637
is in X-ray quiescent state.
