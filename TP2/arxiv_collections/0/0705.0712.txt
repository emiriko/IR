We prove general reflection positivity results for both scalar fields and
Dirac fields on a Riemannian manifold, and comment on applications to quantum
field theory. As another application, we prove the inequality $C_D \leq C_N$
between Dirichlet and Neumann covariance operators on a manifold with a
reflection.
