A new variant of the Feshbach map, called smooth Feshbach map, has been
introduced recently by Bach et al., in connection with the renormalization
analysis of non-relativistic quantum electrodynamics. We analyze and clarify
its algebraic and analytic properties, and we generalize it to non-selfadjoint
partition operators $\chi$ and $\chib$.
