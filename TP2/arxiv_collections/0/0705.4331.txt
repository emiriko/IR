Euclidean space and linear algebra do not characterize dynamic electronic
orbitals satisfactorily for even the motion of both electrons in an inert
helium atom cannot be defined in reasonable details. Here the author puts
forward a novel two-dimensional spacetime model from scratch in the context of
defining both electrons in a helium atom. Space and time are treated as two
orthogonal, symmetric and complementary quantities under the atomic spacetime.
Electronic motion observed the rule of differential and integral operations
that were implemented by dynamic trigonometric functions. It is demonstrated
that the atomic spacetime is not a linear vector space with Newtonian time, and
within which calculus has non-classical definition, and complex wave functions
have fresh physical significances. This alternative approach is original,
informative and refreshing but still compatible with quantum mechanics in the
formulation. The description of electronic resonance in helium is also
comparable with classical mechanics such as an oscillating pendulum and with
classical electromagnetism such as an LC oscillator. The study has effectively
unified complex function, calculus, and trigonometry in mathematics, and
provided a prospect for unifying particle physics with classical physics on the
novel spacetime platform.
