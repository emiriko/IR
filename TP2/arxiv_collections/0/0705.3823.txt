We give a new description of the data needed to specify a morphism from a
scheme to a toric Deligne-Mumford stack. The description is given in terms of a
collection of line bundles and sections which satisfy certain conditions. As
applications, we characterize any toric Deligne-Mumford stack as a product of
roots of line bundles over the rigidified stack, describe the torus action,
describe morphisms between toric Deligne-Mumford stacks with complete coarse
moduli spaces in terms of homogeneous polynomials, and compare two different
definitions of toric stacks.
