We explore extensions of hybrid inflationary models in the context of
supersymmetric D-term inflation. We point out that a large variety of
inflationary scenarios can be encountered when the field content is extended.
It is not only possible to get curvaton type models but also scenarios in which
different fields, with nontrivial statistical properties, contribute to the
primordial curvature fluctuations. We explore more particularly the parameter
space of these multiple field inflationary models. It is shown that there
exists a large domain in which significant primordial non-Gaussianities can be
produced while preserving a scale free power spectrum for the metric
fluctuations. In particular we explicitly compute the expected bi- and
trispectrum for such models and compared the results to the current and
expected observational constraints. It is shown that it is necessary to use
both the bi- and tri-spectra of CMB anisotropies to efficiently reduce their
parameter space.
