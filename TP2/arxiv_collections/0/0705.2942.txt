The studies of fluctuations of the one-dimensional Kardar-Parisi-Zhang
universality class using the techniques from random matrix theory are reviewed
from the point of view of the asymmetric simple exclusion process. We explain
the basics of random matrix techniques, the connections to the polynuclear
growth models and a method using the Green's function.
