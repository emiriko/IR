In this article, we study the vertices $DDV$ and $D^*DV$ with the light-cone
QCD sum rules. The strong coupling constants $g_{DDV}$ and $f_{D^*DV}$ play an
important role in understanding the final-state re-scattering effects in the
hadronic B decays. They are related to the basic parameters $\beta$ and
$\lambda$ respectively in the heavy quark effective Lagrangian, our numerical
values are smaller than the existing estimations.
