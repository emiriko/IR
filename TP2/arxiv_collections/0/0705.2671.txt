In the matrix product states approach to $n$ species diffusion processes the
stationary probability distribution is expressed as a matrix product state with
respect to a quadratic algebra determined by the dynamics of the process. The
quadratic algebra defines a noncommutative space with a $SU_q(n)$ quantum group
action as its symmetry. Boundary processes amount to the appearance of
parameter dependent linear terms in the algebraic relations and lead to a
reduction of the $SU_q(n)$ symmetry. We argue that the boundary operators of
the asymmetric simple exclusion process generate a tridiagonal algebra whose
irriducible representations are expressed in terms of the Askey-Wilson
polynomials. The Askey-Wilson algebra arises as a symmetry of the boundary
problem and allows to solve the model exactly.
