A survey is given of the evolution from Yukawa's early work, via the
understanding of the pion as a Nambu-Goldstone boson of spontaneously broken
chiral symmetry in QCD, to modern developments in the theory of the nucleus
based on the chiral effective field theory representing QCD in its low-energy
limit.
