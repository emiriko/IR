We examine the stability of a trapped dipolar condensate mixed with a
single-component fermion gas at T=0. Whereas pure dipolar condensates with
small s-wave interaction are unstable even for small dipole-dipole interaction
strength, we find that the admixture of fermions can significantly stabilize
them, depending on the strength of the boson-fermion interaction. Within the
stable regime we find a region where a ground state is characterized by a
density wave along the soft trap direction.
