Schroedinger's book 'What is Life?' is widely credited for having played a
crucial role in development of molecular and cellular biology. My essay
revisits the issues raised by this book from the modern perspective of
epigenetics and systems biology. I contrast two classes of potential mechanisms
of epigenetic stability: 'epigenetic templating' and 'systems biology'
approaches, and consider them from the point of view expressed by Schroedinger.
I also discuss how quantum entanglement, a nonclassical feature of quantum
mechanics, can help to address the 'problem of small numbers' that lead
Schroedinger to promote the idea of molecular code-script for explanation of
stability of biological order.
