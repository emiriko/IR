A unified treatment of Schwinger parametrised Feynman amplitudes is suggested
which addresses vertices of arbitrary order on the same footing as propagators.
Contributions from distinct diagrams are organised collectively. The scheme is
based on the continuous graph Laplacian. The analogy to a classical statistical
diffusion system of vector charges on the graph is explored.
