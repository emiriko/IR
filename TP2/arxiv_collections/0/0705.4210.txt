In some cases water droplets can completely wet micro-structured
superhydrophobic surfaces. The {\it dynamics} of this rapid process is analyzed
by ultra-high-speed imaging. Depending on the scales of the micro-structure,
the wetting fronts propagate smoothly and circularly or -- more interestingly
-- in a {\it stepwise} manner, leading to a growing {\it square-shaped} wetted
area: entering a new row perpendicular to the direction of front propagation
takes milliseconds, whereas once this has happened, the row itself fills in
microseconds ({\it ``zipping''})
