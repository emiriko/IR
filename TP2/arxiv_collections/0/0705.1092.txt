We study, in the framework of open systems, the entanglement generation of
two independent uniformly accelerated atoms in interaction with the vacuum
fluctuations of massless scalar fields subjected to a reflecting plane
boundary. We demonstrate that, with the presence of the boundary, the
accelerated atoms exhibit distinct features from static ones in a thermal bath
at the corresponding Unruh temperature in terms of the entanglement creation at
the neighborhood of the initial time. In this sense, accelerated atoms in
vacuum do not necessarily have to behave as if they were static in a thermal
bath at the Unruh temperature.
