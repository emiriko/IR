The Vlasov equation for the collisionless evolution of the single-particle
probability distribution function (PDF) is a well-known Lie-Poisson Hamiltonian
system. Remarkably, the operation of taking the moments of the Vlasov PDF
preserves the Lie-Poisson structure. The individual particle motions correspond
to singular solutions of the Vlasov equation. The paper focuses on singular
solutions of the problem of geodesic motion of the Vlasov moments. These
singular solutions recover geodesic motion of the individual particles.
