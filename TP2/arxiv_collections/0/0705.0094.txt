The extragalactic background (EGB) of diffuse gamma rays can be determined by
subtracting the Galactic contribution from the data. This requires a Galactic
model (GM) and we include for the first time the contribution of dark matter
annihilation (DMA), which was previously proposed as an explanation for the
EGRET excess of diffuse Galactic gamma rays above 1 GeV.
  In this paper it is shown that the newly determined EGB shows a
characteristic high energy bump on top of a steeply falling soft contribution.
The bump is shown to be compatible with a contribution from an extragalactic
DMA signal from weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) with a mass
between 50 and 100 GeV in agreement with the EGRET excess of the Galactic
diffuse gamma rays and in disagreement with earlier analysis. The remaining
soft contribution of the EGB is shown to resemble the spectra of the observed
point sources in our Galaxy.
