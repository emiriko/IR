The measured low initial sticking probability of oxygen molecules at the
Al(111) surface that had puzzled the field for many years was recently
explained in a non-adiabatic picture invoking spin-selection rules [J. Behler
et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 94, 036104 (2005)]. These selection rules tend to
conserve the initial spin-triplet character of the free O2 molecule during the
molecule's approach to the surface. A new locally-constrained
density-functional theory approach gave access to the corresponding
potential-energy surface (PES) seen by such an impinging spin-triplet molecule
and indicated barriers to dissociation which reduce the sticking probability.
Here, we further substantiate this non-adiabatic picture by providing a
detailed account of the employed approach. Building on the previous work, we
focus in particular on inaccuracies in present-day exchange-correlation
functionals. Our analysis shows that small quantitative differences in the
spin-triplet constrained PES obtained with different gradient-corrected
functionals have a noticeable effect on the lowest kinetic energy part of the
resulting sticking curve.
