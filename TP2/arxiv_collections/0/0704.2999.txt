Heavy-quark jets are important in many of today's collider studies and
searches, yet predictions for them are subject to much larger uncertainties
than for light jets. This is because of strong enhancements in higher orders
from large logarithms, ln(p_t/m_Q). We propose a new definition of heavy-quark
jets, which is free of final-state logarithms to all orders and such that all
initial-state collinear logarithms can be resummed into the heavy-quark parton
distributions. Heavy-jet spectra can then be calculated in the massless
approximation, which is simpler than a massive calculation and reduces the
theoretical uncertainties by a factor of three. This provides the first ever
accurate predictions for inclusive b- and c-jets, and the latter have
significant discriminatory power for the intrinsic charm content of the proton.
The techniques introduced here could be used to obtain heavy-flavour jet
results from existing massless next-to-leading order calculations for a wide
range of processes. We also discuss the experimental applicability of our
flavoured jet definition.
