We consider the asymptotic behaviour of the solution of one dimensional
stochastic differential equations and Langevin equations in periodic
backgrounds with zero average. We prove that in several such models, there is
generically a non vanishing asymptotic velocity, despite of the fact that the
average of the background is zero.
