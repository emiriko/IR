We present an extended study of how the Next to Minimal
  Supersymmetric Model easily avoids fine-tuning in electroweak symmetry
breaking for a SM-like light Higgs with mass in the vicinity of $100\gev$, as
beautifully consistent with precision electroweak data, while escaping LEP
constraints due to the dominance of $h\to aa$ decays with $m_a<2m_b$ so that
$a\to \tauptaum$ or jets. The residual $\sim 10%$ branching ratio for $h\to
b\anti b$ explains perfectly the well-known LEP excess at $\mh\sim 100\gev$.
Details of model parameter correlations and requirements are discussed as a
function $\tan(\beta)$. Comparisons of fine-tuning in the NMSSM to that in the
MSSM are presented. We also discuss fine-tuning associated with scenarios in
which the $a$ is essentially pure singlet, has mass $m_a>30\gev$, and decays
primarily to $\gam\gam$ leading to an $h\to aa\to 4\gam$ Higgs signal.
