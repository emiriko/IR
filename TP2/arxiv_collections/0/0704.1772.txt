The space velocities from the catalog of Nordstrom et al. (2004) are used to
trace variations of a number of kinematic parameters of single F and G dwarfs
as a function of their age. The vertex deviation of disk stars increases from
7+- 1 to 15+-2 degrees as the mean age decreases from 4.3 to 1.5 Gyr. The
two-dimensional velocity distributions in the UV, UW, and VW planes are
analyzed. The evolution of the main peaks in the velocity distributions can be
followed to an average age of approximately 9 Gyr. We find that: (1) in the
distributions of the UV velocity components, stars of different types are
concentrated toward several stable peaks (the Hyades, Pleiades, and Sirius
Cluster), suggesting that the stars belonging to these formations did not form
simultaneously; (2) the peak associated with the Hyades Cluster dominates in
all age intervals; and (3) the Hyades peak is strongest for stars with an
average age of 1.5 Gyr, suggesting that this peak contains a considerable
fraction of stars from the Hyades cluster. The age dependences of the kinematic
parameters exhibit a break near 4.5 Gyr, which can be explained as an effect of
the different contributions of stars of the thin and thick disks. The Stromberg
relation yields a solar LSR velocity of V_{\odot LSR} = (8.7, 6.2, 7.2)+- (0.5,
2.2, 0.8) km/s.
