In this paper we present an invariant perturbation theory to adiabatic
process according to the concepts of adiabatic orbits, adiabatic evolution
orbit and U(1)-invariant adiabatic orbit. The probabilities of keeping the
adiabatic orbit in the first-order and the second-order approximation are
calculated, respectively. We also give a convenient sufficient condition.
