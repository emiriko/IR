We present the results of radial velocity measurements of two samples of
active stars. The first sample contains field G and K giants across the Red
Giant Branch, whereas the second sample consists of nearby young stars (d < 150
pc) with ages between 10 - 300 Myrs. The radial velocity monitoring program has
been carried out with FEROS at 1.52 m ESO telescope (1999 - 2002) and continued
since 2003 at 2.2 m MPG/ESO telescope. We observed stellar radial velocity
variations which originate either from the stellar activity or the presence of
stellar/substellar companions. By means of a bisector technique we are able to
distinguish the sources of the radial velocity variation. Among them we found
few candidates of planetary companions, both of young stars and G-K giants
sample.
