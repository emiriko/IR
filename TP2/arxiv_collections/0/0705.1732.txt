We use functoriality of tropicalization and the geometry of projections of
subvarieties of tori to show that the fibers of the tropicalization map are
dense in the Zariski topology. For subvarieties of tori over fields of
generalized power series, points in each tropical fiber are obtained
"constructively" using Kedlaya's transfinite version of Newton's method.
