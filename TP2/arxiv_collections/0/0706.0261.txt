We study the exponential scale length of total radio emission, the spectral
index distribution, and the linear radio polarization in the Scd galaxy M33.
Observations were carried out using the 3.6 cm dual channel and the 6.2 cm four
channel receivers of the 100--m Effelsberg telescope along with the L-band VLA
D--array at 20 cm. High spatial resolution and sensitivity in both total and
linearly polarized radio continuum emission from M33 were achieved. We found
considerable extended emission, not only from the main arms I S and I N, but
also from the weaker arms. The large--scale magnetic field exhibits
well--ordered spiral structure with almost the same orientation as that of the
optical spiral arms, however, it does not show a clear structural correlation
or anti--correlation with the optical arms. There is a north-south asymmetry in
polarization that is frequency-dependent. We found that the ring mean spectral
index versus radius increases faster beyond $R$ = 4 kpc. At each wavelength,
the exponential scale length is larger inside than outside $R$ = 4 kpc. From
the larger scales lengths at $R$ $<$ 4 kpc, we conclude that star forming
regions are mainly spread over the region $R$ $<$ 4 kpc without a dominant
nuclear concentration. Furthermore, at $R$ $<$ 4 kpc, a spatial correlation
between cosmic rays and star forming regions may exist. From the behaviour of
the mean spectral indices obtained from different pairs of the radio continuum
data at 3.6, 6.2, and 20 cm, we confirm that a decrease in the thermal fraction
causes an increase in the spectral index. The frequency-dependent asymmetry in
the polarization hints to an asymmetry in Faraday depolarization.
