A lead-glass hodoscope calorimeter that was constructed for use in the
Jefferson Lab Real Compton Scattering experiment is described. The detector
provides a measurement of the coordinates and the energy of scattered photons
in the GeV energy range with resolutions of 5 mm and 6%/\sqrt(E{\gamma} [GeV]).
Features of both the detector design and its performance in the high luminosity
environment during the experiment are presented.
