The rms (root mean square) variability is the parameter for understanding the
emission temporal properties of X-ray binaries (XRBs) and active galactic
nuclei (AGN).
  The rms-flux relation with Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) data for the
dips and nondip of black hole Cyg X-1 has been investigated in this paper. Our
results show that there exist the linear rms-flux relations in the frequency
range 0.1-10 Hz for the dipping light curve. Moreover, this linear relation
still remains during the nondip regime, but with the steeper slope than that of
the dipping case in the low energy band. For the high energy band, the slopes
of the dipping and nondipping cases are hardly constant within errors. The
explanations of the results have been made by means of the ``Propagating
Perturbation'' model of Lyubarskii (1997).
