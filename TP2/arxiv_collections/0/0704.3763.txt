Bose-Einstein coalescence of independent photons at the surface of a beam
splitter is the physical process that allows linear optical quantum gates to be
built. When distinct parametric down-conversion events are used as an
independent photon source, distinguishability arises form the energy
correlation of each photon with its twin. We find that increasing the pump
bandwidth may help in improving the visibility of non-classical interference
and reaching a level of near perfect indistinguishability. PACS: 03.67.Mn,
