In this paper the benefits provided by multi-cell processing of signals
transmitted by mobile terminals which are received via dedicated relay
terminals (RTs) are assessed. Unlike previous works, each RT is assumed here to
be capable of full-duplex operation and receives the transmission of adjacent
relay terminals. Focusing on intra-cell TDMA and non-fading channels, a
simplified uplink cellular model introduced by Wyner is considered. This
framework facilitates analytical derivation of the per-cell sum-rate of
multi-cell and conventional single-cell receivers. In particular, the analysis
is based on the observation that the signal received at the base stations can
be interpreted as the outcome of a two-dimensional linear time invariant
system. Numerical results are provided as well in order to provide further
insight into the performance benefits of multi-cell processing with relaying.
