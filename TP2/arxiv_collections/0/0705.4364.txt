The objective of this work is twofold: First, we analyze the relation between
the k-cosymplectic and the k-symplectic Hamiltonian and Lagrangian formalisms
in classical field theories. In particular, we prove the equivalence between
k-symplectic field theories and the so-called autonomous k-cosymplectic field
theories, extending in this way the description of the symplectic formalism of
autonomous systems as a particular case of the cosymplectic formalism in
non-autonomous mechanics. Furthermore, we clarify some aspects of the geometric
character of the solutions to the Hamilton-de Donder-Weyl and the
Euler-Lagrange equations in these formalisms. Second, we study the equivalence
between k-cosymplectic and a particular kind of multisymplectic Hamiltonian and
Lagrangian field theories (those where the configuration bundle of the theory
is trivial).
