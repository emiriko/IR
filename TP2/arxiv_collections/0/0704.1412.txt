Ebert et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 77, 3827 (1996)] have fractured icosahedral
Al-Mn-Pd single crystals in ultrahigh vacuum and have investigated the cleavage
planes in-situ by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Globular patterns in the
STM-images were interpreted as clusters of atoms. These are significant
structural units of quasicrystals. The experiments of Ebert et al. imply that
they are also stable physical entities, a property controversially discussed
currently. For a clarification we performed the first large scale fracture
simulations on three-dimensional complex binary systems. We studied the
propagation of mode I cracks in an icosahedral model quasicrystal by molecular
dynamics techniques at low temperature. In particular we examined how the shape
of the cleavage plane is influenced by the clusters inherent in the model and
how it depends on the plane structure. Brittle fracture with no indication of
dislocation activity is observed. The crack surfaces are rough on the scale of
the clusters, but exhibit constant average heights for orientations
perpendicular to high symmetry axes. From detailed analyses of the fractured
samples we conclude that both, the plane structure and the clusters, strongly
influence dynamic fracture in quasicrystals and that the clusters therefore
have to be regarded as physical entities.
