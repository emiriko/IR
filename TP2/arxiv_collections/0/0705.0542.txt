The Kaplan-Manohar ambiguity in light quark masses allows for a larger
uncertainty in the ratio of up to down quark masses than naive estimates from
the chiral Lagrangian would indicate. We show that it allows for a relaxation
of experimental bounds on the QCD axion, specifically KSVZ axions in the $2-3
\mu$eV mass range composing 100% of the galactic dark matter halo can evade the
experimental limits placed by the ADMX collaboration.
