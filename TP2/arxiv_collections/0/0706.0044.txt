We numerically investigate the nature of the phase transition of the XY model
in the heptagonal lattice with the negative curvature, in comparison to other
interaction structures such as a flat two-dimensional (2D) square lattice and a
small-world network. Although the heptagonal lattice has a very short
characteristic path length like the small-world network structure, it is
revealed via calculation of the Binder's cumulant that the former exhibits a
zero-temperature phase transition while the latter has the finite-temperature
transition of the mean-field nature. Through the computation of the vortex
density as well as the correlation function in the low-temperature
approximation, we show that the absence of the phase transition originates from
the strong spinwave-type fluctuation, which is discussed in relation to the
usual 2D XY model.
