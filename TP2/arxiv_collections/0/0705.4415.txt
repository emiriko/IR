Since perception tests are highly time-consuming, there is a need to automate
as many operations as possible, such as stimulus generation, procedure control,
perception testing, and data analysis. The computer-driven system we are
presenting here meets these objectives. To achieve large flexibility, the tests
are controlled by scripts. The system's core software resembles that of a
lexical-syntactic analyzer, which reads and interprets script files sent to it.
The execution sequence (trial) is modified in accordance with the commands and
data received. This type of operation provides a great deal of flexibility and
supports a wide variety of tests such as auditory-lexical decision making,
phoneme monitoring, gating, phonetic categorization, word identification, voice
quality, etc. To achieve good performance, we were careful about timing
accuracy, which is the greatest problem in computerized perception tests.
