We present two theoretical schemes for spin filters in one-dimensional
semiconductor quantum wires with spatially modulated Rashba spin-orbit coupling
(SOC) as well as weak magnetic potential. For case I, the SOC is periodic and
the weak magnetic potential is applied uniformly along the wire. Full spin
polarizations with opposite signs are obtained within two separated energy
intervals. For case II, the weak magnetic potential is periodic while the SOC
is uniform. An ideal negative/positive switching effect for spin polarization
is realized by tuning the strength of SOC. The roles of SOC, magnetic
potential, and their coupling on the spin filtering are analyzed.
