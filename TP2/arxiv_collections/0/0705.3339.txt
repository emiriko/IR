The NA60 experiment is a fixed-target experiment at the CERN SPS. It has
measured the dimuon yield in Indium--Indium collisions with an In beam of 158
AGeV/c and in p-A collisions with a proton beam of 400 and 158 AGeV/c. The
results allow to address three important physics topics, namely the study of
the rho spectral function in nuclear collisions, the clarification of the
origin of the dimuon excess measured by NA50 in the intermediate mass range,
and the J/psi suppression pattern in a collision system different from Pb-Pb.
An overview of these results will be given in this paper.
