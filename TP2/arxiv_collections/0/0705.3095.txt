We invesigate analytically both the intermediate and late-time behaviour of
the massive scalar field in the background of static spherically symmetric
black hole solution in dilaton gravity with arbitrary coupling constant. The
intermediate asymptotic behaviour of scalar field depends on the field's
parameter mass as well as the multiple number l. On its turn, the late-time
behaviour has the power law decay rate independent on coupling constant in the
theory under consideration.
