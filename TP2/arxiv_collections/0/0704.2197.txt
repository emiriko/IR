Potential energy curves for excited leptonic states of the
helium-antihydrogen system are calculated within Ritz' variational approach. An
explicitly correlated ansatz for the leptonic wave function is employed
describing accurately the motion of the leptons (two electrons and positron) in
the field of the helium nucleus and of the antiproton with arbitrary orbital
angular momentum projection $\Lambda$ onto the internuclear axis. Results for
$\Lambda$=0, 1 and 30 are presented. For quasibound states with large values of
$\Lambda$ and rotational quantum numbers $J>\Lambda$ no annihilation and
rearrangement decay channels occur, i. e. they are metastable.
