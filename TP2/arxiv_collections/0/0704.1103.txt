The contribution of a spin-rich $qqq$ force (in conjunction with pairwise
$qq$ forces) to the analytical structure of the $qqq$ wave function is worked
out in the high momentum regime of QCD where the confining interaction may be
ignored, so that the dominant effect is $Coulombic$. A distinctive feature of
this study is that the spin-rich $qqq$ force is generated by a $ggg$ vertex (a
genuine part of the QCD Lagrangian) wherein the 3 radiating gluon lines end on
as many quark lines, giving rise to a (Mercedes-Benz type) $Y$-shaped diagram.
The dynamics is that of a Salpeter-like equation (3D support for the kernel)
formulated covariantly on the light front, a la Markov-Yukawa Transversality
Principle (MYTP) which warrants a 2-way interconnection between the 3D and 4D
Bethe-Salpeter (BSE) forms for 2 as well as 3 fermion quarks. With these
ingredients, the differential equation for the 3D wave function $\phi$ receives
well-defined contributions from the $qq$ and $qqq$ forces. In particular a
$negative$ eigenvalue of the spin operator $i \sigma_1.\sigma_2\times \sigma_3$
which is an integral part of the $qqq$ force, causes a characteristic
singularity in the differential equation, signalling the dynamical effect of a
spin-rich $qqq$ force not yet considered in the literature. The potentially
crucial role of this interesting effect vis-a-vis the so-called `spin anomaly'
of the proton, is a subject of considerable physical interest.
