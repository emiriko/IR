The resonant state of the open quantum system is studied from the viewpoint
of the outgoing momentum flux. We show that the number of particles is
conserved for a resonant state, if we use an expanding volume of integration in
order to take account of the outgoing momentum flux; the number of particles
would decay exponentially in a fixed volume of integration. Moreover, we
introduce new numerical methods of treating the resonant state with the use of
the effective potential. We first give a numerical method of finding a
resonance pole in the complex energy plane. The method seeks an energy
eigenvalue iteratively. We found that our method leads to a super-convergence,
the convergence exponential with respect to the iteration step. The present
method is completely independent of commonly used complex scaling. We also give
a numerical trick for computing the time evolution of the resonant state in a
limited spatial area. Since the wave function of the resonant state is
diverging away from the scattering potential, it has been previously difficult
to follow its time evolution numerically in a finite area.
