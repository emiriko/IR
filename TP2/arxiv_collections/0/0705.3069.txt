Some core-collapse supernovae show clear signs of interaction with dense
circumstellar material that often appears to be non-spherical. Circumstellar
nebulae around supernova progenitors provide clues to the origin of that
asymmetry in immediate pre-supernova evolution. Here I discuss outstanding
questions about the formation of the ring nebula around SN1987A and some
implications of similar ring nebulae around Galactic B supergiants. Several
clues hint that SN1987A's nebula may have been ejected in an LBV-like event,
rather than through interacting winds in a transition from a red supergiant to
a blue supergiant.
