We discuss the difficulties of predicting the solar cycle using mean-field
models. Here we argue that these difficulties arise owing to the significant
modulation of the solar activity cycle, and that this modulation arises owing
to either stochastic or deterministic processes. We analyse the implications
for predictability in both of these situations by considering two separate
solar dynamo models. The first model represents a stochastically-perturbed flux
transport dynamo. Here even very weak stochastic perturbations can give rise to
significant modulation in the activity cycle. This modulation leads to a loss
of predictability. In the second model, we neglect stochastic effects and
assume that generation of magnetic field in the Sun can be described by a fully
deterministic nonlinear mean-field model -- this is a best case scenario for
prediction. We designate the output from this deterministic model (with
parameters chosen to produce chaotically modulated cycles) as a target
timeseries that subsequent deterministic mean-field models are required to
predict. Long-term prediction is impossible even if a model that is correct in
all details is utilised in the prediction. Furthermore, we show that even
short-term prediction is impossible if there is a small discrepancy in the
input parameters from the fiducial model. This is the case even if the
predicting model has been tuned to reproduce the output of previous cycles.
Given the inherent uncertainties in determining the transport coefficients and
nonlinear responses for mean-field models, we argue that this makes predicting
the solar cycle using the output from such models impossible.
