The successful launch of the CoRoT (COnvection, ROtation and planetary
Transits) satellite opens a new era in asteroseismology. The space photometry
is complemented by high-resolution spectroscopy and multicolour photometry from
ground, to disclose the pulsational content of the asteroseismic targets in the
most complete way. Some preliminary results obtained with both types of data
are presented. The paper is based on observations collected at S. Pedro Martir,
Serra La Nave, La Silla, and Telescopio Nazionale Galileo Observatories.
