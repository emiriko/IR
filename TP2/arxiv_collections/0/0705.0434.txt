The magnetic properties of single crystals of LiHo_xY_{1-x}F_4 with x=16.5%
and x=4.5% were recorded down to 35 mK using a micro-SQUID magnetometer. While
this system is considered as the archetypal quantum spin glass, the detailed
analysis of our magnetization data indicates the absence of a phase transition,
not only in a transverse applied magnetic field, but also without field. A
zero-Kelvin phase transition is also unlikely, as the magnetization seems to
follow a non-critical exponential dependence on the temperature. Our analysis
thus unmasks the true, short-ranged nature of the magnetic properties of the
LiHo_xY_{1-x}F_4 system, validating recent theoretical investigations
suggesting the lack of phase transition in this system.
