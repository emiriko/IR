The IceCube neutrino detector is a cubic kilometer TeV to PeV neutrino
detector under construction at the geographic South Pole. The dominant
population of neutrinos detected in IceCube is due to meson decay in cosmic-ray
air showers. These atmospheric neutrinos are relatively well-understood and
serve as a calibration and verification tool for the new detector. In 2006, the
detector was approximately 10% completed, and we report on data acquired from
the detector in this configuration. We observe an atmospheric neutrino signal
consistent with expectations, demonstrating that the IceCube detector is
capable of identifying neutrino events. In the first 137.4 days of livetime,
234 neutrino candidates were selected with an expectation of 211 +/-
76.1(syst.) +/- 14.5(stat.) events from atmospheric neutrinos.
