We study the dynamical process of disentanglement of two qubits and two
qutrits coupled to an Ising spin chain in a transverse field, which exhibits a
quantum phase transition. We use the concurrence and negativity to quantify
entanglement of two qubits and two qutrits, respectively. Explicit connections
between the concurrence (negativity) and the decoherence factors are given for
two initial states, the pure maximally entangled state and the mixed Werner
state. We find that the concurrence and negativity decay exponentially with
fourth power of time in the vicinity of critical point of the environmental
system.
