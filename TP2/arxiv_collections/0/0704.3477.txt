We present metallicities and their variations with different parameters for
36 high-latitude fields covering Galactic longitudes 0<l<360. The metallicities
for relatively short vertical distances (z<2.5 kpc) show systematic
fluctuations with Galactic longitude, similar to those of the thick-disc
scaleheight, which may be interpreted as indicating a common origin, viz., the
flare effect of the disc. This suggestion is supported by the metallicity
variations which we find as functions of radial distance. The metallicity
variation at larger vertical distances (6.5<z<9.5 kpc) is small but monotonic.
Three different vertical metallicity gradients could be detected:
d[M/H]/dz=-0.22(+/-0.03), d[M/H]/dz=-0.38 (+/-0.06), and d[M/H]/dz=-0.08
(+/-0.07) dex/kpc for the intervals z<3, 3<z<5, and 5<z<10 kpc, respectively.
Since our data cover the whole Galactic longitude interval, the resulting
metallicity gradients can be interpreted as properties of the larger-scale
Galaxy. The first gradient confirms the dissipational formation of the disc at
short z-distances. The steeper gradient corresponds to the transition region
between different population components of the Galaxy, and finally, the lowest
value provides an adequate description of the inner-halo metallicity gradient.
