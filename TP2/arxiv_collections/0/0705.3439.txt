The computation of radiative energy loss in a dynamically screened QCD medium
is a key ingredient for obtaining reliable predictions for jet quenching in
ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions. We calculate, to first order in the
opacity, the energy loss suffered by a heavy quark traveling through an
infinite and time-independent QCD medium and show that the result for a
dynamical medium is almost twice that obtained previously for a medium
consisting of randomly distributed static scattering centers. A quantitative
description of jet suppression in RHIC and LHC experiments thus must correctly
account for the dynamics of the medium's constituents.
