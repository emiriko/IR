Quantum transmissions of a free particle passing through a rectangular
potential barrier with dissipation are studied using a path decomposition
technique. Dissipative processes strongly suppress the transmission probability
at resonance just above the barrier resulting in an unexpected reduction of the
mean traversal time through the potential barrier.
