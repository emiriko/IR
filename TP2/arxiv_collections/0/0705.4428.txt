A proof-of-principle electron electric dipole moment (e-EDM) experiment using
slow cesium atoms, nulled magnetic fields, and electric field quantization has
been performed. With the ambient magnetic fields seen by the atoms reduced to
less than 200 pT, an electric field of 6 MV/m lifts the degeneracy between
states of unequal mF and, along with the low (approximately 3 m/s) velocity,
suppresses the systematic effect from the motional magnetic field. The low
velocity and small residual magnetic field have made it possible to induce
transitions between states and to perform state preparation, analysis, and
detection in regions free of applied static magnetic and electric fields. This
experiment demonstrates techniques that may be used to improve the e-EDM limit
by two orders of magnitude, but it is not in itself a sensitive e-EDM search,
mostly due to limitations of the laser system.
