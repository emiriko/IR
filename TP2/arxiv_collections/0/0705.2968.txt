In peripheral collisions of relativistic heavy ions highly excited spectators
containing Lambda-hyperons can be produced. Such strange spectator matter may
undergo a break-up into many fragments (multifragmentation) as it is well
established for ordinary nuclear systems. We generalize the statistical
multifragmentation model, previously successfully used for the description of
experimental data, for the case of hypernuclear systems. We predict relative
yields of hypernuclei and the main characteristics of such a break-up. We point
at a connection of this phenomenon with a liquid-gas phase transition in
hypermatter.
