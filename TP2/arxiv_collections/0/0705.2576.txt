In this notes unbounded regular operators on Hilbert $C^*$-modules over
arbitrary $C^*$-algebras are discussed. A densely defined operator $t$
possesses an adjoint operator if the graph of $t$ is an orthogonal summand.
Moreover, for a densely defined operator $t$ the graph of $t$ is orthogonally
complemented and the range of $P_FP_{G(t)^\bot}$ is dense in its biorthogonal
complement if and only if $t$ is regular. For a given $C^*$-algebra $\mathcal
A$ any densely defined $\mathcal A$-linear closed operator $t$ between Hilbert
$C^*$-modules is regular, if and only if any densely defined $\mathcal
A$-linear closed operator $t$ between Hilbert $C^*$-modules admits a densely
defined adjoint operator, if and only if $\mathcal A$ is a $C^*$-algebra of
compact operators. Some further characterizations of closed and regular modular
operators are obtained.
