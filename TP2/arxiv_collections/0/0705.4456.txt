Despite theoretical predictions of the existence of many submillimeter
masers, and some pioneering observational discoveries over the past few
decades, these lines have remained relatively unstudied due to (i) challenges
associated with observing at shorter wavelength; and, (ii) lack of possibility
of high (< 14'' at 345 GHz) angular resolution observations. With the advent of
the SMA, the first submillimeter imaging array capable of sub-arcsecond
resolution, APEX, and the promise of ALMA, opportunities are opening for
performing new science with millimeter/submillmeter masers. In this talk, I
will review recent work in the field - including extragalactic water millimeter
masers, hydrogen recombination masers, submillimeter masers in star-forming
regions, and in the envelopes of evolved stars - and discuss prospects for the
future.
