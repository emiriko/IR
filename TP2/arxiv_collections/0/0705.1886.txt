This paper presents the principles of ontology-supported and ontology-driven
conceptual navigation. Conceptual navigation realizes the independence between
resources and links to facilitate interoperability and reusability. An engine
builds dynamic links, assembles resources under an argumentative scheme and
allows optimization with a possible constraint, such as the user's available
time. Among several strategies, two are discussed in detail with examples of
applications. On the one hand, conceptual specifications for linking and
assembling are embedded in the resource meta-description with the support of
the ontology of the domain to facilitate meta-communication. Resources are like
agents looking for conceptual acquaintances with intention. On the other hand,
the domain ontology and an argumentative ontology drive the linking and
assembling strategies.
