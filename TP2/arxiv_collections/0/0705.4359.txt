The redshift of galaxies is in general explained by the expansion of space.
The flat space time theory of gravitation suggests an additional
interpretation. In this theory gravitation is explained analogously to
Maxwell's theory on a flat space-time metric and gravitation is described by a
field (potentials) with which the proper time (atomic time) is defined. In
addition to the proper time in the universe, the oberserver's time is stated.
The oberserver's time interval is absolute whereas the interval of the proper
time is time dependent. In particular, atomic clocks at distant objects are
going slower than clocks at present. This explains the redshift of distant
objects without assuming an expanding universe.
