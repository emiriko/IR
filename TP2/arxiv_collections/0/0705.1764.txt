The talk is intended to motivate the use of DA$\Phi$NE--2 running at the
$\phi$ peak as an intense, clean source of low--momentum charged and neutral
kaons. It covers a few open problems still unsolved after more than
twenty--five years and the physics (some of it still novel) that could be
learned only in this way. And, of course, the answer to the above question is
{\sl NO}.
