We propose a new theoretical method for the calculation of the interaction
energy between macromolecular systems at large distances. The method provides a
linear scaling of the computing time with the system size and is considered as
an alternative to the well known fast multipole method. Its efficiency,
accuracy and applicability to macromolecular systems is analyzed and discussed
in detail.
