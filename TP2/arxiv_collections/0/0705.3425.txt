We prove that the cohomology groups of a definably compact set over an
o-minimal expansion of a group are finitely generated and invariant under
elementary extensions and expansions of the language. We also study the
cohomology of the intersection of a definable decreas-ing family of definably
compact sets, under the additional assumption that the o-minimal structure
expands a field.
