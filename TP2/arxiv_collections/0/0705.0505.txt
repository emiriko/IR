We find non-supersymmetric metastable vacua in four dimensional N=2 gauge
theories softly broken to N=1 by a superpotential term. First we study the
simplest case, namely the SU(2) gauge theory without flavors. We study the
spectrum and lifetime of the metastable vacuum and possible embeddings of the
model in UV complete theories. Then we consider larger gauge group theories
with flavors. We show that when we softly break them to N=1, the potential
induced on specific submanifolds of their moduli space is identical to the
potential in lower rank gauge theories. Then we show that the potential
increases when we move away from this submanifold, allowing us to construct
metastable vacua on them in the theories that can be reduced to the SU(2) case.
