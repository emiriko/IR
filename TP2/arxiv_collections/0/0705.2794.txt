We study the process by which quantum correlations are created when an
interaction Hamiltonian is repeatedly applied to a system of two harmonic
oscillators for some characteristic time interval. We show that, for the case
where the oscillator frequencies are equal, the initial Maxwell-Boltzmann
distributions of the uncoupled parts evolve to a new equilibrium
Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution through a series of transient Maxwell-Boltzmann
distributions. Further, we discuss why the equilibrium reached when the two
oscillator frequencies are unequal, is not a thermal one. All the calculations
are exact and the results are obtained through an iterative process, without
using perturbation theory.
