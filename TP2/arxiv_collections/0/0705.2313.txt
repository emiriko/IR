MIX has recently been proposed as a new sensor scheme with better energy
management for data-gathering in Wireless Sensor Networks. However, it is not
known how it performs when some of the sensors carry out sinkhole attacks. In
this paper, we propose a variant of MIX with adjunct computational trust
management to limit the impact of such sinkhole attacks. We evaluate how MIX
resists sinkhole attacks with and without computational trust management. The
main result of this paper is to find that MIX is very vulnerable to sinkhole
attacks but that the adjunct trust management efficiently reduces the impact of
such attacks while preserving the main feature of MIX: increased lifetime of
the network.
