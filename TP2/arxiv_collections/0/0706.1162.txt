Nowadays, to achieve competitive advantage, the industrial companies are
considering that success is sustained to great product development. That is to
manage the product throughout its entire lifecycle. Achieving this goal
requires a tight collaboration between actors from a wide variety of domains,
using different software tools producing various product data types and
formats. The actors' collaboration is mainly based on the exchange /share
product information. The representation of the actors' viewpoints is the
underlying requirement of the collaborative product development. The multiple
viewpoints approach was designed to provide an organizational framework
following the actors' perspectives in the collaboration, and their
relationships. The approach acknowledges the inevitability of multiple
integration of product information as different views, promotes gathering of
actors' interest, and encourages retrieved adequate information while providing
support for integration through PLM and/or SCM collaboration. In this paper, a
multiple viewpoints representation is proposed. The product, process,
organization information models are discussed. A series of issues referring to
the viewpoints representation are discussed in detail. Based on XML standard,
taking electrical connector as an example, an application case of part of
product information modeling is stated.
