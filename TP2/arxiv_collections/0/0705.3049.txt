We discuss properties of hypothetical scale invariant (unparticle) matter by
viewing it as a tower of massive particles. We show how peculiar properties of
unparticles emerge in the limit when the mass spacing parameter Delta vanishes.
We explain why unparticle cannot decay in this limit and how, for finite Delta,
the decays manifest themselves in a relation between the reconstructed
invariant mass and vertex displacement. We describe a model field theory in
AdS5 which explicitly implements the deconstruction procedure by truncating the
extra dimension to size of order 1/Delta.
