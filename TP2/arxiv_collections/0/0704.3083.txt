The connection between AGB evolution of stellar populations and infrared vs.
ultraviolet properties of the parent galaxies is reviewed relying on the
updated lookout provided by population-synthesis theory. In particular,
planetary-nebula events and hot horizontal-branch evolution are assessed in a
unitary view to outline a plain general picture of galaxy spectrophotometric
evolution. This will include a brief discussion of relevant phenomena such as
the "UV upturn" in ellipticals and the stellar mass loss properties along the
galaxy morphological sequence.
