We discuss mechanisms of self-organization processes in two-level solid-state
class-B laser system. The model is considered under assumptions of influence of
nonlinear absorber and external force, separately. It was found that
self-organization occurs through the Hopf bifurcation and results to a stable
pulse radiation. Analysis is performed according to the Floquet exponent
investigation. It was found that influence of the nonlinear absorber extends
the domain of control parameters that manage a stable periodic radiation
processes. An external force suppresses self-organization processes. A combined
influence of both external force and nonlinear absorber results to more
complicated picture of self-organization with two reentrant Hopf bifurcations.
