We construct a large class of quantum "d x d" states which are positive under
partial transposition (so called PPT states). The construction is based on
certain direct sum decomposition of the total Hilbert space displaying
characteristic circular structure - that is way we call them circulant states.
It turns out that partial transposition maps any such decomposition into
another one and hence both original density matrix and its partially transposed
partner share similar cyclic properties. This class contains many well known
examples of PPT states from the literature and gives rise to a huge family of
completely new states.
