We investigate the behaviour of an original traffic model. The model
considers a single multi-lane street, populated by autonomous vehicles directed
from either end to the other. Lanes have no intrinsic directionality, and the
vehicles are inserted at random at either end and any lane. Collision avoidance
is fully automatic and, to enhance the transport capacity of the street,
vehicles form_trains_ in which they may travel at high speed quite close to the
vehicle in front.
  We report on the transit times for vehicles under a wide variety of
conditions: vehicle insertion probability & imbalance and their maximum speed
distribution. We also outline an interesting feature of the model, that the
complex interactions of many vehicles are considerably more powerful than a
simple "keep left" directive which each vehicle should obey.
