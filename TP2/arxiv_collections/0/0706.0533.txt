The scandium isotopes 44,45Sc have been studied with the 45Sc(3He,alpha
gamma)44Sc and 45Sc(3He,3He' gamma)45Sc reactions, respectively. The nuclear
level densities and gamma-ray strength functions have been extracted using the
Oslo method. The experimental level densities are compared to calculated level
densities obtained from a microscopic model based on BCS quasiparticles within
the Nilsson level scheme. This model also gives information about the parity
distribution and the number of broken Cooper pairs as a function of excitation
energy. The experimental gamma-ray strength functions are compared to
theoretical models of the E1, M1, and E2 strength, and to data from (gamma,n)
and (gamma,p) experiments. The strength functions show an enhancement at low
gamma energies that cannot be explained by the present, standard models.
