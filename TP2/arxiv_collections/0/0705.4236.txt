Hypertoric varieties are quaternionic analogues of toric varieties, important
for their interaction with the combinatorics of matroids as well as for their
prominent place in the rapidly expanding field of algebraic symplectic and
hyperkahler geometry. The aim of this survey is to give clear definitions and
statements of known results, serving both as a reference and as a point of
entry to this beautiful subject.
