A short survey of some material related to conformal general relativity
(CGR), integrable Weyl geometry, and Dirac-Weyl (DW) theory is given which
suggests that CGR is essentially equivalent to DW with quantum mass equivalent
to conformal mass, and various actions can be reformulated in terms of the
quantum potential.
