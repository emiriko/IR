We have calculated the two-loop strong interaction corrections to the
chargino pole masses in the DRbar'-scheme in the Minimal Supersymmetric
Standard Model (MSSM) with complex parameters. We have performed a detailed
numerical analysis for a particular point in the parameter space and found
corrections of a few tenths of a percent. We provide a computer program which
calculates chargino and neutralino masses with complex parameters including the
one-loop corrections and all two-loop SQCD effects.
