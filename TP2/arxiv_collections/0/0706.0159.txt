Chemical potential oscillations mix individual-band frequencies of the de
Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) and Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) magneto-oscillations in
canonical low-dimensional multi-band Fermi liquids. We predict a similar mixing
in canonical single-band Fermi liquids, which Fermi-surfaces have two or more
extremal cross-sections. Combination harmonics are analysed using a single-band
almost two-dimensional energy spectrum. We outline some experimental conditions
allowing for resolution of combination harmonics.
