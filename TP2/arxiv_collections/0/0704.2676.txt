We present an overview of a few recent results related to CP-violation from
the Tevatron. First, we discuss a measurement of the dimuon charge asymmetry
from D{\O}that extracts the CP-violation parameter of $\Bo$ mixing and decay.
This is followed by the CDF measurement of the CP-violating asymmetry in
$\bdkpi$ decays. Finally we give the CDF result on the ratio $R = \frac{BR(B
\to D^0 K)}{BR(B \to D^0 \pi)}$
