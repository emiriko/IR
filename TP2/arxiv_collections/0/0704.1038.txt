The free field partition function for a generic U(N) gauge theory, where the
fundamental fields transform in the adjoint representation, is analysed in
terms of symmetric polynomial techniques. It is shown by these means how this
is related to the cycle polynomial for the symmetric group and how the large N
result may be easily recovered. Higher order corrections for finite N are also
discussed in terms of symmetric group characters. For finite N, the partition
function involving a single bosonic fundamental field is recovered and explicit
counting of multi-trace quarter BPS operators in free \N=4 super Yang Mills
discussed, including a general result for large N. The partition function for
BPS operators in the chiral ring of \N=4 super Yang Mills is analysed in terms
of plane partitions. Asymptotic counting of BPS primary operators with
differing R-symmetry charges is discussed in both free \N=4 super Yang Mills
and in the chiral ring. Also, general and explicit expressions are derived for
SU(2) gauge theory partition functions, when the fundamental fields transform
in the adjoint, for free field theory.
