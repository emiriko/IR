We analyze five epochs of Spitzer Space Telescope/Infrared Array Camera
(IRAC) observations of the nearby spiral galaxy M33. Each epoch covered nearly
a square degree at 3.6, 4.5, and 8.0 microns. The point source catalog from the
full dataset contains 37,650 stars. The stars have luminosities characteristic
of the asymptotic giant branch and can be separated into oxygen-rich and
carbon-rich populations by their [3.6] - [4.5] colors. The [3.6] - [8.0] colors
indicate that over 80% of the stars detected at 8.0 microns have dust shells.
Photometric comparison of epochs using conservative criteria yields a catalog
of 2,923 variable stars. These variables are most likely long-period variables
amidst an evolved stellar population. At least one-third of the identified
carbon stars are variable.
