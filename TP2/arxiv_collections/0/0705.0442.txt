The polarization of bremsstrahlung photon in the processes $ee^\pm\to
(e\gamma)e^\pm$, and $ep\to (e\gamma)p$ is calculated for peripheral
kinematics, in the high energy limit where the cross section does not decrease
with the incident energy. When the initial electron is
unpolarized(longitudinally polarized) the final photon can be linearly
(circularly) polarized. The Stokes parameters of the photon polarization are
calculated as a function of the kinematical variables of process: the energy of
recoil particle, the energy fraction of scattered electron, and the polar and
azimuthal angles of photon. Numerical results are given in form of tables, for
typical values of the relevant kinematic variables.
