The Fokker-Planck Equation, applied to transport processes in fusion plasmas,
can model several anomalous features, including uphill transport, scaling of
confinement time with system size, and convective propagation of externally
induced perturbations. It can be justified for generic particle transport
provided that there is enough randomness in the Hamiltonian describing the
dynamics. Then, except for 1 degree-of-freedom, the two transport coefficients
are largely independent. Depending on the statistics of interest, the same
dynamical system may be found diffusive or dominated by its L\'{e}vy flights.
