We present results for kaon decay widths of baryon resonances from a
relativistic study with constituent quark models. The calculations are done in
the point-form of Poincare-invariant quantum mechanics with a spectator-model
decay operator. We obtain covariant predictions of the Goldstone-boson-exchange
and a variant of the one-gluon-exchange constituent quark models for all kaon
decay widths of established baryon resonances. They are generally characterized
by underestimating the available experimental data. In particular, the widths
of kaon decays with increasing strangeness in the baryon turn out to be
extremely small. We also consider the nonrelativistic limit, leading to the
familiar elementary emission model, and demonstrate the importance of
relativistic effects. It is found that the nonrelativistic approach evidently
misses sensible influences from Lorentz boosts and some essential spin-coupling
terms.
