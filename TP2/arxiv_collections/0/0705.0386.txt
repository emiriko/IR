We study the multi-spin entanglement for the 1D anisotropic XY model
concentrating on the simplest case of three-spin entanglement. As compared to
the pairwise entanglement, three-party quantum correlations have a longer range
and they are more robust on increasing the temperature.
  We find regions of the phase diagram of the system where bound entanglement
occurs, both at zero and finite temperature. Bound entanglement in the ground
state can be obtained by tuning the magnetic field. Thermal bound entanglement
emerges naturally due to the effect of temperature on the free ground state
entanglement.
