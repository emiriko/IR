We discuss O'Raifeartaigh models with general R-charge assignments,
introduced by Shih to break R-symmetry spontaneously. We argue that most of
these models have runaway directions related to the R-symmetry. In addition, we
study the simplest model with a U(N) global symmetry and show that in a range
of parameters R-symmetry is spontaneously broken in a metastable vacuum.
