After five years of running at RHIC, and on the eve of the LHC heavy-ion
program, we highlight the status of femtoscopic measurements. We emphasize the
role interferometry plays in addressing fundamental questions about the state
of matter created in such collisions, and present an enumerated list of
measurements, analyses and calculations that are needed to advance the field in
the coming years.
