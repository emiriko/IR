Reformulation of the generalized electromagnetic fields of dyons has been
dicussed in inhomogenous media and corresponding quaternionic equations are
derived in compact, simple and unique manner. We have also discussed the
monochromatic fields of generalized electromagnetic fields of dyons in slowly
changing media in a consistent manner.
