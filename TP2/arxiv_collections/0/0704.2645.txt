The standard theory of elementary particle physics is modified in such a way
that the Higgs boson becomes unobservable and Lorentz invariance is slightly
violated at the level of the S-matrix. The basic technique of realizing these
properties without violating the unitarity of the physical S-matrix is the use
of the complex-ghost quantum field theory.
