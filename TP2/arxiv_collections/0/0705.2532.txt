In the extra U(1) superstring inspired model, we examine the electroweak and
U(1)-prime symmetry breaking with the singlet and exotic quark D, D+{\c}along
with the study of heavy Z-prime boson in accordance with the top quark mass
region. For this, we have done the analysis of complete renormalization group
equations (RGEs)pertaining to the anomaly free E-{\6}-Eta model of rank 5. The
Z-prime is found to the order of TeV or above with allowed small Z-Zprime
mixing angle, for which the large singlet VEV is required. This is done by
considering the only non-universality of Yukawa couplings at GUT scale because
these do not obey the E-{\6}relationship and also satisfies the unitarity
constraints both at GUT and weak scale, where rest of the parameters, i.e.,
gaugino masses, tri-linear couplings, and soft supersymmetric breaking masses
are kept universal at GUT scale with the gauge couplings unification. The large
value of Yukawa couplings (order of 1) triggered the symmetry breaking
radiatively and induces the effective-Mu parameter at the electroweak scale and
lead to a viable low energy spectrum at weak scale.
