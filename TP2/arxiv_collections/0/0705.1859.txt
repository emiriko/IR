Magnetic dissipation through decay of Alfven waves in the magnetar
magnetosphere is discussed. Transport of magnetic fields in the star leads to
dissipation of the magnetic energy through either direct internal heating or
transferring of the energy in waves that decay in the magnetar magnetosphere.
In the latter case, the Alfven waves are excited by crust dislocations or
elastic waves underneath the star's surface. It is suggested that these Alfven
waves can decay into ion sound waves which can be effectively damped leading to
strong plasma heating. Hot plasmas expand producing transient X-rays.
