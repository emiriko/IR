Guided by a geometric understanding developed in earlier works of Wang and
Young, we carry out some numerical studies of shear-induced chaos. The settings
considered include periodic kicking of limit cycles, random kicks at Poisson
times, and continuous-time driving by white noise. The forcing of a
quasi-periodic model describing two coupled oscillators is also investigated.
In all cases, positive Lyapunov exponents are found in suitable parameter
ranges when the forcing is suitably directed.
