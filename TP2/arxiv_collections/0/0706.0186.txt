The Inert Doublet Model is an extension of the Standard Model including one
extra ``Inert scalar doublet'' and an exact $Z_2$ symmetry. The ``Inert
scalar'' provides a new candidate for dark matter. We present a systematic
analysis of the dark matter abundance assuming the standard freeze-out
mechanism and investigate the potentialities for direct and gamma indirect
detection. We show that the dark matter candidate saturates the WMAP dark
matter density in two rather separate mass ranges, one between 40 and 80 GeV,
the other one over 400 GeV. We also show that the model should be within the
range of future experiments, like GLAST and EDELWEISS II or ZEPLIN.
