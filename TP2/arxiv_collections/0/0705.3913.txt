In arXive:0705.3912 we studied triple-point defective very ample linear
systems on regular surfaces, and we showed that they can only exist if the
surface is ruled. In the present paper we show that we can drop the regularity
assumption, and we classify the triple-point defective very ample linear
systems on ruled surfaces.
