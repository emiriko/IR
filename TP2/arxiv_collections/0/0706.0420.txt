The effect of the magnetic field on the critical behavior of Sr0:9La0:1CuO2
is explored in terms of reversible magnetization data. As the correlation
length transverse to the magnetic field Hi,applied along the i-axis, cannot
grow beyond the limiting magnetic length LHi, related to the average distance
between vortex lines, one expects a magnetic field induced finite size effect.
Invoking the scaling theory of critical phenomena we provide clear evidence for
this effect. It implies that in type II superconductors there is a 3D to 1D
crossover line Hpi(T). Consequently, below Tc and above Hpi(T) uperconductivity
is confined to cylinders with diameter LHi(1D). Accordingly, there is no
continuous phase transition in the (H,T)-plane along the Hc2-lines as predicted
by the mean-field treatment.
