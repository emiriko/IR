To confirm previously reported evidence of high-temperature superconductivity
in laser processed Sr-Ru-O, we performed simultaneous two-probe and four-probe
resistive measurements using bar-geometry samples. A superconducting-type
transition with an onset at about 250K was recorded in one of the samples,
consistent with our previously reported measurements in the X-bridge geometry.
Some compositional details of the samples are also provided which were not
known at the time of previous web-publication.
