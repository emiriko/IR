We observe a complex change in the hopping exponent value from 1/2 to 1/3 as
a function of disorder strength and electron density in a sodium-doped silicon
MOSFET. The disorder was varied by applying a gate voltage and thermally
drifting the ions to different positions in the oxide. The same gate was then
used at low temperature to modify the carrier concentration.
Magnetoconductivity measurements are compatible with a change in transport
mechanisms when either the disorder or the electron density is modified
suggesting a possible transition from a Mott insulator to an Anderson insulator
in these systems.
