An efficient quantum cryptography network protocol is proposed with
d-dimension polarized photons, without resorting to entanglement and quantum
memory. A server on the network, say Alice, provides the service for preparing
and measuring single photons whose initial state are |0>. The users code the
information on the single photons with some unitary operations. For preventing
the untrustworthy server Alice from eavesdropping the quantum lines, a
nonorthogonal-coding technique (decoy-photon technique) is used in the process
that the quantum signal is transmitted between the users. This protocol does
not require the servers and the users to store the quantum state and almost all
of the single photons can be used for carrying the information, which makes it
more convenient for application than others with present technology. We also
discuss the case with a faint laser pulse.
