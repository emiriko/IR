We present a theory describing the mechanism for the two-dimensional (2D)
metal-insulator transition (MIT) in absence of disorder. A two-band Hubbard
model is introduced, describing vacancy-interstitial pair excitations within
the Wigner crystal. Kinetic energy gained by delocalizing such excitations is
found to lead to an instability of the insulator to self-doping above a
critical carrier concentration $n=n_c$, mapping the problem to a density-driven
Mott MIT. This mechanism provides a natural microscopic picture of several
puzzling experimental features, including the large effective mass enhancement,
the large resistivity drop, and the large positive magneto-resistance on the
metallic side of the transition. We also present a global phase diagram for the
clean 2D electron gas as a function of $n$ and parallel magnetic field
$B_{\shortparallel}$, which agrees well with experimental findings in ultra
clean samples.
