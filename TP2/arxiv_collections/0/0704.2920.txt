In this paper we show a local Jacquet-Langlands correspondence for all
unitary irreducible representations. We prove the global Jacquet-Langlands
correspondence in characteristic zero. As consequences we obtain the
multiplicity one and strong multiplicity one theorems for inner forms of GL(n)
as well as a classification of the residual spectrum and automorphic
representations in analogy with results proved by Moeglin-Waldspurger and
Jacquet-Shalika for GL(n).
