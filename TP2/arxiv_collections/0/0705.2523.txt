The paper explores the use of nanoparticles of gamma Fe2O3 for hyperthermia
treatment of living organisms by absorption of 1064 nm radiations from Nd:YAG
laser. Escherichia coli cells have been used as the model system for
demonstrating the effect wherein lysine is used as an interface between the
cell walls and the nanoparticles. Scanning Electron Microscopic observations
have, exclusively, proved that attachment of nanoparticles of iron oxide along
with lysine alone is responsible for absorption of above radiations. The
quantitative estimation has been provided by growth rate measurements and
protein assessment of the cells. The nanoparticles of gamma Fe2O3 were
synthesized by DC arc plasma assisted gas phase condensation.
