We construct the four-point correlation functions containing the top
component of the supermultiplet in the Neveu-Schwarz sector of the N=1 SUSY
Liouville field theory. The construction is based on the recursive
representation for the NS conformal blocks. We test our results in the case
where one of the fields is degenerate with a singular vector on the level 3/2.
In this case, the correlation function satisfies a third-order ordinary
differential equation, which we derive. We numerically verify the crossing
symmetry relations for the constructed correlation functions in the
nondegenerate case.
