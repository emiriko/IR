In this article, Einstein-Maxwell space-time has been considered in
connection to some of the astrophysical solutions as previously obtained by
Tolman (1939) and Bayin (1978). The effect of inclusion of charge into these
solutions has been investigated thoroughly and also the nature of fluid
pressure and mass density throughout the sphere have been discussed.
Mass-radius and mass-charge relations have been derived for various cases of
the charged matter distribution. Two cases are obtained where perfect fluid
with positive pressures give rise to electromagnetic mass models such that
gravitational mass is of purely electromagnetic origin.
