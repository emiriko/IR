We introduce a spectrum for arbitrary varieties. This generalizes the
definition by Steenbrink for hypersurfaces. In the isolated complete
intersection singularity case, it coincides with the one given by Ebeling and
Steenbrink except for the coefficients of integral exponents. We show a
relation to the graded pieces of the multiplier ideals by using a relation to
the filtration $V$ of Kashiwara and Malgrange. This implies a partial
generalization of a theorem of Budur in the hypersurface case. The point is to
consider the direct sum of the graded pieces of the multiplier ideals as a
module over the algebra defining the normal cone of the subvariety. We also
give a combinatorial description in the case of monomial ideals.
