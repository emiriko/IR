Mobile multi-hop ad hoc networks allow establishing local groups of
communicating devices in a self-organizing way. However, in a global setting
such networks fail to work properly due to network partitioning. Providing that
devices are capable of communicating both locally-e.g. using Wi-Fi or
Bluetooth-and additionally also with arbitrary remote devices-e.g. using
GSM/UMTS links-the objective is to find efficient ways of inter-linking
multiple network partitions. Tackling this problem of topology control, we
focus on the class of small-world networks that obey two distinguishing
characteristics: they have a strong local clustering while still retaining a
small average distance between two nodes. This paper reports on results gained
investigating the question if small-world properties are indicative for an
efficient link management in multiple multi-hop ad hoc network partitions.
