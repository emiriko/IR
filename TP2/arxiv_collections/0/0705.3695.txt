Momentum dependent charge excitations of a two-leg ladder are investigated by
resonant inelastic x-ray scattering of (La,Sr,Ca)14Cu24O41. In contrast to the
case of a square lattice, momentum dependence of the Mott gap excitation of the
ladder exhibits little change upon hole-doping, indicating the formation of
hole pairs. Theoretical calculation based on a Hubbard model qualitatively
explains this feature. In addition, experimental data shows intraband
excitation as continuum intensity below the Mott gap and it appears at all the
momentum transfers simultaneously. The intensity of the intraband excitation is
proportional to the hole concentration of the ladder, which is consistent with
optical conductivity measurements.
