The Ten dimensional Unified field theory has a 4 dimensional Riemannian
spacetime and six dimensional Calabi Yau space structure. The supersymmetric
Yang Mills fields and black holes are solutions in these theories. The
formation of primordial black holes in early universe, the collapse to
singularity of stellar black holes, the Hawking evaporation of microscopic
black holes in LHC are topics of observational and theoretical interest.
  The observation of gamma ray bursts and creation of spectrum of particles and
radiation of dark and normal matter occur due to primordial and microscopic
black holes. The approach to singularity in black hole interior solutions,
require the Bogoliubov transforms of SUSY YM fields in black hole geometries;
both during formation and in evaporation. The Hawking effect of radiating black
holes is applicable for all the fields. Invariants can be defined to give the
conditions for these processes.
