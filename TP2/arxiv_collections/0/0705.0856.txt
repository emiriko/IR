The multiobjective optimization of Slide-o-Cam is reported in this paper.
Slide-o-Cam is a cam mechanism with multiple rollers mounted on a common
translating follower. This transmission provides pure-rolling motion, thereby
reducing the friction of rack-and-pinions and linear drives. A Pareto frontier
is obtained by means of multiobjective optimization. This optimization is based
on three objective functions: (i) the pressure angle, which is a suitable
performance index for the transmission because it determines the amount of
force transmitted to the load vs. that transmitted to the machine frame; (ii)
the Hertz pressure used to evaluate the stresses produced on the contact
surface between cam and roller; and (iii) the size of the mechanism,
characterized by the number of cams and their width.
