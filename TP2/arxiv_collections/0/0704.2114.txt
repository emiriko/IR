The frequency distribution of DNA bases A, C, G, T exhibit fractal
fluctuations ubiquitous to dynamical systems in nature. The power spectra of
fractal fluctuations exhibit inverse power law form signifying long-range
correlations between local (small-scale) and global (large-scale)
perturbations. The author has developed a general systems theory based on
classical statistical physics for fractal fluctuations which predicts that the
probability distribution of eddy amplitudes and the variance (square of eddy
amplitude)spectrum of fractal fluctuations follow the universal Boltzmann
inverse power law expressed as a function of the golden mean. The model
predicted distribution is very close to statistical normal distribution for
fluctuations within two standard deviations from the mean and exhibits a fat
long tail. In this paper it is shown that DNA base CG frequency distribution in
Takifugu rubripes (Puffer fish) Genome Release 4 exhibit universal inverse
power law form consistent with model prediction. The observed long-range
correlations in the DNA bases implies that the non-coding 'junk' or 'selfish'
DNA which appear to be redundant, may also contribute to the efficient
functioning of the protein coding DNA, a result supported by recent studies.
