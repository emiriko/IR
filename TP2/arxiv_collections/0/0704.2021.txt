We investigate possible mass shift and width broadening of J/psi in hot
gluonic matter using QCD sum rule. Input values of gluon condensates at finite
temperature are extracted from lattice QCD data for the energy density and
pressure. Although stability of the moment ratio is achieved only up to T/Tc ~
1.05, the gluon condensates cause a decrease of the moment ratio, which results
in change of spectral properties. Using the Breit-Wigner form for the
phenomenological side, we find that mass shift of J/psi just above Tc can reach
maximally 200 MeV and width can broaden to dozens of MeV.
