Very recently, it has been shown that thermal noise and its artificial
versions (Johnson-like noises) can be utilized as an information carrier with
peculiar properties therefore it may be proper to call this topic Thermal Noise
Informatics. Zero Power (Stealth) Communication, Thermal Noise Driven
Computing, and Totally Secure Classical Communication are relevant examples. In
this paper, while we will briefly describe the first and the second subjects,
we shall focus on the third subject, the secure classical communication via
wire. This way of secure telecommunication utilizes the properties of
Johnson(-like) noise and those of a simple Kirchhoff's loop. The communicator
is unconditionally secure at the conceptual (circuit theoretical) level and
this property is (so far) unique in communication systems based on classical
physics. The communicator is superior to quantum alternatives in all known
aspects, except the need of using a wire. In the idealized system, the
eavesdropper can extract zero bit of information without getting uncovered. The
scheme is naturally protected against the man-in-the-middle attack. The
communication can take place also via currently used power lines or phone
(wire) lines and it is not only a point-to-point communication like quantum
channels but network-ready. Tests have been carried out on a model-line with
ranges beyond the ranges of any known direct quantum communication channel and
they indicate unrivalled signal fidelity and security performance. This simple
device has single-wire secure key generation/sharing rates of 0.1, 1, 10, and
100 bit/second for copper wires with diameters/ranges of 21 mm / 2000 km, 7 mm
/ 200 km, 2.3 mm / 20 km, and 0.7 mm / 2 km, respectively and it performs with
0.02% raw-bit error rate (99.98 % fidelity).
