In this Paper we present high angular resolution imaging of 3
intermediate-mass (IM) stars using the Plateau de Bure Interferometer (PdBI).
In particular we present the chemical study we have carried out towards the IM
hot core NGC 7129--FIRS 2. This is the first chemical study in an IM hot core
and provides important hints to understand the dependence of the hot core
chemistry on the stellar luminosity. We also present our high angular
resolution (0.3") images of the borderline Class 0-Class I object IC1396 N.
These images trace the warm region of this IM protostar with unprecedent detail
(0.3"\sim200 AU at the distance of IC1396 N) and provide the first detection of
a cluster of IM hot cores. Finally, we present our interferometric continuum
and spectroscopic images of the disk around the Herbig Be star R Mon. We have
determined the kinematics and physical structure of the disk associated with
this B0 star. The low spectral index derived from the dust emission as well as
the flat geometry of the disk suggest a more rapid evolution of the disks
associated with massive stars. In the Discussion, we dare to propose a possible
evolutionary sequence for the warm circumstellar material around IM stars.
