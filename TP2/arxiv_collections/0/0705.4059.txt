Grand Unified Theories based on the group SO(10) generically provide
interesting and testable relations between the charged fermions and neutrino
sector masses and mixings. In the light of the recent neutrino data, we
reexamine these relations both in supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric models,
and give a brief review of their present status.
