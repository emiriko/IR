It usually writes the boundary condition of the wave equation in the Coulomb
field as a rough form without considering the size of the atomic nucleus. The
rough expression brings on that the solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation and
the Dirac equation with the Coulomb potential are divergent at the origin of
the coordinates, also the virtual energies, when the nuclear charges number Z >
137, meaning the original solutions do not satisfy the conditions for
determining solution. Any divergences of the wave functions also imply that the
probability density of the meson or the electron would rapidly increase when
they are closing to the atomic nucleus. What it predicts is not a truth that
the atom in ground state would rapidly collapse to the neutron-like. We
consider that the atomic nucleus has definite radius and write the exact
boundary condition for the hydrogen and hydrogen-like atom, then newly solve
the radial Dirac-Coulomb equation and obtain a new exact solution without any
mathematical and physical difficulties. Unexpectedly, the K value constructed
by Dirac is naturally written in the barrier width or the equivalent radius of
the atomic nucleus in solving the Dirac equation with the exact boundary
condition, and it is independent of the quantum energy. Without any divergent
wave function and the virtual energies, we obtain a new formula of the energy
levels that is different from the Dirac formula of the energy levels in the
Coulomb field.
