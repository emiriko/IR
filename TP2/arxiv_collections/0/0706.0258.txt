Exploiting operator relations in QCD, we derive a novel and model-independent
formula relating the in-medium quark condensate <bar-q q>* to the decay
constant F*_t and the wave function renormalization constant Z* of the pion in
the nuclear medium. Evaluating Z* at low density from the iso-scalar
pion-nucleon scattering data, it is concluded that the enhanced repulsion of
the s-wave isovector pion-nucleusinteraction observed in the deeply bound
pionic atoms implies directly the reduction of the in-medium quark condensate.
The knowlege of the in-medium pion mass is not necessary to reach this
conclusion.
