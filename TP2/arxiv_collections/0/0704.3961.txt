We give a one-dimensional quantum cellular automaton (QCA) capable of
simulating all others. By this we mean that the initial configuration and the
local transition rule of any one-dimensional QCA can be encoded within the
initial configuration of the universal QCA. Several steps of the universal QCA
will then correspond to one step of the simulated QCA. The simulation preserves
the topology in the sense that each cell of the simulated QCA is encoded as a
group of adjacent cells in the universal QCA. The encoding is linear and hence
does not carry any of the cost of the computation. We do this in two flavours:
a weak one which requires an infinite but periodic initial configuration and a
strong one which needs only a finite initial configuration. KEYWORDS: Quantum
