A three-dimensional system of interacting spins typically develops static
long-range order when it is cooled. If the spins are quantum (S = 1/2),
however, novel quantum paramagnetic states may appear. The most highly sought
state among them is the resonating valence bond (RVB) state in which every pair
of neighboring quantum spins form entangled spin singlets (valence bonds) and
the singlets are quantum mechanically resonating amongst all the possible
highly degenerate pairing states. Here we provide experimental evidence for
such quantum paramagnetic states existing in frustrated antiferromagnets,
ZnxCu4-x(OD)6Cl2, where the S = 1/2 magnetic Cu2+ moments form layers of a
two-dimensional kagome lattice. We find that in Cu4(OD)6Cl2, where distorted
kagome planes are weakly coupled to each other, a dispersionless excitation
mode appears in the magnetic excitation spectrum below ~ 20 K, whose
characteristics resemble those of quantum spin singlets in a solid state, known
as a valence bond solid (VBS), that breaks translational symmetry. Doping
nonmagnetic Zn2+ ions reduces the distortion of the kagome lattice, and weakens
the interplane coupling but also dilutes the magnetic occupancy of the kagome
lattice. The VBS state is suppressed and for ZnCu3(OD)6Cl2 where the kagome
planes are undistorted and 90% occupied by the Cu2+ ions, the low energy spin
fluctuations in the spin liquid phase become featureless.
