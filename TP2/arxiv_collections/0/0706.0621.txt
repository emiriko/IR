We describe measurements of the decay of pure superfluid turbulence in
superfluid 3He-B, in the low temperature regime where the normal fluid density
is negligible. We follow the decay of the turbulence generated by a vibrating
grid as detected by vibrating wire resonators. Despite the absence of any
classical normal fluid dissipation processes, the decay is consistent with
turbulence having the classical Kolmogorov energy spectrum and is remarkably
similar to that measured in superfluid 4He at relatively high temperatures.
Further, our results strongly suggest that the decay is governed by the
superfluid circulation quantum rather than kinematic viscosity.
