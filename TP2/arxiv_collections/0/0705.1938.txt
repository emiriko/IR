The LBV/WR system HD 5980 contains a short-period, eccentric binary system
with interacting stellar winds. In this paper we summarize results from model
calculations of the tidal flows on the LBV component showing that energy
dissipation rates, E-dot, associated with turbulent viscosity are orbital-phase
dependent as well as variable over the stellar surface. We speculate that if
E-dot contributes towards driving mass-loss, the strongest wind-wind
interaction effects may occur after periastron passage. In addition, the model
suggests the presence of stronger outflows localized at polar angles theta~30
--50 degrees during part of the orbital cycle. Thus, the analysis of wind-wind
interactions in this system requires that models be revised to incorporate
non-stationary and asymmetric wind structures.
