Luttinger liquid behavior of one-dimensional correlated electron systems is
characterized by power-law scaling of a variety of physical observables with
exponents determined by a single interaction dependent parameter K. We suggest
a setup to study Luttinger liquid behavior in quantum wires which allows to
determine K from two independent measurements: resonant transport through a
quantum dot embedded in the wire and the charge on the dot. Consistency of the
two measured values of K for a single probe would provide strong experimental
evidence for the Luttinger liquid paradigm.
