Using the Swift data of GRB 050315, we progress on the uniqueness of our
theoretically predicted Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) structure as composed by a
proper-GRB (P-GRB), emitted at the transparency of an electron-positron plasma
with suitable baryon loading, and an afterglow comprising the so called "prompt
emission" as due to external shocks. Thanks to the Swift observations, we can
theoretically fit detailed light curves for selected energy bands on a
continuous time scale ranging over 10^6 seconds. The theoretically predicted
instantaneous spectral distribution over the entire afterglow confirms a clear
hard-to-soft behavior encompassing, continuously, the "prompt emission" all the
way to the latest phases of the afterglow. Consequences of the instrumental
threshold on the definition of "short" and "long" GRBs are discussed.
