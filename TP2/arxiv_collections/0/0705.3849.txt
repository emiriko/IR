We present calculations of the frequency-dependent spin susceptibility tensor
of a two-dimensional electron gas with competing Rashba and Dresselhaus
spin-orbit interaction. It is shown that the interplay between both types of
spin-orbit coupling gives rise to an anisotropic spectral behavior of the spin
density response function which is significantly different from that of
vanishing Rashba or Dresselhaus case. Strong resonances are developed in the
spin susceptibility as a consequence of the angular anisotropy of the energy
spin-splitting. This characteristic optical modulable response may be useful to
experimentally probe spin accumulation and spin density currents in such
systems.
