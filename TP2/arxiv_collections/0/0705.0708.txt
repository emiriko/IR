Ordinary and gl(n,R) generalized Toda systems as well as a related hierarchy
are probed with respect to certain quantization characteristics. "Quantum"
canonical and Poisson transformations are used to study quantizations of
transformed Toda systems. With a Lax pair setting, a hierarchy of related
systems are shown and their quantizations discussed. Finally, comments are
added about quantum aspects of gl(n,R) generalized Toda systems with the
approaches of deformation quantization or quantum groups in mind.
