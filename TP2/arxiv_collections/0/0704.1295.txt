Electronic structure of a novel superconducting noncentrosymmetric compound
Mg10Ir19B16 was calculated using the Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker method. Electronic
part of the electron-phonon coupling constant, McMillan-Hopfield parameters,
were calculated using the rigid-muffin-tin approximation (RMTA). The magnitude
of the electron-phonon coupling constant, analysing atomic contributions, is
discussed. Our results show, that superconductivity in Mg10Ir19B16 is
presumably mediated by electron-phonon interaction.
