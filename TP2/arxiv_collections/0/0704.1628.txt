Spin-dependent transport measurements through a double quantum dot are a
valuable tool for detecting both the coherent evolution of the spin state of a
single electron as well as the hybridization of two-electron spin states. In
this paper, we discuss a model that describes the transport cycle in this
regime, including the effects of an oscillating magnetic field (causing
electron spin resonance) and the effective nuclear fields on the spin states in
the two dots. We numerically calculate the current flow due to the induced spin
flips via electron spin resonance and we study the detector efficiency for a
range of parameters. The experimental data are compared with the model and we
find a reasonable agreement.
