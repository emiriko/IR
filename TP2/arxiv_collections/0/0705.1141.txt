We present a study of magnetic profiles of umbral dots (UDs) and its
consequences on the Joule heating mechanisms. Hamedivafa (2003) studied Joule
heating using vertical component of magnetic field. In this paper UDs magnetic
profile has been investigated including the new azimuthal component of magnetic
field which might explain the relatively larger enhancement of Joule heating
causing more brightness near circumference of UD.
