We argue that estimates of dissipative effects based on the first-order
hydrodynamics with shear viscosity are potentially misleading because higher
order terms in the gradient expansion of the dissipative part of the stress
tensor tend to reduce them. Using recently obtained sound dispersion relation
in thermal $\cal N$=4 supersymmetric plasma, we calculate the $resummed$ effect
of these high order terms for Bjorken expansion appropriate to RHIC/LHC
collisions. A reduction of entropy production is found to be substantial, up to
an order of magnitude.
