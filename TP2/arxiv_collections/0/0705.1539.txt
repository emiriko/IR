Colliding winds of massive stars in binary systems are considered as
candidate sites of high-energy non-thermal photon emission. They are already
among the suggested counterparts for a few individual unidentified EGRET
sources, but may constitute a detectable source population for the GLAST
observatory. The present work investigates such population study of massive
colliding wind systems at high-energy gamma-rays. Based on the recent detailed
model (Reimer et al. 2006) for non-thermal photon production in prime candidate
systems, we unveil the expected characteristics of this source class in the
observables accessible at LAT energies. Combining the broadband emission model
with the presently cataloged distribution of such systems and their individual
parameters allows us to conclude on the expected maximum number of
LAT-detections among massive stars in colliding wind binary systems.
