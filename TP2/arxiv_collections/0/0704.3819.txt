The notion of a Weyl module, previously defined for the untwisted affine
algebras, is extended here to the twisted affine algebras. We describe an
identification of the Weyl modules for the twisted affine algebras with
suitably chosen Weyl modules for the untwisted affine algebras. This
identification allows us to use known results in the untwisted case to compute
the dimensions and characters of the Weyl modules for the twisted algebras.
