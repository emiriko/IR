We present the results of the magnetic and specific heat measurements on V4
tetrahedral-cluster compound GaV4S8 between 2 to 300K. We find two transitions
related to a structural change at 42K followed by ferromagnetic order at 12K on
cooling. Remarkably similar properties were previously reported for the cluster
compounds of Mo4. These compounds show an extremely high density of low energy
excitations in their electronic properties. We explain this behavior in a
cluster compound as due to the reduction of coulomb repulsion among electrons
that occupy highly degenerate orbits of different clusters.
