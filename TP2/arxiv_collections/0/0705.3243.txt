Traceroute sampling is an important technique in exploring the internet
router graph and the autonomous system graph. Although it is one of the primary
techniques used in calculating statistics about the internet, it can introduce
bias that corrupts these estimates. This paper reports on a theoretical and
experimental investigation of a new technique to reduce the bias of traceroute
sampling when estimating the degree distribution. We develop a new estimator
for the degree of a node in a traceroute-sampled graph; validate the estimator
theoretically in Erdos-Renyi graphs and, through computer experiments, for a
wider range of graphs; and apply it to produce a new picture of the degree
distribution of the autonomous system graph.
