When n is odd, consider the finite general linear and unitary groups of rank
n, extended by the inverse transpose automorphism. There are elements in the
extended groups which square to a regular unipotent element, and we evaluate
the values of irreducible characters of the extended groups on these elements.
Several intermediate results on real conjugacy classes and real-valued
characters of these groups are obtained along the way.
