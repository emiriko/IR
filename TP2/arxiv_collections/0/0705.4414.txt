The light-cone gauge allows to single out a set of ``transverse'' fields
(TF), whose Green functions are free from UV divergences in SYM N=4. Green
functions with external lines involving the remaining fields do instead exhibit
divergences: indeed those fields can be expressed, by solving their equations
of motion, as composite operators in terms of ``transverse'' fields. A set of
exact identities (bridge identities) automatically realize their insertions in
a path-integral formulation.
