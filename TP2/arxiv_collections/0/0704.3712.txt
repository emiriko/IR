The first direct measurement of p_t-broadening effects in cold nuclear matter
has been studied as a function of several kinematic variables for different
hadron types. The data have been accumulated by the HERMES experiment at DESY,
in which the HERA 27.6 GeV lepton beam scattered off several nuclear gas
targets.
