We study the effects of different forms of information feedback associated
with mass media on an agent-agent based model of the dynamics of cultural
dissemination. In addition to some processes previously considered, we also
examine a model of local mass media influence in cultural dynamics. Two
mechanisms of information feedback are investigated: (i) direct mass media
influence, where local or global mass media act as an additional element in the
network of interactions of each agent, and (ii) indirect mass media influence,
where global media acts as a filter of the influence of the existing network of
interactions of each agent. Our results generalize previous findings showing
that cultural diversity builds-up by increasing the strength of the mass media
influence. We find that this occurs independently of the mechanisms of action
(direct or indirect) of the mass media message. However, through an analysis of
the full range of parameters measuring cultural diversity, we establish that
the enhancement of cultural diversity produced by interaction with mass media
only occurs for strong enough mass media messages. In comparison with previous
studies a main different result is that weak mass media messages, in
combination with agent-agent interaction, are efficient in producing cultural
homogeneity. Moreover, the homogenizing effect of weak mass media messages are
more efficient for direct local mass media messages than for global mass media
messages or indirect global mass media influences.
