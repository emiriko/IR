We study a particle moving at unit speed in a self-similar Lorentz billiard
channel; the latter consists of an infinite sequence of cells which are
identical in shape but growing exponentially in size, from left to right. We
present numerical computation of the drift term in this system and establish
the logarithmic periodicity of the corrections to the average drift.
