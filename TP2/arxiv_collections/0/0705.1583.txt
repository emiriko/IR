Wireless networking is rapidly growing and becomes an inexpensive technology
which allows multiple users to simultaneously access the network and the
internet while roaming about the campus. In the present work, the software
development of a wireless LAN(WLAN) is highlighted. This WLAN utilizes direct
sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) technology at 902MHz RF carrier frequency in
its physical layer. Cost effective installation and antijaming property of
spread spectrum technology are the major advantages of this work.
