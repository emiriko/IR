Detecting and studying objects at the highest redshifts, out to the end of
Cosmic Reionization at z>7, is clearly a key science goal of ALMA. ALMA will in
principle be able to detect objects in this redshift range both from high-J
(J>7) CO transitions and emission from ionized carbon, [CII], which is one of
the main cooling lines of the ISM. ALMA will even be able to resolve this
emission for individual targets, which will be one of the few ways to determine
dynamical masses for systems in the Epoch of Reionization. We discuss some of
the current problems regarding the detection and characterization of objects at
high redshifts and how ALMA will eliminate most (but not all) of them.
