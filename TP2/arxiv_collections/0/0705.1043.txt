We study a recently introduced model of one-component glass-forming liquids
whose constituents interact with anisotropic potential. This system is
interesting per-se and as a model of liquids like glycerol (interacting via
hydrogen bonds) which are excellent glass formers. We work out the statistical
mechanics of this system, encoding the liquid and glass disorder using
appropriate quasi-particles (36 of them). The theory provides a full
explanation of the glass transition phenomenology, including the identification
of a diverging length scale and a relation between the structural changes and
the diverging relaxation times.
