Ti50 Pd50-xCrx is a high temperature shape memory alloy with a martensitic
transformation temperature strongly dependent on the Cr composition. Prior to
the transformation a premartensitic phase is present with an incommensurate
modulated cubic lattice with wave vector of q0=(0.22, 0.22, 0). The temperature
dependence of the diffuse scattering in the cubic phase is measured as a
function temperature for x=6.5, 8.5, and 10 at. %. The lattice dynamics has
been studied and reveals anomalous temperature and q-dependence of the
[110]-TA2 transverse phonon branch. The phonon linewidth is broad over the
entire Brillouin zone and increases with decreasing temperature, contrary to
the behavior expected for anharmonicity. No anomaly is observed at q0. The
results are compared with first principles calculation of the phonon structure.
