A class of non static solutions around a global monopole resulting from the
breaking of a global S0(3) symmetry based on Lyra geometry are obtained. The
solutions are obtained using the functional separability of the metric
coefficients. We have shown that the monopole exerts attractive gravitational
effects on test particles.
