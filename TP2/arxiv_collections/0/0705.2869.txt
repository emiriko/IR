We present two studies into strong symmetry breaking scenarios at the LHC.
The first case is a study into vector boson scattering at ATLAS. This uses the
framework of the Electroweak Chiral Lagrangian with Pade unitarisation to
generate possible signal scenarios. Signals could be observed with an
integrated luminosity of 30 fb^{-1}. Secondly a search for the technirho,
rho_{TC}, at CMS is presented, within the Technicolour ``Straw Man'' model. 5
sigma discovery is possible starting from 4 fb^{-1}.
