Recently, Takenaka et al. reported that the resistivity rho(T) of
theta-(BEDT-TTF)_2I_3 (theta-ET) exceeds the Ioffe-Regel resistivity by a
factor of 50 at large temperatures T (``bad metal''). This was ascribed to
strong correlation. We argue that the optical conductivity sigma(omega) implies
that correlation is not very strong, and that correlation gives no general
strong suppression of sigma(omega). The large rho(T) is primarily due to a
downturn in sigma(omega) at small omega, earlier emphasized by Takenaka et al.
as the explanation for bad metal behavior of high-T_c cuprates. We argue,
however, that for cuprates strong correlation is the main effect. The data of
Takenaka et al. puts theta-ET in a new class of bad metals.
