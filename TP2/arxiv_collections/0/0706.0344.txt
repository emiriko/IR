We present a new multi-annulus code for the study of collisionally evolving
extended debris discs. We first aim to confirm results obtained for a
single-annulus system, namely that the size distribution in "real" debris discs
always departs from the theoretical collisional equilibrium
$dN\proptoR^{-3.5}dR$ power law, especially in the crucial size range of
observable particles (<1cm), where it displays a characteristic wavy pattern.
We also aim at studying how debris discs density distributions, scattered light
luminosity profiles, and SEDs are affected by the coupled effect of collisions
and radial mixing due to radiation pressure affected small grains. The size
distribution evolution is modeled from micron-sized grains to 50km-sized
bodies. The model takes into account the crucial influence of radiation
pressure-affected small grains. We consider the collisional evolution of a
fiducial a=120AU radius disc with an initial surface density in
$\Sigma(a)\propto a^{\alpha}$. We show that the system's radial extension plays
a crucial role: in most regions the collisional and size evolution of the dust
is imposed by small particles on eccentric or unbound orbits produced further
inside the disc. The spatial distribution of small grains strongly departs from
the initial profile, while the bigger objects, containing most of the system's
mass, still follow the initial distribution. This has consequences on the
scattered--light radial profiles which get significantly flatter, and we
propose an empirical law to trace back the distribution of large unseen parent
bodies from the observed profiles. We finally provide empirical formula for the
collisional size distribution and collision timescale that can be used for
future debris disc modeling.
