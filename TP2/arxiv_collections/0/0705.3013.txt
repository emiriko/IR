In this paper the issue of energy efficiency in CDMA wireless data networks
is addressed through a game theoretic approach. Building on a recent paper by
the first two authors, wherein a non-cooperative game for spreading-code
optimization, power control, and receiver design has been proposed to maximize
the ratio of data throughput to transmit power for each active user, a
stochastic algorithm is here described to perform adaptive implementation of
the said non-cooperative game. The proposed solution is based on a combination
of RLS-type and LMS-type adaptations, and makes use of readily available
measurements. Simulation results show that its performance approaches with
satisfactory accuracy that of the non-adaptive game, which requires a much
larger amount of prior information.
