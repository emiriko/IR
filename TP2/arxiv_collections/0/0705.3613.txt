The total neutron-Nucleus cross section has been calculated within an
approach which takes into account nucleon-nucleon correlations, Glauber
multiple scattering and inelastic shadowing corrections. Nuclear targets
ranging from 4He to 208Pb and neutron incident momentum ranging from 3 to 300
GeV/c, have been considered. Correlations have been introduced by two different
approaches leading to the same results. The commonly used approximation,
consisting in treating nuclear effects only by a product of one-body densities,
is carefully analyzed and it is shown that the effects of realistic
correlations resulting from modern nucleon-nucleon interactions and realistic
correlations resulting from realistic nucleon-nucleon interactions and
microscopic ground state calculation of nuclear properties cannot be
disregarded.
