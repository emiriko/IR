The hypothesis concerning the off-site continuum existence is investigated
from the point of view of the mathematical theory of sets. The principles and
methods of the mathematical description of the physical objects from different
off-site continuums are introduced and discussed. There are also proposed the
mathematical methods of the description of the off-site continuum observable
structures and the visual perception of its physical objects from the continuum
of the observer.
