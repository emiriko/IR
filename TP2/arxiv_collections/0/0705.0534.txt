Inspired by the AdS/CFT correspondence, we study the pseudoscalar mesons of
QCD through a dual embedding in a strongly curved extra dimensional spacetime.
This model incorporates the consequences of symmetry and has very few free
parameters, due to constraints from five-dimensions and the operator product
expansion of QCD. Using as inputs the pion, kaon, and rho masses and fpi, we
compute the eta and eta prime masses to be 520 and 867 MeV, respectively. Their
decay rates into photons are also computed and found to be in good agreement
with data.
