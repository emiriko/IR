To endow the N=1* SYM theory with quarks, we embed D7-brane probes into its
gravity dual, known as the Polchinski-Strassler background. The non-vanishing
3-form flux G_3 in the background is dual to mass terms for the three adjoint
chiral superfields, deforming the N=4 SYM theory to the N=1* SYM theory. We
keep its three mass parameters independent. This generalizes our analysis in
hep-th/0610276 for the N=2* SYM theory. We work at second order in the mass
perturbation, i.e. G_3 and its backreaction on the background are considered
perturbatively up to this order. We find analytic solutions for the embeddings
which in general depend also on angular variables. We discuss the properties of
the solutions and give error estimates on our approximation. By applying the
method of holographic renormalization, we show that in all cases the embeddings
are at least consistent with supersymmetry.
