We consider the question of cross-correlation measurements using Virgo and
the LSC Interferometers (LIGO Livingston, LIGO Hanford, and GEO600) to search
for a stochastic gravitational-wave background. We find that inclusion of Virgo
into the network will substantially improve the sensitivity to correlations
above 200 Hz if all detectors are operating at their design sensitivity. This
is illustrated using a simulated isotropic stochastic background signal,
generated with an astrophysically-motivated spectrum, injected into 24 hours of
simulated noise for the LIGO and Virgo interferometers.
