Single electron charging effects in a surface-gated InSb/AlInSb QW structure
are reported. This material, due to its large g-factor and light effective
mass, offers considerable advantages over more commonly used materials, such as
GaAs, for quantum information processing devices. However, differences in
material and device technology result in significant processing challenges.
Simple Coulomb blockade and quantised confinement models are considered to
explain the observation of conductance oscillations in these structures. The
charging energy is found to be comparable with the energy spectrum for single
particle states.
