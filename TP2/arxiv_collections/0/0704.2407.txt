It has been shown based on radio variability arguments that some BALQSOs
(broad absorption line quasars) are viewed along the polar axis (orthogonal to
accretion disk) in the recent article of Zhou et al. These arguments are based
on the brightness temperature, $T_{b}$ exceeding $10^{12} ^{\circ}$ K which
leads to the well-known inverse Compton catastrophe unless the radio jet is
relativistic and is viewed along its axis. In this letter, we expand the Zhou
et al sample of polar BALQSOs to the entire SDSS DR5. In the process, we
clarify a mistake in their calculation of brightness temperature. The expanded
sample of high $T_{b}$ BALQSOS, has an inordinately large fraction of LoBALQSOs
(low ionization BALQSOs). We consider this an important clue to understanding
the nature of the polar BALQSOs. This is expected in the polar BALQSO
analytical/numerical models of Punsly in which LoBALQSOs occur when the line of
sight is very close to the polar axis, where the outflow density is the
highest.
