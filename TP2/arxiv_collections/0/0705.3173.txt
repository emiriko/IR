Although it is commonly agreed that the presence of a close stellar companion
is likely to affect planet formation and evolution, the precise effects and
their actual impact on planet occurrence and properties are still debated. In
particular, observational constraints are sparse, a consequence of the
discrimination against close binaries in Doppler planet searches. To bring
observational constraints on the occurrence and properties of planets in
binaries and multiple stars, we have been conducting two dedicated observing
programs using both adaptive optics imaging and radial-velocity monitoring. In
this chapter we explain our approach and present preliminary results from these
two programs. A simplified statistical analysis of the data from our VLT/NACO
imaging survey brings the first observational evidence that the occurrence of
planets is reduced in binaries closer than ~120 AU. On the radial-velocity
side, current results confirm that the use of two-dimensional correlation
allows to search for circumprimary giant planets in many types of spectroscopic
binaries. Definitive results from our ongoing planet search in spectroscopic
binaries should yield important constraints on the closest binaries susceptible
of hosting circumprimary giant planets.
