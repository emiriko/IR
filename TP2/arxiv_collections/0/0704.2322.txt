A consistent device model to describe current-voltage characteristics of
metal/insulator/metal systems is developed. In this model the insulator and the
metal electrodes are described within the same theoretical framework by using
density of states distributions. This approach leads to differential equations
for the electric field which have to be solved in a self consistent manner by
considering the continuity of the electric displacement and the electrochemical
potential in the complete system. The model is capable of describing the
current-voltage characteristics of the metal/insulator/metal system in forward
and reverse bias for arbitrary values of the metal/ insulator injection
barriers. In the case of high injection barriers, approximations are provided
offering a tool for comparison with experiments. Numerical calculations are
performed exemplary using a simplified model of an organic semiconductor.
