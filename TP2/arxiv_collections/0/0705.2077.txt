Analogue models of gravity have been motivated by the possibility of
investigating phenomena not readily accessible in their cosmological
counterparts. In this paper, we investigate the analogue of cosmological
particle creation in a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe by numerically
simulating a Bose-Einstein condensate with a time-dependent scattering length.
In particular, we focus on a two-dimensional homogeneous condensate using the
classical field method via the truncated Wigner approximation. We show that for
various forms of the scaling function the particle production is consistent
with the underlying theory in the long wavelength limit. In this context, we
further discuss the implications of modified dispersion relations that arise
from the microscopic theory of a weakly interacting Bose gas.
