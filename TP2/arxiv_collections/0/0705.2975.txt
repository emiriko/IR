We compare several definitions of the Galois group of a linear difference
equation that have arisen in algebra, analysis and model theory and show, that
these groups are isomorphic over suitable fields. In addition, we study
properties of Picard-Vessiot extensions over fields with not necessarily
algebraically closed subfields of constants.
