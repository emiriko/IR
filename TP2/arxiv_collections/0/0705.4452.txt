We find an exact solution for the stability limit of relativistic charged
spheres for the case of constant gravitational mass density and constant charge
density. We argue that this provides an absolute stability limit for any
relativistic charged sphere in which the gravitational mass density decreases
with radius and the charge density increases with radius. We then provide a
cruder absolute stability limit that applies to any charged sphere with a
spherically symmetric mass and charge distribution. We give numerical results
for all cases. In addition, we discuss the example of a neutral sphere
surrounded by a thin, charged shell.
