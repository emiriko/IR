The E_6/U(1)_N gauge extension of the Supersymmetric Standard Model, first
proposed by Ma, is shown to have exactly the requisite ingredients to realize
the important new idea that dark matter is the origin of neutrino mass. With
the implementation of a discrete Z_2 X Z_2 symmetry, and particle content given
by three {27} representations of E_6, neutrino masses are naturally generated
in two loops, with candidates of dark matter in the loops. All particles of
this model are expected to be at or below the TeV scale, allowing them to be
observable at the LHC.
