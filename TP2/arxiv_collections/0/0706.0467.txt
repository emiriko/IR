We include in statistical model calculations the facts that in the nuclear
multifragmentation process the fragments are produced within a given volume and
have a finite size. The corrections associated with these constraints affect
the partition modes and, as a consequence, other observables in the process. In
particular, we find that the favored fragmenting modes strongly suppress the
collective flow energy, leading to much lower values compared to what is
obtained from unconstrained calculations. This leads, for a given total
excitation energy, to a nontrivial correlation between the breakup temperature
and the collective expansion velocity. In particular we find that, under some
conditions, the temperature of the fragmenting system may increase as a
function of this expansion velocity, contrary to what it might be expected.
