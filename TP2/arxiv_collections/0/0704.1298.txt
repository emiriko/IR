Over the last few years, optical, mid-infrared and X-ray surveys have brought
to light a significant number of candidate obscured AGN and, among them, many
Type 2 quasars, the long-sought after "big cousins'' of local Seyfert 2
galaxies. However, despite the large amount of multi-wavelength data currently
available, a proper census and a panchromatic view of the obscured AGN/quasar
population are still missing, mainly due to observational limitations. Here we
provide a review of recent results on the identification of obscured AGN,
focusing primarily on the population of Type 2 quasars selected in the optical
band from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.
