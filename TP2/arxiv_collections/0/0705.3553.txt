We update the extraction of |Vub| from exclusive semileptonic B to pi decays,
combining experimental partial branching fraction information with theoretical
form factor calculations, using the recently revised HPQCD results for the form
factors f_+ and f_0. We use Omnes representations to provide the required
parametrisations of the form factors. The extracted value is 10^3 |Vub| =
3.47+/-0.29+/-0.03, in striking agreement with |Vub| extracted using all other
inputs in CKM fits and showing some disagreement with |Vub| extracted from
inclusive semileptonic B to pi decays.
