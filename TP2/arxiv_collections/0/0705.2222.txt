As per organizers' request, my talk at the 11th Marcel Grossmann Conference
consisted of two parts. In the first, I illustrated recent advances in loop
quantum gravity through examples. In the second, I presented an overall
assessment of the status of the program by addressing some frequently asked
questions. This account is addressed primarily to researchers outside the loop
quantum gravity community.
