We numerically study the dynamical excitations in Bose-Einstein condensate
(BEC) placed in periodic and quasi-periodic 2D optical lattice (OL). In case of
the repulsive mean-field interaction the BEC quantum tunnelling leads to a
progressive soliton's splitting and generating of secondary solitons, which
migrate to closest trapping potential minima. A nontrivial soliton dynamics
appears when a series of pi-pulses (phase kicks) are applied to the optical
lattice. Such sudden perturbation produces a dynamic redistribution of the
secondary solitons, leading to a formation of an artificial solitonic
superlattice. Different geometries of OL are analyzed.
