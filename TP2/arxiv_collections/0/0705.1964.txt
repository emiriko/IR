We propose and study a spin-orbit interaction based mechanism to actively
cool down the torsional vibration of a nanomechanical resonator made by
semiconductor materials. We show that the spin-orbit interactions of electrons
can induce a coherent coupling between the electron spins and the torsional
modes of nanomechanical vibration. This coherent coupling leads to an active
cooling for the torsional modes via the dynamical thermalization of the
resonator and the spin ensemble.
