This paper presents simulations of the trajectories of high-energy ions
through several bent crystal layers. At certain layer alignments volume
reflection occurs from each layer and the resultant multiple volume reflection
angle is correspondingly increased, along with the range of entrance angles
over which ions undergo volume reflection. Another feature is that the range of
entrance angles for which bent crystal channeling occurs is also increased in
passing through several bent layers. The use of several bent crystal layers to
produce multiple volume reflection provides an alternative approach to the
design of a space shield or radiation protection at accelerators based on bent
crystals.
