Intracellular recordings of cortical neurons in vivo display intense
subthreshold membrane potential (Vm) activity. The power spectral density (PSD)
of the Vm displays a power-law structure at high frequencies (>50 Hz) with a
slope of about -2.5. This type of frequency scaling cannot be accounted for by
traditional models, as either single-compartment models or models based on
reconstructed cell morphologies display a frequency scaling with a slope close
to -4. This slope is due to the fact that the membrane resistance is
"short-circuited" by the capacitance for high frequencies, a situation which
may not be realistic. Here, we integrate non-ideal capacitors in cable
equations to reflect the fact that the capacitance cannot be charged
instantaneously. We show that the resulting "non-ideal" cable model can be
solved analytically using Fourier transforms. Numerical simulations using a
ball-and-stick model yield membrane potential activity with similar frequency
scaling as in the experiments. We also discuss the consequences of using
non-ideal capacitors on other cellular properties such as the transmission of
high frequencies, which is boosted in non-ideal cables, or voltage attenuation
in dendrites. These results suggest that cable equations based on non-ideal
capacitors should be used to capture the behavior of neuronal membranes at high
frequencies.
