A new method to coherently control the electron dynamics is proposed using a
few-cycle laser pulse in combination with a controlling field. It is shown that
this method not only broadens the attosecond pulse bandwidth, but also reduces
the chirp, then an isolated 80-as pulse is straightforwardly obtained and even
shorter pulse is achievable by increasing the intensity of the controlling
field. Such ultrashort pulses allow one to investigate ultrafast electronic
processes which have never be achieved before. In addition, the few-cycle
synthesized pulse is expected to manipulate a wide range of laser-atom
interactions.
