In this letter we consider the consequences for the LHC of light vector-like
exotica with fractional electric charge. It is shown that such states are found
in orbifold constructions of the heterotic string. Moreover, these exotica are
consistent with gauge coupling unification at one loop, even though they do not
come in complete multiplets of SU(5).
