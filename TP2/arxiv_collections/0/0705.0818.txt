We extend the SU(4) model [1-5] for high-Tc superconductivity to an SU(4)k
model that permits explicit momentum (k) dependence in predicted observables.
We derive and solve gap equations that depend on k, temperature, and doping
from the SU(4)k coherent states, and show that the new SU(4)k model reduces to
the original SU(4) model for observables that do not depend explicitly on
momentum. The results of the SU(4)k model are relevant for experiments such as
ARPES that detect explicitly k-dependent properties. The present SU(4)k model
describes quantitatively the pseudogap temperature scale and may explain why
the ARPES-measured T* along the anti-nodal direction is larger than other
measurements that do not resolve momentum. It also provides an immediate
microscopic explanation for Fermi arcs observed in the pseudogap region. In
addition, the model leads to a prediction that even in the underdoped regime,
there exist doping-dependent windows around nodal points in the k-space, where
antiferromagnetism may be completely suppressed for all doping fractions,
permitting pure superconducting states to exist.
