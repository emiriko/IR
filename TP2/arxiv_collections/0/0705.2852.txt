Due to the presence of a large orbital angular momentum of the parton system
produced at the early stage of non-central heavy-ion collisions, quarks and
anti-quarks are shown to be polarized in the direction opposite to the reaction
plane which is determined by the impact-parameter and the beam momentum. The
global quark polarization via elastic scattering was first calculated in an
effective static potential model, then using QCD at finite temperature with the
hard-thermal-loop re-summed gluon propagator. The measurable consequences are
discussed. Global hyperon polarization from the hadronization of polarized
quarks are predicted independent of the hadronization scenarios. It has also
been shown that the global polarization of quarks and anti-quarks leads also to
spin alignment of vector mesons. Dedicated measurements at RHIC are underway
and some of the preliminary results are obtained. In this presentation, the
basic idea and main results of global quark polarization are presented. The
direct consequences such as global hyperon polarization and spin alignment are
summarized.
