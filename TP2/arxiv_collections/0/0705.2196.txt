High resolution optical and ultraviolet spectra of two B-type post-Asymptotic
Giant Branch (post-AGB) stars in globular clusters, Barnard 29 in M 13 and ROA
5701 in omega Cen, have been analysed using model atmosphere techniques. The
optical spectra have been obtained with FEROS on the ESO 2.2-m telescope and
the 2d-Coud\'e spectrograph on the 2.7-m McDonald telescope, while the
ultraviolet observations are from the GHRS on the HST. Abundances of light
elements (C, N, O, Mg, Al and S) plus Fe have been determined from the optical
spectra, while the ultraviolet data provide additional Fe abundance estimates
from Fe III absorption lines in the 1875-1900 {\AA} wavelength region. A
general metal underabundance relative to young B-type stars is found for both
Barnard 29 and ROA 5701. These results are consistent with the metallicities of
the respective clusters, as well as with previous studies of the objects. The
derived abundance patterns suggest that the stars have not undergone a gas-dust
separation, contrary to previous suggestions, although they may have evolved
from the AGB before the onset of the third dredge-up. However, the Fe
abundances derived from the HST spectra are lower than those expected from the
metallicities of the respective clusters, by 0.5 dex for Barnard 29 and 0.8 dex
for ROA 5701. A similar systematic underabundance is also found for other
B-type stars in environments of known metallicity, such as the Magellanic
Clouds. These results indicate that the Fe III ultraviolet lines may yield
abundance values which are systematically too low by typically 0.6 dex and
hence such estimates should be treated with caution.
