We study a particular return map for a class of low dimensional chaotic
models called Kolmogorov Lorenz systems, which received an elegant general
Hamiltonian description and includes also the famous Lorenz63 case, from the
viewpoint of energy and Casimir balance. In particular it is considered in
detail a subclass of these models, precisely those obtained from the Lorenz63
by a small perturbation on the standard parameters, which includes for example
the forced Lorenz case in Ref.[6]. The paper is divided into two parts. In the
first part the extremes of the mentioned state functions are considered, which
define an invariant manifold, used to construct an appropriate Poincare surface
for our return map. From the experimental observation of the simple orbital
motion around the two unstable fixed points, together with the circumstance
that these orbits are classified by their energy or Casimir maximum, we
construct a conceptually simple skeletal dynamics valid within our sub class,
reproducing quite well the Lorenz map for Casimir. This energetic approach
sheds some light on the physical mechanism underlying regime transitions. The
second part of the paper is devoted to the investigation of a new type of
maximum energy based long term predictions, by which the knowledge of a
particular maximum energy shell amounts to the knowledge of the future
(qualitative) behaviour of the system. It is shown that, in this respect, a
local analysis of predictability is not appropriate for a complete
characterization of this behaviour. A perspective on the possible extensions of
this type of predictability analysis to more realistic cases in (geo)fluid
dynamics is discussed at the end of the paper.
