We present a description of finite dimensional quantum entanglement, based on
a study of the space of all convex decompositions of a given density matrix. On
this space we construct a system of real polynomial equations describing
separable states. We further study this system using statistical mechanical
methods. Finally, we apply our techniques to Werner states of two qubits and
obtain a sufficient criterion for separability.
