We obtain integral representations of solutions to special cases of the
Fuchsian system of differential equations and Heun's differential equation. In
particular, we calculate the monodromy of solutions to the Fuchsian equation
that corresponds to Picard's solution of the sixth Painlev\'e equation, and to
Heun's equation.
