We characterize the capacity of the general class of noncoherent underspread
wide-sense stationary uncorrelated scattering (WSSUS) time-frequency-selective
Rayleigh fading channels, under peak constraints in time and frequency and in
time only. Capacity upper and lower bounds are found which are explicit in the
channel's scattering function and allow to identify the capacity-maximizing
bandwidth for a given scattering function and a given peak-to-average power
ratio.
