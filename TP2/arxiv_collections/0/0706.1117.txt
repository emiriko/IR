With increasing applied current we show that the moving vortex lattice
changes its structure from a triangular one to a set of parallel vortex rows in
a pinning free superconductor. This effect originates from the change of the
shape of the vortex core due to non-equilibrium effects (similar to the
mechanism of vortex motion instability in the Larkin-Ovchinnikov theory). The
moving vortex creates a deficit of quasiparticles in front of its motion and an
excess of quasiparticles behind the core of the moving vortex. This results in
the appearance of a wake (region with suppressed order parameter) behind the
vortex which attracts other vortices resulting in an effective
direction-dependent interaction between vortices. When the vortex velocity $v$
reaches the critical value $v_c$ quasi-phase slip lines (lines with fast vortex
motion) appear which may coexist with slowly moving vortices between such
lines. Our results are found within the framework of the time-dependent
Ginzburg-Landau equations and are strictly valid when the coherence length
$\xi(T)$ is larger or comparable with the decay length $L_{in}$ of the
non-equilibrium quasiparticle distribution function. We qualitatively explain
experiments on the instability of vortex flow at low magnetic fields when the
distance between vortices $a \gg L_{in} \gg \xi (T)$. We speculate that a
similar instability of the vortex lattice should exist for $v>v_c$ even when
$a<L_{in}$.
