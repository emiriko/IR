Numerous searches for new phenomena have been carried out using data from
proton-antiproton collisions at Fermilab's Tevatron. Final states with leptons
give signatures which are relatively unique and generally have small
backgrounds. We present many of the latest results from the CDF and D0
collaborations from 0.4-1.2 fb^-1 of data. Topics include supersymmetry, extra
gauge bosons, Randall-Sundrum gravitons, excited electrons and neutral,
long-lived particles.
