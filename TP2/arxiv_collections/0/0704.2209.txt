Using a large sample of spiral galaxies for which 21 cm single-dish and/or
long-slit optical spectra are available, we make a detailed comparison between
various estimates of rotational widths. Different optical width estimators are
considered and their limitations discussed, with emphasis on biases associated
with rotation curve properties (shape and extent) and disk central surface
brightness. The best match with HI rotational velocities is obtained with
Polyex widths, which are measured at the optical radius (encompassing a fixed
fraction of the total light of the galaxy) from a model fit to the rotation
curve. In contrast with Polyex widths, optical rotational velocities measured
at 2.15 disk scale lengths r_d deviate from HI widths by an amount that
correlates with the central surface brightness of the disk. This bias occurs
because the rotation curves of galaxies are in general still rising at 2.15
r_d, and the fraction of total mass contained within this radius decreases with
increasing disk surface brightness. Statistical corrections, parameterized by
the radial extent of the observed rotation curve, are provided to reduce Polyex
and HI width measurements into a homogeneous system. This yields a single
robust estimate of rotational velocity to be used for applications of disk
scaling relations.
