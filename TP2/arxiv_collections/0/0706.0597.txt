In the density distribution of a deformed target-nucleus, the spherical
$\lambda = 0$ and the deformed $\lambda = 2$ parts were considered. On this
basis, the corresponding potential parts $U_0$ and $U^{(2)}_{int}$ of a double
-folding microscopic nucleus-nucleus optical potential are obtained. Then, for
these potentials and by using the coupled-channel technique (ECIS), the elastic
and inelastic amplitudes are calculated for $^{17}O$ heavy ion scattering on
$2^{+}$ collective excited state of various target nuclei. Besides, the same
cross-sections are calculated in the frame of an adiabatic approach of the
eikonal approximation, where the inelastic amplitude is the linear function of
$U^{(2)}_{int}$. Both the obtained results are compared with the experimental
data, and also discuss their efficiency in predicting the deformation
parameters of nuclei.
