Polarized neutron reflectometry (PNR) provides evidence that nonlocal
electrodynamics governs the magnetic field penetration in an extreme low-k
superconductor. The sample is an indium film with a large elastic mean free
path (11 mkm) deposited on a silicon oxide wafer. It is shown that PNR can
resolve the difference between the reflected neutron spin asymmetries predicted
by the local and nonlocal theories of superconductivity. The experimental data
support the nonlocal theory, which predicts a nonmonotonic decay of the
magnetic field.
