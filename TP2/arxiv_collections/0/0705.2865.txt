By measuring transverse single spin asymmetries one has access to the
transversity distribution function $\Delta_T q(x)$ and the transverse momentum
dependent Sivers function $q_0^T(x,\vec{k}_T)$. New measurements from
identified hadrons and hadron pairs, produced in deep inelastic scattering of a
transversely polarized $^6LiD$ target are presented. The data were taken in
2003 and 2004 by the COMPASS collaboration using the muon beam of the CERN SPS
at 160 GeV/c, resulting in small asymmetries.
