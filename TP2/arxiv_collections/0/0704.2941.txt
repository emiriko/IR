Decoy State Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), being capable of beating PNS
attack and uncon- ditionally secure, have become an attractive one recently.
But, in many QKD systems, disturbances of transmission channel make quantum bit
error rate (QBER) increase which limits both security distance and key bit rate
of real-life decoy state QKD systems. We demonstrate the two-intensity decoy
QKD with one-way Faraday-Michelson phase modulation system, which is free of
channel dis- turbance and keeps interference fringe visibility (99%) long
period, near 130KM single mode optical fiber in telecom (1550 nm) wavelength.
This is longest distance fiber decoy state QKD system based on two intensity
protocol.
