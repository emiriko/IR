We give a new moduli construction of the minimal resolution of the
singularity of type 1/r(1,a) by introducing the Special McKay quiver. To
demonstrate that our construction trumps that of the G-Hilbert scheme, we show
that the induced tautological line bundles freely generate the bounded derived
category of coherent sheaves on X by establishing a suitable derived
equivalence. This gives a moduli construction of the Special McKay
correspondence for abelian subgroups of GL(2).
