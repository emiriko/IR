Low energy proton-proton scattering is studied in pionless effective field
theory. Employing the dimensional regularization and MS-bar and power
divergence subtraction schemes for loop calculation, we calculate the
scattering amplitude in 1S0 channel up to next-to-next-to leading order and fix
low-energy constants that appear in the amplitude by effective range
parameters. We study regularization scheme and scale dependence in separation
of Coulomb interaction from the scattering length and effective range for the
S-wave proton-proton scattering.
