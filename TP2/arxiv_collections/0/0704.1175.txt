Two identical 1D autocatalytic systems with Gray--Scott kinetics--driven
towards convectively unstable regimes and submitted to independent
spatiotemporal Gaussian white noises--are coupled unidirectionally, but
otherwise linearly. Numerical simulation then reveals that (even when perturbed
by noise) the slave system replicates the convective patterns arising in the
master one to a very high degree of precision, as indicated by several measures
of synchronization.
