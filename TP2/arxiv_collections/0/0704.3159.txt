The development and progress of the studies of winds and mass loss from hot
stars, from about 1965 up to now, is discussed in a personal historical
perspective. The present state of knowledge about stellar winds, based on
papers presented at this workshop, is described. About ten years ago the
mechanisms of the winds were reasonably well understood, the mass loss rates
were known, and the predictions of stellar evolution theory with mass loss
agreed with observations. However, recent studies especially those based on
FUSE observations, have resulted in a significant reduction of the mass loss
rates, that disagrees with predictions from radiation driven wind models. The
situation is discussed and future studies that can clarify the situation are
suggested.
  I also discuss what is known about the dissolution of star clusters in
different environments. The dissolution time can be derived from the mass and
age distributions of cluster samples. The resulting dissolution times of
clusters in the solar neighborhood (SN) and in interacting galaxies are shorter
than predicted by two-body relaxation of clusters in a tidal field. Encounters
with giant molecular clouds can explain the fate of clusters in the SN and are
the most likely cause of the short lifetime of clusters in interacting
galaxies.
