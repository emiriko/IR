We have studied the possible signals of unparticle in atomic parity
violation(APV) along an isotope chain and in the NuTeV experiment. The effects
of unparticle physics could be observed in APV, if the uncertainty in relative
neutron/proton radius shift $\delta(\Delta\frac{R_N}{R_P})$ is less than a few
times $10^{-4}$ by measuring the parity violating electron scattering. The
constraints imposed by NuTeV experiment on unparticle physics are discussed in
detail. If the NuTeV results are confirmed by future experiments, we suggest
that unparticle could account for a part of NuTeV anomaly. There exist certain
regions for the unparticle parameters ($\Lambda_{\cal U}$, $d_{\cal U}$,
$c_{V{\cal U}}$ and $c_{A{\cal U}}$), where the NuTeV discrepancy could be
completely explained by unparticle effects and the strange quark asymmetry,
even with or without the contributions from the isoscalarity violation etc. It
is remarkable that these parameter regions are consistent with the constraints
from $b\to s\gamma$
