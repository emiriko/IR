We specify recursive equations that could be used to generate a lowest order
parton shower for hard scattering in hadron-hadron collisions. The formalism is
based on the factorization soft and collinear interactions from relatively
harder interactions in QCD amplitudes. It incorporates quantum interference
between different amplitudes in those cases in which the interference diagrams
have leading soft or collinear singularities. It incorporates the color and
spin information carried by partons emerging from a hard interaction. One
motivation for this work is to have a method that can naturally cooperate with
next-to-leading order calculations.
