A spinel related oxide, Na4Ir3O8, was found to have a three dimensional
network of corner shared Ir4+ (t2g^5) triangles. This gives rise to an
antiferromagnetically coupled S = 1/2 spin system formed on a geometrically
frustrated hyperkagome lattice. Magnetization M and magnetic specific heat Cm
data showed the absence of long range magnetic ordering at least down to 2 K.
The large Cm at low temperatures is independent of applied magnetic field up to
12 T, in striking parallel to the behavior seen in triangular and kagome
antiferromagnets reported to have a spin-liquid ground state. These results
strongly suggest that the ground state of Na4Ir3O8 is a three dimensional
manifestation of a spin liquid.
