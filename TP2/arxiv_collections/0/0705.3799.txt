Dusty hyperluminous galaxies in the early universe provide unique
environments for studying the role of massive stars in the formation and
destruction of dust. At redshifts above ~ 6, when the universe was less than ~
1 Gyr old, dust could have only condensed in the explosive ejecta of Type II
supernovae (SNe), since most of the progenitors of the AGB stars, the major
alternative source of interstellar dust, did not have time to evolve off the
main sequence since the onset of star formation. In this paper we present
analytical models for the evolution of the gas, dust, and metals in high
redshift galaxies, with a special application to SDSS J1148+5251, a
hyperluminous quasar at z = 6.4. We find that an average supernova must
condense at least 1 Msun of dust to account for the observed dust mass in this
quasar. Observationally, it is in excess of the largest dust yield of ~0.02
Msun found thus far in the ejecta of any SN. If future observations find this
to be a typical supernova dust yield, then additional processes, such as
accretion onto preexisting grains, or condensation around the AGN will need to
be invoked to account for the large amount of dust in this and similar objects.
The galaxy's star formation history is still uncertain, and current
observations of the gas, metal, and dust contents of J1148 can be reproduced by
either an intensive and short burst of star formation (~ 1000 Msun/yr) with a
duration of ~ 100 Myr, or a much lower star formation rate (~ 100 Msun/yr)
occurring over the lifetime of the galaxy.
