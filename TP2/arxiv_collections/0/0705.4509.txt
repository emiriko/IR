We report measurements of spectroscopic linewidth and Rabi oscillations in
three thin-film dc SQUID phase qubits. One device had a single-turn Al loop,
the second had a 6-turn Nb loop, and the third was a first order gradiometer
formed from 6-turn wound and counter-wound Nb coils to provide isolation from
spatially uniform flux noise. In the 6 - 7.2 GHz range, the spectroscopic
coherence times for the gradiometer varied from 4 ns to 8 ns, about the same as
for the other devices (4 to 10 ns). The time constant for decay of Rabi
oscillations was significantly longer in the single-turn Al device (20 to 30
ns) than either of the Nb devices (10 to 15 ns). These results imply that
spatially uniform flux noise is not the main source of decoherence or
inhomogenous broadening in these devices.
