We discuss possible origins for discrepancies observed in the radiated
energies in head-on collisions of non-spinning binaries starting from
Brill-Lindquist and superposed Kerr-Schild data. For this purpose, we discuss
the impact of different choices of gauge parameters and a small initial boost
of the black holes.
