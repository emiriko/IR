We present a study of interlayer coupling and proximity effects in a
La$_{0.66}$Ca$_{0.33}$MnO$_3$(10 nm)/YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$(10 nm) superlattice.
Using element-sensitive x-ray probes, the magnetic state of Mn can be probed
without seeing the strong diamagnetism of the superconductor, which makes this
approach ideal to study changes in the magnetic properties across the
superconducting transition. By a combined experiment using {\it in situ}
transport measurements during polarized soft x-ray measurements, we were able
to see no noticeable influence of the superconducting state on the magnetic
properties and no evidence for magnetic coupling across a 10 nm YBCO layer.
