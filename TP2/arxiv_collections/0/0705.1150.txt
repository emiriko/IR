Proposed in this paper is a kinetostatic performance index for the optimum
dimensioning of planar manipulators of the serial type. The index is based on
the concept of distance of the underlying Jacobian matrix to a given isotropic
matrix that is used as a reference model for purposes of performance
evaluation. Applications of the index fall in the realm of design, but control
applications are outlined. The paper focuses on planar manipulators, the basic
concepts being currently extended to their three-dimensional counterparts.
