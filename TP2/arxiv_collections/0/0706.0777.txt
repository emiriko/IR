In this paper, bound states energies and corresponding wave functions of
H-shaped quantum wires are calculated numerically in the presence of external
magnetic and electric fields and within the Landau gauge. With a suitable
definition of external confinement potential, we present a numerical algorithm
to calculate the profile of probability distribution of charge carriers. Our
analysis shows that in the presence of external electric and magnetic fields,
bound state properties of carriers are sensitive functions of an asymmetric
parameter $a=\frac{W_{x}}{W_{y}}$ which measures the relative width of the well
in two directions. We also study many body effect of bandgap renormalization in
this quasi one dimensional system within dynamical random phase approximation.
