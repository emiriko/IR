We consider the possibilities of studying a supernova collapse neutrino burst
at Baksan Neutrino Observatory (Institute for Nuclear Research, Russian Academy
of Sciences) using the prposed 5-kt target-mass liquid scintillation
spectrometer. Attention is given to the influence of mixing angle
${\theta}_{13}$ on the expected rates and spectra of neutrino events.
