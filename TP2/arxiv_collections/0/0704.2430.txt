We present imaging data and photometry for the COSMOS survey in 15
photometric bands between 0.3um and 2.4um. These include data taken on the
Subaru 8.3m telescope, the KPNO and CTIO 4m telescopes, and the CFHT 3.6m
telescope. Special techniques are used to ensure that the relative photometric
calibration is better than 1% across the field of view. The absolute
photometric accuracy from standard star measurements is found to be 6%. The
absolute calibration is corrected using galaxy spectra, providing colors
accurate to 2% or better. Stellar and galaxy colors and counts agree well with
the expected values. Finally, as the first step in the scientific analysis of
these data we construct panchromatic number counts which confirm that both the
geometry of the universe and the galaxy population are evolving.
