Proposed by Wolfgang Pauli more than 80 years ago, the exclusion principle
has been proven to have a far-reaching consequence, from femtoscopic world to
macroscopic, super-dense, and fully relativistic physics. Starting from this
principle, we discuss two interesting research topics, which have currently
drawn considerable attention in the nuclear- and astrophysics communities; the
hypernuclear and neutron star physics. Special attention is given to the
electromagnetic production of the hypertriton and the consequences of the
neutrino electromagnetic properties in dense matter. We also touch on the new
arena which could also be fascinating for physicists; the econophysics.
