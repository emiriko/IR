We present results from a high-angular-resolution survey of 78 very low mass
(VLM) binary systems with 6.0 <= V-K colour <= 7.5 and proper motion >= 0.15
arcsec/yr. 21 VLM binaries were detected, 13 of them new discoveries. The new
binary systems range in separation between 0.18 arcsec and 1.3 arcsec. The
distance-corrected binary fraction is 13.5% (+6.5%/-4%), in agreement with
previous results. 9 of the new binary systems have orbital radii > 10 AU,
including a new wide VLM binary with 27 AU projected orbital separation. One of
the new systems forms two components of a 2300 AU separation triple system. We
find that the orbital radius distribution of the binaries with V-K < 6.5 in
this survey appears to be different from that of redder (lower-mass) objects,
suggesting a possible rapid change in the orbital radius distribution at around
the M5 spectral type. The target sample was also selected to investigate X-ray
activity among VLM binaries. There is no detectable correlation between excess
X-Ray emission and the frequency and binary properties of the VLM systems.
