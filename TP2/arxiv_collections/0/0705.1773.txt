The paper focuses on discrete-type approximations of solutions to
non-homogeneous stochastic differential equations (SDEs) involving fractional
Brownian motion (fBm). We prove that the rate of convergence for Euler
approximations of solutions of pathwise SDEs driven by fBm with Hurst index
$H>1/2$ can be estimated by $O(\delta^{2H-1})$ ($\delta$ is the diameter of
partition). For discrete-time approximations of Skorohod-type quasilinear
equation driven by fBm we prove that the rate of convergence is $O(\delta^H)$.
