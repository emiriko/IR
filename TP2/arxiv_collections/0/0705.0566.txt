We report on the structural and magnetic properties of thin Ge(1-x)Mn(x)films
grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) on Ge(001) substrates at temperatures
(Tg) ranging from 80deg C to 200deg C, with average Mn contents between 1 % and
11 %. Their crystalline structure, morphology and composition have been
investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), electron energy loss
spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction. In the whole range of growth temperatures
and Mn concentrations, we observed the formation of manganese rich
nanostructures embedded in a nearly pure germanium matrix. Growth temperature
mostly determines the structural properties of Mn-rich nanostructures. For low
growth temperatures (below 120deg C), we evidenced a two-dimensional spinodal
decomposition resulting in the formation of vertical one-dimensional
nanostructures (nanocolumns). Moreover we show in this paper the influence of
growth parameters (Tg and Mn content) on this decomposition i.e. on nanocolumns
size and density. For temperatures higher than 180deg C, we observed the
formation of Ge3Mn5 clusters. For intermediate growth temperatures nanocolumns
and nanoclusters coexist. Combining high resolution TEM and superconducting
quantum interference device magnetometry, we could evidence at least four
different magnetic phases in Ge(1-x)Mn(x) films: (i) paramagnetic diluted Mn
atoms in the germanium matrix, (ii) superparamagnetic and ferromagnetic low-Tc
nanocolumns (120 K < Tc < 170 K), (iii) high-Tc nanocolumns (Tc> 400 K) and
(iv) Ge3Mn5 clusters.
