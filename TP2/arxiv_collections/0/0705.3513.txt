The CDF and D{\O} experiments at the Tevatron are currently the only capable
of searching for the Standard Model Higgs boson. This article describes their
most sensitive searches in the expected Higgs mass range, focusing on advanced
methods used to extract the maximal sensitivity from the data. CDF presents
newly updated results for $H \to W^+W^-$ and $ZH \to l^+l^- b\bar{b}$. D{\O}\
presents two new searches for $WH \to l\nu b\bar{b}$. These new analyses use
the same 1 fb$^{-1}$ dataset as previous searches, but with improved techniques
resulting in markedly improved sensitivity.
