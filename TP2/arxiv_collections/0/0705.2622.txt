In the recent past,unparticle physics effects have been explored in detail in
both the fermionic and bosonic sectors. We have used fermionic unparticles to
study the cross-section of electron-positron annihilation to light
pseudo-scalar meson pairs e^+e^- ->PP. We show that this cross-section is
sensitive to the scaling dimension d_U<1.4.
