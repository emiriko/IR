The study of impurities in antiferromagnets is of considerable interest in
condensed matter physics. In this paper we address the elementary question of
the effect of vacancies on the orientation of the surrounding magnetic moments
in an antiferromagnet. In the presence of a magnetic field, alternating
magnetic moments are induced, which can be described by a universal expression
that is valid in any ordered antiferromagnet and turns out to be independent of
temperature over a large range. The universality is not destroyed by quantum
fluctuation, which is demonstrated by quantum Monte Carlo simulations in the
two-dimensional Heisenberg antiferromagnet. Physical predictions for finite
doping are made, which are relevant for experiments probing Knight shifts and
the order parameter.
