We implement and demonstrate a scheme that permits to drive
electroluminescence with an extremely low turn-on voltage. The device behaves
like compound semiconductors, in which the electroluminescence turn-on voltage
is about the same as the open circuit voltage for the photovoltaic effect.
However, the electroluminescence turn-on voltage is about half of the band gap
of the emitting material, that cannot be explained using current models of
charge injection in organic semiconductors. We hereby propose explanation
through an Auger-type two-step injection mechanism (Auger-fountain).
