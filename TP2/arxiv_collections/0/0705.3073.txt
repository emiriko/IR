Forward-backward correlation in pp collisions is studied in an approach that
emphasizes the partonic scattering angles and circumvents the intractable
problem related to the transverse momenta that are low. Assuming the
back-to-back scattering of partons to be the origin of hadronic correlation,
the properties of forward-backward multiplicity covariance can be derived
essentially independent of details of hadronization. The range of correlation
in pseudo-rapidity emerges from the study without any dynamical input, thus
dispelling the notion that correlation length has any fundamental significance.
An attempt is made to relate the results to the two-component structure seen in
autocorrelation.
