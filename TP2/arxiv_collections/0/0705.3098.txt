We demonstrate that geodesics in exact vacuum Kundt gravitational waves may
exhibit a highly complicated behaviour. In fact, as in the previously studied
case of non-homogeneous pp-waves, for specific choices of the structural
function the motion appears to be genuinely chaotic. This fact is demonstrated
by the fractal method.
