We report the detection of a transient X-ray source toward the Small
Magellanic Cloud (SMC) using the X-ray Imaging Spectrometer (XIS) onboard the
Suzaku telescope. The source was detected at the edge of the XIS image during a
routine observation of the calibration source 1E 0102.2-7219, a supernova
remnant in the SMC. We constrained the source position using ray-tracing
simulations. No such transient source was found at the position in the other
Suzaku observations nor in all the available archived images of other X-ray
missions for the last ~28 years. The XIS spectrum can be explained by a single
blackbody with a temperature of ~72 eV, and an interstellar extinction of
~4.9x10^{20} H atoms cm^{-2} consistent with the value to the SMC. An
additional absorption edge at ~0.74 keV was also confirmed, which is presumably
due to the absorption by helium-like oxygen ions. Assuming that the source is
at the distance of the SMC, the X-ray luminosity in the 0.2-2.0 keV band is
~10^{37} erg s^{-1} and the radius of the source is ~10^{8} cm. The XIS light
curve shows about a two-fold decline in X-ray flux during the 24 ks
observation. Together with the archived data, the X-ray flux in the burst is at
least three orders of magnitude brighter than the undetected quiescent level.
All these properties are often seen among supersoft sources (SSSs). We conclude
that the transient source is another example of SSS in the SMC.
