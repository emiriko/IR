We study the dynamics of initial nucleation processes of photoinduced
structural change of molecular crystals. In order to describe the nonadiabatic
transition in each molecule, we employ a model of localized electrons coupled
with a fully quantized phonon mode, and the time-dependent Schr\"odinger
equation for the model is numerically solved. We found a minimal model to
describe the nucleation induced by injection of an excited state of a single
molecule in which multiple types of intermolecular interactions are required.
In this model coherently driven molecular distortion plays an important role in
the successive conversion of electronic states which leads to photoinduced
cooperative phenomena.
