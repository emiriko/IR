We show that, for any local, causal quantum field theory which couples
covariantly to gravity, and which admits Minkowski spacetime vacuum(a)
invariant under the inhomogeneous proper orthochronous Lorentz group, plane
gravitational waves propagating in such Minkowski vacuum(a) do not dissipate
energy or momentum via quantum field theoretic effects.
