Half-metallic Heusler alloys are among the most promising materials for
future applications in spintronic devices. Although most Heusler alloys are
ferromagnets, ferrimagnetic or antiferromagnetic (also called fully-compensated
ferrimagnetic) alloys would be more desirable for applications due to the lower
external fields. Ferrimagnetism can be either found in perfect Heusler
compounds or achieved through the creation of defects in ferromagnetic Heusler
alloys.
