I conjecture that a flat 10D compact universe emerged out of nothing (By
``nothing'' I mean no notion of space and time) with all it's symmetries
intact: Poincare invariance, conformal invariance and supersymmetry, it's
massless moduli fields, and a zero energy density. Its subsequent evolution and
spontaneous breaking of these symmetries or by quantum fluctuations leads to
topological defects on this superspace which are the fields we observe (or
haven't yet observed) propagating in this spacetime. By the law of naturalness
it will restore all these broken symmetries. In recent years, the cosmological
constant problem has metamorphosed to a new problem of finding a selection
mechanism that selects our vacuum out of a string theory landscape or resign to
anthropic reasoning. I provide a new perspective for solving this problem using
a multistep approach based on the wavefunction, inflation and conformal
symmetry.
