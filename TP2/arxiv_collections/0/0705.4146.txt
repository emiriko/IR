For some 100 years physics has modelled space and time via the spacetime
concept, with space being merely an observer dependent perspective effect of
that spacetime - space itself had no observer independent existence - it had no
ontological status, and it certainly had no dynamical description. In recent
years this has all changed. In 2002 it was discovered that a dynamical 3-space
had been detected many times, including the Michelson-Morley 1887 light-speed
anisotropy experiment. Here we review the dynamics of this 3-space, tracing its
evolution from that of an emergent phenomena in the information-theoretic
Process Physics to the phenomenological description in terms of a velocity
field describing the relative internal motion of the structured 3-space. The
new physics of the dynamical 3-space is extensively tested against experimental
and astronomical observations, including the necessary generalisation of the
Maxwell, Schrodinger and Dirac equations, leading to a derivation and
explanation of gravity as a refraction effect of quantum matter waves. The flat
and curved spacetime formalisms are derived from the new physics, so explaining
their apparent many successes.
