We demonstrate radiation-pressure cavity-cooling of a mechanical mode of a
micromirror starting from cryogenic temperatures. To achieve that, a
high-finesse Fabry-Perot cavity (F\approx 2200) was actively stabilized inside
a continuous-flow 4He cryostat. We observed optical cooling of the fundamental
mode of a 50mu x 50 mu x 5.4 mu singly-clamped micromirror at \omega_m=3.5 MHz
from 35 K to approx. 290 mK. This corresponds to a thermal occupation factor of
<n>\approx 1x10^4. The cooling performance is only limited by the mechanical
quality and by the optical finesse of the system. Heating effects, e.g. due to
absorption of photons in the micromirror, could not be observed. These results
represent a next step towards cavity-cooling a mechanical oscillator into its
quantum ground state.
