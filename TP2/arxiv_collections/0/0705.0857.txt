We present a new interatomic potential for water captured in a
charge-transfer embedded atom method (EAM) framework. The potential accounts
for explicit, dynamical charge transfer in atoms as a function of the local
chemical environment. As an initial test of the charge-transfer EAM approach
for a molecular system, we have constructed a relatively simple version of the
potential and examined its ability to model the energetics of small water
clusters. The excellent agreement between our results and current experimental
and higher-level quantum computational data signifies a successful first step
towards developing a unified charge-transfer potential capable of accurately
describing the polymorphs, dynamics, and complex thermodynamic behavior of
water.
