We give an explicit expression for the frequencies of slowly damped
quasinormal modes of near-extreme Kerr black holes. It follows from this
expression that the near-extreme Kerr holes obey the Hod's bound: in the limit
of maximal rotation, $\lim \sup \omega_{IS}/T\leq \pi / \hbar$, where $\omega
_{IS}$ is the decay rate of the slowest decaying quasinormal mode, $T$ is the
black hole temperature. On the other hand, the bound is not saturated in the
sense that $\lim \inf \omega_{IS}/T< \pi /\hbar$ is a strict inequality. {\it
It remains unclear} whether the bound is saturated in the sense that $\lim \sup
\omega_{IS}/T= \pi /\hbar$.
