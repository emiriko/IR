We contrast two sets of conditions that govern the transition in which
classical dynamics emerges from the evolution of a quantum system. The first
was derived by considering the trajectories seen by an observer (dubbed the
``strong'' transition) [Bhattacharya, et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 85: 4852
(2000)], and the second by considering phase-space densities (the ``weak''
transition) [Greenbaum, et al., Chaos 15, 033302 (2005)]. On the face of it
these conditions appear rather different. We show, however, that in the
semiclassical regime, in which the action of the system is large compared to
$\hbar$, and the measurement noise is small, they both offer an essentially
equivalent local picture. Within this regime, the weak conditions dominate
while in the opposite regime where the action is not much larger than Planck's
constant, the strong conditions dominate.
