We present Gemini optical spectroscopy of 23 young star clusters in NGC3256.
We find that the cluster ages range are from few Myr to ~150 Myr. All these
clusters are relatively massive (2--40)x 10^{5} \msun$ and appear to be of
roughly 1.5 \zo metallicity. The majority of the clusters in our sample follow
the same rotation curve as the gas and hence were presumably formed in the
molecular-gas disk. However, a western subsample of five clusters has
velocities that deviate significantly from the gas rotation curve. These
clusters may either belong to the second spiral galaxy of the merger or may
have formed in tidal-tail gas falling back into the system. We discuss our
observations in light of other known cluster populations in merging galaxies,
and suggest that NGC 3256 is similar to Arp 220, and hence may become an
Ultra-luminous Infrared Galaxy as the merger progresses and the star-formation
rate increases.
  Some of the clusters which appeared as isolated in our ground-based images
are clearly resolved into multiple sub-components in the HST-ACS images. The
same effect has been observed in the Antennae galaxies, showing that clusters
are often not formed in isolation, but instead tend to form in larger groups or
cluster complexes.
