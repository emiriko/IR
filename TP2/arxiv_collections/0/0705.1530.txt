We calculate the probabilities of two- and four-phonon Raman scattering in
graphene and show how the relative intensities of the overtone peaks encode
information about relative rates of different inelastic processes electrons are
subject to. If the most important processes are electron-phonon and
electron-electron scattering, the rate of the latter can be deduced from the
Raman spectra.
