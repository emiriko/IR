The exact spectrum of dyons in a class of N=4 supersymmetric string theories
is known to change discontinuously across walls of marginal stability. We show
that the change in the degeneracy across the walls of marginal stability can be
accounted for precisely by the entropy of two centered small black holes which
disappear as we cross the walls of marginal stability.
