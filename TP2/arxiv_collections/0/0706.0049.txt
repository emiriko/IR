We extend the Bipolar Theorem of Brannath and Schachermayer (1999) to the
space of nonnegative cadlag supermartingales on a filtered probability space.
We formulate the notion of fork-convexity as an analogue to convexity in this
setting. As an intermediate step in the proof of our main result we establish a
conditional version of the Bipolar theorem. In an application to mathematical
finance we describe the structure of the set of dual processes of the utility
maximization problem of Kramkov and Schachermayer (1999) and give a
budget-constraint characterization of admissible consumption processes in an
incomplete semimartingale market.
