Using the local spin-density approximation (LSDA) and the (non
self-consistent) GW approach, the (quasi-particle) band structure is calculated
for MnTe in zinc-blende geometry. Different parameters characterizing the
electronic structure are computed for an antiferromagnetic and the
ferromagnetic phase and compared with the experiment. The strong Hubbard-type
repulsion on the Mn-3d orbitals and the p-d hybridization are seen to be
responsible for substantial defects found in the LSDA picture. It is discussed
to which extent these can be improved upon by means of the GW approach.
