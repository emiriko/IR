We consider the future dynamics of a transient phantom dominated phase of the
universe in LQC and in the RS braneworld, which both have a non-standard
Friedmann equation. We find that for a certain class of potentials, the Hubble
parameter oscillates with simple harmonic motion in the LQC case and therefore
avoids any future singularity. For more general potentials we find that damping
effects eventually lead to the Hubble parameter becoming constant. On the other
hand in the braneworld case we find that although the type I singularity can be
avoided, the scale factor still diverges at late times.
