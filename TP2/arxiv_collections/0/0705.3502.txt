We use the non-perturbative gauge field approach to study the effects of spin
orbit coupling on the dynamic of magnetic moment. We present a general equation
of motion (EOM) which unifies i) the spin orbit coupling effect derived from
the SU(2) spin gauge field, and ii) the moment chirality effect previously
derived from the topological U(1)xU(1) rotation gauge under the adiabatic
condition. We present a modified Landau-Liftshitz-Gilbert equation and discuss
the implication of the modified EOM in various technological applications, such
as current-induced switching and trajectory of magnetic moments in spin-valve
multilayers, magnetic memory and diluted magnetic semiconductor.
