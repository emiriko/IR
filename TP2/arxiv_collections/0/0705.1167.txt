In almost all structure formation models, primordial perturbations are
created within a homogeneous and isotropic universe, like the one we observe.
Because their ensemble averages inherit the symmetries of the spacetime in
which they are seeded, cosmological perturbations then happen to be
statistically isotropic and homogeneous. Certain anomalies in the cosmic
microwave background on the other hand suggest that perturbations do not
satisfy these statistical properties, thereby challenging perhaps our
understanding of structure formation. In this article we relax this tension. We
show that if the universe contains an appropriate triad of scalar fields with
spatially constant but non-zero gradients, it is possible to generate
statistically anisotropic and inhomogeneous primordial perturbations, even
though the energy momentum tensor of the triad itself is invariant under
translations and rotations.
