The transverse mass spectra and the rapidity distributions of $\pi^+$ and
$\pi^-$ in Au-Au collisions at 2, 4, 6, and 8 GeV$\cdot$A by E895 collaboration
are fitted using an elliptically expanding fireball model with the contribution
from the resonance decays and the final state Coulomb interaction. The ratio of
the total number of produced $\pi^-$ and $\pi^+$ is used to fit the data. The
resulting freeze-out temperature is rather low($T_f < 60$ MeV) with large
transverse flow and thus resonance contribution is very small. The difference
in the shape of $m_t$ spectra of the oppositely charged pions are found to be
due to the Coulomb interaction of the pions.
