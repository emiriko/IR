The notion of relative cuspidality for distinguished representations attached
to $p$-adic symmetric spaces is introduced. A characterization of relative
cuspidality in terms of Jacquet modules is given and a generalization of
Jacquet's subrepresentation theorem to the relative case (symmetric space case)
is established.
