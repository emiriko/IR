By performing two parallel numerical experiments -- solving the dynamical
Hamiltonian equations and solving the Hasselmann kinetic equation -- we
examined the applicability of the theory of weak turbulence to the description
of the time evolution of an ensemble of free surface waves (a swell) on deep
water. We observed qualitative coincidence of the results.
  To achieve quantitative coincidence, we augmented the kinetic equation by an
empirical dissipation term modelling the strongly nonlinear process of
white-capping. Fitting the two experiments, we determined the dissipation
function due to wave breaking and found that it depends very sharply on the
parameter of nonlinearity (the surface steepness). The onset of white-capping
can be compared to a second-order phase transition. This result corroborates
with experimental observations by Banner, Babanin, Young.
