In this note, we develop transformation formulae and expansions for the log
tangent integral, which are then used to derive series acceleration formulae
for certain values of Dirichlet L-functions, such as Catalan's constant. The
formulae are characterized by the presence of an infinite series whose general
term consists of a linear recurrence damped by the central binomial coefficient
and a certain quadratic polynomial. Typically, the series can be expressed in
closed form as a rational linear combination of Catalan's constant and pi times
the logarithm of an algebraic unit.
