We present radio observations and optical spectroscopy of the giant low
surface brightness (LSB) galaxy PGC 045080 (or 1300+0144). PGC 045080 is a
moderately distant galaxy having a highly inclined optical disk and massive HI
gas content. Radio continuum observations of the galaxy were carried out at 320
MHz, 610 MHz and 1.4 GHz. Continuum emission was detected and mapped in the
galaxy. The emission appears extended over the inner disk at all three
frequencies. At 1.4 GHz and 610 MHz it appears to have two distinct lobes. We
also did optical spectroscopy of the galaxy nucleus; the spectrum did not show
any strong emission lines associated with AGN activity but the presence of a
weak AGN cannot be ruled out. Furthermore, comparison of the H$\alpha$ flux and
radio continuum at 1.4 GHz suggests that a significant fraction of the emission
is non-thermal in nature. Hence we conclude that a weak or hidden AGN may be
present in PGC 045080. The extended radio emission represents lobes/jets from
the AGN. These observations show that although LSB galaxies are metal poor and
have very little star formation, their centers can host significant AGN
activity. We also mapped the HI gas disk and velocity field in PGC 045080. The
HI disk extends well beyond the optical disk and appears warped. In the HI
intensity maps, the disk appears distinctly lopsided. The velocity field is
disturbed on the lopsided side of the disk but is fairly uniform in the other
half. We derived the HI rotation curve for the galaxy from the velocity field.
The rotation curve has a flat rotation speed of ~ 190 km/s.
