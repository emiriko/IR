Linearly projecting smooth projective varieties provides a method of
obtaining hypersurfaces birational to the original varieties. We show that in
low dimension, the resulting hypersurfaces only have Du Bois singularities.
Moreover, we conclude that these Du Bois singularities are in fact semi log
canonical. However, we demonstrate the existence of counterexamples in high
dimension -- the generic linear projection of certain varieties of dimension 30
or higher is neither semi log canonical nor Du Bois.
