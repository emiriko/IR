We examine transport through a quantum dot coupled to three ferromagnetic
leads in the regime of weak tunnel coupling. A finite source-drain voltage
generates a nonequilibrium spin on the otherwise non-magnetic quantum dot. This
spin accumulation leads to magnetoresistance. A ferromagnetic but current-free
base electrode influences the quantum-dot spin via incoherent spin-flip
processes and coherent spin precession. As the dot spin determines the
conductance of the device, this allows for a purely magnetic transistor-like
operation. We analyze the effect of both types of processes on the electric
current in different geometries.
