We present a calculation of single pion electroproduction cross sections on
heavy targets in the kinematic region of the Delta(1232) resonance. Final state
interactions of the pions are taken into account using the pion multiple
scattering model of Adler, Nussinov and Paschos (ANP model). For
electroproduction and neutral current reactions we obtain results for carbon,
oxygen, argon and iron targets and find a significant reduction of the
W-spectra for pi^0 as compared to the free nucleon case. On the other hand, the
charged pion spectra are only little affected by final state interactions.
Measurements of such cross sections with the CLAS detector at JLAB could help
to improve our understanding of pion rescattering effects and serve as
important/valuable input for calculations of single pion neutrinoproduction on
heavy targets relevant for current and future long baseline neutrino
experiments. Two ratios, in Eq. (3.8) and (3.10), will test important
properties of the model.
