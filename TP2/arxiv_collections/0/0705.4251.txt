This work reviews several hierarchical measurements of the topology of
complex networks and then applies feature selection concepts and methods in
order to quantify the relative importance of each measurement with respect to
the discrimination between four representative theoretical network models,
namely Erd\"{o}s-R\'enyi, Barab\'asi-Albert, Watts-Strogatz as well as a
geographical type of network. The obtained results confirmed that the four
models can be well-separated by using a combination of measurements. In
addition, the relative contribution of each considered feature for the overall
discrimination of the models was quantified in terms of the respective weights
in the canonical projection into two dimensions, with the traditional
clustering coefficient, hierarchical clustering coefficient and neighborhood
clustering coefficient resulting particularly effective. Interestingly, the
average shortest path length and hierarchical node degrees contributed little
for the separation of the four network models.
