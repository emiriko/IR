Here we present experimental and computational evidences to support that
rock-salt cubic VO is a strongly correlated metal with Non-Fermi-Liquid
thermodynamics and an unusually strong spin-lattice coupling. An unexpected
change of sign of metallic thermopower with composition is tentatively ascribed
to the presence of a pseudogap in the density of states. These properties are
discussed as signatures of the proximity to a magnetic quantum phase
transition. The results are summarized in a new electronic phase diagram for
the 3d monoxides, which resembles that of other strongly correlated systems.
The structural and electronic simplicity of 3d monoxides make them ideal
candidates to progress in the understanding of highly correlated electron
systems.
