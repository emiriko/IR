Predictions for the pseudorapidity density of charged particles produced in
Pb-Pb central collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.5$ TeV are presented. Particle
production in such collisions is computed in the framework of
k_t-factorization, using running coupling non-linear evolution to determine the
transverse momentum and rapidity dependence of the nuclear unintegrated gluon
distributions.
