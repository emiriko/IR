We use resonant soft x-ray scattering to study electronic reconstruction at
the interface between the Mott insulator LaMnO3 and the "band" insulator
SrMnO3. Superlattices of these two insulators were shown previously to have
both ferromagnetism and metallic tendencies [Koida et al., Phys. Rev. B 66,
144418 (2002)]. By studying a judiciously chosen superlattice reflection we
show that the interface density of states exhibits a pronounced peak at the
Fermi level, similar to that predicted by Okamoto et al. [Phys. Rev. B 70,
241104(R) (2004)]. The intensity of this peak correlates with the conductivity
and magnetization, suggesting it is the driver of metallic behavior. Our study
demonstrates a general strategy for using RSXS to probe the electronic
properties of heterostructure interfaces.
