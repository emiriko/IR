This paper is a short commentary on the 2005 paper in Nature by S. Rainville
et al., which claimed to be ``the most precise direct test of the famous
equation", E = mc^2. This communication is directed only to the readers who are
familiar with the earlier papers by the author on the subject of mass-energy
equivalence.
