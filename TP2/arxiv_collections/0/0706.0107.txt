We investigate the transport properties of ballistic quantum wires in the
presence of Zeeman spin splittings and a spatially inhomogeneous Rashba
interaction. The Zeeman interaction is extended along the wire and produces
gaps in the energy spectrum which allow electron propagation only for spinors
lying along a certain direction. For spins in the opposite direction the waves
are evanescent far away from the Rashba region, which plays the role of the
scattering center. The most interesting case occurs when the magnetic field is
perpendicular to the Rashba field. Then, the spins of the asymptotic
wavefunctions are not eigenfunctions of the Rashba Hamiltonian and the
resulting coupling between spins in the Rashba region gives rise to sudden
changes of the transmission probability when the Fermi energy is swept along
the gap. After briefly examining the energy spectrum and eigenfunctions of a
wire with extended Rashba coupling, we analyze the transmission through a
region of localized Rashba interaction, in which a double interface separates a
region of constant Rashba interaction from wire leads free from spin-orbit
coupling. For energies slightly above the propagation threshold, we find the
ubiquitous occurrence of transmission zeros (antiresonances) which are analyzed
by matching methods in the one-dimensional limit. We find that a a minimal
tight-binding model yields analytical transmission lineshapes of Fano
antiresonance type. More general angular dependences of the external magnetic
field is treated within projected Schroedinger equations with Hamiltonian
matrix elements mixing wavefunction components. Finally, we consider a
realistic quantum wire where the energy subbands are coupled via the Rashba
intersubband coupling term and discuss its effect on the transmission zeros.
