A consistent approach to Cosmology requires an explicit averaging of the
Einstein equations, to describe a homogeneous and isotropic geometry. Such an
averaging will in general modify the Einstein equations. The averaging
procedure due to Buchert has attracted considerable attention recently since it
offers the tantalizing hope of explaining the phenomenon of dark energy through
such corrections. This approach has been criticized, however, on the grounds
that its effects may be gauge artifacts. We apply the fully covariant formalism
of Zalaletdinov's Macroscopic Gravity and show that, after making some
essential gauge choices, the Cosmological equations receive \emph{spacetime
scalar} corrections which are therefore observable in principle, and further,
that the broad structure of these corrections is \emph{identical} to those
derived by Buchert.
