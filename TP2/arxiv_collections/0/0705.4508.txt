In the context of two-dimensional spacetime within a helium atom, both 1s
electrons are characterized by wave functions that observe duality equation.
They are symmetric, orthogonal and interwoven, forming a dynamic rope structure
at any moment. Instead of elliptical orbit of planets around the sun,
electronic orbitals take the form of matter state transformation cycle. While
the kinematic movement of planets is governed by Kepler's first law, electronic
transformation obeys Pythagorean theorem, both being equivalent in physical
principle. The atomic spacetime is a continuous medium of electron clouds in
synchronized differential and integral processes that are implemented by smooth
trigonometry. In order to integrate this new approach with conventional
physics, the author translates the pattern of electronic motion in the atomic
spacetime into spherical volume undulation in Euclidean geometry and calculates
the probability density of an electron within the sphere from the classical
perspective. From the primary wave function of a 1s electron, the author also
tries to derive the mathematical expression of central force that guides the
surrounding bodies along the orbits. The result is exciting and surprising that
questions the exactness of the venerable Coulomb's law.
