We present an extensive overview of production cross sections and kinetic
energies for the complete set of nuclides formed in the spallation of 136Xe by
protons at the incident energy of 1 GeV per nucleon. The measurement was
performed in inverse kinematics at the FRagment Separator (GSI, Darmstadt).
Slightly below the Businaro-Gallone point, 136Xe is the stable nuclide with the
largest neutron excess. The kinematic data and cross sections collected in this
work for the full nuclide production are a general benchmark for modelling the
spallation process in a neutron-rich nuclear system, where fission is
characterised by predominantly mass-asymmetric splits.
