We propose a dynamical scenario beyond the standard model, in which the
radiative correction to the Higgs mass parameter is suppressed due to a large
anomalous dimension induced through a conformal invariant coupling with an
extra gauge sector. Then the anomalous dimension also suppresses the Yukawa
couplings of the Higgs field. However, the large top Yukawa coupling can be
generated effectively through mixing among top quarks and the fermions of the
conformal gauge sector. This scenario is found to predict a fairly heavy Higgs
mass of about 500 GeV. We present an explicit model and show consistency with
the Electro-Weak precision measurements of the S and T parameters as well as
the Z boson decay width.
