We report our search for optically thick radio cores in sixteen narrow-waist
bipolar nebulae. Optically thick cores are a characteristic signature of
collimated ionized winds. Eleven northern nebulae were observed with the Very
Large Array (VLA) at 1.3 cm and 0.7 cm, and five southern nebulae were observed
with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) at 6 cm and 3.6 cm. Two
northern objects, 19W32 and M 1-91, and three southern objects, He 2-25, He
2-84 and Mz 3, were found to exhibit a compact radio core with a rising
spectrum consistent with an ionized jet. Such jets have been seen in M 2-9 and
may be responsible for shaping bipolar structure in planetary nebulae.
