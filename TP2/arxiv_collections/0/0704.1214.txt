It was found that approximately constant column densities of giant molecular
clouds (Larson's low) can be explained as cloud existence condition in external
(galactic) gravitational field. This condition can be also applied to objects
(clumps and cores) embedded into the cloud and its gravitational field. Derived
existence condition do not rely on any internal dynamic of a cloud and embedded
objects.
