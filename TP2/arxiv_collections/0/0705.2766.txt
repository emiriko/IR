We revisit the model of a system made up of a Brownian quantum oscillator
under the influence of an external classical force and linearly coupled to an
environment made up of many quantum oscillators at zero or finite temperature.
We show that the HPZ master equation for the reduced density matrix derived
earlier [B.L. Hu, J.P. Paz, Y. Zhang, Phys. Rev. D 45, 2843 (1992)] with
coefficients obtained from solutions of integro-differential equations can
assume closed functional forms for a fairly general class of spectral densities
of the environment at arbitrary temperature and coupling strength. As an
illustration of these new results we solve the corresponding master equation
and calculate, among other physical quantities, the uncertainty function whose
late time behavior can be obtained fully. This produces a formula for
investigating the standard quantum limit which is central to addressing many
theoretical issues in macroscopic quantum phenomena and experimental concerns
related to low temperature precision measurements. We find that any initial
state always settles down to a Gaussian density matrix whose covariance is
determined by the thermal reservoir and whose mean is determined by the
external force. For more general spectra we show that the solution of the
master equation can be reduced to solving for the motion of a classical
parametric oscillator with parametric frequency determined by the unsolved for
master equation coefficients. States in these systems experience evolution that
is parametrically similar to the simpler evolution explicitly determined for in
the case of Laurent-series spectra.
