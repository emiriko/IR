By considering the $x$-dependence of $\pi^+$, $\pi^-$, $K^+$, $K^-$,
$\Lambda$, $\bar{\Lambda}$, $p$, $\bar{p}$ hadron productions in charged lepton
semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering off nuclear target (using Fe as an
example) and deuteron D target, % at $Q^2=5$ GeV$^2$, we find that
$(\bar{\Lambda}^A/\Lambda^A)/(\bar{\Lambda}^D/\Lambda^D)$ and
$({\bar{p}}^A/{p}^A)/({\bar{p}}^A/p^A)$ are ideal to figure out the nuclear sea
content, which is predicted to be different by different models accounting for
the nuclear EMC effect.
