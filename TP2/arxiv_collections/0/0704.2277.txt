We present a numerical simulation of the Gross-Neveu model on the lattice
using a new representation in terms of fermion loops. In the loop
representation all signs due to Pauli statistics are eliminated completely and
the partition function is a sum over closed loops with only positive weights.
We demonstrate that the new formulation allows to simulate volumes which are
two orders of magnitude larger than those accessible with standard methods.
