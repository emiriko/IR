We introduce the notion of weak commensurabilty of arithmetic subgroups and
relate it to the length equivalence and isospectrality of locally symmetric
spaces. We prove many strong consequences of weak commensurabilty and derive
from these many interesting results about isolength and isospectral locally
symmetric spaces.
