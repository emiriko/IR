Among the ideas to be conveyed to students in an introductory quantum course,
we have the pivotal idea championed by Dirac that functions correspond to
column vectors (kets) and that differential operators correspond to matrices
(ket-bras) acting on those vectors. The MATLAB (matrix-laboratory) programming
environment is especially useful in conveying these concepts to students
because it is geared towards the type of matrix manipulations useful in solving
introductory quantum physics problems. In this article, we share MATLAB codes
which have been developed at WPI, focusing on 1D problems, to be used in
conjunction with Griffiths' introductory text.
