In the framework of the Lindblad theory for open quantum systems, we
determine the degree of quantum decoherence of a harmonic oscillator
interacting with a thermal bath. It is found that the system manifests a
quantum decoherence which is more and more significant in time. We calculate
also the decoherence time scale and analyze the transition from quantum to
classical behaviour of the considered system.
