Astrophysical sources of energetic gamma rays provide the right conditions
for maximal mixing between (pseudo)scalar (axion-like) particles and photons if
their coupling is as strong as suggested by the PVLAS claim. This is
independent of whether or not the axion interaction is standard at all energies
or becomes supressed in the extreme conditions of the stellar interior. The
flux of such particles through the Earth could be observed using a metre long,
Tesla strength superconducting solenoid thus testing the axion interpretation
of the PVLAS anomaly. The rate of events in CAST caused by axions from the Crab
pulsar is also estimated for the PVLAS-favoured parameters.
