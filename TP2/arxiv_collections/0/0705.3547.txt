Using a conventional Hall-bar geometry with a micro-metal strip on top of the
surface, we demonstrate an electrical coherent control of nuclear spins in an
AlGaAs/GaAs semiconductor heterostructure. A breakdown of integer quantum Hall
(QH) effect is utilized to dynamically polarize nuclear spins. By applying a
pulse rf magnetic field with the metal strip, the quantum state of the nuclear
spins shows Rabi oscillations, which is detected by measuring longitudinal
voltage of the QH conductor.
