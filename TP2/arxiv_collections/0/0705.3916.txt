In this paper we invstigate the possibility of the acoustic analogue of a
phenomenon like superradiance, that is, the amplification of a sound wave by
reflection from the ergo-region of a rotating acoustic black hole in the fluid
"draining bathtub" model in the presence of a desclination be amplified or
reduced in agreement with the value of the deficit angle.
