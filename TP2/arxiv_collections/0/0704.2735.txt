We study the effects of charge polarization on the extended physical
properties of superlattices, such as transmission coefficients and valence band
structure. We consider both linear and parabolic modulation of the band edge.
Based on the theory of finite periodic systems (TFPS), analytic expressions and
high precision calculations of the relevant physical quantities for n-cell
systems are obtained. New and also well-known features of these systems are
identified. Besides the well-known energy bandstructure, we also have the field
bandstructure, with interesting characteristics.Wider field gaps at stronger
internal electric fields and higher density of field bands for larger layer
widths are some of these characteristics. Well denned level density asymmetries
identify the minibands induced by charge polarization or the so-called Quantum
Confining Stark Effect. We present the n-cell transmission amplitudes,
transmission coefficients and miniband structures for different values of the
relevant parameters.
