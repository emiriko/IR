We have extensively mapped a sample of dense molecular clouds (L1512, TMC-1C,
L1262, Per 7, L1389, L1251E) in lines of HC3N, CH3OH, SO and C^{18}O. We
demonstrate that a high degree of chemical differentiation is present in all of
the observed clouds. We analyse the molecular maps for each cloud,
demonstrating a systematic chemical differentiation across the sample, which we
relate to the evolutionary state of the cloud. We relate our observations to
the cloud physical, kinematical and evolutionary properties, and also compare
them to the predictions of simple chemical models. The implications of this
work for understanding the origin of the clumpy structures and chemical
differentiation observed in dense clouds are discussed.
