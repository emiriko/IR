The corrections to g-mode frequencies caused by the presence of a central
magnetic field and rotation of the Sun are calculated. The calculations are
carried out in the simple one dimensional magnetohydrodynamical model using the
approximations which allow one to find the purely analytical spectra of
magneto-gravity waves beyond the scope of the JWKB approximation and avoid in a
small background magnetic field the appearance of the cusp resonance which
locks a wave within the radiative zone. These analytic results are compared
with the satellite observations of the g-mode frequency shifts which are of the
order one per cent as given in the GOLF experiment at the SoHO board. The main
contribution turns out to be the magnetic frequency shift in the strong
magnetic field which obeys the used approximations. In particular, the fixed
magnetic field strength 700 KG results in the mentioned value of the frequency
shift for the g-mode of the radial order n=-10. The rotational shift due to the
Coriolis force appears to be small and does not exceed a fracton of per cent,
\alpha_\Omega < 0.003.
