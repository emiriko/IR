We study the IR-through-UV interstellar extinction curves towards 328
Galactic B and late-O stars. We use a new technique which employs stellar
atmosphere models in lieu of unreddened "standard" stars. This technique is
capable of virtually eliminating spectral mismatch errors in the curves. It
also allows a quantitative assessment of the errors and enables a rigorous
testing of the significance of relationships between various curve parameters,
regardless of whether their uncertainties are correlated. Analysis of the
curves gives the following results: (1) In accord with our previous findings,
the central position of the 2175 A extinction bump is mildly variable, its
width is highly variable, and the two variations are unrelated. (2) Strong
correlations are found among some extinction properties within the UV region,
and within the IR region. (3) With the exception of a few curves with extreme
(i.e., large) values of R(V), the UV and IR portions of Galactic extinction
curves are not correlated with each other. (4) The large sightline-to-sightline
variation seen in our sample implies that any average Galactic extinction curve
will always reflect the biases of its parent sample. (5) The use of an average
curve to deredden a spectral energy distribution (SED) will result in
significant errors, and a realistic error budget for the dereddened SED must
include the observed variance of Galactic curves. While the observed large
sightline-to-sightline variations, and the lack of correlation among the
various features of the curves, make it difficult to meaningfully characterize
average extinction properties, they demonstrate that extinction curves respond
sensitively to local conditions. Thus, each curve contains potentially unique
information about the grains along its sightline.
