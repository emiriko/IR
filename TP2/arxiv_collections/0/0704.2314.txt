A SU(4) flavor symmetrical Lagrangian is constructed for the interaction of
the pseudo-scalar mesons with the vector mesons. SU(4) symmetry is broken to
SU(3) by suppression of terms in the Lagrangian where the interaction should be
driven by charmed mesons. Chiral symmetry can be restored by setting this new
SU(4) symmetry breaking parameters to zero. Unitarization in coupled channels
leads to the dynamical generation of resonances. Many known axial resonances
can be identified including the new controversial X(3872) and the structure
found recently by Belle around 3875 MeV in the hidden charm sector. Also new
resonances are predicted, some of them with exotic quantum numbers.
