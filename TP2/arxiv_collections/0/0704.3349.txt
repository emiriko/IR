We provide a characterization of $J$-class and $J^{mix}$-class unilateral
weighted shifts on $l^{\infty}(\mathbb{N})$ in terms of their weight sequences.
In contrast to the previously mentioned result we show that a bilateral
weighted shift on $l^{\infty}(\mathbb{Z})$ cannot be a $J$-class operator.
