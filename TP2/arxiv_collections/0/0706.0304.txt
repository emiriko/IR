Quantum walks, being the quantum analogue of classical random walks, are
expected to provide a fruitful source of quantum algorithms. A few such
algorithms have already been developed, including the `glued trees' algorithm,
which provides an exponential speedup over classical methods, relative to a
particular quantum oracle. Here, we discuss the possibility of a quantum walk
algorithm yielding such an exponential speedup over possible classical
algorithms, without the use of an oracle. We provide examples of some highly
symmetric graphs on which efficient quantum circuits implementing quantum walks
can be constructed, and discuss potential applications to quantum search for
marked vertices along these graphs.
