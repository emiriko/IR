We propose a soft-output detection scheme for Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output
(MIMO) systems. The detector employs Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to compute
bit reliabilities from the signals received and is thus suited for coded MIMO
systems. It offers a good trade-off between achievable performance and
algorithmic complexity.
