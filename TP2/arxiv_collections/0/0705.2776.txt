From photometric observations of elliptical galaxies, among which are both
radio galaxies and radio-quiet objects, an investigation was carried out of the
relationship `redshift -- age of the stellar system' $(\Delta z/\Delta t)$. By
means of this relationship cosmological parameters $H(z)$ and $\Omega_\Lambda$
are estimated. Ages of stellar systems are determined within the framework of
evolution models of synthetic spectra PEGASE and GISSEL. This approach can be
considered as time study of objects of the early Universe independent of other
cosmological models. Construction of a pooled sample is described, containing
220 objects from different populations of elliptical galaxies, for which an
analysis of the upper limit of the age of formation of a stellar system was
performed. These data were used to estimate the boundaries of determination of
the cosmological parameters $H_0$ and $\Lambda$--term: $H_0=72\pm10$ and
$\Omega_\Lambda=0.8\pm0.1$ in the model GISSEL and $H_0=53\pm10$, and
$\Omega_\Lambda=0.8\pm0.1$ in the model PEGASE.
