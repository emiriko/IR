It is shown in the work of one of the authors in 1979 (MKV) that the
contribution to the amplitude of this decay from diagrams with one baryon loop
is equal to zero and contributions from diagrams with meson loops appear very
small. However, pole diagrams with intermediate vector mesons were not
considered there. Here it is shown that contributions of these pole diagrams
dominate. The meson-baryon chiral model used here is compared with known quark
chiral models. The obtained results are in satisfactory agreement with recent
experimental data.
