The anomalous Hall effect in a magnetic two-dimensional electron gas with
Rashba spin-orbit coupling is studied within the Kubo-Streda formalism in the
presence of pointlike potential impurities. We find that all contributions to
the anomalous Hall conductivity vanish to leading order in disorder strength
when both chiral subbands are occupied. In the situation that only the majority
subband is occupied, all terms are finite in the weak scattering limit and the
total anomalous Hall conductivity is dominated by skew scattering. We compare
our results to previous treatments and resolve some of the discrepancies
present in the literature.
