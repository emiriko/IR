Quantum relativity as a generalized, or rather deformed, version of Einstein
relativity with a linear realization on a classical six-geometry beyond the
familiar setting of space-time offer a new framework to think about the quantum
space-time structure. The formulation requires two deformations to be
implemented through imposing two fundamental invariants. We take them to be the
independent Planck mass and Planck length. Together, they gives the quantum
$\hbar$. The scheme leads to {\small \boldmath\protect SO(2,4)} as the
relativity symmetry. The quantum world has an AdS$_5$ `classical' geometry,
which is parallel to the "conformal universe", but not scale invariant.
