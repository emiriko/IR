The Bell-Evans-Polanyi principle that is valid for a chemical reaction that
proceeds along the reaction coordinate over the transition state is extended to
molecular dynamics trajectories that in general do not cross the dividing
surface between the initial and the final local minima at the exact transition
state. Our molecular dynamics Bell-Evans-Polanyi principle states that low
energy molecular dynamics trajectories are more likely to lead into the basin
of attraction of a low energy local minimum than high energy trajectories. In
the context of global optimization schemes based on molecular dynamics our
molecular dynamics Bell-Evans-Polanyi principle implies that using low energy
trajectories one needs to visit a smaller number of distinguishable local
minima before finding the global minimum than when using high energy
trajectories.
