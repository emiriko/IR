We use a variational method to construct soliton solutions for systems
characterized by opposing dispersion and competing nonlinearities at
fundamental and second harmonics. We show that both ordinary and embedded
solitons tend to gain energy when the second harmonic field becomes weaker than
the first harmonic field.
