The paper summarizes our latest progress in the development of newly
introduced micro pattern gaseous detectors with resistive electrodes. These
resistive electrodes protect the detector and the front-end electronics in case
of occasional discharges and thus make the detectors very robust and reliable
in operation. As an example, we describe in greater detail a new recently
developed GEM-like detector, fully spark-protected with electrodes made of
resistive kapton. We discovered that all resistive layers used in these studies
(including kapton), that are coated with photosensitive layers, such as CsI,
can be used as efficient photo cathodes for detectors operating in a pulse
counting mode. We describe the first applications of such detectors combined
with CsI or SbCs photo cathodes for the detection of UV photons at room and
cryogenic temperatures.
