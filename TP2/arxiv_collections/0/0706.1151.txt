Topology Control (TC) aims at tuning the topology of highly dynamic networks
to provide better control over network resources and to increase the efficiency
of communication. Recently, many TC protocols have been proposed. The protocols
are designed for preserving connectivity, minimizing energy consumption,
maximizing the overall network coverage or network capacity. Each TC protocol
makes different assumptions about the network topology, environment detection
resources, and control capacities. This circumstance makes it extremely
difficult to comprehend the role and purpose of each protocol. To tackle this
situation, a taxonomy for TC protocols is presented throughout this paper.
Additionally, some TC protocols are classified based upon this taxonomy.
