A quantum Monte Carlo simulation of a system of hard rods in one dimension is
presented and discussed. The calculation is exact since the analytical form of
the wavefunction is known, and is in excellent agreement with predictions
obtained from asymptotic expansions valid at large distances. The analysis of
the static structure factor and the pair distribution function indicates that a
solid-like and a gas-like phases exist at high and low densities, respectively.
The one-body density matrix decays following a power-law at large distances and
produces a divergence in the low density momentum distribution at k=0 which can
be identified as a quasi-condensate.
