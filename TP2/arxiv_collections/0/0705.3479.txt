This work describes how to implement a non-local xor function for
coherent-state qubit using only linear optics. The setup proposed does not use
gates based on teleportation and it has probability of success equal to 0.5, in
the lossless case, when the necessary entangled state is available. The key
element that makes possible the realization of the non-local xor function is a
tripartite GHZ-type entangled coherent state. Its generation is proposed
firstly using an ideal lossless setup and secondly considering the decoherence
caused by losses in the optical devices.
