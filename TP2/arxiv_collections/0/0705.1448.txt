The strong-property-fluctuation theory (SPFT) provides a sophisticated means
of estimating the effective constitutive parameters of a homogenized composite
material (HCM), which takes account of the statistical distribution of the
component particles. We present an extended version of the third-order SPFT in
which the component particles are represented as depolarization regions of
nonzero volume. Numerical results are provided for a bianisotropic
homogenization scenario wherein the HCM is a Faraday chiral medium. Thereby,
convergence of the extended SPFT at the second-order level of approximation is
demonstrated within the long-wavelength regime.
