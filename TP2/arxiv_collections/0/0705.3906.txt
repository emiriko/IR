In 1999 A. Connes and D. Kreimer have discovered a Hopf algebra structure on
the Feynman graphs of scalar field theory. They have found that the
renormalization can be interpreted as a solving of some Riemann - Hilbert
problem. In this work the generalization of their scheme to the case of
nonabelian gauge theories is proposed. The action of the gauge group on the
Hopf algebra is defined and the proof that this action is in consistent with
the Hopf algebra structure is given. The scetch of new proof of S-matrix, based
on the Hopf algebra is given.
