We present a study of entanglement in the case of the 1D extended anisotropic
Heisenberg model. We investigate two quantum phase transitions (QPTs) within
the previously found ergodicity phase diagram [E. Plekhanov, A. Avella, and F.
Mancini Phys. Rev. B \textbf{74}, 115120 (2006)]. Our calculations are done by
means of the numerically exact Lanczos method at T=0, followed by a finite-size
scaling. As a measure of entanglement we use the concurrence for two spins out
of the system. We conclude from our studies that these QPTs are accompanied by
a qualitative entanglement change.
