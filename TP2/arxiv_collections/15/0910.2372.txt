We extend the epsilon-expansion of continuum chiral perturbation theory to
nonzero lattice spacing in the framework of Wilson Chiral Perturbation Theory.
We distinguish various regimes by defining the relative power counting of the
quark mass m and the lattice spacing a. We observe that for m ~ a Lambda^2_QCD,
the explicit breaking of chiral symmetry in Wilson fermions is still driven by
the quark mass and lattice corrections are highly suppressed. The lattice
spacing effects become more pronounced for smaller quark masses and may lead to
non-trivial corrections of the continuum results at next-to-leading order. We
compute these corrections for standard current and density correlation
functions. A fit to lattice data shows that these corrections are small, as
expected.
