We report photometry and analysis of a previously unknown SU UMa-type dwarf
nova in Bootes detected in outburst by the Catalina Real-time Transient Survey
on 2009 May 30 with the discovery identifier CSS090530:144011+494734. This
apparently stellar object had previously been catalogued by the Sloan Digital
Sky survey as SDSS J144011.01+494733.4. We measured its mean superhump period
over the first 3 days following detection as 0.06500(4) d at which point this
changed to 0.06438(3) d. We detected a possible orbital period of 0.06322(8) d
implying a mean superhump period excess of 0.020(2). After detection, the dwarf
nova maintained steady brightness for 5 days before starting to fade. The
outburst amplitude was 5.5 magnitudes above its quiescent level.
