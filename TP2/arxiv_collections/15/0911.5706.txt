We study an Allen-Cahn equation perturbed by a multiplicative stochastic
noise which is white in time and correlated in space. Formally this equation
approximates a stochastically forced mean curvature flow. We derive uniform
energy bounds and prove tightness of of solutions in the sharp interface limit,
and show convergence to phase-indicator functions.
