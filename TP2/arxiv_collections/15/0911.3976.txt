Much work in SETI has focused on detecting radio broadcasts due to
extraterrestrial intelligence, but there have been limited efforts to transmit
messages over interstellar distances. As a check if such messages can be
interpreted once received, we conducted a blind test. One of us coded a
75-kilobit message, which the other then attempted to decipher. The decryption
was accurate, supporting the message design as a general structure for
communicating with aliens capable of detecting narrow-band radio transmissions.
