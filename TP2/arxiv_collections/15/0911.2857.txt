The longitudinal resistance $R_{xx}$ of the SrTiO3/LaAlO3 interface with
magnetic fields applied perpendicular to the interface has an antisymmetric
term (namely, $R_{xx}(H)\neq R_{xx}(-H)$) which increases with decreasing
temperature and increasing field. We argue that the origin of this phenomenon
is a non-homogeneous Hall effect with clear contribution of an extraordinary
Hall effect, suggesting the presence of non-uniform field-induced
magnetization.
