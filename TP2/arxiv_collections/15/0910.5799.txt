We report on the dark pulse emission of an all-normal dispersion erbium-doped
fiber laser with a polarizer in cavity. We found experimentally that apart from
the bright pulse emission, under appropriate conditions the fiber laser could
also emit single or multiple dark pulses. Based on numerical simulations we
interpret the dark pulse formation in the laser as a result of dark soliton
shaping.
