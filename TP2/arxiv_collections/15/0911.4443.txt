The pattern of quantum numbers in the leptons and quarks indicate that
precisely two fixed hypercharge splittings are observed in nature. The $|\Delta
Y|=1$ splitting corresponds to the $SU(2)_L$ scalar and doublet spacing,
indicative of the Yukawa interactions of the Higgs mechanism. A $|\Delta
Y|=4/3$ splitting is identified between corresponding $SU(3)_C$ scalars and
triplets. The properties of this splitting are the basis for the prediction of
a new kind of scalar particle that directly couples quarks and leptons.
Possible experimental methods for detecting a strongly interacting, charge
-1$e$/3 scalar particle are presented for the examples of exotic decay modes of
the top quark and the analysis of $t\bar{t}\tau^+\tau^-$ production at hadron
colliders.
