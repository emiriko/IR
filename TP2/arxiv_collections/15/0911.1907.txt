We consider general mixtures of isocurvature and adiabatic cosmological
perturbations. With a minimal assumption set consisting of the linearized
Einstein equations and a primordial perfect fluid we derive the second-order
action and its curvature variables. We also allow for varying equation of state
and speed of sound profiles. The derivation is therefore carried out at the
same level of generality that has been achieved for adiabatic modes before. As
a result we find a new conserved super-horizon quantity and relate it to the
adiabatically conserved curvature perturbation. Finally we demonstrate how the
formalism can be applied by considering a Chaplygin gas-like primordial matter
model, finding two scale-invariant solutions for structure formation.
