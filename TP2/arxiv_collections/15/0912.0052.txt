Generalizing the concept of a perfect number, Sloane's sequences of integers
A083207 lists the sequence of integers $n$ with the property: the positive
factors of $n$ can be partitioned into two disjoint parts so that the sums of
the two parts are equal. Following Clark et al., we shall call such integers,
Zumkeller numbers. Generalizing this, Clark et al., call a number n a
half-Zumkeller number if the positive proper factors of n can be partitioned
into two disjoint parts so that the sums of the two parts are equal.
  An extensive study of properties of Zumkeller numbers, half-Zumkeller numbers
and their relation to practical numbers is undertaken in this paper.
  Clark et al., announced results about Zumkellers numbers and half-Zumkeller
numbers and suggested two conjectures. In the present paper we shall settle one
of the conjectures, prove the second conjecture in some special cases and prove
several results related to the second conjecture. We shall also show that if
there is an even Zumkeller number that is not half-Zumkeller it should be
bigger than 7233498900.
