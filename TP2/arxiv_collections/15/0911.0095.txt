Azimuthal asymmetries in exclusive electroproduction of a real photon from an
unpolarized deuterium target are measured with respect to beam helicity and
charge. They appear in the distribution of these photons in the azimuthal angle
phi around the virtual-photon direction, relative to the lepton scattering
plane. The extracted asymmetries are attributed to either the deeply virtual
Compton scattering process or its interference with the Bethe-Heitler process.
They are compared with earlier results on the proton target. In the measured
kinematic region, the beam-charge asymmetry amplitudes and the leading
amplitudes of the beam-helicity asymmetries on an unpolarized deuteron target
are compatible with the results from unpolarized protons.
