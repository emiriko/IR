Numerical Algebraic Geometry uses numerical data to describe algebraic
varieties. It is based on the methods of numerical polynomial homotopy
continuation, an alternative to the classical symbolic approaches of
computational algebraic geometry. We present a package, the driving idea behind
which is to interlink the existing symbolic methods of Macaulay2 and the
powerful engine of numerical approximate computations. The core procedures of
the package exhibit performance competitive with the other homotopy
continuation software.
