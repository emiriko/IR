This is a course on Random Matrix Theory which includes traditional as well
as advanced topics presented with an extensive use of classical logarithmic
plasma analogy and that of the quantum systems of one-dimensional interacting
fermions with inverse square interaction (Calogero-Sutherland model). Certain
non-invariant random matrix ensembles are also considered with the emphasis on
the eigenfunction statistics in them. The course can also be viewed as
introduction to theory of localization where the (non-invariant) random matrix
ensembles play a role of the toy models to illustrate functional methods based
on super-vector/super-matrix representations.
