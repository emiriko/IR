Recent discoveries, as well as open questions, in experimentally realized
correlated electron materials are reviewed. In particular, high temperature
superconductivity in the cuprates and in the recently discovered iron
pnictides, possible chiral p-wave superconductivity in strontium ruthenate, the
search for quantum spin liquid behavior in real materials, and new experimental
discoveries in topological insulators are discussed.
