A proposal for resolution of the information paradox is that "nice slice"
states, which have been viewed as providing a sharp argument for information
loss, do not in fact do so as they do not give a fully accurate description of
the quantum state of a black hole. This however leaves an information
*problem*, which is to provide a consistent description of how information
escapes when a black hole evaporates. While a rather extreme form of
nonlocality has been advocated in the form of complementarity, this paper
argues that is not necessary, and more modest nonlocality could solve the
information problem. One possible distinguishing characteristic of scenarios is
the information retention time. The question of whether such nonlocality
implies acausality, and particularly inconsistency, is briefly addressed. The
need for such nonlocality, and its apparent tension with our empirical
observations of local quantum field theory, may be a critical missing piece in
understanding the principles of quantum gravity.
