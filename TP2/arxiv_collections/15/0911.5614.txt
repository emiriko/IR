In a recent work, we have constructed a model of hidden sector of the
Universe, consisting of sterile spin-1/2 Dirac fermions ("sterinos"), sterile
spin-0 bosons ("sterons") conjectured to get spontaneously nonzero vacuum
expectation value, and also of conventional photons assumed to participate both
in the hidden and Standard-Model sectors (after the electroweak symmetry is
spontaneously broken by the Standard-Model Higgs mechanism). This provides a
"photonic portal" to the hidden sector as an alternative to the popular "Higgs
portal". Moreover, we have proposed to stop the proliferation of new kinds of
gauge bosons as sterile mediators of nongravitational interactions in the
hidden sector, introducing instead nongauge mediating bosons described by an
antisymmetric-tensor field (of dimension one), whose sources are given not only
by sterino-antisterino pairs, but also by steron-photon pairs. Then,
conventional photons display, beside the familiar gauge coupling to the
Standard-Model electric current, a new nongauge weak coupling of sterile
antisymmetric-tensor bosons to steron-photon pairs, where photons are described
by the gauge-invariant electromagnetic field F_{\mu \nu}. The new mediators are
unstable, decaying, for instance, into electron-positron pairs. When
interacting in pairs, they can annihilate simply into two photons. The
corresponding cross-section is calculated.
