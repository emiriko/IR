The interplay between shear band (SB) formation and boundary conditions (BC)
is investigated in wormlike micellar systems (CPyCl--NaSal) using ultrasonic
velocimetry coupled to standard rheology in Couette geometry. Time-resolved
velocity profiles are recorded during transient strain-controlled experiments
in smooth and sand-blasted geometries. For stick BC standard SB is observed,
although depending on the degree of micellar entanglement temporal fluctuations
are reported in the highly sheared band. For slip BC wall slip occurs only for
shear rates larger than the start of the stress plateau. At low entanglement,
SB formation is shifted by a constant $\Delta\dot{\gamma}$, while for more
entangled systems SB constantly "nucleate and melt." Micellar orientation
gradients at the walls may account for these original features.
