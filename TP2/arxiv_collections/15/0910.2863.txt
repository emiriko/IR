We prove some related results concerning blow-up solutions for the Jang
equation. First: it has been shown that, given an outermost marginally outer
trapped surface (MOTS) \Sigma, there exists a solution to Jang's equation which
blows up at \Sigma. Here we show that in addition, large classes of spherically
symmetric initial data have solutions to the Jang equation which blow up at
non-outermost MOTSs, i.e. MOTSs which lie strictly inside of other MOTS, and
even inside of strictly outer trapped surfaces. Unlike for outermost MOTSs,
however, we show that there do not \emph{always} exist blow-up solutions for
inner MOTSs, even in spherical symmetry. Secondly, an unpublished result of R.
Schoen, whose proof we include here, says that in the time-symmetric case, any
MOTS corresponding to a blow-up solution for Jang's equation must be
outer-area-minimizing, i.e. cannot be contained in a surface of strictly
smaller area. The statement is false without the assumption of time-symmetry,
however; we construct an explicit spherically symmetric data set providing a
counterexample for the general case.
