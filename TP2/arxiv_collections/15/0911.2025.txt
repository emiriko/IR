The Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope observed the bright and long GRB090902B,
lying at a redshift of z = 1.822. Together the Large Area Telescope (LAT) and
the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) cover the spectral range from 8 keV to >300
GeV is covered. Here we show that the prompt burst spectrum is consistent with
emission from the jet photosphere combined with non-thermal emission described
by a single power-law with photon index -1.9. The photosphere gives rise to a
strong quasi-blackbody spectrum which is somewhat broader than a single Planck
function and has a characteristic temperature of ~290keV. We derive the
photospheric radius Rph = (1.1 \pm 0.3) x 10^12 Y^{1/4} cm and the bulk Lorentz
factor of the flow, which is found to vary by a factor of two and has a maximal
value of Gamma = 750 Y^{1/4}. Here Y is the ratio between the total fireball
energy and the energy emitted in the gamma-rays. We find that during the first
quarter of the prompt phase the photospheric emission dominates, which explains
the delayed onset of the observed flux in the LAT compared to the GBM. We model
the photospheric emission with a multi-color blackbody and its shape indicates
that the photospheric radius increases at higher latitudes. We interpret the
broad band emission as synchrotron emission at R ~ 4x10^15 cm. Our analysis
emphasize the importance of having high temporal resolution when performing
spectral analysis on GRBs, since there is strong spectral evolution.
