Globalised-civilisation interaction intensity grows exponentially, involving
all dimensions and regions of planetary environment. The resulting dynamics of
critically high, exploding complexity urgently needs consistent understanding
and efficient management. The new, provably universal concept of unreduced
dynamic complexity of real interaction processes described here provides the
former and can be used as a basis for the latter, in the form of "complexity
revolution" in information systems controlling such "critically globalised"
civilisation dynamics. We outline the relevant dynamic complexity properties
and the ensuing principles of anticipated complexity transition in information
and communication systems. We then emphasize key applications of unreduced
complexity concept and complexity-driven IT to various aspects of
post-industrial civilisation dynamics, including intelligent communication,
context-aware information and control systems, reliable genetics, integral
medicine, emergent engineering, efficient risk management at the new level of
socio-economic development and resulting realistic sustainability.
