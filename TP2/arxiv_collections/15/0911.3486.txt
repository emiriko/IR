We fit WMAP5 and related data by allowing for a CDM--DE coupling and
non--zero neutrino masses, simultaneously. We find a significant correlation
between these parameters, so that simultaneous higher coupling and \nu--masses
are allowed. Furthermore, models with a significant coupling and \nu--mass are
statistically favoured in respect to a cosmology with no coupling and
negligible neutrino mass (our best fits are: C ~ 1/2m_p, m_\nu ~ 0.12eV per
flavor). We use a standard Monte Carlo Markov Chain approach, by assuming DE to
be a scalar field self--interacting through Ratra--Peebles or SUGRA potentials.
