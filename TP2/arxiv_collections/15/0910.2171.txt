Using SU(3) symmetry to constrain the pion BB' couplings, assuming SU(3)
breaking comes only from one-loop pion cloud contributions, and using the the
covariant spectator theory to describe the photon coupling to the quark core,
we show how the experimental masses and magnetic moments of the baryon octet
can be used to set a model independent constraint on the strength of the pion
cloud contributions to the octet, and hence the nucleon, form factors at Q2=0.
