We present results on the Omega baryon electromagnetic form factors using
N_f= 2 + 1 dynamical domain-wall fermion configurations corresponding to a pion
mass of about 330 MeV. We construct appropriate sequential sources for the
determination of the two dominant form factors GE0 and GM1 as well as a
sequential source that isolates the subdominant electric quadrupole form factor
GE2. We calculate the Omega baryon magnetic moment, mu_omega, and electric
charge radius, <r_E0>^2, and compare to experiment, for the case of mu_omega,
and to other lattice calculations.
