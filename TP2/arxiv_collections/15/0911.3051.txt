We extend the classification of finite Weyl groupoids of rank two. Then we
generalize these Weyl groupoids to `reflection groupoids' by admitting
non-integral entries of the Cartan matrices. This leads to the unexpected
observation that the spectrum of the cluster algebra of type $A_{n-3}$
completely describes the set of finite reflection groupoids of rank two with
$2n$ objects.
