Is there a general theorem that tells us when we can hope for exponential
speedups from quantum algorithms, and when we cannot? In this paper, we make
two advances toward such a theorem, in the black-box model where most quantum
algorithms operate.
  First, we show that for any problem that is invariant under permuting inputs
and outputs (like the collision or the element distinctness problems), the
quantum query complexity is at least the 7th root of the classical randomized
query complexity. (An earlier version of this paper gave the 9th root.) This
resolves a conjecture of Watrous from 2002.
  Second, inspired by recent work of O'Donnell et al. (2005) and Dinur et al.
(2006), we conjecture that every bounded low-degree polynomial has a "highly
influential" variable. Assuming this conjecture, we show that every T-query
quantum algorithm can be simulated on most inputs by a poly(T)-query classical
algorithm, and that one essentially cannot hope to prove P!=BQP relative to a
random oracle.
