We describe a statistical method to avoid biased estimation of the content of
different particle species. We consider the case when the particle
identification information strongly depends on some kinematical variables,
whose distributions are unknown and different for each particles species. We
show that the proposed procedure provides properly normalized and completely
data-driven estimation of the unknown distributions without any a priori
assumption on their functional form. Moreover, we demonstrate that the method
can be generalized to any kinematical distribution of the particles.
