Given the current landscape in experimental high-energy physics, these
lectures are focused on applications of event generators for hadron colliders
like the Tevatron and LHC. Section 2 contains a first overview of the physics
picture and the generator landscape. Thereafter section 3 describes the usage
of matrix elements, section 4 the important topics of initial- and final-state
showers, and section 5 how showers can be matched to different hard processes.
The issue of multiparton interactions and their role in mimimum-bias and
underlying-event physics is introduced in section 6, followed by some comments
on hadronization in section 7. The article concludes with an outlook on the
ongoing generator-development work in section 8.
