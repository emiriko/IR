We consider the dynamics of the system of self propelling particles modeled
via the Vicsek algorithm in continuum time limit. It is shown that the
alignment process for the velocities can be subdivided into two regimes: "fast"
kinetic and "slow" hydrodynamic ones. In fast kinetic regime the alignment of
the particle velocity to the local neighborhood takes place with characteristic
relaxation time. So that the bigger regions arise with the velocity alignment.
These regions align their velocities thus giving rise to hydrodynamic regime of
the dynamics. We propose the mean-field like approach in which we take into
account the correlations between density and velocity. The comparison of the
theoretical predictions with the numerical simulations is given. The relation
between Vicsek model in the zero velocity limit and the Kuramoto model is
stated. The mean-field approach accounting for the dynamic change of the
neighborhood is proposed. The nature of the discontinuity of the dependence of
the order parameter in case of vectorial noise revealed in Gregorie and Chaite,
Phys. Rev. Lett., {\bf 92}, 025702 (2004) is discussed and the explanation of
it is proposed.
