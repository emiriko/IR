Dynamic properties of molecular motors whose motion is powered by
interactions with specific lattice bonds are studied theoretically with the
help of discrete-state stochastic "burnt-bridge" models. Molecular motors are
depicted as random walkers that can destroy or rebuild periodically distributed
weak connections ("bridges") when crossing them, with probabilities $p_1$ and
$p_2$ correspondingly. Dynamic properties, such as velocities and dispersions,
are obtained in exact and explicit form for arbitrary values of parameters
$p_1$ and $p_2$. For the unbiased random walker, reversible burning of the
bridges results in a biased directed motion with a dynamic transition observed
at very small concentrations of bridges. In the case of backward biased
molecular motor its backward velocity is reduced and a reversal of the
direction of motion is observed for some range of parameters. It is also found
that the dispersion demonstrates a complex, non-monotonic behavior with large
fluctuations for some set of parameters. Complex dynamics of the system is
discussed by analyzing the behavior of the molecular motors near burned
bridges.
