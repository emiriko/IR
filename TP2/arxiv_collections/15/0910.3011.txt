Recently a new experimental program of novel systematic studies of light
hypernuclei using pionic decay was established at JLab (Study of Light
Hypernuclei by Pionic Decay at JLab, JLab Experiment PR-08-012). The highlights
of the proposed program include high precision measurements of binding energies
of hypernuclei by using a high resolution pion spectrometer, HpiS. The average
values of binding energies will be determined within an accuracy of ~10 keV or
better. Therefore, the crucial point of this program is an absolute calibration
of the HpiS with accuracy 10E-4 or better. The merging of continuous wave
laser-based precision optical-frequency metrology with mode-locked ultrafast
lasers has led to precision control of the visible frequency spectrum produced
by mode-locked lasers. Such a phase-controlled mode-locked laser forms the
foundation of an optical clock or femtosecond optical frequency comb (OFC)
generator, with a regular comb of sharp lines with well defined frequencies.
Combination of this technique with a recently developed radio frequency (RF)
phototube results in a new tool for precision time measurement. We are
proposing a new time-of-flight (TOF) system based on an RF phototube and OFC
technique. The proposed TOF system achieves 10 fs instability level and opens
new possibilities for precise measurements in nuclear physics such as an
absolute calibration of magnetic spectrometers within accuracy 10E-4 - 10E-5.
