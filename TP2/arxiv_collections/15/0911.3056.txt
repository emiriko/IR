We show that a recently discussed apparatus for aberration-cancelled
interferometry may be modified to perform correlated-photon imaging in the
so-called "ghost" imaging configuration. For objects in the vicinity of a
particular plane, the images are free of object-induced phase distortions. This
apparatus has the distinctive feature that it may be used to superimpose images
of two objects in a manner that could lead to useful effects and applications.
We show that the apparatus works using either quantum-entangled or classically
correlated light sources.
