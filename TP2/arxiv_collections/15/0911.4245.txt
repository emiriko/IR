To determine whether a given multipartite quantum state is separable with
respect to some partition we construct a family of entanglement measures R_m.
This is done utilizing generalized concurrences as building blocks which are
defined by flipping of M constituents and indicate states that are separable
with regard to bipartitions when vanishing. Further, we provide an analytically
computable lower bound for R_m via a simple ordering relation of the convex
roof extension. Using the derived lower bound, we illustrate the effect of the
isotropic noise on a family of four-qubit mixed states for each intermediate
separability.
