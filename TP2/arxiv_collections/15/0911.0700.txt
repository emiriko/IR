We report on recent XMM-Newton observations, archival radio continuum and CO
data, and SED modeling of the unidentified Galactic plane source HESS
J1708-410. No significant extended X-ray emission is observed, and we place an
upper limit of 3.2 x 10{-13} erg cm{-2} s{-1} in the 2-4 keV range for the
region of TeV emission. Molonglo Galactic Plane Survey data is used to place an
upper limit of 0.27 Jy at 843 MHz for the source, with a 2.4 GHz limit of 0.4
Jy from the Parkes survey of the southern Galactic plane. 12CO (J 1->0) data of
this region indicates a plausible distance of 3 kpc for HESS J1708-410. SED
modeling of both the H.E.S.S. detection and flux upper limits offer useful
constraints on the emission mechanisms, magnetic field, injection spectrum, and
ambient medium surrounding this source.
