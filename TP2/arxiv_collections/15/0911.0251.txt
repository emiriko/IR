We investigate cancellation of spatial aberrations induced by an object
placed in a quantum coincidence interferometer with type-II parametric down
conversion as a light source. We analyze in detail the physical mechanism by
which the cancellation occurs, and show that the aberration cancels only when
the object resides in one particular plane within the apparatus. In addition,
we show that for a special case of the apparatus it is possible to produce
simultaneous cancellation of both even-order and odd-order aberrations in this
plane.
