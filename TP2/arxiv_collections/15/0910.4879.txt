We study the nuclear effects in the electromagnetic structure function
F2(x,Q^2) in nuclei in the deep inelastic lepton nucleus scattering process by
taking into account Fermi motion, binding, pion and rho meson cloud
contributions. Calculations have been done in a local density approximation
using relativistic nuclear spectral functions which include nucleon
correlations for nuclear matter. The ratios over deuteron structure function
are obtained and compared with the recent JLAB results for light nuclei with
special attention to the slope of the x distributions. This magnitude shows a
non trivial A dependence and it is insensitive to possible normalization
uncertainties. The results have also been compared with some of the older
experiments using intermediate mass nuclei.
