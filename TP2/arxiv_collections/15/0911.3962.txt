In this paper we introduce Lipschitz spaces with respect to the Gaussian
measure, and study the boundedness of the fractional integral and fractional
derivative operators on them.The methods are general enough to provide
alternative proofs of the ones given in the classical case and moreover can be
extended to the case of Laguerre and Jacobi expansions too
