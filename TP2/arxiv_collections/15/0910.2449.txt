Using the ADM formalism in the minisuperspace, we obtain the commutative and
noncommutative exact classical solutions and exact wave function to the
Wheeler-DeWitt equation with an arbitrary factor ordering, for the anisotropic
Bianchi type I cosmological model, coupled to a scalar field, cosmological term
and barotropic perfect fluid. We introduce noncommutative scale factors,
considering that all minisuperspace variables $\rm q^i$ do not commute, so the
symplectic structure was modified. In the classical regime, it is shown that
the anisotropic parameter $\rm \beta_{\pm nc}$ and the field $\phi$, for some
value in the $\lambda_{eff}$ cosmological term and noncommutative $\theta$
parameter, present a dynamical isotropization up to a critical cosmic time
$t_{c}$; after this time, the effects of isotropization in the noncommutative
minisuperspace seems to disappear. In the quantum regimen, the probability
density presents a new structure that corresponds to the value of the
noncommutativity parameter.
