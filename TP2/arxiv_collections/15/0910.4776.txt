We examine the weak-field approximation of locally Galilean invariant
gravitational theories with general covariance in a $(4+1)$-dimensional
Galilean framework. The additional degrees of freedom allow us to obtain
Poisson, diffusion, and Schr\"odinger equations for the fluctuation field. An
advantage of this approach over the usual $(3+1)$-dimensional General
Relativity is that it allows us to choose an ansatz for the fluctuation field
that can accommodate the field equations of the Lagrangian approach to MOdified
Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) known as AQUAdratic Lagrangian (AQUAL). We
investigate a wave solution for the Schr\"odinger equations.
