In this paper we establish global Lp regularity properties of Fourier
integral operators. The orders of decay of the amplitude are determined for
operators to be bounded on $L^p(\Rn)$, $1<p<\infty$, as well as to be bounded
from Hardy space $H^1(\Rn)$ to $L^1(\Rn)$. The obtained results extend local
$L^p$ regularity properties of Fourier integral operators established by
Seeger, Sogge and Stein (1991) as well as global $L^2(\Rn)$ results of Asada
and Fujiwara (1978) and Ruzhansky and Sugimoto (2006), to the global setting of
$L^p(\Rn)$. Global boundedness in weighted Sobolev spaces $W^{\sigma,p}_s(\Rn)$
is also established. The techniques used in the proofs are the space dependent
dyadic decomposition and the global calculi developed by Ruzhansky and Sugimoto
(2006) and Coriasco (1999).
