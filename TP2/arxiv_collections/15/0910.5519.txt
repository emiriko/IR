On contact manifolds we describe a notion of (contact) finite-type for linear
partial differential operators satisfying a natural condition on their leading
terms. A large class of linear differential operators are of finite-type in
this sense, and for any such operator we construct a partial connection on a
(finite rank) vector bundle with the property that sections in the null space
of the operator correspond bijectively, and via an explicit map, with sections
parallel for the partial connection. It follows that the solution space is
finite dimensional and bounded by the corank of the holonomy algebra of the
partial connection. For finite-type operators on a parabolic contact geometry,
the structure of the vector bundle, in particular its rank, can be easily
determined by representation theory.
