The Hubbard-I approximation is generalized to allow for direct evaluation of
the equal-time anomalous two-electron propagator for Hubbard model on
two-dimensional square lattice. This propagator is compared against the quantum
Monte Carlo data obtained by Aimi and Imada [J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. {\bf 76},
113708 (2007)] in the limit of strong electron-electron interaction. The
Hubbard-I predictions are in a good qualitative agreement with the Monte Carlo
results. In particular, $d$-wave correlations decay as $c r^{-3}$ ("free
electron" behaviour), if separation $r$ exceeds 2-3 lattice constants. However,
the Hubbard-I approximation underestimates coefficient $c$ by a factor of about
three. We conclude that the Hubbard-I approximation, despite its simplicity and
artefacts, captures the qualitative behaviour of the two-particle propagator
for the Hubbard model, at least for moderate values of $r$.
