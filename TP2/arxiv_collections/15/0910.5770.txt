Significant temperature effects on the electrokinetic transport in a
nanochannel with a slab geometry are demonstrated using a molecular dynamics
(MD) model. A system consisting of Na+ and Cl- ions dissolved in water and
confined between fixed crystalline silicon walls with negatively charged inner
surfaces in an external electric field was investigated. Lennard-Jones (LJ)
force fields and Coulomb electrostatic interactions with Simple Point Charge
Extended (SPC/E) model were used to represent the interactions between ions,
water molecules, and channel wall atoms. Dependence of the flow of water and
ions on the temperature was examined. The magnitude of the water flux and even
its direction are shown to be significantly affected by temperature. In
particular, the previously reported flow reversal phenomenon does not occur at
higher temperature. Temperature dependence of the flux was attributed to the
charge redistribution and to the changes in viscosity of water.
