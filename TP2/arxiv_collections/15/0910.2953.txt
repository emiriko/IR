This paper presents CCD observations of the Algol-type eclipsing binaries RZ
Dra and EG Cep. The light curves have been analyzed with the PHOEBE software
and Wilson-Devinney code (2003 version). A detailed photometric analysis, based
on these observations, is presented for both binarity and pulsation. The
results indicate semidetached systems where the secondary component fills its
Roche lobe. After the subtraction of the theoretical light curve, a frequency
analysis was performed in order to check for pulsations of the primary
component of each system. Moreover, a period analysis was performed for each
case in order to search for additional components around the eclipsing pairs.
