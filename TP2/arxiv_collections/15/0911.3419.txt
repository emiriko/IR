Long-period transiting exoplanets provide an opportunity to study the
mass-radius relation and internal structure of extrasolar planets. Their
studies grant insights into planetary evolution akin to the Solar System
planets, which, in contrast to hot Jupiters, are not constantly exposed to the
intense radiation of their parent stars. Observations of secondary eclipses
allow investigations of exoplanet temperatures and large-scale exo-atmospheric
properties. In this short paper, we elaborate on, and calculate, probabilities
of secondary eclipses for given orbital parameters, both in the presence and
absence of detected primary transits, and tabulate these values for the forty
planets with the highest primary transit probabilities.
