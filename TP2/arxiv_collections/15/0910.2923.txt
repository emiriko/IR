The asymptotic time derivative of the total dipole signal is proposed as an
useful observable to investigate on Isospin equilibration phenomenon in
multi-fragmentation processes. The study has been developed to describe
charge/mass equilibration processes involving the gas and liquid "phases" of
the total system formed during the early stage of a collision. General
properties of this observable and the links with others isospin dependent
phenomena are discussed. In particular, the $^{40}Cl+^{28}Si$ system at 40
MeV/nucleon is investigated by means of semiclassical microscopic many-body
calculations based on the CoMD-II model. The study of the dynamical many-body
correlations produced by the model also shows how the proposed observable is
rather sensitive to different parameterizations of the isospin dependent
interaction.
