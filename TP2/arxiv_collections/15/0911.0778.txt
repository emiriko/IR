Star clusters and their stellar populations play a significant role in the
context of galaxy evolution, across space (from local to high redshift) and
time (from currently forming to fossil remnants). We are now within reach of
answering a number of fundamental questions that will have a significant impact
on our understanding of key open issues in contemporary astrophysics, ranging
from the formation, assembly and evolution of galaxies to the details of the
star-formation process. Our improved understanding of the physics driving star
cluster formation and evolution has led to the emergence of crucial new open
questions that will most likely be tackled in a systematic way in the next
decade.
