Nanostructured titania derived from the sol-gel processing requires a
detailed study to clarify state-of-art of every process step starting from
colloidal sol, peptization, gelation to the final sintering. The applied
parameters such as peptization temperature and time in the current
investigation of sol during the early stage of processing were characterized by
dynamic light scattering (DLS) and compared to other parameters found in the
literature. Upon gelation, the resulting anatase was calcined to study the
phase transformation to rutile as well as to discriminate the effect of
peptized and unpeptized in which the characterizations were carried out by
using XRD, Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm and HRTEM. It shows that
peptizing the titania sol at 80oC for at least 12 h resulted in a small and
uniform anatase crystallite with size of 4.6 nm.
