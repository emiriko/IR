In this article we study holomorphic deformations of the filtered Gauss-Manin
systems associated to a vanishing period integral. For that purpose we
introduce a new sub-class of the class of monogenic (a,b)-modules (Brieskorn
modules) which was studied in our previous article [B. 09]. We show that these
new objects, called ?themes?, have good functorial properties and that there
exists a canonical order on the roots of the corresponding Bernstein
polynomial. We construct, for given fundamental invariants, a finite
dimensional versal holomorphic family and we show that, when all themes with
these fundamental invariants are ?stable?, this versal family is in fact
universal. We also give a sufficient condition on the roots of the Bernstein
polynomial in order that the previous condition is satisfied. We show with an
example that a universal family may not exist for some values of the
fundamental invariants.
