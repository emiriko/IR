We study the phase transition between the high temperature Coulomb phase and
the low temperature staggered crystal phase in three dimensional classical O(N)
spin-ice model. Compared with the previously proposed CP(1) formalism on the
Coulomb-crystal transition of the classical dimer model, our description based
on constrained order parameter is more conventional, due to a fundamental
difference between the O(N) and the dimer model. A systematic epsilon and 1/N
expansion are used to study the universality class of the phase transition, and
a stable fixed point is found based on our calculations for large enough N.
