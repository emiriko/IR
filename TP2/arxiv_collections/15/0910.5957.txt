We investigate the relation between non-unitarity of the leptonic mixing
matrix and leptogenesis. We discuss how all parameters of the canonical type-I
seesaw mechanism can, in principle, be reconstructed from the neutrino mass
matrix and the deviation of the effective low-energy leptonic mixing matrix
from unitary. When the mass M' of the lightest right-handed neutrino is much
lighter than the masses of the others, we show that its decay asymmetries
within flavour-dependent leptogenesis can be expressed in terms of two
contributions, one depending on the unique dimension five (d=5) operator
generating neutrino masses and one depending on the dimension six (d=6)
operator associated with non-unitarity. In low-energy seesaw scenarios where
small lepton number violation explains the smallness of neutrino masses, the
lepton number conserving d=6 operator contribution generically dominates over
the d=5 operator contribution which results in a strong enhancement of the
flavour-dependent decay asymmetries without any resonance effects. To calculate
the produced final baryon asymmetry, the flavour equilibration effects directly
related to non-unitarity have to be taken into account. In a simple realization
of this non-unitarity driven leptogenesis, the lower bound on M' is found to be
about 10^8 GeV at the onset of the strong washout regime, more than one order
of magnitude below the bound in "standard" thermal leptogenesis.
