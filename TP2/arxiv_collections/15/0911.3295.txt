Using Monte Carlo simulations and finite-size scaling analysis, the critical
behavior of attractive rigid rods of length k (k-mers) on square lattices at
intermediate density has been studied. A nematic phase, characterized by a big
domain of parallel k-mers, was found. This ordered phase is separated from the
isotropic state by a continuous transition occurring at a intermediate density
\theta_c, which increases linearly with the magnitude of the lateral
interactions.
