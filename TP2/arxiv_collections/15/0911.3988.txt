We derive a rate of convergence of the Loewner driving function for planar
loop-erased random walk to Brownian motion with speed 2 on the unit circle, the
Loewner driving function for radial SLE(2). The proof uses a new estimate of
the difference between the discrete and continuous Green's functions that is an
improvement over existing results for the class of domains we consider. Using
the rate for the driving process convergence along with additional information
about SLE(2), we also obtain a rate of convergence for the paths with respect
to the Hausdorff distance.
