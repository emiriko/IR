We have developed a new method, K2, optimized for the detection of galaxy
clusters in multicolor images. Based on the Red Sequence approach, K2 detects
clusters using simultaneous enhancements in both colors and position. The
detection significance is robustly determined through extensive Monte-Carlo
simulations and through comparison with available cluster catalogs based on two
different optical methods, and also on X-ray data. K2 also provides
quantitative estimates of the candidate clusters' richness and photometric
redshifts. Initially K2 was applied to 161 sq deg of two color gri images of
the CFHTLS-Wide data. Our simulations show that the false detection rate, at
our selected threshold, is only ~1%, and that the cluster catalogs are ~80%
complete up to a redshift of 0.6 for Fornax-like and richer clusters and to z
~0.3 for poorer clusters. Based on Terapix T05 release gri photometric
catalogs, 35 clusters/sq deg are detected, with 1-2 Fornax-like or richer
clusters every two square degrees. Catalogs containing data for 6144 galaxy
clusters have been prepared, of which 239 are rich clusters. These clusters,
especially the latter, are being searched for gravitational lenses -- one of
our chief motivations for cluster detection in CFHTLS. The K2 method can be
easily extended to use additional color information and thus improve overall
cluster detection to higher redshifts. The complete set of K2 cluster catalogs,
along with the supplementary catalogs for the member galaxies, are available on
request from the authors.
