A new style of temporal debugging is proposed. The new URDB debugger can
employ such techniques as temporal search for finding an underlying fault that
is causing a bug. This improves on the standard iterative debugging style,
which iteratively re-executes a program under debugger control in the search
for the underlying fault. URDB acts as a meta-debugger, with current support
for four widely used debuggers: gdb, MATLAB, python, and perl. Support for a
new debugger can be added in a few hours. Among its points of novelty are: (i)
the first reversible debuggers for MATLAB, python, and perl; (ii) support for
today's multi-core architectures; (iii) reversible debugging of multi-process
and distributed computations; and (iv) temporal search on changes in program
expressions. URDB gains its reversibility and temporal abilities through the
fast checkpoint-restart capability of DMTCP (Distributed MultiThreaded
CheckPointing). The recently enhanced DMTCP also adds ptrace support, enabling
one to freeze, migrate, and replicate debugging sessions.
