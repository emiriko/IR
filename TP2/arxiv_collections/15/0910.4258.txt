We present results of the Suzaku observation of the dipping, periodically
bursting low mass X-ray binary XB 1323-619 in which we concentrate of the
spectral evolution in dipping in the energy range 0.8 - 70 keV. It is shown
that spectral evolution in dipping is well-described by absorption on the bulge
in the outer accretion disk of two continuum components: emission of the
neutron star plus the dominant, extended Comptonized emission of the accretion
disk corona (ADC). This model is further supported by detection of a relatively
small, energy-independent decrease of flux above 20 keV due to Thomson
scattering. It is shown that this is consistent with the electron scattering
expected of the bulge plasma. We address the recent proposal that the dip
sources may be explained by an ionized absorber model giving a number of
physical arguments against this model. In particular, that model is
inconsistent with the extended nature of the ADC for which the evidence is now
overwhelming.
