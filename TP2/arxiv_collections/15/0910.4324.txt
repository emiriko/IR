Capillary filling dynamics of liquid n-tetracosane (n-C24H50) in a network of
cylindrical pores with 7 and 10 nm mean diameter in monolithic silica glass
(Vycor) exhibit an abrupt temperature-slope change at Ts=54 deg C, ~4 deg C
above bulk and ~16 deg C, 8 deg C, respectively, above pore freezing. It can be
traced to a sudden inversion of the surface tension's T slope, and thus to a
decrease in surface entropy at the advancing pore menisci, characteristic of
the formation of a single solid monolayer of rectified molecules, known as
surface freezing from macroscopic, quiescent tetracosane melts. The imbibition
speeds, that are the squared prefactors of the observed square-root-of-time
Lucas-Washburn invasion kinetics, indicate a conserved bulk fluidity and
capillarity of the nanopore-confined liquid, if we assume a flat lying, sticky
hydrocarbon backbone monolayer at the silica walls.
