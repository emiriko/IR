We present results on the electromagnetic and axial nucleon form factors
using two degenerate flavors of twisted mass fermions on lattices of spatial
size 2.1 fm and 2.7 fm and a lattice spacing of about 0.09 fm. We consider pion
masses in the range of 260-470 MeV. We chirally extrapolate results on the
nucleon axial ch arge, the isovector Dirac and Pauli root mean squared radii
and magnetic moment to the physical point and co mpare to experiment.
