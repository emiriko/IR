It is possible to provide a thermodynamic interpretation for the field
equations in any diffeomorphism invariant theory of gravity. This insight, in
turn, leads us to the possibility of deriving the gravitational field equations
from another variational principle without using the metric as a dynamical
variable. I review this approach and discuss its implications.
