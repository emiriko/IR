Using the convex optimization method and Helstrom family of ensembles
introduced in Ref. [1], we have discussed optimal ambiguous discrimination in
qubit systems. We have analyzed the problem of the optimal discrimination of N
known quantum states and have obtained maximum success probability and optimal
measurement for N known quantum states with equiprobable prior probabilities
and equidistant from center of the Bloch ball, not all of which are on the one
half of the Bloch ball and all of the conjugate states are pure. An exact
solution has also been given for arbitrary three known quantum states. The
given examples which use our method include: 1. Diagonal N mixed states; 2. N
equiprobable states and equidistant from center of the Bloch ball which their
corresponding Bloch vectors are inclined at the equal angle from z axis; 3.
Three mirror-symmetric states; 4. States that have been prepared with equal
prior probabilities on vertices of a Platonic solid.
