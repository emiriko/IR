A popular observable in finite-temperature lattice QCD is the so-called
singlet quark-antiquark free energy, conventionally defined in Coulomb gauge.
In an effort to interpret the existing numerical data on this observable, we
compute it at order O(alpha_s^2) in continuum, and analyze the result at
various distance scales. At short distances (r << 1/pi T) the behaviour matches
that of the gauge-independent zero-temperature potential; on the other hand at
large distances (r >> 1/pi T) the singlet free energy appears to have a
gauge-fixing related power-law tail. At infinite distance the result again
becomes physical in the sense that it goes over to a gauge-independent
disconnected contribution, the square of the expectation value of the trace of
the Polyakov loop; we recompute this quantity at O(alpha_s^2), finding for pure
SU(Nc) a different non-logarithmic term than in previous literature, and adding
for full QCD the quark contribution. We also discuss the value of the singlet
free energy in a general covariant gauge, as well as the behaviour of the
cyclic Wilson loop that is obtained if the singlet free energy is made
gauge-independent by inserting straight spacelike Wilson lines into the
observable. Comparisons with lattice data are carried out where possible.
