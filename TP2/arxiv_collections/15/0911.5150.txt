Recent developments of high-order CCM have been to extend existing formalism
and codes to $s \ge \frac 12$ for both the ground and excited states. In this
article, we describe how "generalised" expectation values for a wide range of
one- and two-body spin operators may also be determined using existing the CCM
code for the ground state. We present new results for the spin-spin correlation
functions of the spin-half square- and triangular-lattice antiferromagnets by
using the LSUB$m$ approximation. We show that the absolute values of the
spin-spin correlation functions $| < \bf{s}(0).\bf{s}(r) > |$ converge with
increasing approximation level for both lattices. We believe that the LSUB$m$
approximation provides reasonable results for the correlation functions for
lattice separations roughly of order $r \approx m$ for the square lattice. We
compare qualitatively our results for the square lattice to those results of
quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) and we see that good correspondence is observed.
Indeed as seen by QMC, the spin-spin correlation function initially decays
strongly with $|r|$ before becoming constant for larger values of $|r|$. CCM
results are also compared to results of exact diagonalisations for both
lattices. ED results demonstrate a strong finite-size effects at lattice
separations $r=L/2$ (where $N=L \times L$) for both lattices. The behaviour of
the correlation function for the triangular lattice is qualitatively similar to
that of the square lattice, namely, that it decays strongly at first before
becoming constant. This is in keeping with the behaviour of both models, which
are believed strongly to be N\'eel-ordered from approximate studies.
