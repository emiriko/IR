We report a unified representation of the spatial and angular Goos-Hanchen
and Imbert-Fedorov shifts that occur when a light beam reflects from a plane
interface. We thus reveal the dual nature of spatial and angular shifts in
optical beam reflection. In the Goos-Hanchen case we show theoretically and
experimentally that this unification naturally arises in the context of
reflection from a lossy surface (e.g., a metal).
