We study cosmic-ray acceleration in a supernova remnant (SNR) and the escape
from it. We model nonthermal particle and photon spectra for the hidden SNR in
the open cluster Westerlund 2, and the old-age mixed-morphology SNR W 28. We
assume that the SNR shock propagates in a low-density cavity, which is created
and heated through the activities of the progenitor stars and/or previous
supernova explosions. We indicate that the diffusion coefficient for
cosmic-rays around the SNRs is less than ~1% of that away from them. We compare
our predictions with the gamma-ray spectra of molecular clouds illuminated by
the cosmic-rays (Fermi and H.E.S.S.). We found that the spectral indices of the
particles are ~2.3. This may be because the particles were accelerated at the
end of the Sedov phase, and because energy dependent escape and propagation of
particles did not much affect the spectrum.
