The paper gives a characterisation of the chain relation of a sofic subshift.
Every sofic subshift $\Sigma$ can be described by a labelled graph $G$.
Factorising $G$ in a suitable way we obtain the graph $G/_\approx$ that offers
insight into some properties of the original subshift. Using $G/_\approx$ we
describe first the chain relation in $\Sigma$, then characterise
chain-transitive sofic subshifts, chain-mixing sofic subshifts and finally the
attractors of the subshift dynamic system. At the end we present
(straightforward) algorithms deciding chain-transitivity and chain-mixing
properties of a sofic subshift and listing all the attractors of the subshift
system.
