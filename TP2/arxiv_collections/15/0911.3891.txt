The occurrence of a bounce in FRW cosmology requires modifications of general
relativity. An example of such a modification is the recently proposed
Horava-Lifshitz theory of gravity, which includes a ``dark radiation'' term
with a negative coefficient in the analog of the Friedmann equation. This paper
describes a phase space analysis of models of this sort with the aim of
determining to what extent bouncing solutions can occur. A simplification,
valid in the relevant region, allows a reduction of the dimension of phase
space so that visualization in three dimensions is possible. It is found that a
bounce is possible, but not generic in models under consideration. Apart from
previously known bouncing solutions some new ones are also described. Other
interesting solutions found include ones which describe a novel sort of
oscillating universes.
