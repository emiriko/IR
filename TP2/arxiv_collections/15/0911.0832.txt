Polarization transfer in quasi-elastic nucleon knockout is sensitive to the
properties of the nucleon in the nuclear medium. In experiment E03-104 at
Jefferson Lab we measured the proton recoil polarization in the 4He(e,e'p)3H
reaction at a Q^2 of 0.8 (GeV/c)^2 and 1.3 (GeV/c)^2 with unprecedented
precision. The measured polarization-transfer coefficients transverse and
longitudinal to the momentum-transfer direction are well described by a fully
relativistic calculation when a density-dependent medium modification of the
nucleon form factors is included in the model. Results of an alternative model
show that the ratio of these observables is also well described through strong
charge-exchange final-state interactions. The induced polarization in the
(e,e'p) reaction is sensitive to the final-state interactions and the data from
E03-104 will further constrain these models.
