Randomness is a fundamental feature in nature and a valuable resource for
applications ranging from cryptography and gambling to numerical simulation of
physical and biological systems. Random numbers, however, are difficult to
characterize mathematically, and their generation must rely on an unpredictable
physical process. Inaccuracies in the theoretical modelling of such processes
or failures of the devices, possibly due to adversarial attacks, limit the
reliability of random number generators in ways that are difficult to control
and detect. Here, inspired by earlier work on nonlocality based and device
independent quantum information processing, we show that the nonlocal
correlations of entangled quantum particles can be used to certify the presence
of genuine randomness. It is thereby possible to design of a new type of
cryptographically secure random number generator which does not require any
assumption on the internal working of the devices. This strong form of
randomness generation is impossible classically and possible in quantum systems
only if certified by a Bell inequality violation. We carry out a
proof-of-concept demonstration of this proposal in a system of two entangled
atoms separated by approximately 1 meter. The observed Bell inequality
violation, featuring near-perfect detection efficiency, guarantees that 42 new
random numbers are generated with 99% confidence. Our results lay the
groundwork for future device-independent quantum information experiments and
for addressing fundamental issues raised by the intrinsic randomness of quantum
theory.
