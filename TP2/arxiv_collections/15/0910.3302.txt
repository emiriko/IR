We present a hard X-ray spectrum of unprecedented quality of the Galactic
supernova remnant W49B obtained with the Suzaku satellite. The spectrum
exhibits an unusual structure consisting of a saw-edged bump above 8 keV. This
bump cannot be explained by any combination of high-temperature plasmas in
ionization equilibrium. We firmly conclude that this bump is caused by the
strong radiative recombination continuum (RRC) of iron, detected for the first
time in a supernova remnant. The electron temperature derived from the
bremsstrahlung continuum shape and the slope of the RRC is 1.5 keV. On the
other hand, the ionization temperature derived from the observed intensity
ratios between the RRC and K-alpha lines of iron is 2.7 keV. These results
indicate that the plasma is in a highly overionized state. Volume emission
measures independently determined from the fluxes of the thermal and RRC
components are consistent with each other, suggesting the same origin of these
components.
