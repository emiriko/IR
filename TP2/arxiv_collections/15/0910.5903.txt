The dependence of the energy of interwall interaction in double-walled carbon
nanotubes (DWNT) on the relative position of walls has been calculated using
the density functional method. This dependence is used to evaluate forces that
are necessary for the relative telescopic motion of walls and to calculate the
shear strength of DWNT for the relative sliding of walls along the nanotube
axis and for their relative rotation about this axis. The possibility of
experimental verification of the obtained results is discussed.
