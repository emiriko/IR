We performed an intensive photometric monitoring of the PMS stars falling in
a field of about 10x10 arc-minutes in the vicinity of the Orion Nebula Cluster
(ONC). Photometric data were collected between November 2006 and January 2007
with the REM telescope in the VRIJHK' bands. The largest number of observations
is in the I band (about 2700 images) and in J and H bands (about 500 images in
each filter). From the observed rotational modulation, induced by the presence
of surface inhomogeneities, we derived the rotation periods for 16 stars and
improved previous determinations for the other 13. The analysis of the spectral
energy distributions and, for some stars, of high-resolution spectra provided
us with the main stellar parameters (luminosity, effective temperature, mass,
age, and vsini). We also report the serendipitous detection of two strong
flares in two of these objects. In most cases, the light-curve amplitudes
decrease progressively from the R to H band as expected for cool starspots,
while in a few cases, they can only be modelled by the presence of hot spots,
presumably ascribable to magnetospheric accretion. The application of our own
spot model to the simultaneous light curves in different bands allowed us to
deduce the spot parameters and particularly to disentangle the spot temperature
and size effects on the observed light curves.
