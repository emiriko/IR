The use of the LCAO (Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals) method for
excited states involves products of orbitals that are known to be linearly
dependent. We identify a basis in the space of orbital products that is local
for orbitals of finite support and with a residual error that vanishes
exponentially with its dimension. As an application of our previously reported
technique we compute the Kohn--Sham density response function $\chi_{0}$ for a
molecule consisting of $N$ atoms in $N^{2}N_{\omega}$ operations, with
$N_{\omega}$ the number of frequency points. We test our construction of
$\chi_{0}$ by computing molecular spectra directly from the equations of
Petersilka--Gossmann--Gross in $N^{2}N_{\omega}$ operations rather than from
Casida's equations which takes $N^{3}$ operations. We consider the good
agreement with previously calculated molecular spectra as a validation of our
construction of $\chi_{0}$. Ongoing work indicates that our method is well
suited for the computation of the GW self-energy $\Sigma=\mathrm{i}GW$ and we
expect it to be useful in the analysis of exitonic effects in molecules.
