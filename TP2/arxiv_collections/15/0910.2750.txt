Every quantum state can be represented as a probability distribution over the
outcomes of an informationally complete measurement. But not all probability
distributions correspond to quantum states. Quantum state space may thus be
thought of as a restricted subset of all potentially available probabilities. A
recent publication [1] advocates such a representation using symmetric
informationally complete (SIC) measurements. Building upon this work we study
how this subset--quantum-state space--might be characterized. Our leading
characteristic is that the inner products of the probabilities are bounded, a
simple condition with nontrivial consequences. To get quantum-state space
something more detailed about the extreme points is needed. No definitive
characterization is reached, but we see several new interesting features over
those in [1], and all in conformity with quantum theory.
