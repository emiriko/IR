The manuscript presents generalization of the Landau hydrodynamic solution
for multiparticle production applied for non-central relativistic heavy ion
collisions. Obtained solution enables to calculate anisotropy parameter $v_2$
for different rapidities with respect to the initial conditions for
hydrodynamics.
