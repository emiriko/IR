SrRuO3 is an itinerant ferromagnet with orthorhombic structure and uniaxial
magnetocrystalline anisotropy - features expected to yield resistivity
anisotropy. Here we explore changes in the resistivity anisotropy of epitaxial
SrRuO3 films due to induced magnetization in the paramagnetic state by using
the planar Hall effect. We find that the effect of the induced magnetization on
the in-plane anisotropy is strongly angular dependent, and we provide a full
description of this behavior at 160 K for induced magnetization in the (001)
plane.
