Private states are those quantum states from which a perfectly secure
cryptographic key can be extracted. They represent the basic unit of quantum
privacy. In this work we show that all states belonging to this class violate a
Bell inequality. This result establishes a connection between perfect privacy
and nonlocality in the quantum domain.
