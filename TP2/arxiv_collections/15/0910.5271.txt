The chiral quark soliton model (CQSM) is one of the most successful models of
baryons at quark level, which maximally incorporates the most important feature
of low energy QCD, i.e. the chiral symmetry and its spontaneous breakdown.
Basically, it is a relativistic mean-field theory with full account of
infinitely many Dirac-sea quarks in a rotational-symmetry-breaking mean field
of hedgehog shape. The numerical technique established so far enables us to
make a nonperturbative evaluation of Casimir effects (i.e. effects of
vacuum-polarized Dirac sea) on a variety of baryon observables. This
incompatible feature of the model manifests most clearly in its predictions for
parton distribution functions of the nucleon. In this talk, after briefly
reviewing several basic features of the CQSM, we plan to demonstrate in various
ways that this unique model of baryons provides us with an ideal tool for
disentangling nonperturbative aspect of the internal partonic structure of the
nucleon, especially the underlying spin structure function of the nucleon.
