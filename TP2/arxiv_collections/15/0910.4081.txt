We study confluence in the setting of higher-order infinitary rewriting, in
particular for infinitary Combinatory Reduction Systems (iCRSs). We prove that
fully-extended, orthogonal iCRSs are confluent modulo identification of
hypercollapsing subterms. As a corollary, we obtain that fully-extended,
orthogonal iCRSs have the normal form property and the unique normal form
property (with respect to reduction). We also show that, unlike the case in
first-order infinitary rewriting, almost non-collapsing iCRSs are not
necessarily confluent.
