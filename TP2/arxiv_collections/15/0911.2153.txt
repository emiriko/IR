The structural, magnetic and resistive properties of (La1-yYy)FeAsO compounds
(y = 0.10, 0.20, 0.30) have been investigated by means of X-ray and neutron
powder diffraction as well as by resistivity measurements. The temperatures at
which the structural transition from tetragonal to orthorhombic and the
magnetic ordering take place progressively reduce by similar amounts with
increasing Y substitution on account of the progressive chemical pressure
increase. We propose that the structural transition could be originated by a
cooperative Jahn-Teller distortion involving the alignment of the fully
occupied Fe 3d(z2) orbitals in the Fe plane along the y axis, leading to the
branching of the cell parameters a and b. The magnetic structure develops after
the occurrence of the structural transition, but before its completion.
