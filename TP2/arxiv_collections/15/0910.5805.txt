We demonstrate self-started mode-locking in an Erbium-doped fiber ring laser
by using the nonlinear polarization rotation mode-locking technique but without
an isolator in cavity. We show that due to the intrinsic effective nonlinearity
discrimination of the mode-locked pulse propagating along different cavity
directions, the soliton operation of the laser is always unidirectional, and
its features have no difference to that of the unidirectional lasers with an
isolator in cavity.
