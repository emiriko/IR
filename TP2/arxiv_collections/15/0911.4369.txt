We study the structure of colloidal fluids with reference to colloid-polymer
mixtures. We compare the one component description of the Asakura-Oosawa (AO)
idealisation of colloid-polymer mixtures with the full two-component model. We
also consider the Morse potential, a variable range interaction, for which the
ground state clusters are known. Mapping the state points between these
systems, we find that the pair structure of the full AO model is equally well
described by the Morse potential or the one component AO approach. We employ a
recently developed method to identify in the bulk fluid the ground state
clusters relevant to the Morse potential. Surprisingly, when we measure the
cluster populations, we find that the Morse fluid is significantly closer the
full AO fluid than the one component AO description.
