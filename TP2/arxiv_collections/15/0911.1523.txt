For a given arithmetic scheme, in this paper we will introduce and discuss
the monodromy action on a universal cover of the \'etale fundamental group and
the monodromy action on an \emph{sp}-completion constructed by the graph
functor, respectively; then by these results we will give a proof of the
section conjecture of Grothendieck for arithmetic schemes.
