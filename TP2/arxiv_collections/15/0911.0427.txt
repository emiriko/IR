We analyze the Abelian gauge fluxes in local F-theory models with G_S=SU(6)
and SO(10). For the case of G_S=SO(10), there is a no-go theorem which states
that for an exotic-free spectrum, there are no solutions for U(1)^2 gauge
fluxes. We explicitly construct the U(1)^2 gauge fluxes with an exotic-free
bulk spectrum for the case of G_S=SU(6). We also analyze the conditions for the
curves supporting the given field content and discuss non-minimal spectra of
the MSSM with doublet-triplet splitting.
