Ground state properties of a Kondo lattice model with random configuration of
$f$ electrons are investigated with a variational Monte Carlo method. We show
that the crossover from a dilute-Kondo system to a heavy-fermion system occurs
when the density of $c$ and $f$ electrons ($n_c$, $n_f$) become comparable,
$n_f\lesssim n_c$. In the heavy-fermion region, the correlation between $f$
electrons is strong and the $f$ electrons themselves greatly contribute to the
screening of other $f$-electron moments. We propose that the character of Kondo
screening changes from "individual" to "collective" across the crossover.
