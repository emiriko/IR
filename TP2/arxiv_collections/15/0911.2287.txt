The global Okounkov body of a projective variety is a closed convex cone that
encodes asymptotic information about every big line bundle on the variety. In
the case of a rank two toric vector bundle E on a smooth projective toric
variety, we use its Klyachko filtrations to give an explicit description of the
global Okounkov body of P(E). In particular, we show that this is a rational
polyhedral cone and that P(E) is a Mori dream space.
