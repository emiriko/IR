We present Suzaku observations of the Galactic black hole candidate Swift
J1753.5-0127 in the low-hard state. The broadband coverage of Suzaku enables us
to detect the source over the energy range 0.6 -- 250 keV. The broadband
spectrum (2 -- 250 keV) is found to be consistent with a simple power-law
(gamma \sim 1.63). In agreement with previous observations of this system, a
significant excess of soft X-ray flux is detected consistent with the presence
of a cool accretion disc. Estimates of the disc inner radius infer a value
consistent with the ISCO (R_{in} \lesssim 6 R_g, for certain values of, e.g.
N_H, i), although we cannot conclusively rule out the presence of an accretion
disc truncated at larger radii (R_{in} \sim 10 - 50 R_g). A weak,
relativistically-broadened iron line is also detected, in addition to disc
reflection at higher energy. However, the iron-K line profile favours an inner
radius larger than the ISCO (R _{in} \sim 10 - 20 R_g). The implications of
these observations for models of the accretion flow in the low-hard state are
discussed.
