A possibility of applying 2MASS J, H, Ks, IPHAS r, i and MegaCam u, g
photometry of red giants for determining distances to dark clouds is
investigated. Red clump giants with a small admixture of G5-K1 and M2-M3 stars
of the giant branch can be isolated and used in determining distances to
separate clouds or spiral arms. The method is applied to an area of the North
America and Pelican nebulae complex. Interstellar extinctions of background red
giants can be also used for mapping dust surface density in the cloud.
