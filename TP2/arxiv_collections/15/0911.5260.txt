We study algebraic and combinatorial aspects of (classical) projections of
$m$-dimensional tropical varieties onto $(m+1)$-dimensional planes. Building
upon the work of Sturmfels, Tevelev, and Yu on tropical elimination as well as
the work of the authors on projection-based tropical bases, we characterize
algebraic properties of the relevant ideals and provide a characterization of
the dual subdivision (as a subdivision of a fiber polytope). This dual
subdivision naturally leads to the issue of self-intersections of a tropical
variety under projections. For the case of curves, we provide some bounds for
the (unweighted) number of self-intersections of projections onto the plane and
give constructions with many self-intersections.
