We study two reciprocal thermal effects in the ferromagnetic semiconductor
(Ga,Mn)As by scattering theory: domain wall motion induced by a temperature
gradient as well as heat currents pumped by a moving domain wall. The effective
out-of-plane thermal spin transfer torque parameter $P_Q \beta_{Q}$, which
governs the coupling between heat currents and a magnetic texture, is found to
be of the order of unity. Unpinned domain walls are predicted to move at speed
10 m/s in temperature gradients of the order 10 ${\rm K/ \mu m}$. The cooling
power of a moving domain wall only compensates the heating due to friction
losses at ultra-low domain wall velocities of about 0.07 m/s. The Seebeck
coefficient is found to be of the order 100-500 ${\rm \mu V / K}$ at T=10 K, in
good agreement with recent experiment.
