This paper presents an axiomatic scheme for interest rate models in discrete
time. We take a pricing kernel approach, which builds in the arbitrage-free
property and provides a link to equilibrium economics. We require that the
pricing kernel be consistent with a pair of axioms, one giving the
inter-temporal relations for dividend-paying assets, and the other ensuring the
existence of a money-market asset. We show that the existence of a
positive-return asset implies the existence of a previsible money-market
account. A general expression for the price process of a limited-liability
asset is derived. This expression includes two terms, one being the discounted
risk-adjusted value of the dividend stream, the other characterising retained
earnings. The vanishing of the latter is given by a transversality condition.
We show (under the assumed axioms) that, in the case of a limited-liability
asset with no permanently-retained earnings, the price process is given by the
ratio of a pair of potentials. Explicit examples of discrete-time models are
provided.
