The Landau gauge lattice gluon propagator is discussed for different sets of
lattices. Particular attention is given to its infrared properties. Our results
show that the lattice propagator can be made compatible with either the
decoupling-like or the scaling-like solution of the Dyson-Schwinger equations.
Furthermore, the analysis of the Cucchieri-Mendes bounds is performed
onsidering large volume simulations and the Oliveira-Silva ratios are computed.
If the first do not give a clear answer about the value of D(0), the second
method favors a $D(0) = 0$. Finally, the SU(3) and SU(2) propagators are
compared in the infrared. It comes out that the propagators are different
although the infrared exponents seem to be similar. The analysis suggests a
scaling behaviour $D(0) \sim N$ with the gauge group SU(N).
