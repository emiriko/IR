We report on the first high-resolution dc-magnetisation ($M$) measurements on
a single crystal of \ycs. $M$ was measured down to 0.05 K and in fields up to
12 T, with the magnetic field $H$ parallel to the crystallographic direction
[100]. Two antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase transitions have been detected in a
field $\mu_{0}H = 0.1$ T at $T_{N} = 1.75$ K and $T_{L} = 0.9$ K, in form of a
sharp cusp and a sudden drop in $\chi = M/H$, respectively. These signatures
suggest that the phase transitions are $2^{nd}$ order at $T_{N}$ and $1^{st}$
order at $T_{L}$. The upper transition is suppressed by a critical field
$\mu_{0}H_{N} = 1.9$ T. The field-dependent magnetisation shows two hysteretic
metamagnetic-like steps at the lowest temperature, followed by a sharp kink,
which separates the AFM region from the paramagnetic one. The magnetic $H - T$
phase diagram of \ycs has been deduced from the isothermal and isofield curves.
Four AFM regions were identified which are separated by $1^{st}$ and $2^{nd}$
order phase-transition lines.
