The Richtmyer-Meshkov instability (RMI) refers to the baroclinic generation
of vorticity at a perturbed density interface when impacted by a shock wave. It
is often thought of as the impulsive limit of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability
(RTI). The fluid dynamics video "large-eddy simulations (LES) of RMI in a
converging geometry" shows the mixing of materials resulting from the
interaction of an imploding cylindrical shock wave with a concentric perturbed
interface that separates outside light gas from heavy gas (initially 5 times
denser) inside a wedge. At the initial impact, the incident shock Mach number
is either 1.3 or 2.0. The present canonical simulations support recent
interests on compressible turbulent mixing in converging geometries relevant to
both inertial confinement fusion and core-collapse supernovae dynamics.
