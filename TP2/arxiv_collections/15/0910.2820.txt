In this note, we consider the equations of motion for charged branes in AdS
space and show that they can be cast into one-dimensional coupled Toda type.
Then we solve the equations of motion to construct static charged AdS brane
solutions which are invariant under translation along $p$ directions and have
toroidal symmetry. The solutions are described by mass, charges and a dilaton
coupling constant.
