Efficient collection of fluorescence from trapped ions is crucial for quantum
optics and quantum computing applications, specifically, for qubit state
detection and in generating single photons for ion-photon and remote ion
entanglement. In a typical setup, only a few per cent of ion fluorescence is
intercepted by the aperture of the imaging optics. We employ a simple metallic
spherical mirror integrated with a linear Paul ion trap to achieve photon
collection efficiency of at least 10% from a single Ba$^+$ ion. An aspheric
corrector is used to reduce the aberrations caused by the mirror and achieve
high image quality.
