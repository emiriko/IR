We theorize that phylogenetic profiles provide a quantitative method that can
relate the structural and functional properties of proteins, as well as their
evolutionary relationships. A key feature of phylogenetic profiles is the
interoperable data format (e.g. alignment information, physiochemical
information, genomic information, etc). Indeed, we have previously demonstrated
Position Specific Scoring Matrices (PSSMs) are an informative M-dimension which
can be scored from quantitative measure of embedded or unmodified sequence
alignments. Moreover, the information obtained from these alignments is
informative, even in the twilight zone of sequence similarity (<25%
identity)(1-5). Although powerful, our previous embedding strategy suffered
from contaminating alignments(embedded AND unmodified) and computational
expense. Herein, we describe the logic and algorithmic process for a heuristic
embedding strategy (Adaptive GDDA-BLAST, Ada-BLAST). Ada-BLAST on average up to
~19-fold faster and has similar sensitivity to our previous method. Further, we
provide data demonstrating the benefits of embedded alignment measurements for
isolating secondary structural elements and the classifying
transmembrane-domain structure/function. We theorize that sequence-embedding is
one of multiple ways that low-identity alignments can be measured and
incorporated into high-performance PSSM-based phylogenetic profiles.
