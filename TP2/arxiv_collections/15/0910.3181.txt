Transverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions are a key
ingredient in the description of spin and azimuthal asymmetries in
deep-inelastic scattering processes. Recent results from non-perturbative
calculations in effective approaches are reviewed, with focus on relations
among different parton distribution functions in QCD and models.
