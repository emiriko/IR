We report on a new, orginal and efficient method for "pi-stacking"
functionalization of single wall carbon nanotubes. This method is applied to
the synthesis of a high-yield light-harvesting system combining single wall
carbon nanotubes and porphyrin molecules. We developed a micelle swelling
technique that leads to controlled and stable complexes presenting an efficient
energy transfer. We demonstrate the key role of the organic solvent in the
functionalization mechanism. By swelling the micelles, the solvent helps the
non water soluble porphyrins to reach the micelle core and allows a strong
enhancement of the interaction between porphyrins and nanotubes. This technique
opens new avenues for the functionalization of carbon nanostructures.
