Various authors have suggested that the gamma-ray burst (GRB) central engine
is a rapidly rotating, strongly magnetized, $(\sim 10^{15}-10^{16}$ G) compact
object. The strong magnetic field can accelerate and collimate the relativistic
flow and the rotation of the compact object can be the energy source of the
GRB. The major problem in this scenario is the difficulty of finding an
astrophysical mechanism for obtaining such intense fields. Whereas, in
principle, a neutron star could maintain such strong fields, it is difficult to
justify a scenario for their creation. If the compact object is a black hole,
the problem is more difficult since, according to general relativity it has "no
hair" (i.e., no magnetic field). Schuster, Blackett, Pauli, and others have
suggested that a rotating neutral body can create a magnetic field by
non-minimal gravitational-electromagnetic coupling (NMGEC). The
Schuster-Blackett form of NMGEC was obtained from the Mikhail and Wanas's
tetrad theory of gravitation (MW). We call the general theory NMGEC-MW.
  We investigate here the possible origin of the intense magnetic fields $\sim
10^{15}-10^{16}$ G in GRBs by NMGEC-MW. Whereas these fields are difficult to
explain astrophysically, we find that they are easily explained by NMGEC-MW. It
not only explains the origin of the $\sim 10^{15}-10^{16}$G fields when the
compact object is a neutron star, but also when it is a black hole.
