The self-consistent separable random-phase approximation (SRPA) model with
Skyrme forces is extended to the case of magnetic excitations and applied to
the description of spin-flip and orbital M1 giant resonances in the isotopic
chain $^{142-152}$Nd. The Skyrme forces SkT6, SkM*, SLy6 and SkI3 are used. The
calculations show the onset of the scissors mode with increasing deformation. A
specific three-peak structure of the spin-flip response is found and explained
by particular neutron and proton spin-flip transitions. Although the employed
forces provide an acceptable qualitative description, the Skyrme functional
still needs further improvement to reproduce quantitatively the experimental
data.
