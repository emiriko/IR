We consider fermions in a zero-temperature superconducting anti-de Sitter
domain wall solution and find continuous bands of normal modes. These bands can
be either partially filled or totally empty and gapped. We present a
semi-classical argument which approximately captures the main features of the
normal mode spectrum.
