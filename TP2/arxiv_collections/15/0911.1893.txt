We derive the abundance of 19 elements in a sample of 64 stars with
fundamental parameters very similar to solar, which minimizes the impact of
systematic errors in our spectroscopic 1D-LTE differential analysis, using
high-resolution (R=60,000), high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N=200) spectra. The
estimated errors in the elemental abundances relative to solar are as small as
0.025 dex. The abundance ratios [X/Fe] as a function of [Fe/H] agree closely
with previously established patterns of Galactic thin-disk chemical evolution.
Interestingly, the majority of our stars show a significant correlation between
[X/Fe] and condensation temperature (Tc). In the sample of 22 stars with
parameters closest to solar, we find that, on average, low Tc elements are
depleted with respect to high Tc elements in the solar twins relative to the
Sun by about 0.08 dex (20%). An increasing trend is observed for the abundances
as a function of Tc for 900<Tc<1800 K, while abundances of lower Tc elements
appear to be roughly constant. We speculate that this is a signature of the
planet formation that occurred around the Sun but not in the majority of solar
twins. If this hypothesis is correct, stars with planetary systems like ours,
although rare (frequency of 15%), may be identified through a very detailed
inspection of the chemical compositions of their host stars.
