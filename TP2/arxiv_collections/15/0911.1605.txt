General form of the non-local equation for an ionization source in glow
discharge and hollow cathode 3D-simulation is formulated. It is a fundamental
equation in a hollow cathode theory, which allows to make up a complete set of
field equations for a self-consistent problem in a stationary glow discharge
and a hollow cathode. It enables to describe adequately the region of negative
glow and the hollow cathode effect. Here you can see first attempts to compare
calculation results of electrical dependences (pressure - voltage) and
experimental data, - under conditions of gradual appearance of the hollow
cathode effect.
