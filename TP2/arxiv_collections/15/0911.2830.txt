We have carried out long-term (14 years) V and R photometric monitoring of 12
carbon-rich proto-planetary nebulae. The light and color curves display
variability in all of them. The light curves are complex and suggest multiple
periods, changing periods, and/or changing amplitudes, which are attributed to
pulsation. A dominant period has been determined for each and found to be in
the range of ~150 d for the coolest (G8) to 35-40 d for the warmest (F3). A
clear, linear inverse relationship has been found in the sample between the
pulsation period and the effective temperature and also an inverse linear
relationship between the amplitude of light variation and the effective
temperature. These are consistent with the expectation for a pulsating post-AGB
star evolving toward higher temperature at constant luminosity. The published
spectral energy distributions and mid-infrared images show these objects to
have cool (200 K), detached dust shells and published models imply that
intensive mass loss ended a few thousand years ago. The detection of periods as
long as 150 d in these requires a revision in the published post-AGB evolution
models that couple the pulsation period to the mass loss rate and that assume
that intensive mass loss ended when the pulsation period had decreased to 100
d. This revision will have the effect of extending the time scale for the early
phases of post-AGB evolution. It appears that real time evolution in the
pulsation periods of individual objects may be detectable on the time scale of
two decades.
