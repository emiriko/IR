Method given for intuitively visualizing constancy of light speed. Using
mass-energy equivalence, we can show with the help of simple thought
experiments, that velocity time dilation and gravitational time dilation are a
necessary consequence of principle of relativity. Speed of light is discussed
in the context of each kind of time dilation.
