A new method is explored to detect extensive air showers: the measurement of
radio waves emitted during the propagation of the electromagnetic shower
component in the magnetic field of the Earth. Recent results of the pioneering
experiment LOPES are discussed. It registers radio signals in the frequency
range between 40 and 80 MHz. The intensity of the measured radio emission is
investigated as a function of different shower parameters, such as shower
energy, angle of incidence, and distance to shower axis. In addition, new
antenna types are developed in the framework of LOPES-Star and new methods are
explored to realize a radio self-trigger algorithm in real time.
