The WMAP haze is an excess in microwave emission coming from the center of
the Milky Way galaxy. In the case of synchrotron emission models of the haze,
we present tests for the source of radiating high-energy electrons/positrons.
We explore several models in the case of a pulsar population or dark matter
annihilation as the source. These morphological signatures of these models are
small behind the WMAP Galactic mask, but are testable and constrain the source
models. We show that detailed measurements of the morphology may distinguish
between the pulsar and dark matter interpretations as well as differentiate
among different pulsar models and dark matter profile models individually.
Specifically, we find that a zero central density Galactic pulsar population
model is in tension with the observed WMAP haze. The Planck Observatory's
greater sensitivity and expected smaller Galactic mask should potentially
provide a robust signature of the WMAP haze as either a pulsar population or
the dark matter.
