General relativity considers Dixon's theory as the standard theory to deal
with the motion of extended bodies in a given gravitational background. We
discuss here the features of the "reaction" of an extended body to the passage
of a weak gravitational wave. We find that the body acquires a dipolar moment
induced by its quadrupole structure. Furthermore, we derive the "world
function" for the weak field limit of a gravitational wave background and use
it to estimate the deviation between geodesics and the world lines of
structured bodies. Measuring such deviations, due to the existence of
cumulative effects, should be favorite with respect to measuring the amplitude
of the gravitational wave itself.
