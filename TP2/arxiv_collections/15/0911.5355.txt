We investigate the bounds on axionlike states from flavor-changing neutral
current b->s decays, assuming the axion couples to the standard model through
mixing with the Higgs sector. Such GeV-scale axions have received renewed
attention in connection with observed cosmic ray excesses. We find that
existing B->K l+ l- data impose stringent bounds on the axion decay constant in
the multi-TeV range, relevant for constraining the "axion portal" model of dark
matter. Such bounds also constrain light Higgs scenarios in the next-to-minimal
supersymmetric standard model. These bounds can be improved by dedicated
searches in B-factory data and at LHCb.
