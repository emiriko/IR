In this paper we analyzed the behavior of the unusual dwarf nova EM Cyg using
the data obtained in April-October, 2007 in Vyhorlat observatory (Slovak
Republic) and in September, 2006 in Crimean Astrophysical Observatory
(Ukraine). During our observations EM Cyg has shown outbursts in every 15-40
days. Because on the light curves of EM Cyg the partial eclipse of an accretion
disc is observed we applied the eclipse mapping technique to reconstruct the
temperature distribution in eclipsed parts of the disc. Calculations of the
accretion rate in the system were made for the quiescent and the outburst
states of activity for different distances.
