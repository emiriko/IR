KASCADE-Grande is a multi-detector experiment at Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe,
Germany for measuring extensive air showers in the primary energy range of 100
TeV to 1 EeV. This contribution attempts to provide a synopsis of the current
results of the experiment. In particular, the reconstruction of the
all-particle energy spectrum in the range of 10 PeV to 1 EeV based on four
different methods with partly different sources of systematic uncertainties is
presented. Since the calibration of the observables in terms of the primary
energy and mass depends on Monte Carlo simulations, we compare the results of
various methods applied to the same sample of measured data. In addition, first
investigations on the elemental composition of the cosmic particles as well as
on tests of hadronic interaction models underlying the analyses are discussed.
