We present recent results of searches for exotic photons at CDF II. In the
first signature-based search, we search for anomalous production of two photons
with additional energetic objects. The results are consistent with the standard
model expectations. In the second analysis, we present a signature-based search
for anomalous production of events containing a photon, two jets, of which at
least one is identified as originating from a $b$ quark, and missing transverse
energy. We find no indications of non-standard model phenomena. Finally, a
search for a fermiophobic Higgs in the diphoton final state is presented. Since
no evidence of a resonance in the diphoton mass spectrum is observed we exclude
this Higgs boson with mass below 106 GeV/$c^2$ at a 95% confidence level.
