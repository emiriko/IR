The LHCb detector covers the forward angular region complementary to the
angular coverage by the general purpose LHC experiments. With the first data,
measurements of inclusive charged particle production and V^0 production will
be performed and compared to particle production models. Focusing on ratios,
such as positives/negatives or lambda-bar/lambda, many systematic effects
cancel and publishable results are expected soon after the turn-on of LHC. The
talk will present the analysis strategies, the physics questions and the
results expected from the first 10^8 minimum bias pp-collisions at a
center-of-mass energy of 10 TeV, which can be recorded within one day of stable
running.
