Six-qubit cluster states built on the simultaneous entanglement of two
photons in three independent degrees of freedom, i.e. polarization and a double
longitudinal momentum, have been recently demonstrated. We present here the
peculiar entanglement properties of the linear cluster state $\LCtilde$ related
to the three degrees of freedom. This state has been adopted to realize various
kinds of Controlled NOT (CNOT) gates, obtaining in all the cases high values of
the gate fidelity. Our results demonstrate that a number of qubits $\leq$10 in
cluster states of two photons entangled in multiple degrees of freedom is
achievable. Furthermore, these states represent a promising approach towards
scalable quantum computation in a medium term time scale. The future
perspectives of a hybrid approach to one-way quantum computing based on
multi-degree of freedom and multi-photon cluster states are also discussed in
the conclusions of this paper.
