We describe pattern formation in ecological systems using a version of the
classical Lotka-Volterra model characterized by a spatial scale which controls
the predator-prey interaction range. Analytical and simulational results show
that patterns can emerge in some regions of the parameters space where the
instability is driven by the range of the interaction. The individual-based
implementation captures realistic ecological features. In fact, spatial
structures emerge in an erratic oscillatory regime which can contemplate
predators' extinction.
