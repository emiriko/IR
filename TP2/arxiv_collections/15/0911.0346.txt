GS 1826-238 is a well-studied X-ray bursting neutron star in a low mass
binary system. Thermal Comptonisation by a hot electron cloud is a widely
accepted mechanism accounting for its high energy emission, while the nature of
most of its soft X-ray output is not completely understood. A further low
energy component is typically needed to model the observed spectra: pure
blackbody and Comptonisation-modified blackbody radiation by a lower
temperature (a few keV) electron plasma were suggested to explain the low
energy data. We studied the steady emission of GS 1826-238 by means of broad
band (X to soft Gamma-rays) measurements obtained by the INTEGRAL observatory
in 2003 and 2006. The newly developed, up-to-date Comptonisation model CompTB
is applied for the first time to study effectively the low-hard state
variability of a low-luminosity neutron star in a low-mass X-ray binary system.
We confirm that the 3-200 keV emission of \GS is characterised by
Comptonisation of soft seed photons by a hot electron plasma. A single spectral
component is sufficient to model the observed spectra. At lower energies, no
direct blackbody emission is observed and there is no need to postulate a low
temperature Compton region. Compared to the 2003 measurements, the plasma
temperature decreased from 20 to 14 keV in 2006, together with the seed photons
temperature. The source intensity was also found to be 30% lower in 2006,
whilst the average recurrence frequency of the X-ray bursts significantly
increased. Possible explanations for this apparent deviation from the typical
limit-cycle behaviour of this burster are discussed.
