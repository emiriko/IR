The nonlocality of the microscopic nucleon-nucleus optical potential is
commonly localized by the Brieva-Rook approximation. The validity of the
localization is tested for the proton+$^{90}$Zr scattering at the incident
energies from 65 MeV to 800 MeV. The localization is valid in the wide
incident-energy range.
