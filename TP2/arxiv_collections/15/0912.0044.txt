We present the latest results for the equation of state and the crossover
transition in 2+1 flavor QCD from the HotQCD Collaboration. Bulk thermodynamic
quantities - energy density, pressure, entropy density, and the speed of sound
- are calculated on lattices with temporal extent $N_t = 8$ in the temperature
range 140 < T < 540 MeV. We utilize two improved staggered fermion actions,
asqtad and p4, with the mass for the two degenerate light quarks chosen to be
$m_{ud} = 0.1 m_s$, corresponding to $m_\pi \approx 220$ MeV for the lightest
pion. We also calculate observables that are sensitive to the chiral and
deconfing transitions - the light and strange quark number susceptibilities,
the chiral condensate, and the renormalized Polyakov loop - finding that
deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration occur in the same narrow
temperature interval.
