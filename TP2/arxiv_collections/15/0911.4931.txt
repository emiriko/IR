We present the status of the description of hadron production in central
nucleus-nucleus collisions within the statistical model . The recent inclusion
of very high-mass resonances and the sigma meson leads to an improved
description of the data, in particular the energy dependence of the K+/pi+
ratio at SPS energies (``the horn''). The connection to the QCD phase diagram
is discussed.
