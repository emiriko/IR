In this paper we report generalized approach to calculate magnetic shielding
factor (MSF) of multi-layer mu metal concentric cylindrical shields for
arbitrary length to radius ratios and different values of magnetic
permeability. We report in this paper the generalized results on the magnetic
shielding factor of multi-layered magnetic shields used in Rb atomic clocks
