We consider a two-dimensional lattice model of equilibrium statistical
mechanics, using nearest neighbor interactions based on the matching conditions
for an aperiodic set of 16 Wang tiles. This model has uncountably many ground
state configurations, all of which are nonperiodic. The question addressed in
this paper is whether nonperiodicity persists at low but positive temperature.
We present arguments, mostly numerical, that this is indeed the case. In
particular, we define an appropriate order parameter, prove that it is
identically zero at high temperatures, and show by Monte Carlo simulation that
it is nonzero at low temperatures.
