Two coupled BECs with a large population imbalance exhibit macroscopic
quantum self-trapping (MQST) if the ratio of interaction energy to tunneling
energy is above a critical value. Here we investigate effect of quantum
fluctuations on MQST. In particular, we analyze the dynamics of a system of two
elongated Bose gases prepared with a large population imbalance, where due to
the quasi one dimensional character of the gas we no longer have true long
range order, and the effect of quantum fluctuations is much more important. We
show that MQST is possible in this system, but even when it is achieved it is
not always dynamically stable. Using this instability one can construct states
with sharply peaked momentum distributions around characteristic momenta
dependent on system parameters. Our other finding is the nonmonotonic
oscillating dependence of the decay rate of the MQST on the length of the
wires. We also address the interesting question of thermalization in this
system and show that it occurs only in sufficiently long wires.
