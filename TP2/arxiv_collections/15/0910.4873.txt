We consider a large N, two-family Calogero and matrix model in the
Hamiltonian, collective-field approach. The Bogomol'nyi limit appears and the
solutions to the coupled Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfeld equations are given by
the static soliton configurations. We find all solutions close to constant and
construct exact one-parameter solutions in the strong-weak dual case. Full
classification of these solutions is presented.
