This paper is concerned with the continuous-time quantum walk on Z, Z^d, and
infinite homogeneous trees. By using the generating function method, we compute
the limit of the average probability distribution for the general isotropic
walk on Z, and for nearest-neighbor walks on Z^d and infinite homogeneous
trees. In addition, we compute the asymptotic approximation for the probability
of the return to zero at time t in all these cases.
