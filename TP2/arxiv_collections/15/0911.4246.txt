The WiggleZ Dark Energy Survey is a survey of 240,000 emission line galaxies
in the distant universe, measured with the AAOmega spectrograph on the 3.9-m
Anglo-Australian Telescope (AAT). The target galaxies are selected using
ultraviolet photometry from the GALEX satellite, with a flux limit of NUV<22.8
mag. The redshift range containing 90% of the galaxies is 0.2<z<1.0. The
primary aim of the survey is to precisely measure the scale of baryon acoustic
oscillations (BAO) imprinted on the spatial distribution of these galaxies at
look-back times of 4-8 Gyrs. Detailed forecasts indicate the survey will
measure the BAO scale to better than 2% and the tangential and radial acoustic
wave scales to approximately 3% and 5%, respectively.
  This paper provides a detailed description of the survey and its design, as
well as the spectroscopic observations, data reduction, and redshift
measurement techniques employed. It also presents an analysis of the properties
of the target galaxies, including emission line diagnostics which show that
they are mostly extreme starburst galaxies, and Hubble Space Telescope images,
which show they contain a high fraction of interacting or distorted systems. In
conjunction with this paper, we make a public data release of data for the
first 100,000 galaxies measured for the project.
