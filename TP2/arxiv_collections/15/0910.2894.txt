We discuss the Surface-Plasmon-Resonance (SPR) technique based on Fourier
-Transform - InfraRed (FTIR) spectrometry. We explore the potential of the
infrared surface plasmon resonance technique for biological studies in aqueous
solutions and compare it to the conventional surface plasmon technique
operating in the visible range. We demonstrate that the sensitivity of the SPR
technique in the infrared range is not lower and in fact is even higher. We
show several examples of applying FTIR-SPR for biological studies: (i)
monitoring D-glucose concentration in solution, and (ii) measuring D-glucose
uptake by erythrocytes in suspension. We emphasize the advantages of infrared
SPR for studying living cell cultures and show how this technique can be used
for characterization of (i) cholesterol penetration into plasma membrane, and
(ii) transferrin-induced clathrin-mediated endocytosis.
