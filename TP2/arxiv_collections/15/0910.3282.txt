Concurrent non-malleability (CNM) is central for cryptographic protocols
running concurrently in environments such as the Internet. In this work, we
formulate CNM in the bare public-key (BPK) model, and show that round-efficient
concurrent non-malleable cryptography with full adaptive input selection can be
established, in general, with bare public-keys (where, in particular, no
trusted assumption is made). Along the way, we clarify the various subtleties
of adaptive concurrent non-malleability in the bare public-key model.
