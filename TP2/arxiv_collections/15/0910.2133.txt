Chirality or the property that distinguishes lefthandedness from
righthandedness is an important aspect of the universe, starting from
neutrinos, which are lefthanded. Fifteen years ago the author had proposed that
life on the earth was formed through a dual process -- several key ingredients
being transported from outer space to the earth by comets or meteorites and
these in turn interacting with compounds already cooked up in the earth's seas.
Several recent observations point to the fact that the amino acids brought out
to the earth by meteorites are lefthanded, as in terrestrial life forms.
Experiments in the laboratory however throw up equal numbers of lefthanded and
righthanded amino acids, what are called racemic mixtures. Not only would the
latest observations endorse this dual mode theory of the origin of life, but on
the other hand it would point to the key trigger for life processes itself.
This is because racemic mixtures are not optically active, unlike the handed or
chiral constituents. It is this activity of harnessing solar radiation and
converting it into chemical energy, and storing this in the sugar bonds, as in
photosynthesis, that characterizes life.
