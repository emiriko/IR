Engineering the photonic density of states (PDOS) using resonant
microcavities or periodic dielectric media gives control over a plethora of
classical and quantum phenomena associated with light. Here, we show that
nanostructured metamaterials with hyperbolic dispersion, possess a broad
bandwidth singularity in the PDOS, an effect not present in any other photonic
system, which allows remarkable control over light-matter interactions. A
spectacular manifestation of this non-resonant PDOS alteration is the broadband
Purcell effect, an enhancement in the spontaneous emission of a light source,
which ultimately leads to a device that can efficiently harness a single photon
from an isolated emitter. Our approach differs from conventional resonant
Purcell effect routes to single photon sources with a limitation in bandwidth,
which places restrictions on the probable use of such methods for practical
device applications, especially at room temperature. The proposed metadevice,
useful for applications from quantum communications to biosensing also opens up
the possibility of using metamaterials to probe the quantum electrodynamic
properties of atoms and artificial atoms such as quantum dots.
