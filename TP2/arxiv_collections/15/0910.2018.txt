We find analytical solution of pair of stochastic equations with arbitrary
forces and multiplicative L\'evy noises in a steady-state nonequilibrium case.
This solution shows that L\'evy flights suppress always a quasi-periodical
motion related to the limit cycle. We prove that difference between stochastic
systems driven by L\'evy and Gaussian noises is that the L\'evy variation
$\Delta L\sim(\Delta t)^{1/\alpha}$ with the exponent $\alpha<2$ is much less
than the Gaussian one $\Delta W\sim(\Delta t)^{1/2}$ in the $\Delta t\to 0$
limit. Moreover, this difference is shown to remove the problem of the calculus
choice because related addition to the physical force is of order $(\Delta
t)^{2/\alpha}\ll\Delta t$.
