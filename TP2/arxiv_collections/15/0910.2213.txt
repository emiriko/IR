A marvelous exposition on chaos is the book The Essence of Chaos by Dr.
Edward N. Lorenz. In this book Dr. Lorenz, famous for his butterfly icon of
chaos, gives a detailed description of a new and realistic model of chaos; the
sliding of a board (a toboggan to those that live in snowy climes) and a sled
down a "bumpy" hill (moguls to the snow aficionados). His text shows numerous
figures which were calculated by him and this reviewer has formulated the model
using Mathematica. This report is an update and expansion from previous arXiv
publication (0910.2213).
