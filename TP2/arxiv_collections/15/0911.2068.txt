The near-side ridge observed in A+A collisions at RHIC has been described as
arising from the radial flow of Glasma flux tubes formed at very early times in
the collisions. We investigate the viability of this scenario by performing a
non-perturbative numerical computation of double inclusive gluon production in
the Glasma. Our results support the conjecture that the range of transverse
color screening of correlations determining the size of the flux tubes is a
semi-hard scale, albeit with non-trivial structure. We discuss our results in
the context of ridge correlations in the RHIC heavy ion experiments.
