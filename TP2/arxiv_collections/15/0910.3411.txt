The problem of description of the evolution of the microscopic phase density
and its generalizations is discussed. With this purpose, the sequence of
marginal microscopic phase densities is introduced, and the appropriate BBGKY
hierarchy for these microscopic distributions and their average values is
formulated. The microscopic derivation of the generalized evolution equation
for average value of the microscopic phase density is given and the
non-Markovian generalization of the Fokker-Planck collision integral is
deduced.
