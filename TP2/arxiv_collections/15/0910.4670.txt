The uncertainty principle places a fundamental limit on the accuracy with
which we can measure conjugate physical quantities. However, the fluctuations
of these variables can be assessed in terms of different estimators. We propose
a new angular performance that allows for tighter uncertainty relations for
angle and angular momentum. The differences with previous bounds can be
significant for particular states and indeed may be amenable to experimental
measurement with the present technology.
