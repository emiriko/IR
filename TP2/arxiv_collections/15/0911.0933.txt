This agile small "book" (in Italian) is an introduction to the life and work
of Ettore Majorana, the brightest Italian theoretical physicist of the XX
century, regarded by Enrico Fermi as the best theoretician of his time in the
world.
  It consists of ten smooth chapters, only few of them being moderately
technical, and of three Appendices: (i) about his inaugural lecture on physics
at the University of Naples; (ii) about some notes of his, on the role of the
statistical laws in physics and in the social sciences; and (iii) with a
recapitulatory biographic outline.
  The present material is mainly taken from our previous book "Il Caso
Majorana: Epistolario, Documenti, Testimonianze", first published (1987, 1991)
by Mondadori, Milan, and recently (2000, 2002, 2008) published by Di Renzo
Editore, Rome. That book presented practically all the serious documents
existing on Majorana's life & work [indeed, almost all the biographical
documents have been discovered or collected, during a few decades, by the
present author, who was the first to publish them]. Actually, we might address
to such a book (c/o www.direnzo.it, "Arcobaleno" series) all the readers
interested in more and deeper information.
