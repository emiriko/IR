An unspecified strong dynamics may give rise to composite vectors
sufficiently light that their interactions, among themselves or with the
electroweak gauge bosons, be approximately described by an effective Lagrangian
invariant under $SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R/ SU(2)_{L+R}$. We study the production
at the LHC of two such states by vector boson fusion or by the Drell--Yan
process in this general framework and we compare it with the case of gauge
vectors from a $SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R\times SU(2)^N$ gauge model spontaneously
broken to the diagonal SU(2) subgroup by a generic $\sigma$-model. Special
attention is payed to the asymptotic behaviour of the different amplitudes in
both cases. The expected rates of multi-lepton events from the decay of the
composite vectors are also given. A thorough phenomenological analysis and the
evaluation of the backgrounds to such signals, aiming at assessing the
visibility of composite-vector pairs at the LHC, is instead deferred to future
work.
