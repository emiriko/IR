We present a closed system of coupled first order differential equations
governing the secular linear momentum loss of a compact binary due to emitted
gravitational waves, with the leading order relativistic and spin-orbit
perturbations included. In order to close the system, the secular evolution
equations of the linear momentum derived from the dissipative dynamics are
supplemented with the secular evolutions of the coupled angular variables, as
derived from the conservative dynamics.
