We predict that quantized mechanical motion can be detected by embedding a
mechanical resonator into a quantum SQUID. If the system is tuned to the regime
when a plasma frequency of the SQUID matches the resonator frequency, the
doubly-degenerate quantum level of the system is split by the coupling between
the SQUID and the resonator. Observation of an avoided crossing as the function
of external flux would be an unambiguous evidence of quantum nature of
mechanical motion. We also investigate the conditions maximizing the level
splitting.
