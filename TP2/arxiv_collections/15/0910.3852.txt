I comment critically on the use and misuse of the theory of vacuum,
pseudoparticles and pseudotensors. The mathematical and phenomenological
arguments against the Higgs mechanism and the inflationary scenario are
presented. I conclude with a proposal on how to mathematically improve our
understanding of fundamental interactions, basing it on the theory of
noncontractible space. The nature of the force of gravity appears crucial in my
reasoning.
