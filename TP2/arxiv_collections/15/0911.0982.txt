The effect of the strong intersite Coulomb correlations on the formation of
the electron structure of the t-V-model has been studied. A qualitatively new
result has been obtained which consists in the occurrence of a split-off band
of the Fermi states. The spectral intensity of this band increases with the
enhancement of a doping level and is determined by the mean-square fluctuation
of the occupation numbers. This leads to the qualitative change in the
structure of the electron density of states.
