We study the forward-backward and the CP-violating asymmetries (both
time-independent and time-dependent) in rare semileptonic $B_d\to\rho^0
l^+l^-$, $B_s\to\phi l^+l^-$, and radiative leptonic $B_{d,s}\to \gamma l^+l^-$
decays and investigate the sensitivity of these asymmetries to the extensions
of the Standard model.
