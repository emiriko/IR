We develop the "triangulated" version of loop quantum cosmology, recently
introduced in the literature. We focus on the "dipole" cosmology, where space
is a three-sphere and the triangulation is formed by two tetrahedra. We show
that the discrete fiducial connection has a simple and appealing geometrical
interpretation and we correct the ansatz on the relation between the model
variables and the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker scale factor. The modified ansatz
leads to the convergence of the Hamiltonian constraint to the continuum one. We
then ask which degrees of freedom are captured by this model. We show that the
model is rich enough to describe the (anisotropic) Bianchi IX Universe, and
give the explicit relation between the Bianchi IX variables and the variables
of the model. We discuss the possibility of using this path in order to define
the quantization of the Bianchi IX Universe. The model contains more degrees of
freedom than Bianchi IX, and therefore captures some inhomogeneous degrees of
freedom as well. Inhomogeneous degrees of freedom can be expanded in
representations of the SU(2) Bianchi IX isometry group, and the dipole model
captures the lowest integer representation of these, connected to
hyper-spherical harmonic of angular momentum j=1.
