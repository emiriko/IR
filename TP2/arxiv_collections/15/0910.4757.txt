We demonstrate second harmonic generation in photonic crystal nanocavities
fabricated in the semiconductor gallium phosphide. We observe second harmonic
radiation at 750 nm with input powers of only nanowatts coupled to the cavity
and conversion efficiency $P_{\rm out}/P_{\rm in, coupled}^2 = 430%/{\rm W}$.
The large electronic band gap of GaP minimizes absorption loss, allowing
efficient conversion. Our results are promising for integrated, low-power light
sources and on-chip reduction of input power in other nonlinear processes.
