Biologically inspired computing is an area of computer science which uses the
advantageous properties of biological systems. It is the amalgamation of
computational intelligence and collective intelligence. Biologically inspired
mechanisms have already proved successful in achieving major advances in a wide
range of problems in computing and communication systems. The consortium of
bio-inspired computing are artificial neural networks, evolutionary algorithms,
swarm intelligence, artificial immune systems, fractal geometry, DNA computing
and quantum computing, etc. This article gives an introduction to swarm
intelligence.
