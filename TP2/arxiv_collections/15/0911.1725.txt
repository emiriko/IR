Any many-body approximation corrected for unphysical repeated collisions in a
given condensation channel is shown to provide the same set of equations as
they appear by using anomalous propagators. The ad-hoc assumption in the latter
theory about non-conservation of particle numbers can be released. In this way
the widespread used anomalous propagator approach is given another physical
interpretation. A generalized Soven equation follows which improves any
approximation in the same way as the coherent potential approximation (CPA)
improves the averaged T-matrix for impurity scattering.
