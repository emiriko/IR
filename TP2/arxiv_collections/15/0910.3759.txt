In this note we relate three topics for arithmetic schemes: a general duality
for \'etale constructible torsion sheaves, an \'etale homology theory, and a
Gersten-Bloch-Ogus-Kato complex. The results in this paper have been used in
other papers of the authors ([JS], [Sa], [SaH] in the list of references).
