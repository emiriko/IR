In addition to the frequency of terms in a document collection, the
distribution of terms plays an important role in determining the relevance of
documents. In this paper, a new approach for representing term positions in
documents is presented. The approach allows an efficient evaluation of
term-positional information at query evaluation time. Three applications are
investigated: a function-based ranking optimization representing a user-defined
document region, a query expansion technique based on overlapping the term
distributions in the top-ranked documents, and cluster analysis of terms in
documents. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
approach.
