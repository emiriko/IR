We propose a framework for inducing strong optomechanical effects in a
suspended carbon nanotube based on deformation potential exciton-phonon
coupling. The excitons are confined using an inhomogeneous axial electric field
which generates optically active quantum dots with a level spacing in the
milli-electronvolt range and a characteristic size in the 10-nanometer range. A
transverse field induces a tunable parametric coupling between the quantum dot
and the flexural modes of the nanotube mediated by electron-phonon
interactions. We derive the corresponding excitonic deformation potentials and
show that this interaction enables efficient optical ground-state cooling of
the fundamental mode and could allow us to realise the strong and ultra-strong
coupling regimes of the Jaynes-Cummings and Rabi models.
