We present experimental measurements of branching fraction and longitudinal
polarization fraction in charmless hadronic B decays into vector, axial vector
and tensor final states with the final dataset of \babar . Measurements of such
kind of decays are a powerful tool both to test the Standard Model and search
possible sources of new physics.
