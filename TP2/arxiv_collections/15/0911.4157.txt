We consider the dynamical behavior of a nanomechanical mirror in a
high-quality cavity under the action of a coupling laser and a probe laser. We
demonstrate the existence of the analog of electromagnetically induced
transparency (EIT) in the output field at the probe frequency. Our calculations
show explicitly the origin of EIT-like dips as well as the characteristic
changes in dispersion from anomalous to normal in the range where EIT dips
occur. Remarkably the pump-probe response for the opto mechanical system shares
all the features of the Lambda system as discovered by Harris and
collaborators.
