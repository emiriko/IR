This paper presents an approach for the development of a number theoretic
discrete Hilbert transform. The forward transformation has been applied by
taking the odd reciprocals that occur in the DHT matrix with respect to a power
of 2. Specifically, the expression for a 16-point transform is provided and
results of a few representative signals are provided. The inverse transform is
the inverse of the forward 16-point matrix. But at this time the inverse
transform is not identical to the forward transform and, therefore, our
proposed number theoretic transform must be taken as a provisional result.
