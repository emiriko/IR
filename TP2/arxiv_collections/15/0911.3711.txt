It has been recently proposed that neutrino mass could originate from Yukawa
interactions of leptons with new colored particles. This raises the interesting
possibility of testing mass generation through copious production of those
particles at hadron colliders. A realistic assessment of it however should take
into account how large those interactions could be from available precision
results. In this work we make a systematic analysis to the flavor structure in
Yukawa couplings, provide a convenient parametrization to it, and investigate
the rare radiative and pure leptonic decays of the muon and tau leptons. For
general values of parameters the muon decays set stringent constraints on the
couplings, and all rare tau decays are far below the current experimental
sensitivity. However, there is room in parameter space in which the muon decays
could be significantly suppressed by destructive interference between colored
particles without generically reducing the couplings themselves. This is also
the region of parameters that is relevant to collider physics. We show that for
this part of parameter space some tau decays can reach or are close to the
current level of precision.
