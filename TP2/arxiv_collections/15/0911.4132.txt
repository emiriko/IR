The sneutrino is a viable candidate for the NLSP in SUSY spectra with
gravitino LSP. In this work we study the collider implications of this
possibility. In particular, we investigate whether the LHC can distinguish it
(at least, in some cases) from alternative spectra, such as those with a
neutralino LSP. We show that there exists a complete family of experimentally
allowed and theoretically motivated spectra with sneutrino NLSP, which exhibit
very distinctive multilepton signals that are difficult to fake within the
MSSM. We study these signals in detail, including the techniques necessary to
find them. We demonstrate our analysis approach on simulations incorporating
backgrounds.
