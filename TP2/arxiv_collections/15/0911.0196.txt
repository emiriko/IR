We calculate the second, fourth and sixth order quark number fluctuations in
the deconfined phase of 2+1 flavor QCD using lattices with temporal extent
Nt=4, 6, 8 and 12. We consider light, strange and charm quarks. We use p4
action for valence quarks and gauge configurations generated with p4 action
with physical value of the strange quark mass and light quark mass mq=0.1ms
generated by the RBC-Bielefeld collaboration. We observe that for all quark
masses the quark number fluctuations rapidly get close to the corresponding
ideal gas limits. We compare our results to predictions of a quasi-particle
model and resummed high temperature perturbative calculations. We also
investigate correlations among different flavor channels.
