Using the analogy between the description of coherent light propagation in a
medium with Kerr nonlinearity by means of nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation and
that of a dissipationless liquid we propose an optical analogue of the Laval
nozzle. The optical Laval nozzle will allow one to form a transonic flow in
which one can observe and study a very unusual dynamics of classical and
quantum fluctuations including analogue of the Hawking radiation of real black
holes. Theoretical analysis of this dynamics is supported by numerical
calculations and estimates for a possible experimental setup are presented.
