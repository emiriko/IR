$\alpha$-FeSe, a prototype iron-chalcogenide superconductor, shows clear
signatures of a strange incoherent normal state. Motivated thereby, we use
LDA+DMFT to show how strong multi-band correlations generate a low-energy
pseudogap in the normal state, giving an incoherent metal in very good
semi-quantitative agreement with observations. We interpret our results in
terms of $\alpha$-FeSe being close to Mottness. A wide range of anomalous
responses in the "normal" state are consistently explained, lending strong
support for this view. Implications for superconductivity arising from such an
anomalous state are touched upon.
