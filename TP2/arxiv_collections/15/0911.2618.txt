We have investigated the pulse shape evolution of the Crab pulsar emission in
the hard X-ray domain of the electromagnetic spectrum. In particular, we have
studied the alignment of the Crab pulsar phase profiles measured in the hard
X-rays and in other wavebands. To obtain the hard X-ray pulse profiles, we have
used six year (2003-2009, with a total exposure of about 4 Ms) of publicly
available data of the SPI telescope on-board of the INTEGRAL observatory,
folded with the pulsar time solution derived from the Jodrell Bank Crab Pulsar
Monthly Ephemeris. We found that the main pulse in the hard X-ray 20-100 keV
energy band is leading the radio one by $8.18\pm0.46$ milliperiods in phase, or
$275\pm15 \mu s$ in time. Quoted errors represent only statistical
uncertainties.Our systematic error is estimated to be $\sim 40 \mu s$ and is
mainly caused by the radio measurement uncertainties. In hard X-rays, the
average distance between the main pulse and interpulse on the phase plane is
$0.3989\pm0.0009$. To compare our findings in hard X-rays with the soft 2-20
keV X-ray band, we have used data of quasi-simultaneous Crab observations with
the PCA monitor on-board the Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) mission. The
time lag and the pulses separation values measured in the 3-20 keV band are
$0.00933\pm0.00016$ (corresponding to $310\pm6 \mu s$) and $0.40016\pm0.00028$
parts of the cycle, respectively. While the pulse separation values measured in
soft X-rays and hard X-rays agree, the time lags are statistically different.
Additional analysis show that the delay between the radio and X-ray signals
varies with energy in the 2 - 300 keV energy range. We explain such a behaviour
as due to the superposition of two independent components responsible for the
Crab pulsed emission in this energy band.
