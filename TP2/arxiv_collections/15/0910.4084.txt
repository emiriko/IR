Given a computer model of a physical object, it is often quite difficult to
visualize and quantify any global effects on the shape representation caused by
local uncertainty and local errors in the data. This problem is further
amplified when dealing with hierarchical representations containing varying
levels of detail and / or shapes undergoing dynamic deformations. In this
paper, we compute, quantify and visualize the complementary topological and
geometrical features of 3D shape models, namely, the tunnels, pockets and
internal voids of the object. We find that this approach sheds a unique light
on how a model is affected by local uncertainty, errors or modifications and
show how the presence or absence of complementary shape features can be
essential to an object's structural form and function.
