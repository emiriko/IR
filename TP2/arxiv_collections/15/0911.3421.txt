China has become the fifth leading nation in terms of its share of the
world's scientific publications. The citation rate of papers with a Chinese
address for the corresponding author also exhibits exponential growth. More
specifically, China has become a major player in critical technologies like
nanotechnology. Although it is difficult to delineate nanoscience and
nanotechnology, we show that China has recently achieved a position second only
to that of the USA. Funding for R&D has been growing exponentially, but since
1997 even more in terms of business expenditure than in terms of government
expenditure. It seems that the Chinese government has effectively used the
public-sector research potential to boost the knowledge-based economy of the
country. Thus, China may be achieving the ("Lisbon") objectives of the
transition to a knowledge-based economy more broadly and rapidly than its
western counterparts. Because of the sustained increase in Chinese government
funding and the virtually unlimited reservoir of highly-skilled human
resources, one may expect a continuation of this growth pattern in the near
future.
