We consider a supersymmetric hybrid inflation model with two inflaton fields.
The superpotential during inflation is dominated by W=(\kappa S+\kappa' S')M^2,
where S, S' are inflatons carrying the same U(1)_R charge, \kappa, \kappa' are
dimensionless couplings, and M (\sim 10^{15-16} GeV) is a dimensionful
parameter associated with a symmetry breaking scale. One light mass eigenstate
drives inflation, while the other heavier mass eigenstate is stuck to the
origin. The smallness of the lighter inflaton mass for the scalar spectral
index n_s\approx 0.96, which is the center value of WMAP7, can be controlled by
the ratio \kappa'/\kappa through the supergravity corrections. We also discuss
the possibility of the two field inflation and large non-Gaussianity in this
setup.
