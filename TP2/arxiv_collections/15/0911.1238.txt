Charmonium states can decay into pairs of $D$ and $\overline{D}$ mesons if
their masses are above the allowed decay thresholds. In general $c\bar{c}$
states near threshold will also undergo mixing with $D\overline{D}$ molecular
(or tetraquark) states, by creation and annihilation of light quark-antiquark
pairs. The investigation of such effects sheds light on the higher Fock state
contributions to charmonium wavefunctions and on mass shifts, relative to a
scenario where such mixing effects are neglected. A variational approach is
applied to a mixing matrix between operators of both sectors, of $c\bar{c}$ and
of $D\overline{D}$ molecular type. The efficient calculation of several
diagrams appearing in this matrix requires all-to-all propagators, which are
realized by sophisticated stochastic estimator techniques. The runs are
performed on $n_F=2$ $24^3\times 48$ lattice volumes with $m_{\pi} \approx 280$
MeV, using the non-perturbatively improved clover Wilson action, both for
valence and for sea quarks.
