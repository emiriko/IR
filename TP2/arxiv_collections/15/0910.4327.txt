We present an analysis of neutrinos detected with the Baikal neutrino
telescope NT200 for correlations with gamma-ray bursts (GRB). No neutrino
events correlated with GRB were observed. Assuming a Waxman-Bahcall spectrum, a
neutrino flux upper limit of {\bf $E^2 \Phi < 1.1 \times
10^{-6}cm^{-2}s^{-1}sr^{-1}GeV$} was obtained. We also present the Green's
Function fluence limit for this search, which extends two orders of magnitude
beyond the energy range of the Super-Kamiokande limit.
