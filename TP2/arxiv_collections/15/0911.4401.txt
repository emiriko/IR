The effect of electron-lattice interaction is studied for a strongly
correlated electron system described by the two-band Hubbard model. A two-fold
effect of electron-lattice interaction is taken into account: in non-diagonal
terms, it changes the effective bandwidth, whereas in diagonal terms, it shifts
the positions of the bands and the chemical potential. It is shown that this
interaction significantly affects the doping range corresponding to the
electronic phase separation and can even lead to a jump-like transition between
states with different values of strains.
