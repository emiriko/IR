In a paper appearing in this issue of Physics Letters A, Kowalski raises some
critical comments on the experiment [F. Cardone, R. Mignani, A. Petrucci, Phys.
Lett. A 373 (2009) 1956] that we carried out by cavitating a solution of
thorium-228. The experiment highlighted the anomalous decay of thorium, thus
confirming the results previously obtained by Urutskoev et al. by explosion of
titanium foils in solutions. In this Letter, we reply to these comments. We
agree with Kowalski that critical comments are one of the key factors of the
process to improve the quality of experiments and the interpretation of
results. However we do hope that these comments together with the details
provided in the replies will promote further and better experiments which are
certainly worth performing in order to shed a brighter light on this issue, as
Kowalski himself suggests in his comment.
