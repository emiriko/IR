We present a quantized model of harmonically confined dot atom with inherent
damping in the presence of a transverse magnetic field. The model leads to a
non hermitian Hamiltonian in real coordinate. We have analytically studied the
effects that damping has on the Rabi type oscillations of the system. The model
explains the decoherence of Rabi oscillation in a Josephson Junction.
