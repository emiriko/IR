The preceding paper describes a strategy for externally influencing the
course of short-time electronic excitation transfer (EET) in molecular dimers
and observing the process by nonlinear wave-packet interferometry (nl-WPI).
Within a sample of isotropically oriented dimers having a specified internal
geometry, a vibrational mode internal to the acceptor chromophore can be
preferentially driven by electronically nonresonant impulsive stimulated Raman
(or resonant infrared) excitation with a short polarized control pulse. A
subsequent electronically resonant polarized pump then preferentially excites
the donor, and EET ensues. Here we test both the control strategy and its
spectroscopic investigation-with some sacrifice of amplitude-level detail-by
calculating the pump-probe difference signal. That signal is the limiting case
of the control-influenced nl-WPI signal in which the two pulses in the pump
pulse-pair coincide, as do the two pulses in the probe pulse-pair. We present
calculated pump-probe difference signals for (1) a model excitation-transfer
complex in which two equal-energy monomers each support one moderately
Franck-Condon active intramolecular vibration; (2) a simplified model of the
covalent dimer dithia-anthracenophane, representing its EET dynamics following
selective impulsive excitation of the weakly Franck-Condon active anthracene
vibration at 385 cm-1; and (3) a model complex featuring moderate
electronic-vibrational coupling in which the site energy of the acceptor
chromophore is lower than that of the donor.
