We report on a search for the standard model Higgs boson produced in
association with a $W$ or $Z$ boson in $p\bar{p}$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} =
1.96$ TeV recorded by the CDF II experiment at the Tevatron in a data sample
corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.1 fb$^{-1}$. We consider events
which have no identified charged leptons, an imbalance in transverse momentum,
and two or three jets where at least one jet is consistent with originating
from the decay of a $b$ hadron. We find good agreement between data and
predictions. We place 95% confidence level upper limits on the production cross
section for several Higgs boson masses ranging from 110$\gevm$ to 150$\gevm$.
For a mass of 115$\gevm$ the observed (expected) limit is 6.9 (5.6) times the
standard model prediction.
