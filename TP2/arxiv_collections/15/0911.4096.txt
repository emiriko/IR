We investigate the production and possible detection of gravitational waves
stemming from the electroweak phase transition in the early universe in models
of minimal walking technicolor. In particular we discuss the two possible
scenarios in which one has only one electroweak phase transition and the case
in which the technicolor dynamics allows for multiple phase transitions.
