Auger recombination (AR) of the ground biexciton state in quantum-confined
lead salt nanowires (NWs) with a strong coupling between the conduction and the
valence bands is shown to be strongly suppressed, and only excited biexciton
states contribute to Auger decay. The AR rate is predicted to be greatly
reduced when temperature or the NW radius are decreased, and the effect is
explained by decrease in both the population of excited biexciton states and
overlap of phonon-broadened single- and biexciton states. Suppression of AR of
multiexciton states exhibiting strong radiative decay makes obviously lead salt
NWs a subject of special interest for numerous lasing applications.
