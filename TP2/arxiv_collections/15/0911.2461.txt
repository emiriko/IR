Using Coulomb drag as a probe, we explore the excitonic phase transition in
quantum Hall bilayers at nu=1 as a function of Zeeman energy, E_Z. The critical
layer separation d/l for exciton condensation initially increases rapidly with
E_Z, but then reaches a maximum and begins a gentle decline. At high E_Z, where
both the excitonic phase at small d/l and the compressible phase at large d/l
are fully spin polarized, we find that the width of the transition, as a
function of d/l, is much larger than at small E_Z and persists in the limit of
zero temperature. We discuss these results in the context of two models in
which the system contains a mixture of the two fluids.
