We investigate the Casimir pressure between two parallel plates made of
magnetic materials at nonzero temperature. It is shown that for real
magnetodielectric materials only the magnetic properties of ferromagnets can
influence the Casimir pressure. This influence is accomplished through the
contribution of the zero-frequency term of the Lifshitz formula. The
possibility of the Casimir repulsion through the vacuum gap is analyzed
depending on the model used for the description of the dielectric properties of
the metal plates.
