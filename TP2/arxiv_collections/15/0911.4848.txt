We combine Maxwell's equations with Eulers's equation, related to a velocity
field of an immaterial fluid, where the density of mass is replaced by a charge
density. We come out with a differential system able to describe a relevant
quantity of electromagnetic phenomena, ranging from classical dipole waves to
solitary wave-packets with compact support. The clue is the construction of an
energy tensor summing up both the electromagnetic stress and a suitable mass
tensor. With this right-hand side, explicit solutions of the full Einstein's
equation are computed for a wide class of wave phenomena. Since our
electromagnetic waves may behave and interact exactly as a material fluid, they
can create vortex structures. We then explicitly analyze some vortex ring
configurations and examine the possibility to build a model for the electron.
