We prove rigidity and vanishing theorems for several holomorphic Euler
characteristics on complex contact manifolds admitting holomorphic circle
actions preserving the contact structure. Such vanishings are reminiscent of
those of LeBrun and Salamon on Fano contact manifolds but under a symmetry
assumption instead of a curvature condition.
