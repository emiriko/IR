Percolation is one of the most studied processes in statistical physics. A
recent paper by Achlioptas et al. [Science 323, 1453 (2009)] has shown that the
percolation transition, which is usually continuous, becomes discontinuous
("explosive") if links are added to the system according to special cooperative
rules (Achlioptas processes). In this paper we present a detailed numerical
analysis of Achlioptas processes with product rule on various systems,
including lattices, random networks a' la Erdoes-Renyi and scale-free networks.
In all cases we recover the explosive transition by Achlioptas et al.. However,
the explosive percolation transition is kind of hybrid as, despite the
discontinuity of the order parameter at the threshold, one observes traces of
analytical behavior, like power law distributions of cluster sizes. In
particular, for scale-free networks with degree exponent lambda<3, all relevant
percolation variables display power law scaling, just as in continuous
second-order phase transitions.
