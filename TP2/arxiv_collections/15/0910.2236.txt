We discuss the application of the adiabatic perturbation theory to analyze
the dynamics in various systems in the limit of slow parametric changes of the
Hamiltonian. We first consider a two-level system and give an elementary
derivation of the asymptotics of the transition probability when the tuning
parameter slowly changes in the finite range. Then we apply this perturbation
theory to many-particle systems with low energy spectrum characterized by
quasiparticle excitations. Within this approach we derive the scaling of
various quantities such as the density of generated defects, entropy and
energy. We discuss the applications of this approach to a specific situation
where the system crosses a quantum critical point. We also show the connection
between adiabatic and sudden quenches near a quantum phase transitions and
discuss the effects of quasiparticle statistics on slow and sudden quenches at
finite temperatures.
