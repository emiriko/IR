Genome-wide association studies generate very large datasets that require
scalable analysis algorithms. In this report we describe the GEDI software
package, which implements efficient algorithms for performing several common
tasks in the analysis of population genotype data, including genotype error
detection and correction, imputation of both randomly missing and untyped
genotypes, and genotype phasing. Experimental results show that GEDI achieves
high accuracy with a runtime scaling linearly with the number of markers and
samples. The open source C++ code of GEDI, released under the GNU General
