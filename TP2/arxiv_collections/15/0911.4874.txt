The paper describes an image processing for a non-photorealistic rendering.
The algorithm is based on a random choice of a set of pixels from those ot the
original image and substitution of them with colour spots. An iterative
procedure is applied to cover, at a desired level, the canvas. The resulting
effect mimics the impressionist painting and Pointillism.
