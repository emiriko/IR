We have measured local and non-local conductance of mesoscopic
normal-metal/superconductor hybrid structures fabricated by e-beam lithography
and shadow evaporation. The sample geometry consists of a superconducting
aluminum bar with two normal-metal wires forming tunnel contacts to the
aluminum at distances of the order of the superconducting coherence length. We
observe subgap anomalies in both local and non-local conductance that quickly
decay with magnetic field and temperature. For the non-local conductance both
positive and negative signs are found as a function of bias conditions,
indicating at a competition of crossed Andreev reflection and elastic
cotunneling. Our data suggest that the signals are caused by a phase-coherent
enhancement of transport rather than dynamical Coulomb blockade.
