Antiparticles may be interpreted as ordinary particles travelling backwards
in time and the two descriptions are considered equivalent, at least in special
relativity and relativistic quantum mechanics. It is suggested that, vice
versa, the discovery of antimatter should be the confirmation that our world is
"endowed" with two opposite time-arrows and such a description could be more
useful and convenient from the point of view of the understanding of the world
itself, at least for a simple reason: whenever phenomena are observed from a
"reference frame" from which the world appears more symmetric, it is easier to
understand the physical laws which regulate it. If, in the future, it is
possible to discover how a macroscopic system of antimatter behaves, it will be
also possible to confirm (or not) the "reality" of the two arrows of time.
