In contrast to alternative values, the quantum of area $\Delta A = 8\pi
l_P^{2}$ does not follow from the usual statistical interpretation of black
hole entropy; on the contrary, a statistical interpretation follows from it.
This interpretation is based on the two concepts: nonadditivity of black hole
entropy and Landau quantization. Using nonadditivity a microcanonical
distribution for a black hole is found and it is shown that the statistical
weight of black hole should be proportional to its area. By analogy with
conventional Landau quantization, it is shown that quantization of black hole
is nothing but the Landau quantization. The Landau levels of black hole and
their degeneracy are found. The degree of degeneracy is equal to the number of
ways to distribute a patch of area $8\pi l_P^{2}$ over the horizon. Taking into
account these results, it is argued that the black hole entropy should be of
the form $S_{bh} =2\pi\cdot\Delta\Gamma $, where the number of microstates is
$\Delta\Gamma = A/8\pi l_P^{2}$. The nature of the degrees of freedom
responsible for black hole entropy is elucidated. The applications of the new
interpretation are presented. The effect of noncommuting coordinates is
discussed.
