The capabilities of the ATLAS, CMS and LHCb detectors to reconstruct jets at
forward rapidities (|\eta|> 3) in p-p collisions at the CERN Large Hadron
Collider are reviewed. The QCD and Higgs physics motivations for such
measurements are summarised. Details are given on studies that provide
information on the parton structure and evolution at small values of fractional
momenta in the proton.
