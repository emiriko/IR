We used VLT/VIMOS images in the V band to obtain light curves of extrasolar
planetary transits OGLE-TR-111 and OGLE-TR-113, and candidate planetary
transits: OGLE-TR-82, OGLE-TR-86, OGLE-TR-91, OGLE-TR-106, OGLE-TR-109,
OGLE-TR-110, OGLE-TR-159, OGLE-TR-167, OGLE-TR-170, OGLE-TR-171. Using
difference imaging photometry, we were able to achieve millimagnitude errors in
the individual data points. We present the analysis of the data and the light
curves, by measuring transit amplitudes and ephemerides, and by calculating
geometrical parameters for some of the systems. We observed 9 OGLE objects at
the predicted transit moments. Two other transits were shifted in time by a few
hours. For another seven objects we expected to observe transits during the
VIMOS run, but they were not detected. The stars OGLE-TR-111 and OGLE-TR-113
are probably the only OGLE objects in the observed sample to host planets, with
the other objects being very likely eclipsing binaries or multiple systems. In
this paper we also report on four new transiting candidates which we have found
in the data.
