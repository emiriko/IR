Uncapped InN nanostructures undergo a deleterious natural aging process at
ambient conditions by oxygen incorporation. The phases involved in this process
and their localization is mapped by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)
related techniques. The parent wurtzite InN (InN-w) phase disappears from the
surface and gradually forms a highly textured cubic layer that completely wraps
up a InN-w nucleus which still remains from original single-crystalline quantum
dots. The good reticular relationships between the different crystals generate
low misfit strains and explain the apparent easiness for phase transformations
at room temperature and pressure conditions, but also disable the classical
methods to identify phases and grains from TEM images. The application of the
geometrical phase algorithm in order to form numerical moire mappings, and RGB
multilayered image reconstructions allows to discern among the different phases
and grains formed inside these nanostructures. Samples aged for shorter times
reveal the presence of metastable InN:O zincblende (zb) volumes, which acts as
the intermediate phase between the initial InN-w and the most stable cubic
In2O3 end phase. These cubic phases are highly twinned with a proportion of
50:50 between both orientations. We suggest that the existence of the
intermediate InN:O-zb phase should be seriously considered to understand the
reason of the widely scattered reported fundamental properties of thought to be
InN-w, as its bandgap or superconductivity.
