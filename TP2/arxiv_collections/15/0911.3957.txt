A uniform minimal model of rhodopsin photoisomerization induced by either
coherent laser light or low level incoherent light (e.g. moonlight) is
provided. Realistic timescales for both processes, which differ by ten orders
of magnitude, are obtained. Further, a kinetic scheme involving rates for both
coherent and incoherent light excitation is introduced, placing all timescales
into a uniform framework.
