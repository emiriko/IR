In this paper we generalize N-fold integer programs and two-stage integer
programs with N scenarios to N-fold 4-block decomposable integer programs. We
show that for fixed blocks but variable N, these integer programs are
polynomial-time solvable for any linear objective. Moreover, we present a
polynomial-time computable optimality certificate for the case of fixed blocks,
variable N and any convex separable objective function. We conclude with two
sample applications, stochastic integer programs with second-order dominance
constraints and stochastic integer multi-commodity flows, which (for fixed
blocks) can be solved in polynomial time in the number of scenarios and
commodities and in the binary encoding length of the input data. In the proof
of our main theorem we combine several non-trivial constructions from the
theory of Graver bases. We are confident that our approach paves the way for
further extensions.
