We investigate the validity of using thermal masses in the kinematics of
final states in the decay rate of heavy neutrinos in leptogenesis calculations.
We find that using thermal masses this way is a reasonable approximation, but
corrections arise through quantum statistical distribution functions and
leptonic quasiparticles.
