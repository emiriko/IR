We investigate theoretically the D'yakonov-Perel' spin relaxation time by
solving the eight-band Kane model and Poisson equation self-consistently. Our
results show distinct behavior with the single-band model due to the anomalous
spin-orbit interactions in narrow band-gap semiconductors, and agree well with
the experiment values reported in recent experiment (K. L. Litvinenko, et al.,
New J. Phys. \textbf{8}, 49 (2006)). We find a strong resonant enhancement of
the spin relaxation time appears for spin align along [$1\bar{1}0$] at a
certain electron density at 4 K. This resonant peak is smeared out with
increasing the temperature.
