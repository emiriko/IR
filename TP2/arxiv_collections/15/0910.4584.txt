We determine the solar neutrino fluxes from a global analysis of the solar
and terrestrial neutrino data in the framework of three-neutrino mixing. Using
a Bayesian approach we reconstruct the posterior probability distribution
function for the eight normalization parameters of the solar neutrino fluxes
plus the relevant masses and mixing, with and without imposing the luminosity
constraint. This is done by means of a Markov Chain Monte Carlo employing the
Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. We also describe how these results can be
applied to test the predictions of the Standard Solar Models. Our results show
that, at present, both models with low and high metallicity can describe the
data with good statistical agreement.
