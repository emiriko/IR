Polymerization of C60 molecular crystal under high pressure and high
temperature is simulated by using linear scaling tight binding molecular
dynamics (TBMD) with Graphic Processing Unit (GPU) as a computational
accelerator for matrix-matrix multiplication. Two sets of tight binding
parameters were tested.
