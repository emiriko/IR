This paper reports an investigation on the phase diagram and compressibility
of wolframite-type tungstates by means of x-ray powder diffraction and
absorption in a diamond-anvil cell and ab initio calculations. The diffraction
experiments show that monoclinic wolframite-type MgWO4 suffers at least two
phase transitions, the first one being to a triclinic polymorph with a
structure similar to that of CuWO4 and FeMoO4-II. The onset of each transition
is detected at 17.1 and 31 GPa. In ZnWO4 the onset of the monoclinic-triclinic
transition has been also found at 15.1 GPa. These findings are supported by
density-functional theory calculations, which predict the occurrence of
additional transitions upon further compression. Calculations have been also
performed for wolframite-type MnWO4, which is found to have an
antiferromagnetic configuration. In addition, x-ray absorption and diffraction
experiments as well as calculations reveal details of the local-atomic
compression in the studied compounds. In particular, below the transition
pressure the ZnO6 and equivalent polyhedra tend to become more regular, whereas
the WO6 octahedra remain almost unchanged. Fitting the pressure-volume data we
obtained the equation of state for the low-pressure phase of MgWO4 and ZnWO4.
These and previous results on MnWO4 and CdWO4 are compared with the
calculations, being the compressibility of wolframite-type tungstates
systematically discussed. Finally Raman spectroscopy measurements and lattice
dynamics calculations are presented for MgWO4.
