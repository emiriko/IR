In this paper, in the framework of NRQCD we study the light hadron (LH)
decays of the spin-triplet (S=1) D-wave heavy quarkonia. The short distance
coefficients of all Fock states in the $^3D_J(J=1,2,3)$ quarkonia including
D-wave color-singlet, P-wave color-octet and S-wave color-singlet and
color-octet are calculated perturbatively at $\alpha_{s}^3$ order. The operator
evolution equations of the four-fermion operators are also derived and are used
to estimate the numerical values of the long distance matrix elements. We find
that for the $c\bar{c}$ system, the LH decay widths of $\psi(1^3D_J)$ predicted
by NRQCD is about $2\sim3$ times larger than the phenomenological potential
model results, while for the $b\bar{b}$ system the two theoretical estimations
of $\Gamma(\Upsilon(1^3D_J)\to LH)$ are in coincidence with each other. Our
predictions for $\psi(1^3D_J)$ LH decay widths are $\Gamma(\psi(1^3D_J)\to
LH)=(0.43,0.05,0.17)$MeV for J=1,2,3; and for $\Upsilon(1^3D_J)$,
$\Gamma(\Upsilon(1^3D_J)\to LH)=(6.91,0.75,2.75)$KeV for J=1,2,3.
