For a robust interpretation of upcoming observations from Planck and LHC
experiments it is imperative to understand how the inflationary dynamics of a
non-minimally coupled Higgs scalar field may affect the degeneracy of the
inflationary observables. We constrain the inflationary observables and the
Higgs boson mass during observable inflation by fitting the the Higgs
inflationary potential directly to WMAP5+BAO+SN data. We obtain a Higgs mass a
value of 143.73+14.97/-6.31 GeV at 95% CL for the central value of top quark
mass. We also show that the inflation driven by a non-minimally coupled scalar
field leads to significant changes of the inflationary parameters when compared
with the similar constraints from the standard inflation.
