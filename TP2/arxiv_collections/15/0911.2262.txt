For a beta-Jacobi ensemble determined by parameters a_1, a_2 and n, under the
restriction that the three parameters go to infinity with n and a_1 being of
small orders of a_2, we obtain both the bulk and the edge scaling limits. In
particular, we derive the asymptotic distributions for the largest and the
smallest eigenvalues, the Central Limit Theorems of the eigenvalues, and the
limiting distributions of the empirical distributions of the eigenvalues.
