NGC 205 is a dwarf elliptical galaxy which shows many features that are more
typical of disk galaxies, and our recent study of the central stellar
population has added another peculiarity. In the central regions, star
formation has been on-going continuously for a few hundred Myr, until ca. 20
Myr ago, perhaps fed by gas funneled to the center in the course of
morphological transformation. In this contribution we use a deep, wide-field
image obtained at a scale of 2"/px to show that subtle structures can be
detected in and near the body of the dwarf galaxy. The southern tidal tail can
be mapped out to unprecedented distances from the center, and we suggest that
the northern tail is partially hidden behind a very extended dust lane, or
ring, belonging to M31. A spiral pattern emerges across the body of the galaxy,
but it might be explained by another M31 dust filament.
