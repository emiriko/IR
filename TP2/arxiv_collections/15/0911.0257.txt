The basic optimal transportation problem consists in finding the most
effective way of moving masses from one location to another, while minimizing
the transportation cost. Such concept has been found to be useful to understand
various mathematical, economical, and control theory phenomena, such as
Witsenhausen's counterexam-ple in stochastic control theory, principal-agent
problem in microeco- nomic theory, location and planning problems, etc. In this
work, we focus on mobile association problems: the determina-tion of the cells
corresponding to each base station, i.e., the locations at which intelligent
mobile terminals prefer to connect to a given base station rather than to
others. This work combines game theory and optimal transport theory to
characterize the solution based on fluid approximations. We characterize the
optimal solution from both the global network and the mobile user points of
view.
