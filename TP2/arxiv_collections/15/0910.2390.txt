We consider a one-dimensional (1D) structure where non-interacting spin-$s$
scattering centers, such as quantum impurities or multi-level atoms, are
embedded at given positions. We show that the injection into the structure of
unpolarized flying qubits, such as electrons or photons, along with {path}
detection suffice to accomplish spin-state teleportation between two centers
via a third ancillary one. {No action over the internal quantum state of both
the spin-$s$ particles and the flying qubits is required. The protocol enables
the transfer of quantum information between well-seperated static entities in
nanostructures by exploiting a very low-control mechanism, namely scattering.
