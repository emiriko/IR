Squared cobalt thin layers of different thickness and width were investigated
by numerical simulations. Using zero-valued externally applied magnetic field
(geometry driven regime) and different initial conditions the magnetization
dynamics were examined. The wavelet-based spectral analysis was applied.
Transient states of different types were identified.
