We present results for $B_K$ calculated using HYP-smeared improved staggered
fermions on the MILC asqtad lattices. In this report, the data is analyzed
using the results of SU(2) staggered chiral perturbation theory (SChPT). We
outline the derivation of the NLO SU(2) SChPT result, explain our fitting
procedure, and outline how we estimate systematic errors. We also show the
light sea-quark mass and lattice spacing dependence for both SU(2) and
SU(3)-based analyses. Our preliminary result from the SU(2) analysis is
$B_K(\text{NDR}, \mu = 2 \text{GeV}) = 0.512 \pm 0.014 \pm 0.034$ and
$\hat{B}_K = B_K(\text{RGI})= 0.701 \pm 0.019 \pm 0.047$. This is somewhat more
accurate than our result from the SU(3) analysis. It is consistent with results
obtained using valence domain-wall fermions
