This paper presents the online AnAmeter framework that helps characterize the
different types of adaptations a system features by helping the evaluator fill
in a simple form. The provided information is then processed to obtain a
quantitative evaluation of three parameters called global, semi-global and
local adaptation degrees. By characterizing and quantifying adaptation,
AnAmeter provides the first steps towards the evaluation of the quality of a
system's adaptation. AnAmeter is an open tool available as freeware on the web
and has been applied to a selection of well known systems. To build this
evaluation grid we also collected a number of systems that cover the full range
of adaptation types.
