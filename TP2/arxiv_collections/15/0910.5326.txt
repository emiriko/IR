After summarizing the basic points of the general QCD parametrization (GP) we
discuss systematically its applications to the properties of the lowest
families of baryons and mesons. We show how the hierarchy of the parameters in
the GP emerges clearly in the properties of hadrons. Among other things, it
explains why simple models can work reasonably well and clarifies the
relationship between current and constituent quarks. More details on the hadron
properties discussed with the GP appear from the list of secrions at the
beginning of the paper.
