We present a new observational method to type the explosions of young
supernova remnants (SNRs). By measuring the morphology of the Chandra X-ray
line emission in seventeen Galactic and Large Magellanic Cloud SNRs with a
multipole expansion analysis (using power ratios), we find that the
core-collapse SNRs are statistically more asymmetric than the Type Ia SNRs. We
show that the two classes of supernovae can be separated naturally using this
technique because X-ray line morphologies reflect the distinct explosion
mechanisms and structure of the circumstellar material. These findings are
consistent with recent spectropolarimetry results showing that core-collapse
SNe are intrinsically more asymmetric.
