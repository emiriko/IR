The QCD phenomenology of prompt photon production from e-p to p-p/p-pbar and
A-A collisions is reviewed. The use of prompt photons as a probe of (i) parton
distribution functions (in a proton or in nuclei) as well as (ii) fragmentation
functions (into photons and hadrons) and their medium-modifications is
highlighted.
