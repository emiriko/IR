We proposed social synergetics and the four basic theorems, in which theorem
of perfect correlation on humanity is researched mathematically. Generally, we
discuss the four variables and the eight aspects in social physics. We search
social thermodynamics and the five fundamental laws of social complex systems.
Then we research different relations among social elements and applications of
the nonlinear sociology, for example, for the economic systems. Finally, we
discuss the evolutional equation of system and the educational equation.
