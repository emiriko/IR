The observed spectral variation of HD 50138 has led different authors to
classify it in a very wide range of spectral types and luminosity classes (from
B5 to A0 and III to Ia) and at different evolutionary stages as either HAeBe
star or classical Be. Aims: Based on new high-resolution optical spectroscopic
data from 1999 and 2007 associated to a photometric analysis, the aim of this
work is to provide a deep spectroscopic description and a new set of parameters
for this unclassified southern B[e] star and its interstellar extinction.
Methods: From our high-resolution optical spectroscopic data separated by 8
years, we perform a detailed spectral description, presenting the variations
seen and discussing their possible origin. We derive the interstellar
extinction to HD 50138 by taking the influences of the circumstellar matter in
the form of dust and an ionized disk into account. Based on photometric data
from the literature and the new Hipparcos distance, we obtain a revised set of
parameters for HD 50138. Results: Because of the spectral changes, we
tentatively suggest that a new shell phase could have taken place prior to our
observations in 2007. We find a color excess value of E(B-V) = 0.08 mag, and
from the photometric analysis, we suggest that HD 50138 is a B6-7 III-V star. A
discussion of the different evolutionary scenarios is also provided.
