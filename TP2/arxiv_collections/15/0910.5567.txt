A detailed chemical composition analysis based on a high-resolution
(R=35,000) CCD spectrum is presented for a newly discovered post-AGB star in
the globular cluster M79 for the first time. The elemental abundance results of
M79 Post-AGB star are found to be [C/Fe]=-0.7, [O/Fe]=+1.4, [alpha-
process/Fe]=0.5, and [s-process/Fe]=-0.1. The surprising result is that the
iron abundance of the star is apparently about 0.6 dex less than that of the
cluster's red giants as reported by published studies including a recent
high-resolution spectroscopic analysis by Carretta and colleagues.
