A feasibility study was carried out at the Astronomical Observatory of the
Autonomous Region of the Aosta Valley demonstrating that it is a well-poised
site to conduct an upcoming observing campaign aimed at detecting small-size
(R<R_Neptune) transiting planets around nearby cool M dwarf stars. Three known
transiting planet systems were monitored from May to August 2009 with a 25 cm
f/3.8 Maksutov telescope. We reached seeing-independent, best-case photometric
RMS less than 0.003 mag for stars with V<13, with a median RMS of 0.006 mag for
the whole observing period.
