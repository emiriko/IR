The effect of a step wise change in the pillar density on the dynamics of
droplets is investigated via three-dimensional lattice Boltzmann simulations.
For the same pillar density gradient but different pillar arrangements, both
motion over the gradient zone as well as complete arrest are observed. In the
moving case, the droplet velocity scales approximately linearly with the
texture gradient. A simple model is provided reproducing the observed linear
behavior. The model also predicts a linear dependence of droplet velocity on
surface tension. This prediction is clearly confirmed via our computer
simulations for a wide range of surface tensions.
