In this work we present a thorough analysis of the phase transitions that
occur in a ferromagnetic 2D Ising model, with only nearest-neighbors
interactions, in the framework of the Tsallis nonextensive statistics. We
performed Monte Carlo simulations on square lattices with linear sizes L
ranging from 32 up to 512. The statistical weight of the Metropolis algorithm
was changed according to the nonextensive statistics. Discontinuities in the
m(T) curve are observed for $q\leq 0.5$. However, we have verified only one
peak on the energy histograms at the critical temperatures, indicating the
occurrence of continuous phase transitions. For the $0.5<q\leq 1.0$ regime, we
have found continuous phase transitions between the ordered and the disordered
phases, and determined the critical exponents via finite-size scaling. We
verified that the critical exponents $\alpha $, $\beta $ and $\gamma $ depend
on the entropic index $q$ in the range $0.5<q\leq 1.0$ in the form $\alpha
(q)=(10 q^{2}-33 q+23)/20$, $\beta (q)=(2 q-1)/8$ and $\gamma
(q)=(q^{2}-q+7)/4$. On the other hand, the critical exponent $\nu $ does not
depend on $q$. This suggests a violation of the scaling relations $2 \beta
+\gamma =d \nu $ and $\alpha +2 \beta +\gamma =2$ and a nonuniversality of the
critical exponents along the ferro-paramagnetic frontier.
