Earlier Chicone, Latushkin and Montgomery-Smith [Comm Math Phys (1997)] have
shown that a fast dynamo in compact two-dimensional manifold can be supported
as long as its Riemannian curvature be negative. Recently Klebanov and
Maldacena [Phys Today (2008)] showed that a similar flat spacetime embedding of
a 2D negative Riemannian hyperbolic embedding in 2+1-D space-time, is achieved
by a coordinate transformation. This embedding is used here to obtain a flat
spacetime embedding of a slow dynamo in Riemannian 2D compact manifold of
negative constant curvature. In is shown that a slow dynamo appears in anti-de
Sitter space (AdS) Lorentz tori. This is in agreement with Bassett et al [Phys
Rev D (2001)] cosmic dynamo where suppression of resonance by universe
expansion slow dynamo action in comparison to preheating phases. Other example
of flat embeddings, which keeps some resamblance with AdS slow dynamo, is given
by the embedding of Moebius strip [Shukurov, Stepanov, Sokoloff, PRE (2008)] in
the laboratory.
