We explore the opportunity to look for large extra dimensions in the early
stages of the LHC running. The high-E$_T$ dijet production is analyzed via a
novel kinematic variable when the machine center-of-mass energy varies from 7
TeV through 10 TeV to 14 TeV and the accumulated data range from 0.5 to 8
fb$^{-1}$. The estimations of the reach in the effective scale $M_S$ for
different numbers of large extra dimensions are presented.
