We study a modified version of the stochastic
susceptible-infected-refractory-susceptible (SIRS) model by employing a
nonlinear (exponential) reinforcement in the contagion rate and no diffusion.
We run simulations for complete and random graphs as well as d-dimensional
hypercubic lattices (for d=3,2,1). For weak nonlinearity, a continuous
nonequilibrium phase transition between an absorbing and an active phase is
obtained, such as in the usual stochastic SIRS model [Joo and Lebowitz, Phys.
Rev. E 70, 036114 (2004)]. However, for strong nonlinearity, the nonequilibrium
transition between the two phases can be discontinuous for d>=2, which is
confirmed by well-characterized hysteresis cycles and bistability. Analytical
mean-field results correctly predict the overall structure of the phase
diagram. Furthermore, contrary to what was observed in a model of phase-coupled
stochastic oscillators with a similar nonlinearity in the coupling [Wood et
al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 96, 145701 (2006)], we did not find a transition to a
stable (partially) synchronized state in our nonlinearly pulse-coupled
excitable elements. For long enough refractory times and high enough
nonlinearity, however, the system can exhibit collective excitability and
unstable stochastic oscillations.
