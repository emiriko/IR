We compare the abundances of various chemical species as derived with 3D
hydrodynamical and classical 1D stellar atmosphere codes in a late-type giant
characterized by T_eff=3640K, log g = 1.0, [M/H] = 0.0. For this particular set
of atmospheric parameters the 3D-1D abundance differences are generally small
for neutral atoms and molecules but they may reach up to 0.3-0.4 dex in case of
ions. The 3D-1D differences generally become increasingly more negative at
higher excitation potentials and are typically largest in the optical
wavelength range. Their sign can be both positive and negative, and depends on
the excitation potential and wavelength of a given spectral line. While our
results obtained with this particular late-type giant model suggest that 1D
stellar atmosphere models may be safe to use with neutral atoms and molecules,
care should be taken if they are exploited with ions.
