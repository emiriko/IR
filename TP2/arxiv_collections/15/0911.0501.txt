Over the recent years, IP and email spoofing gained much importance for
security concerns due to the current changes in manipulating the system
performance in different online environments. Intrusion Detection System (IDS)
has been used to secure these environments for sharing their data over network
and host based IDS approaches. However, the rapid growth of intrusion events
over Internet and local area network become responsible for the distribution of
different threats and vulnerabilities in the computing systems. The current
signature detection approach used by IDS, detects unclear actions based on
analyzing and describing the action patterns such as time, text, password etc
and has been faced difficulties in updating information, detect unknown novel
attacks, maintenance of an IDS which is necessarily connected with analyzing
and patching of security holes, and the lack of information on user privileges
and attack signature structure. Thus, this paper proposes an EADS (Exception
agent detection system) for securing the header information carried by IP over
online environments. The study mainly concerns with the deployment of new
technique for detecting and eliminating the unknown threats attacks during the
data sharing over online environments.
