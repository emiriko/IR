Within the framework of generalized factorization of higher-twist
contributions to semi-inclusive cross section of deeply inelastic scattering
off a large nucleus, multiple parton scattering leads to an effective
medium-modified fragmentation function and the corresponding medium-modified
DGLAP evolution equations. We extend the study to include gluon multiple
scattering and induced quark-antiquark production via gluon fusion . We
numerically solve these medium-modified DGLAP (mDGLAP) evolution equations and
study the scale ($Q^2$), energy ($E$), length ($L$) and jet transport parameter
($\hat q$) dependence of the modified fragmentation functions for a jet
propagating in a uniform medium with finite length (a "brick" problem). We also
discuss the concept of parton energy loss within such mDGLAP evolution
equations and its connection to the modified fragmentation functions. With a
realistic Wood-Saxon nuclear geometry, we calculate the modified fragmentation
functions and compare to experimental data of DIS off large nuclei. The
extracted jet transport parameter at the center of a large nucleus is found to
be $\hat q_{0}=0.024\pm0.008$ GeV$^{2}$/fm.
