In this paper we prove that assuming Schanuel's conjecture, an exponential
polynomial in one variable over the algebraic numbers has only finitely many
algebraic solutions. This implies a positive answer to Shapiro's conjecture for
exponential polynomials over the algebraic numbers for pseudoexponential fields
as well as for any algebraically closed exponential field satisfying Schanuel's
conjecture.
