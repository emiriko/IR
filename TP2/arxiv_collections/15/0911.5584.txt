We study the impact of cosmic inhomogeneities on the interpretation of SNe
observations. We build an inhomogeneous universe model that can confront
supernova data and yet is reasonably well compatible with the Copernican
Principle. Our model combines a relatively small local void, that gives
apparent acceleration at low redshifts, with a meatball model that gives
sizeable lensing (dimming) at high redshifts. Together these two elements,
which focus on different effects of voids on the data, allow the model to mimic
the concordance model.
