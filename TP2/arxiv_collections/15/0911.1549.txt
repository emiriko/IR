The theory of radiative transfer provides the link between the physical
conditions in an astrophysical object and the observable radiation which it
emits. Thus accurately modelling radiative transfer is often a necessary part
of testing theoretical models by comparison with observations. We describe a
new radiative transfer code which employs Monte Carlo methods for the numerical
simulation of radiation transport in expanding media. We discuss the
application of this code to the calculation of synthetic spectra and light
curves for a Type Ia supernova explosion model and describe the sensitivity of
the results to certain approximations made in the simulations.
