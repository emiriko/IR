The standard covariant differentiation procedure for fields in vector bundles
is generalised so as to be applicable to fields in general nonaffine bundles in
which the fibres may have an arbitrary nonlinear structure. In addition to the
usual requirement that the base space should be flat or endowed with its own
linear connection, and that there should be an ordinary gauge connection on the
bundle, it is necessary to require also that there should be an intrinsic,
bundle-group invariant connection on the fibre space. The procedure is based on
the use of an appropriate primary-field (i.e. section) independent connector
that is constructed in terms of the natural fibre-tangent-vector realisation of
the gauge connection. The application to gauged harmonic mappings will be
described in a following article.
