We prove an existence theorem for the Boltzmann-Fermi-Dirac equation for
integrable collision kernels in possibly bounded domains with specular
reflection at the boundaries, using the characteristic lines of the free
transport. We then obtain that the solution satisfies the local conservations
of mass, momentum and kinetic energy thanks to a dispersion technique.
