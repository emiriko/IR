We analyze the mechanical deformations that are required to create uniform
pseudomagnetic fields in graphene. It is shown that, if a ribbon is bent
in-plane into a circular arc, this can lead to fields exceeding 10T, which is
sufficient for the observation of pseudo-Landau quantization. The arc geometry
is simpler than those suggested previously and, in our opinion, has much better
chances to be realized experimentally soon. The effects of a scalar potential
induced by dilatation in this geometry is shown to be negligible.
