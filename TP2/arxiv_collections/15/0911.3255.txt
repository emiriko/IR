We developed a method to make GEM foils with a spherical geometry. Tests of
this procedure and with the resulting spherical \textsc{gem}s are presented.
Together with a spherical drift electrode, a spherical conversion gap can be
formed. This would eliminate the parallax error for detection of x-rays,
neutrons or UV photons when a gaseous converter is used. This parallax error
limits the spatial resolution at wide scattering angles. The method is
inexpensive and flexible towards possible changes in the design.
  We show advanced plans to make a prototype of an entirely spherical
triple-GEM detector, including a spherical readout structure. This detector
will have a superior position resolution, also at wide angles, and a high rate
capability. A completely spherical gaseous detector has never been made before.
