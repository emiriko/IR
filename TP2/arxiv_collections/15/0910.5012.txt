We present a comprehensive theory of spin transport in a non-degenerate
semiconductor that is in contact with multiple ferromagnetic terminals. The
spin dynamics in the semiconductor is studied during a perturbation of a
general, non-collinear magnetization configuration and a method is shown to
identify the various configurations from current signals. The conventional
Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker description for spin transport across Schottky contacts
is generalized by the use of a non-linearized I-V relation, and it is extended
by taking into account non-coherent transport mechanisms. The theory is used to
analyze a three terminal lateral structure where a significant difference in
the spin accumulation profile is found when comparing the results of this model
with the conventional model.
