Ti/Al multilayer thin films with precise thickness have been deposited using
a combination of dc and rf magnetron sputtering techniques. Cross-sectional
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed unmixed fifteen parallel and
alternate layers of Ti and Al with sharp interfaces, each measuring 27 nm and
15 nm in thickness, respectively. The Ti layer was composed of hcp and fcc
phases while the Al layer was fcc. Both x-ray diffraction (XRD) and selected
area electron diffraction (SAED) analysis confirmed the identity of these
phases. Detection of fcc-Ti in as-deposited the Ti/Al multilayer thin film by
XRD established that the fcc-Ti phase is not an artifact of TEM sample
preparation, as have been envisaged by some of the previous researchers. The
fcc-Ti phase appeared when dual rf guns were used for Ti deposition and the
diffraction peak intensity corresponding to fcc phase increased when the gun
power was raised. A modified equation of state based thermodynamic analysis
confirmed that the formation of hcp phase as opposed to the thermodynamically
stable fcc phase of pure Ti is due to crystallite size reduction and not
impurity driven.
