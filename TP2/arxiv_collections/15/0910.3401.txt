The density fluctuation spectrum in the solar wind reveals a Kolmogorov-like
scaling with a spectral slope of -5/3 in wavenumber space. The energy transfer
process in the magnetized solar wind, characterized typically by MHD
turbulence, over extended length-scales remains an unresolved paradox of modern
turbulence theories, raising the question of how a compressible magnetofluid
exhibits a turbulent spectrum that is characteristic of an incompressible
hydrodynamic fluid. To address these questions, we have undertaken
three-dimensional time dependent numerical simulations of a compressible
magnetohydrodynamic fluid describing super-Alfv\'enic, supersonic and strongly
magnetized plasma fluid. It is shown that a Kolmogorov-like density spectrum
can develop by plasma motions that are dominated by Alfv\'enic cascades whereas
compressive modes are dissipated.
