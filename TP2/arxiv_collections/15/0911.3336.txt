We present a spectroscopic study of excitation dynamics in self assembled
CdTe/ZnTe quantum dots. Insight into details of kinetics is obtained from the
time resolved micro-photoluminescence, single photon correlation and
subpicosecond excitation correlation measurements done on single quantum dots.
It is shown that the pulsed excitation in energy above the energy gap of the
barrier material results in separate capture of electrons and holes. The
capture of carriers of different charge take place at different delay from
excitation.
