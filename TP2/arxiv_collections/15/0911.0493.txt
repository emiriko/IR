Latest developments in VLSI, wireless communications, and biomedical sensing
devices allow very small, lightweight, low power, intelligent sensing devices
called biosensors. A set of these devices can be integrated into a Wireless
Biomedical Sensor Network (WBSN), a new breakthrough technology used in
telemedicine for monitoring the physiological condition of an individual. The
biosensor nodes in WBSN has got resource limitations in terms of battery
lifetime, CPU processing capability, and memory capacity. Replacement or
recharging of batteries on thousands of biosensor nodes is quiet difficult or
too costly. So, a key challenge in wireless biomedical sensor networks is the
reduction of energy and memory consumption. Considering, the sensitivity of
information in WBSN, we must provide security and patient privacy, as it is an
important issue in the design of such systems. Hence this paper proposes an
energy efficient security protocol for WBSN where security is provided to the
physiological data, which is being transmitted from the sensor node to the sink
device. This is achieved by authenticating the data using patients biometric,
encrypting the data using Quasi Group cryptography after compressing the image
data using an energy efficient number theory based technique.
