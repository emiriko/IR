We present measurements of differential cross sections for the inclusive
$Z/\gamma^*$ + jet production and the inclusive photon plus heavy flavor
production in a data sample of 1fb$^{-1}$ collected with the D{\O}detector in
proton-antiproton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$=1.96 TeV. In the first measurement,
we compare kinematic distributions of the $Z/\gamma^*$ and the jets as well as
various angles of the $Z$+jet system with different Monte Carlo event
generators and next-to-leading order perturbative QCD (NLO pQCD) predictions
with non-perturbative corrections applied. In the second measurement, we
compare the results with NLO pQCD predictions, covering photon transverse
momenta 30-150 GeV, photon rapidities $|y^{\gamma}| < 1.0$, jet rapidities
$|y^{jet}| < 0.8$, and jet transverse momenta $p_{T}^{jet} > 15$ GeV.
