We use the classification of the quadrirational maps given by Adler, Bobenko
and Suris to describe when such maps satisfy the Yang-Baxter relation. We show
that the corresponding maps can be characterized by certain singularity
invariance condition. This leads to some new families of Yang-Baxter maps
corresponding to the geometric symmetries of pencils of quadrics.
