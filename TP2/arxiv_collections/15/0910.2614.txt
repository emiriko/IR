Context: Most solar and stellar dynamo models use the alpha-Omega scenario
where the magnetic field is generated by the interplay between differential
rotation (the Omega effect) and a mean electromotive force due to helical
turbulent convection flows (the alpha effect). There are, however, turbulent
dynamo mechnisms that may complement the alpha effect or may be an alternative
to it. Aims: We investigate models of solar-type dynamos where the alpha effect
is completely replaced by two other turbulent dynamo mechanisms, namely the
Omega x J effect and the shear-current effect, which both result from an
inhomogeneity of the mean magnetic field. Methods: We studied axisymmetric
mean-field dynamo models containing differential rotation, the Omega x J and
shear-current effects, and a meridional circulation. The model calculations
were carried out using the rotation profile of the Sun as obtained from
helioseismic measurements and radial profiles of other quantities according to
a standard model of the solar interior. Results: Without meridional flow, no
satisfactory agreement of the models with the solar observations can be
obtained. With a sufficiently strong meridional circulation included, however,
the main properties of the large-scale solar magnetic field, namely, its
oscillatory behavior, its latitudinal drift towards the equator within each
half cycle, and its dipolar parity with respect to the equatorial plane, are
correctly reproduced. Conclusions: We have thereby constructed the first
mean-field models of solar-type dynamos that do not use the alpha effect.
