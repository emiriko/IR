Some predictions concerning possible results of the future JLab experiments
on the pion form factor F_pi(Q^2) are made. The calculations exploit the method
proposed previously by the authors and based on the instant-form Poincare
invariant approach to pion considered as a quark-antiquark system. Long ago,
this model has predicted with surprising accuracy the values of F_pi(Q^2)
measured later in JLab experiment. The results are almost independent from the
form of wave function. The pion mean square radius <r^2_pi> and the decay
constant f_pi also agree with experimental values. The model gives power-like
asymptotic behavior of F_pi(Q^2) at high momentum transfer in agreement with
QCD predictions.
