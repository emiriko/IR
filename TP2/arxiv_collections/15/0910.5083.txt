Two possible phases of superhard material BC3 originating from the cubic
diamond structure are investigated by ab initio pseudopotential density
functional method using generalized gradient approximation (GGA). We calculate
their elastic constants, electronic band structure, and density of states
(DOS). Full phonon frequencies, electron-phonon coupling constant and possible
superconducting Tc of the metallic phase with tetragonal symmetry (t-BC3, space
group P-42m) have for the first time been investigated at 5 and 10 GPa. The
calculated electron-phonon coupling (0.67) and the logarithmically-averaged
frequency (862 cm-1) show superconductivity for the undoped t-BC3 with Tc = 20
K at 5 GPa, which decreases to 17.5 K at 10 GPa.
