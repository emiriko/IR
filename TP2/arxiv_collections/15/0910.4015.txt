Why reaction rate constants for enzymatic reactions are typically inversely
proportional to fractional power exponents of solvent viscosity remains to be
already a thirty years old puzzle. Available interpretations of the phenomenon
invoke to either a modification of 1. the conventional Kramers' theory or that
of 2. the Stokes law. We show that there is an alternative interpretation of
the phenomenon at which neither of these modifications is in fact
indispensable. We reconcile 1. and 2. with the experimentally observable
dependence. We assume that an enzyme solution in solvent with or without
cosolvent molecules is an ensemble of samples with different values of the
viscosity for the movement of the system along the reaction coordinate. We
assume that this viscosity consists of the contribution with the weight $q$
from cosolvent molecules and that with the weight $1-q$ from protein matrix and
solvent molecules. We introduce heterogeneity in our system with the help of a
distribution over the weight $q$. We verify the obtained solution of the
integral equation for the unknown function of the distribution by direct
substitution. All parameters of the model are related to experimentally
observable values. General formalism is exemplified by the analysis of
literature experimental data for oxygen escape from hemerythin.
