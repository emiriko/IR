We describe our recent results on the resonant perturbation theory of
decoherence and relaxation for quantum system with many qubits. The approach
represents a rigorous analysis of the phenomenon of decoherence and relaxation
for general $N$-level systems coupled to reservoirs of the bosonic fields. We
derive a representation of the reduced dynamics valid for all times $t\geq 0$
and for small but fixed interaction strength. Our approach does not involve
master equation approximations and applies to a wide variety of systems which
are not explicitly solvable.
