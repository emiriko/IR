We theoretically investigate resonant tunneling through S- and U-shaped
nanostructured graphene nanoribbons. A rich structure of resonant tunneling
peaks are found eminating from different quasi-bound states in the middle
region. The tunneling current can be turned on and off by varying the Fermi
energy. Tunability of resonant tunneling is realized by changing the width of
the left and/or right leads and without the use of any external gates.
