The Extreme-Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer on board the HINODE satellite is
used to examine the loop system described in Marsh et al. (2009) by applying
spectroscopic diagnostic methods. A simple isothermal mapping algorithm is
applied to determine where the assumption of isothermal plasma may be valid,
and the emission measure locii technique is used to determine the temperature
profile along the base of the loop system. It is found that, along the base,
the loop has a uniform temperature profile with a mean temperature of 0.89 +-
0.09 MK which is in agreement with the temperature determined seismologically
in Marsh et al. (2009), using observations interpreted as the slow
magnetoacoustic mode. The results further strengthen the slow mode
interpretation, propagation at a uniform sound speed, and the analysis method
applied in Marsh et al. (2009). It is found that it is not possible to
discriminate between the slow mode phase speed and the sound speed within the
precision of the present observations.
