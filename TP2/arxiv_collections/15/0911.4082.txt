We study the explosive character of the percolation transition in a
real-world network. We show that the emergence of a spanning cluster in the
Human Protein Homology Network (H-PHN) exhibits similar features to an
Achlioptas-type process and is markedly different from regular random
percolation. The underlying mechanism of this transition can be described by
slow-growing clusters that remain isolated until the later stages of the
process, when the addition of a small number of links leads to the rapid
interconnection of these modules into a giant cluster. Our results indicate
that the evolutionary-based process that shapes the topology of the H-PHN
through duplication-divergence events may occur in sudden steps, similarly to
what is seen in first-order phase transitions.
