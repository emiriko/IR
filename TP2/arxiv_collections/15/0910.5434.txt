One of the most used approaches in simulating materials is the tight-binding
approximation. When using this method in a material simulation, it is necessary
to compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian describing the
system. In general, the system possesses few explicit symmetries. Due to them,
the problem has many degenerate eigenvalues. The ambiguity in choosing a
orthonormal basis of the invariant subspaces, associated with degenerate
eigenvalues, will result in eigenvectors which are not invariant under the
action of the symmetry operators in matrix form. A meaningful computation of
the eigenvectors needs to take those symmetries into account. A natural choice
is a set of eigenvectors, which simultaneously diagonalizes the Hamiltonian and
the symmetry matrices. This is possible because all the matrices commute with
each other. The simultaneous eigenvectors and the corresponding eigenvalues
will be in a parametrized form in terms of the lattice momentum components.
This functional dependence of the eigenvalues is the dispersion relation and
describes the band structure of a material. Therefore it is important to find
this functional dependence in any numerical computation related to material
properties.
