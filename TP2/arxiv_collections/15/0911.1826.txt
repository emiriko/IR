In this paper, we explore completely regular codes in the Hamming graphs and
related graphs. Experimental evidence suggests that many completely regular
codes have the property that the eigenvalues of the code are in arithmetic
progression. In order to better understand these "arithmetic completely regular
codes", we focus on cartesian products of completely regular codes and products
of their corresponding coset graphs in the additive case. Employing earlier
results, we are then able to prove a theorem which nearly classifies these
codes in the case where the graph admits a completely regular partition into
such codes (e.g, the cosets of some additive completely regular code).
Connections to the theory of distance-regular graphs are explored and several
open questions are posed.
