We briefly review central concepts concerning nonextensive statistical
mechanics, based on the nonadditive entropy $S_q=k\frac{1-\sum_{i}p_i^q}{q-1}
(q \in {\cal R}; S_1=-k\sum_{i}p_i \ln p_i)$. Among others, we focus on
possible realizations of the $q$-generalized Central Limit Theorem, including
at the edge of chaos of the logistic map, and for quasi-stationary states of
many-body long-range-interacting Hamiltonian systems.
