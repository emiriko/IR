This paper presents sufficient graph-theoretic conditions for injectivity of
collections of differentiable functions on rectangular subsets of R^n. The
results have implications for the possibility of multiple fixed points of maps
and flows. Well-known results on systems with signed Jacobians are shown to be
easy corollaries of more general results presented here.
