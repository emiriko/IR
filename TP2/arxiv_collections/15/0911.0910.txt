The study deals with the parallelization of finite element based
Navier-Stokes codes using domain decomposition and state-ofart sparse direct
solvers. There has been significant improvement in the performance of sparse
direct solvers. Parallel sparse direct solvers are not found to exhibit good
scalability. Hence, the parallelization of sparse direct solvers is done using
domain decomposition techniques. A highly efficient sparse direct solver
PARDISO is used in this study. The scalability of both Newton and modified
Newton algorithms are tested.
