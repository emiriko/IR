Due to their microstructure, quasi brittle materials present rough cracks.
Under sliding of the crack lips, this roughness involves in one hand induced
opening and in the other hand some apparent plasticity which is due to the
interlocking of the crack lips combined with Coulomb's friction. The proposed
model is written under the irreversible thermodynamics framework.
Micromechanics uses the Del Piero and Owen's structured deformation theory.
Opening of the crack depends upon the crack shape and the relative sliding of
the crack lips. The thermodynamic force associated to the sliding has the
mechanical meaning of the force acting in order to make the crack slide. Yield
surface is defined as a limitation of this force with respect to the Coulomb's
friction and the Barenblatt cohesion. The crack orientation is defined as the
one for which the criterion is reached for the lowest stress level. A
decreasing cohesion, respect to sliding is supposed. Tension and compression
reference cases are envisaged.
