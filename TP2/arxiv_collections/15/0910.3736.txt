To cope with the soft errors and make full use of the multi-core system, this
paper gives an efficient fault-tolerant hardware and software co-designed
architecture for multi-core systems. And with a not large number of test
patterns, it will use less than 33% hardware resources compared with the
traditional hardware redundancy (TMR) and it will take less than 50% time
compared with the traditional software redundancy (time redundant).Therefore,
it will be a good choice for the fault-tolerant architecture for the future
high-reliable multi-core systems.
