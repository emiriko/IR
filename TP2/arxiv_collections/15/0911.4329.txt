XML keyword search is a user-friendly way to query XML data using only
keywords. In XML keyword search, to achieve high precision without sacrificing
recall, it is important to remove spurious results not intended by the user.
Efforts to eliminate spurious results have enjoyed some success by using the
concepts of LCA or its variants, SLCA and MLCA. However, existing methods still
could find many spurious results. The fundamental cause for the occurrence of
spurious results is that the existing methods try to eliminate spurious results
locally without global examination of all the query results and, accordingly,
some spurious results are not consistently eliminated. In this paper, we
propose a novel keyword search method that removes spurious results
consistently by exploiting the new concept of structural consistency.
