The temperature dependence of the magnetic resonance spectra of
nitrogen-vacancy (NV-) ensembles in the range of 280-330 K was studied. Four
samples prepared under different conditions were studied with NV-
concentrations ranging from 10 ppb to 15 ppm. For all of these samples, the
axial zero-field splitting (ZFS) parameter, D, was found to vary significantly
with temperature, T, as dD/dT = -74.2(7) kHz/K. The transverse ZFS parameter,
E, was non-zero (between 4 and 11 MHz) in all samples, and exhibited a
temperature dependence of dE/(EdT) = -1.4(3) x 10^(-4) K^(-1). The results
might be accounted for by considering local thermal expansion. The observation
of the temperature dependence of the ZFS parameters presents a significant
challenge for room-temperature diamond magnetometers and may ultimately limit
their bandwidth and sensitivity.
