In our earlier posting "Matrix Pencils and Entanglement Classification",
arXiv:0911.1803, we gave a polynomial-time algorithm for deciding if two states
in a space of dimension $2\otimes m\otimes n$ are SLOCC equivalent. In this
note, we point out that a straightforward modification of the algorithm gives a
simple enumeration of all SLOCC equivalence classes in the same space, with the
class representatives expressed in the Kronecker canonical normal form of
matrix pencils. Thus, two states are equivalent if and only if they have the
same canonical form. As an example, we present representatives in canonical
form for each of the 26 equivalence classes in $2\otimes 3\otimes n$ systems.
