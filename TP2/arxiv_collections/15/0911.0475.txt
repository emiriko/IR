This paper deals with coamoebas, that is, images under coordinatewise
argument mappings, of certain quite particular plane algebraic curves. These
curves are the zero sets of reduced A-discriminants of two variables. We
consider the coamoeba primarily as a subset of the torus T^2=(R/2\pi Z)^2, but
also as a subset of its covering space R^2, in which case the coamoeba consists
of an infinite, doubly periodic image. In fact, it turns out to be natural to
take multiplicities into account, and thus to treat the coamoeba as a chain in
the sense of algebraic topology.
  We give a very explicit description of the coamoeba as the union of two
mirror images of a (generally non-convex) polygon, which is easily constructed
from a matrix B that represents the Gale transform of the original collection
A. We also give an area formula for the coamoeba, and we show that the coamoeba
is intimately related to a certain zonotope. In fact, on the torus T^2 the
coamoeba and the zonotope together form a cycle, and hence precisely cover the
entire torus an integer number of times. This integer is proved to be equal to
the (normalized) volume of the convex hull of A.
