We have investigated the intrinsic Josephson properties in slightly
underdoped (Hg,Re)Ba2Ca2Cu3Oy [Hg(Re)1223] intrinsic Josephson junctions (IJJs)
with a dimension of 1.0x1.5x0.11 um^3. The current-voltage characteristics of
the IJJs exhibit clear multiple branches with subgap structures similar to
those of other cuprate superconductors. The switching current distributions
P(I) from the zero-voltage to the nonzero-voltage state in the current-biased
IJJs agree well with the theoretical curves of the thermally assisted escape
model at temperatures above ~5 K. The plasma frequency fp of the IJJs is
estimated to be 1.3 THz from the fluctuation-free critical current density of
2.0x10^5 A/cm2, which is one of the highest among cuprate superconductors,
reflecting the high Tc and a relatively low anisotropy of the Re doped Hg
system. The P(I) gradually becomes independent of temperature below ~5 K, which
suggests a crossover of the escape process from thermal activation to quantum
tunneling at such a high temperature.
