We study, in two space dimensions, the large-scale properties of collections
of constant-speed polar point particles interacting locally by nematic
alignment in the presence of noise. This minimal approach to self-propelled
rods allows one to deal with large numbers of particles, revealing a
phenomenology previously unseen in more complicated models, and moreover
distinctively different from both that of the purely polar case (e.g. the
Vicsek model) and of active nematics.
