Magnetite thin fims have been grown epitaxially on ZnO and MgO substrates
using molecular beam epitaxy. The film quality was found to be strongly
dependent on the oxygen partial pressure during growth. Structural, electronic,
and magnetic properties were analyzed utilizing Low Energy Electron Diffraction
(LEED), HArd X-ray PhotoElectron Spectroscopy (HAXPES), Magneto Optical Kerr
Effect (MOKE), and X-ray Magnetic Circular Dichroism (XMCD). Diffraction
patterns show clear indication for growth in the (111) direction on ZnO.
Vertical structure analysis by HAXPES depth profiling revealed uniform
magnetite thin films on both type of substrates. Both, MOKE and XMCD
measurements show in-plane easy magnetization with a reduced magnetic moment in
case of the films on ZnO.
