We report the discovery with XMM-Newton of correlated spectral and timing
behavior in the ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX) NGC 5408 X-1. An ~100 ksec
pointing with XMM/Newton obtained in January, 2008 reveals a strong 10 mHz QPO
in the > 1 keV flux, as well as flat-topped, band limited noise breaking to a
power law. The energy spectrum is again dominated by two components, a 0.16 keV
thermal disk and a power-law with an index of ~2.5. These new measurements,
combined with results from our previous January 2006 pointing in which we first
detected QPOs, show for the first time in a ULX a pattern of spectral and
temporal correlations strongly analogous to that seen in Galactic black hole
sources, but at much higher X-ray luminosity and longer characteristic
time-scales. We find that the QPO frequency is proportional to the inferred
disk flux, while the QPO and broad-band noise amplitude (root mean squared,
rms) are inversely proportional to the disk flux. Assuming that QPO frequency
scales inversely with black hole mass at a given power-law spectral index we
derive mass estimates using the observed QPO frequency - spectral index
relations from five stellar-mass black hole systems with dynamical mass
constraints. The results from all sources are consistent with a mass range for
NGC 5408 X-1 from 1000 - 9000 solar masses. Moreover, the recent relation from
Gierlinski et al. that relates black hole mass to the strength of variability
at high frequencies (above the break in the power spectrum) is also indicative
of such a high mass for NGC 5408 X-1. We argue that these new findings strongly
support the conclusion that NGC 5408 X-1 harbors an intermediate mass black
hole.
