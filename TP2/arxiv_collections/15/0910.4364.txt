The physics items presented in the HE 2.2-2.5 sessions include a variety of
results concerning neutrino oscillations, dark matter and anti-matter,
supernova neutrinos and proton decay. The OG 2.5-2.7 sessions concern detector
R&D and operations in gamma and neutrino astronomy. I report here about a
selection of the presented results.
