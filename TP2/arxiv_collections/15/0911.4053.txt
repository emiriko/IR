We report real space imaging measurements of inelastic Friedel oscillations.
The inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy, using scanning tunneling
microscopy, around dimers of dichlorobenze adsorbates on Au(111) surface
display clear spatial modulations that we attribute to inelastic scattering at
the molecular sites caused by molecular vibrations. Due to local interactions
between the adsorbate and the surface states, the molecular vibrations generate
a redistribution of the charge density at energies in a narrow range around the
inelastic mode. Our experimental findings are supported by theoretical
arguments.
