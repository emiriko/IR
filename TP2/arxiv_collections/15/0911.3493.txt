This paper is a continuation of the previous study [\v{S}amaj, L.: J. Stat.
Phys. {\bf 137}, 1-17 (2009)], where a sequence of sum rules for the
equilibrium charge and current density correlation functions in an infinite
(bulk) quantum media coupled to the radiation was derived by using Rytov's
fluctuational electrodynamics. Here, we extend the previous results to
inhomogeneous situations, in particular to the three-dimensional interface
geometry of two joint semi-infinite media. The sum rules derived for the
charge-charge density correlations represent a generalization of the previous
ones, related to the interface dipole moment and to the long-ranged tail of the
surface charge density correlation function along the interface of a conductor
in contact with an inert (not fluctuating) dielectric wall, to two fluctuating
semi-infinite media of any kind. The charge-current and current-current sum
rules obtained here are, to our knowledge, new. The current-current sum rules
indicate a breaking of the directional invariance of the diagonal
current-current correlations by the interface. The sum rules are expressed
explicitly in the classical high-temperature limit (the static case) and for
the jellium model (the time-dependent case).
