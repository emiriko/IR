It is known that $C(X)$ is algebraically closed if $X$ is a locally
connected, hereditarily unicoherent compact Hausdorff space. For such spaces,
we prove that if $F:C(X) \to C(X)$ is given by an everywhere convergent power
series with coefficients in $C(X)$ and satisfies certain restrictions, then it
has a root in $C(X)$. Our results generalizes the monic algebraic case.
