The quantum cosmological version of a nonsingular Universe presented by
Mukhanov and Brandenberger in the early nineties has been developed and the
Hamilton Jacobi equation has been found under semiclassical (WKB)
approximation. It has been pointed out that, parameterization of classical
trajectories with semiclassical time parameter, for such a classically
constrained system, is a nontrivial task and requires Lagrangian formulation
rather than the Hamiltonian formalism.
