We constructe the $\mathcal{N}=1$ SYM lagrangian in light-cone gauge using
chiral superfields instead of the standard vector superfield approach and
derive the MHV lagrangian. The canonical transformations of the gauge field and
gaugino fields are summarised by the transformation condition of chiral
superfields. We show that $\mathcal{N}=1$ MHV super-vertices can be described
by a formula similar to that of the $\mathcal{N}=4$ MHV super-amplitude. In the
discussions we briefly remark on how to derive Nair's formula for
$\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM theory directly from light-cone lagrangian.
