Serious Games (SGs) have experienced a tremendous outburst these last years.
Video game companies have been producing fun, user-friendly SGs, but their
educational value has yet to be proven. Meanwhile, cognition research scientist
have been developing SGs in such a way as to guarantee an educational gain, but
the fun and attractive characteristics featured often would not meet the
public's expectations. The ideal SG must combine these two aspects while still
being economically viable. In this article, we propose a production chain model
to efficiently conceive and produce SGs that are certified for their
educational gain and fun qualities. Each step of this chain will be described
along with the human actors, the tools and the documents that intervene.
