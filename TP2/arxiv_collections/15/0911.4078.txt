We present results for the corrections of order alpha^2 (Z alpha)^5 to the
Lamb shift. We compute all the contributing Feynman diagrams in dimensional
regularization and a general covariant gauge using a mixture of analytical and
numerical methods. We confirm results obtained by other groups and improve
their precision. Values of the 32 master integrals for this and similar
problems are provided.
