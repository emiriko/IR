The semi-classical approach to the quantum geometrodynamical model is used
for the description of the properties of the universe on extremely small
spacetime scales. Quantum theory for a homogeneous, isotropic and closed
universe is constructed on the basis of a Hamiltonian formalism with the use of
material reference system as a dynamical system defined by macroscopic
relativistic matter. The equations of the model are reduced to the form of the
Einstein-type equations in which the matter energy density has two components
of quantum nature, which behave as antigravitating fluids. The first component
does not vanish in the limit h -> 0 and can be associated with dark energy. The
second component is described by extremely rigid equation of state and goes to
zero after the transition to large spacetime scales. On small spacetime scales
this quantum correction determines the geometry of the universe. This geometry
is conformal to a unit four-sphere embedded in a five-dimensional Euclidean
flat space. When reaching the post-Planck era, the geometry of the universe
changes into the geometry conformal to a unit four-hyperboloid in a
five-dimensional Lorentz-signatured flat space. Near the boundary between two
regions the universe undergoes almost an exponential expansion which passes
smoothly into the expansion under the action of radiation dominating over
matter which is described by the standard cosmological model.
