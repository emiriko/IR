We present results from an extensive study of fluctuation phenomena in
superconducting nanowires made from sputtered NbN. Nanoscale wires were
fabricated in form of a meander and operated at a constant temperature
T~0.4Tc(0). The superconducting state is driven close to the electronic phase
transition by a high bias current near the critical one. Fluctuations of
sufficient strength temporarily drive a section of the meander structure into
the normal conducting state, which can be registered as a voltage pulse of
nanosecond duration. We considered three different models (vortex-antivortex
pairs, vortex edge barriers and phase slip centers) to explain the experimental
data. Only thermally excited vortices, either via unbinding of
vortex-antivortex pairs or vortices overcoming the edge barrier, lead to a
satisfactory and consistent description for all measurements.
