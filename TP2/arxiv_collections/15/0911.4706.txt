We consider two-dimensional Hamiltonians on a torus with finite range, finite
strength interactions and a unique ground state with a non-vanishing spectral
gap, and a conserved local charge, as defined precisely in the text. Using the
local charge operators, we introduce a boundary magnetic flux in the horizontal
and vertical direction and evolve the ground state quasi-adiabatically around a
square of size one magnetic flux, in flux space. At the end of the evolution we
obtain a trivial Berry phase, which we compare, via a method reminiscent of
Stokes' Theorem, to the Berry phase obtained from an evolution around a small
loop near the origin. As a result, we prove, without any averaging assumption,
that the Hall conductance for interacting electron systems is quantized in
integer multiples of e^2/h up to small corrections bounded by a function that
decays as a stretched exponential in the linear size L. Finally, we discuss
extensions to the fractional case under an additional topological order
assumption to describe the multiple degenerate ground states.
