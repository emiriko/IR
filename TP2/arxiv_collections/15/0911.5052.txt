We discuss neutrino oscillation physics with a neutrino factory in stages,
including the possibility of upgrading the muon energy within the same program.
We point out that a detector designed for the low energy neutrino factory may
be used off-axis in a high energy neutrino factory beam. We include the
re-optimization of the experiment depending on the value of theta_13 found. As
upgrade options, we consider muon energy, additional baselines, a detector mass
upgrade, an off-axis detector, and the platinum (muon to electron neutrino)
channels. In addition, we test the impact of Daya Bay data on the optimization.
We find that for large theta_13 (theta_13 discovered by the next generation of
experiments), a low energy neutrino factory might be the most plausible minimal
version to test the unknown parameters. However, if a higher muon energy is
needed for new physics searches, a high energy version including an off-axis
detector may be an interesting alternative. For small theta_13 (theta_13 not
discovered by the next generation), a plausible program could start with a low
energy neutrino factory, followed by energy upgrade, and then baseline or
detector mass upgrade, depending on the outcome of the earlier phases.
