Geiger-mode avalanche photodiodes (G-APD) are promising new sensors for light
detection in atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes. In this paper, the design and
commissioning of a 36-pixel G-APD prototype camera is presented. The data
acquisition is based on the Domino Ring Sampling (DRS2) chip. A sub-nanosecond
time resolution has been achieved. Cosmic-ray induced air showers have been
recorded using an imaging mirror setup, in a self-triggered mode. This is the
first time that such measurements have been carried out with a complete G-APD
camera.
