We look into the inner structure of a two-dimensional dilatonic evaporating
black hole. We establish and employ the homogenous approximation for the
black-hole interior. The field equations admit two types of singularities, and
their local asymptotic structure is investigated. One of these singularities is
found to develop, as a spacelike singularity, inside the black hole. We then
study the internal structure of the evaporating black hole from the horizon to
the singularity.
