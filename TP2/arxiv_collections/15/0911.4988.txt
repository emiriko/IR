In a previous paper the authors applied the Abstract Interpretation approach
for approximating the probabilistic semantics of biological systems, modeled
specifically using the Chemical Ground Form calculus. The methodology is based
on the idea of representing a set of experiments, which differ only for the
initial concentrations, by abstracting the multiplicity of reagents present in
a solution, using intervals. In this paper, we refine the approach in order to
address probabilistic termination properties. More in details, we introduce a
refinement of the abstract LTS semantics and we abstract the probabilistic
semantics using a variant of Interval Markov Chains. The abstract probabilistic
model safely approximates a set of concrete experiments and reports
conservative lower and upper bounds for probabilistic termination.
