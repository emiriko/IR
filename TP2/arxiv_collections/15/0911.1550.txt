Motivated by recent advances in fabricating graphene nanostructures, we find
that an electron can be trapped in Z-shaped graphene nanoconstriction with
zigzag edges. The central section of the constriction operates as a
single-level quantum dot, as the current flow towards the adjunct sections
(rotated by 60 degree) is strongly suppressed due to mismatched valley
polarization, although each section in isolation shows maximal quantum value of
the conductance $G_0=2e^2/h$. We further show, that the trapping mechanism is
insensitive to the details of constriction geometry, except from the case when
widths of the two neighboring sections are equal. The relation with earlier
studies of electron transport through symmetric and asymmetric kinks with
zigzag edges is also established.
