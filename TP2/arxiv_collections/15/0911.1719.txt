Bosonic colored group field theory is considered. Focusing first on dimension
four, namely the colored Ooguri group field model, the main properties of
Feynman graphs are studied. This leads to a theorem on optimal perturbative
bounds of Feynman amplitudes in the "ultraspin" (large spin) limit. The results
are generalized in any dimension. Finally integrating out two colors we write a
new representation which could be useful for the constructive analysis of this
type of models.
