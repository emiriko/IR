We present a new upper limit of sum m_{\nu} eV < 0.28 (95% CL) on the sum of
the neutrino masses assuming a flat LCDM cosmology. This relaxes slightly to
sum m_{\nu} < 0.34 and sum m_{\nu} < 0.47 when quasi non-linear scales are
removed and w is not equal to -1, respectively. These bounds are derived from a
new photometric redshift catalogue of over 700,000 Luminous Red Galaxies (MegaZ
DR7) with a volume of 3.3 (Gpc h^-1)^3, extending over the redshift range 0.45
< z < 0.65 and up to angular scales of l_max = 300. The data are combined with
WMAP 5-year CMB fluctuations, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), type 1a
Supernovae (SNe) and an HST prior on the Hubble parameter. This is the first
combined constraint from a photometric redshift catalogue with other
cosmological probes. When combined with WMAP this data set proves to be as
constraining as the addition of all SNe and BAO data available to date. The
upper limit is one of the tightest and `cleanest' constraints on the neutrino
mass from cosmology or particle physics. Furthermore, if the aforementioned
bounds hold, they all predict that current-to-next generation neutrino
experiments, such as KATRIN, are unlikely to obtain a detection.
