We review some recent developments in the theory of rotating atomic gases.
These studies have thrown light on the process of nucleation of vortices in
regimes where mean-field methods are inadequate. In our review we shall
describe and compare quantum vortex nucleation of a dilute ultracold bosonic
gas trapped in three different configurations: a one-dimensional ring lattice,
a one-dimensional ring superlattice and a two-dimensional asymmetric harmonic
trap. In all of them there is a critical rotation frequency, at which the
particles in the ground state exhibit strong quantum correlations. However, the
entanglement properties vary significantly from case to case. We explain these
differences by characterizing the intermediate states that participate in the
vortex nucleation process. Finally, we show that noise correlations are
sensitive to these differences. These new studies have, therefore, shown how
novel quantum states may be produced and probed in future experiments with
rotating neutral atom systems.
