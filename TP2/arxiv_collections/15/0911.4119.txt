ZEUS inclusive diffractive cross-section measurements have been used in a
DGLAP next-to-leading-order QCD analysis to extract the diffractive parton
distribution functions. Data on diffractive dijet production in deep inelastic
scattering have also been included to costrain the gluon density. Predictions
based on the extracted parton densities are compared to diffractive charm and
dijet photoproduction data.
