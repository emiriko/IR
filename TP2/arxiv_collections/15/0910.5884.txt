We report on the translation and rotation of particle clusters made through
the combination of spherical building blocks. These clusters present ideal
model systems to study the motion of objects with complex shape. Because they
could be separated into fractions of well-defined configurations on a
sufficient scale and their overall dimensions were below 300 nm, the
translational and rotational diffusion coefficients of particle duplets,
triplets and tetrahedrons could be determined by a combination of polarized
dynamic light scattering (DLS) and depolarized dynamic light scattering (DDLS).
The use of colloidal clusters for DDLS experiments overcomes the limitation of
earlier experiments on the diffusion of complex objects near surfaces because
the true 3D diffusion can be studied. When the exact geometry of the complex
assemblies is known, different hydrodynamic models for calculating the
diffusion coefficient for objects with complex shapes could be applied. Because
hydrodynamic friction must be restricted to the cluster surface the so-called
shell model, in which the surface is represented as a shell of small friction
elements, was most suitable to describe the dynamics. A quantitative comparison
of the predictions from theoretical modeling with the results obtained by DDLS
showed an excellent agreement between experiment and theory.
