It is now well established that the stability of aligned dipolar Bose gases
can be tuned by varying the aspect ratio of the external harmonic confinement.
This paper extends this idea and demonstrates that a Gaussian barrier along the
strong confinement direction can be employed to tune both the structural
properties and the dynamical stability of an oblate dipolar Bose gas aligned
along the strong confinement direction. In particular, our theoretical
mean-field analysis predicts the existence of instability islands immersed in
otherwise stable regions of the phase diagram. Dynamical studies indicate that
these instability islands, which can be probed experimentally with present-day
technology, are associated with the going soft of a Bogoliubov--de Gennes
excitation frequency with radial breathing mode character. Furthermore, we find
dynamically stable ground state densities with ripple-like oscillations along
the radial direction. These structured ground states exist in the vicinity of a
dynamical radial roton-like instability.
