In this talk, we discuss one of the dissipative processes which likely take
place in the Early Universe. We assume that the matter filling the isotropic
and homogeneous background is to be described by a relativistic viscous fluid
characterized by an ultra-relativistic equation of state and finite bulk
viscosity deduced from recent lattice QCD calculations and heavy-ion collisions
experiments. We concentrate our treatment to bulk viscosity as one of the
essential dissipative processes in the rapidly expanding Early Universe and
deduce the dependence of the scale factor and Hubble parameter on the comoving
time $t$. We find that both scale factor and Hubble parameter are finite at
$t=0$, revering to absence of singularity. We also find that their evolution
apparently differs from the one resulting in when assuming that the background
matter is an ideal and non-viscous fluid.
