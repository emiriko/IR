In most experiments aimed at determining the masses and mixing parameters for
neutrino oscillations in different energy regimes there are strong backgrounds
to neutrino interactions with matter that can confuse the expected small
signals. One particular set of backgrounds is due to neutrino production of
mesons, particularly pions, from nucleon or nuclear targets. It is especially
important and theoretically interesting in itself to study $coherent$ neutrino
production of pions, i.e. wherein the target does not break up. Preserving the
target requires that the meson produced in the reaction will be charged for
Charged Current (CC) interactions or neutral for Neutral Current (NC)
interactions. Coherent scattering is the weak analog of exclusive neutral meson
electroproduction for which considerable progress has been made in
understanding the intermediate energy, small momentum transfer region by
applying the Generalized Parton Distribution (GPD) phenomenology. The GPD
perspective will be explained with emphasis on how the understanding gained
from electroproduction of neutral pions can carry over to the neutrino
processes.
