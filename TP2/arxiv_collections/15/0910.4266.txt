We describe new lower bounds for randomized communication complexity and
query complexity which we call the partition bounds. They are expressed as the
optimum value of linear programs. For communication complexity we show that the
partition bound is stronger than both the rectangle/corruption bound and the
\gamma_2/generalized discrepancy bounds. In the model of query complexity we
show that the partition bound is stronger than the approximate polynomial
degree and classical adversary bounds. We also exhibit an example where the
partition bound is quadratically larger than polynomial degree and classical
adversary bounds.
