We consider the entanglement manipulation capabilities of the universal
covariant quantum cloner or quantum processor circuit for quantum bits. We
investigate its use for cloning a member of a bipartite or a genuine tripartite
entangled state of quantum bits. We find that for bipartite pure entangled
states a nontrivial behavior of concurrence appears, while for GHZ entangled
states a possibility of the partial extraction of bipartite entanglement can be
achieved.
