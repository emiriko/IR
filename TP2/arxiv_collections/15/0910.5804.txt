We report on the observation of bound states of gain-guided solitons (GGSs)
in a dispersion-managed erbium-doped fiber laser operating in the normal net
cavity dispersion regime. Despite of the fact that the GGS is a chirped soliton
and there is strong pulse stretching and compression along the cavity in the
laser, the bound solitons observed have a fixed pulse separation, which is
invariant to the pump strength change. Numerical simulation confirmed the
experimental observations.
