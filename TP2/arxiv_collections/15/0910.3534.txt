We present a measurement of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix element
$|V_{cb}|$ times the form factor normalization $\mathcal{F}(1)$ using the decay
$B^+\to\bar D^{*0}\ell^+\nu_\ell$. This measurement is performed together with
a determination of the form factor parameters $\rho^2$, $R_1(1)$ and $R_2(1)$
which fully characterize this decay in the framework of Heavy Quark Effective
Theory. This analysis is based on a data sample equivalent to 140 fb$^{-1}$ of
Belle data collected near the $\Upsilon(4S)$ resonance.
  The preliminary results, based on about 27,000 reconstructed $B^+\to\bar
D^{*0}\ell^+\nu_\ell$ decays, are $\rho^2=1.376\pm 0.074\pm 0.056$,
$R_1(1)=1.620\pm 0.091\pm 0.092$, $R_2(1)=0.805\pm 0.064\pm 0.036$ and
$\mathcal{F}(1)|V_{cb}|=35.0\pm 0.4\pm 2.2$. We find the $B^+\to\bar
D^{*0}\ell^+\nu_\ell$ branching fraction to be $(4.84\pm 0.04\pm 0.56)%$. For
all numbers quoted here, the first error is the statistical and the second is
the systematic uncertainty.
  A direct, model-independent determination of the form factor shapes has also
been carried out and shows good agreement with the HQET based form factor
parametrization by Caprini {\it et al.}.
