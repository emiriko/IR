We introduce k-crossings and k-nestings of permutations. We show that the
crossing number and the nesting number of permutations have a symmetric joint
distribution. As a corollary, the number of k-noncrossing permutations is equal
to the number of k-nonnesting permutations. We also provide some enumerative
results for k-noncrossing permutations for some values of k.
