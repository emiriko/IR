Many people believe that mysterious phenomenon of consciousness may be
connected with quantum features of our world. The present author proposed
so-called Extended Everett's Concept (EEC) that allowed to explain
consciousness and super-consciousness (intuitive knowledge). Brain, according
to EEC, is an interface between consciousness and super-consciousness on the
one part and body on the other part. Relations between all these components of
the human cognitive system are analyzed in the framework of EEC. It is
concluded that technical devices improving usage of super-consciousness
(intuition) may exist.
