The tau -> pi pi pi nu_tau decay is driven by the hadronization of the
axial-vector current. Within the resonance chiral theory, and considering the
large-Nc expansion, this process has been studied in Ref.[1]. In the light of
later developments we revise here this previous work by including a new
off-shell width for the lightest a_1 resonance that provides a good description
of the tau -> pi pi pi nu_tau spectrum and branching ratio. We also consider
the role of the rho(1450) resonance in these observables. Thus we bring in an
overall description of the tau -> pi pi pi nu_tau process in excellent
agreement with our present experimental knowledge.
