We study the strangeness electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon from the
N_f=2+1 clover fermion lattice QCD calculation. The disconnected insertions are
evaluated using the Z(4) stochastic method, along with unbiased subtractions
from the hopping parameter expansion. In addition to increasing the number of
Z(4) noises, we find that increasing the number of nucleon sources for each
configuration improves the signal significantly. We obtain G_M^s(0) =
-0.017(25)(07), where the first error is statistical, and the second is the
uncertainties in Q^2 and chiral extrapolations. This is consistent with
experimental values, and has an order of magnitude smaller error. We also study
the strangeness second moment of the partion distribution function of the
nucleon, <x^2>_{s-\bar{s}}.
