On the base of the distinction between covariant and contravariant metric
tensor components, an approach from algebraic geometry will be proposed, aimed
at finding new solutions of the Einstein's equations both in GTCCCM and in
standard gravity theory, if these equations are treated as algebraic equations.
As a partial case, some physical applications of the approach have been
considered in reference to theories with extra dimensions. The s.c. "length
function" l(x) has been introduced and has been found as a solution of
quasilinear differential equations in partial derivatives for two different
cases, corresponding to "compactification + rescaling" and "rescaling +
compactification" of the type I low-energy string theory action. New (although
complicated) relations between the parameters in the action have been found,
valid also for the standard approach in theories with extra dimensions.
