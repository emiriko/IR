This paper describes the discovery potential for new resonances with the
ATLAS experiment. The resonances discussed in here are the Z', leptoquarks,
graviton and W' resonances in some of their leptonic final states, considering
a center-of-mass energy of 14 TeV for all of them, and an estimation of the
potential of the W' search at the early center-of-mass energy of the LHC . The
studied scenarios show that an initial run of few tens of 1/pb would be enough
to go beyond the current limits in most of these models.
