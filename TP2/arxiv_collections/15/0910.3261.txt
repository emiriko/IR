We introduce the concept of an extended O-operator that generalizes the
well-known concept of a Rota-Baxter operator. We study the associative products
coming from these operators and establish the relationship between extended
O-operators and the associative Yang-Baxter equation, extended associative
Yang-Baxter equation and generalized Yang-Baxter equation.
