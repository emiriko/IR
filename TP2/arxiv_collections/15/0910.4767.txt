We propose a method to measure the superfluid fraction of an atomic gas. The
method involves the use of a vector potential generated by optical beams with
non-zero angular momentum to simulate uniform rotation. The induced change in
angular momentum of the atomic gas can be measured spectroscopically. This
allows a direct determination of the superfluid fraction.
