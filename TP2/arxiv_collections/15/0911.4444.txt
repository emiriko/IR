A tight upper bound is given on the distribution of the maximum of a
supermartingale. Specifically, it is shown that if $Y$ is a semimartingale with
initial value zero and quadratic variation process $[Y,Y]$ such that $Y +
[Y,Y]$ is a supermartingale, then the probability the maximum of $Y$ is greater
than or equal to a positive constant $a$ is less than or equal to $1/(1+a).$
The proof makes use of the semimartingale calculus and is inspired by dynamic
programming.
