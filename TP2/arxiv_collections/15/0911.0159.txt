HERA $ep$ collider provides unique information on the proton structure. High
center of mass energy $s=320$ GeV gives access to both the low Bjorken-$x$
domain and regime of high momentum transfers $Q$. Recently the H1 collaboration
reported a high precision measurement of the structure function $F_2$ at low
$x$ leading to tight constraints on the sea quark and gluon densities. Both the
H1 and ZEUS collaborations measure the structure function $F_L$ which provides
an important cross check of the conventional QCD picture. This measurement is
recently extended by H1 to low $Q^2$ where small $x$ corrections may play
important role. An ultimate precision of the deep inelastic scattering cross
section measurement is achieved by combining the measurements of the H1 and
ZEUS collaborations. The combined data are used as a sole input to a QCD fit to
obtained HERA PDF set. New measurements of inclusive $e^-p$ neutral and charged
current scattering cross sections by the ZEUS collaboration at high $Q^2$
improve precision in this kinematic domain. H1 analysis of the DIS high $P_t$
jet production cross section is used for a determination of the strong coupling
constant $\alpha_S$. Separation of the strange quark density from the total sea
is obtained by the HERMES collaboration using tagged $K^{\pm}$ production.
