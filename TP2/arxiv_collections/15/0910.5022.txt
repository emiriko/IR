The authors claim to have found a "proper", "gauge-invariant" definition of a
charged-particle's momentum in gauge theory, which is more "superior" than the
textbook version. I show that their result arises from a misunderstanding of
gauge symmetry by generalizing the Coulomb gauge result indiscriminately and is
not physical.
