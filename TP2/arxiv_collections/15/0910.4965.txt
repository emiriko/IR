We present the optical data for 195 HI-selected galaxies that fall within
both the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Parkes Equatorial Survey (ES).
The photometric quantities have been independently recomputed for our sample
using a new photometric pipeline optimized for large galaxies, thus correcting
for SDSS's limited reliability for automatic photometry of angularly large or
low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies. We outline the magnitude of the
uncertainty in the SDSS catalog-level photometry and derive a quantitative
method for correcting the over-sky subtraction in the SDSS photometric
pipeline. The main thrust of this paper is to present the ES/SDSS sample and
discuss the methods behind the improved photometry, which will be used in
future scientific analysis. We present the overall optical properties of the
sample and briefly compare to a volume-limited, optically-selected sample.
Compared to the optically-selected SDSS sample (in the similar volume),
HI-selected galaxies are bluer and more luminous (fewer dwarf ellipticals and
more star formation). However, compared to typical SDSS galaxy studies, which
have their own selection effects, our sample is bluer, fainter and less
massive.
