A general method, which we call the potential $S$-matrix pole method, is
developed for obtaining the $S$-matrix pole parameters for bound, virtual and
resonant states based on numerical solutions of the Schr\"odinger equation.
This method is well-known for bound states. In this work we generalize it for
resonant and virtual states, although the corresponding solutions increase
exponentially when $r\to\infty$. Concrete calculations are performed for the
$1^+$ ground and the $0^+$ first excited states of $^{14}\rm{N}$, the resonance
$^{15}\rm{F}$ states ($1/2^+$, $5/2^+$), low-lying states of $^{11}\rm{Be}$ and
$^{11}\rm{N}$, and the subthreshold resonances in the proton-proton system. We
also demonstrate that in the case the broad resonances their energy and width
can be found from the fitting of the experimental phase shifts using the
analytical expression for the elastic scattering $S$-matrix. We compare the
$S$-matrix pole and the $R$-matrix for broad $s_{1/2}$ resonance in
${}^{15}{\rm F}$
