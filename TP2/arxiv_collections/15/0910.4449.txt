We investigate the temporal evolution of magnetic flux emerging within a
granule in the quiet-Sun internetwork at disk center. We combined IR
spectropolarimetry performed in two Fe I lines at 1565 nm with
speckle-reconstructed G-band imaging. We determined the magnetic field
parameters by a LTE inversion of the full Stokes vector using the SIR code, and
followed their evolution in time. To interpret the observations, we created a
geometrical model of a rising loop in 3D. The relevant parameters of the loop
were matched to the observations where possible. We then synthesized spectra
from the 3D model for a comparison to the observations. We found signatures of
magnetic flux emergence within a growing granule. In the early phases, a
horizontal magnetic field with a distinct linear polarization signal dominated
the emerging flux. Later on, two patches of opposite circular polarization
signal appeared symmetrically on either side of the linear polarization patch,
indicating a small loop-like structure. The mean magnetic flux density of this
loop was roughly 450 G, with a total magnetic flux of around 3x10^17 Mx. During
the ~12 min episode of loop occurrence, the spatial extent of the loop
increased from about 1 to 2 arcsec. The middle part of the appearing feature
was blueshifted during its occurrence, supporting the scenario of an emerging
loop. The temporal evolution of the observed spectra is reproduced to first
order by the spectra derived from the geometrical model. The observed event can
be explained as a case of flux emergence in the shape of a small-scale loop.
