It is well known that in the weak coupling regime, quantum field theories in
de Sitter space do not have a unique vacuum, but a class of vacua parametrized
by a complex parameter $\alpha$, i.e., the so-called $\alpha$-vacua. In this
article, using gauge/gravity duality, we calculate the symmetric two-point
function of strongly coupled ${\cal N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory on
$dS_3$. We find that there is a class of de Sitter invariant vacua,
parametrized by a set of complex parameters $\{\alpha_{\nu}\}$.
