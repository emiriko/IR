We compute the flux of axions from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). Axions can
be produced in the accretion disk by the Compton, Bremsstrahlung and Primakoff
processes. We find that the axion luminosity due to these processes is
negligible in comparison to the photon luminosity from AGNs. We also compute
the luminosity of a hypothetical pseudoscalar, with very small mass, from the
AGN atmosphere due to the phenomenon of pseudoscalar-photon mixing in
background magnetic field. In this case we find that for some parameter ranges,
the pseudoscalar flux can exceed that of photons. We comment on the
implications of this result on the observed large scale alignment of optical
polarizations from AGNs.
