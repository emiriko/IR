The Einstein vacuum equations in the formulation developed by Newman, Penrose
[NP] and Friedrich [Fr] are expressed in terms of a Lie superbracket.
Differential identities are derived from the super Jacobi identity. This
perspective clarifies the covariance properties of the equations. The equations
are intended as a tool for the analytic study of vacuum spacetimes.
