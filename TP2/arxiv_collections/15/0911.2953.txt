Parts of DNA sequences known as exons and introns play very different role in
coding and storage of genetic information. Here we show that their conducting
properties are also very different. Taking into account long-range correlations
among four basic nucleotides that form double-stranded DNA sequence, we
calculate electron localization length for exon and intron regions. Analyzing
different DNA molecules, we obtain that the exons have narrow bands of extended
states, unlike the introns where all the states are well localized. The band of
extended states is due to a specific form of the binary correlation function of
the sequence of basic DNA nucleotides.
