It has recently been shown that generalized connections of the (A)dS space
symmetry algebra provide an effective geometric and algebraic framework for all
types of gauge fields in (A)dS, both for massless and partially-massless. The
equations of motion are equipped with a nilpotent operator called $\sigma_-$
whose cohomology groups correspond to the dynamically relevant quantities like
differential gauge parameters, dynamical fields, gauge invariant field
equations, Bianchi identities etc. In the paper the $\sigma_-$-cohomology is
computed for all gauge theories of this type and the field-theoretical
interpretation is discussed. In the simplest cases the $\sigma_-$-cohomology is
equivalent to the ordinary Lie algebra cohomology.
