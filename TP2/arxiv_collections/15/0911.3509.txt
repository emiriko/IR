Coarse-Graining (CG) models are low resolution approximation of high
resolution models, such as all-atomic (AA) models. An effective CG model is
expected to reproduce equilibrium values of sufficient physical quantities of
its AA model, which requires to match the equilibrium probability density of
the CG model to that of the AA model in conformational space. The present work
proposes for constructing effective CG models a novel methodology that aims at
minimizing the distance between CG model and AA model. The distance is defined
as a functional of conformational probability densities in CG and AA models and
further expanded by ensemble averages of a set of sufficient and independent
basis functions. An orthogonalization strategy is adopted to get the
independent basis functions from sufficiently preselected interesting physical
quantities of the system. Two variational methods are developed to optimize
parameters of effective CG force field by minimizing the functional of
probability densities, are then generalized so that the CG model also reproduce
the pressure of AA model. The general CG framework is verified in constructing
one-site CG water from TIP3P water model.
