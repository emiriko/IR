We formulate a generalized Chalker--Coddington network model that describes
the effect of nuclear spins on the two-dimensional electron gas in the quantum
Hall regime. We find exact analytical expression for the transmission
coefficient of a charged particle through a saddle point potential in presence
of perpendicular magnetic field that takes into account spin-flip processes.
Spin-flip scattering creates a metallic state in a finite range around the
critical energy of quantum Hall transition. As a result we find that the usual
insulating phases with Hall conductance $\sigma_{xy}=0, 1, 2$ are separated by
novel metallic phases.
