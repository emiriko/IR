We consider spin Hall effect in a system of massless Dirac fermions in a
graphene lattice. Two types of spin-orbit interaction, pertinent to the
graphene lattice, are taken into account - the intrinsic and Rashba terms.
Assuming perfect crystal lattice, we calculate the topological contribution to
spin Hall conductivity. When both interactions are present, their interplay is
shown to lead to some peculiarities in the dependence of spin Hall conductivity
on the Fermi level.
