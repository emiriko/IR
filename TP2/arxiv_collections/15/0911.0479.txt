In this paper we consider in detail the properties of dynamical heterogeneity
in lattice glass models (LGMs). LGMs are lattice models whose dynamical rules
are based on thermodynamic, as opposed to purely kinetic, considerations. We
devise a LGM that is not prone to crystallization and displays properties of a
fragile glass-forming liquid. Particle motion in this model tends to be locally
anisotropic on intermediate time scales even though the rules governing the
model are isotropic. The model demonstrates violations of the Stokes-Einstein
relation and the growth of various length scales associated with dynamical
heterogeneity. We discuss future avenues of research comparing the predictions
of lattice glass models and kinetically constrained models to atomistic
systems.
