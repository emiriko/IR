We examine the flux structures defined by NS-NS superpotentials of Type IIA
and Type IIB string theories compactified on a particular class of internal
spaces which include non-geometric flux contributions due to T duality or
mirror symmetry. This is then extended to the Type IIB R-R sector through the
use of S duality and then finally to its mirror dual Type IIA R-R sector, with
note of how this sector breaks S duality invariance in Type IIA. The nilpotency
and tadpole constraints associated with the fluxes induced by both dualities
are derived, explicitly demonstrated to be mirror invariant and classified in
terms of S duality multiplets. These results are then used to motivate the
postulation of an additional symmetry for internal spaces which are their own
mirror duals and an analysis is done of the resultant constraints for such a
construction.
