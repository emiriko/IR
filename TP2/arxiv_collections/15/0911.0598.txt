The possibility of a fundamental consistency between the basic quantum
principles and reduction (so-called wave function reduction) is reexamined. The
mathematical description of an organized macroscopic device is constructed
explicitly as a convenient tool for this investigation. Previous no-go theorems
excluding consistency are disproved on this ground, because their assumptions
neglected the occurrence of organization in a real measuring apparatus. A
scheme for deriving reduction from quantum mechanics is also proposed as a
conjecture.
