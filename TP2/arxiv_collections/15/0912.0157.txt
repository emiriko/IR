One of the most striking effect of fluctuations in evolutionary game theory
is the possibility for mutants to fixate (take over) an entire population.
Here, we generalize a recent WKB-based theory to study fixation in evolutionary
games under non-vanishing selection, and investigate the relation between
selection intensity w and demographic (random) fluctuations. This allows the
accurate treatment of large fluctuations and yields the probability and mean
times of fixation beyond the weak selection limit. The power of the theory is
demonstrated on prototypical models of cooperation dilemmas with multiple
absorbing states. Our predictions compare excellently with numerical
simulations and, for finite w, significantly improve over those of the
Fokker-Planck approximation.
