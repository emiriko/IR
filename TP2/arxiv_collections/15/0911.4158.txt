We examine the question of survival of quantum entanglement between the
bipartite states and multiparticle states like GHZ states under the action of a
dephasing bath by the application of sequence of $\pi$ pulses. We show the
great advantage of the pulse sequence of Uhrig [ 2007 {\it Phys. Rev. Lett.}
{\bf 98} 100504] applied at irregular intervals of time, in controlling quantum
entanglement. In particular death of entanglement could be considerably delayed
by pulses. We use quantum optical techniques to obtain exact results.
