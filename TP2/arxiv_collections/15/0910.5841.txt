The structure, and electrical, mechanical and optical properties of few-layer
graphene (FLG) synthesized by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on a Ni coated
substrate were studied. Atomic resolution transmission electron microscope
(TEM) images show highly crystalline single layer parts of the sample changing
to multilayer domains where crystal boundaries are connected by chemical bonds.
This suggests two different growth mechanisms. CVD and carbon segregation
participate in the growth process and are responsible for the different
structural formations found. Measurements of the electrical and mechanical
properties on the centimeter scale provide evidence of a large scale structural
continuity: 1) in the temperature dependence of the electrical conductivity, a
non-zero value near 0 K indicates the metallic character of electronic
transport; 2) the Young's modulus of a pristine polycarbonate film (1.37 GPa)
improves significantly when covered with FLG (1.85 GPa). The latter indicates
an extraordinary Young modulus value of the FLG-coating of TPa orders of
magnitude. Raman and optical spectroscopy support the previous conclusions. The
sample can be used as a flexible and transparent electrode and is suitable for
special membranes to detect and study individual molecules in high resolution
TEM.
