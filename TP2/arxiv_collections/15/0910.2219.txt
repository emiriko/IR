We report on the first step of a systematic study of how gaugino mass
unification can be probed at the LHC in a quasi-model independent manner. Here
we focus our attention on the theoretically well-motivated mirage pattern of
gaugino masses, a one-parameter family of models of which universal (high
scale) gaugino masses are a limiting case. Using a statistical method to
optimize our signature selection we arrive at three ensembles of observables
targeted at the physics of the gaugino sector, allowing for a determination of
this non-universality parameter without reconstructing individual mass
eigenvalues or the soft supersymmetry-breaking gaugino masses themselves. In
this controlled environment we find that approximately 80% of the
supersymmetric parameter space would give rise to a model for which our method
will detect non-universality in the gaugino mass sector at the 10% level with
approximately 10 inverse femptobarns of integrated luminosity.
