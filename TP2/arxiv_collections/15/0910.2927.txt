Rational approximations of the matrix sign function lead to multishift
methods. For non-Hermitian matrices long recurrences can cause storage
problems, which can be circumvented with restarts. Together with deflation we
obtain efficient iterative methods, as we show in numerical experiments for the
overlap Dirac operator at non-vanishing quark chemical potential for lattices
up to size 10^4.
