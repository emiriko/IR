As a test of the standard inflationary cosmology, which generically predicts
nearly scale-invariant spectrum of primordial curvature fluctuations, we
perform Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo analysis to search for possible modulations in
the power spectrum and determine its shape together with the cosmological
parameters using cosmic microwave background radiation data. By incorporating
various three-parameter features on the simple power-law spectrum, we find an
oscillatory modulation localized around the comoving wavenumber $k\simeq
0.009\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ at 99.995% confidence level which improves the
log-likelihood as much as $-\Delta 2\ln {\cal L}\equiv \Delta \chi^2_{\rm
eff}=-22$. This feature can be detected even if we use only the cross
correlation between the temperature and the E-mode polarization anisotropies.
