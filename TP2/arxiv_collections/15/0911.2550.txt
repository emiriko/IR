We calculate the transverse and the time-time components of the Coulomb-gauge
gluon propagator in SU(3) lattice Yang-Mills theory both on isotropic and
anisotropic lattices. The problem of scaling violation observed on the
isotropic lattice is drastically reduced as the anisotropy increases; namely,
the system approaches the Hamiltonian limit. In the infrared region, the
transverse gluon propagator exhibits a turnover and the temporal gluon
propagator shows divergent behavior.
