The Lie superalgebra sl(r+1|s+1) admits several inequivalent choices of
simple root systems. We have carried out analytic Bethe ansatz for any simple
root systems of sl(r+1|s+1). We present transfer matrix eigenvalue formulae in
dressed vacuum form, which are expressed as the Young supertableaux with some
semistandard-like conditions. These formulae have determinant expressions,
which can be viewed as quantum analogue of Jacobi-Trudi and Giambelli formulae
for sl(r+1|s+1). We also propose a class of transfer matrix functional
relations, which is specialization of Hirota bilinear difference equation.
Using the particle-hole transformation, relations among the Bethe ansatz
equations for various kinds of simple root systems are discussed.
