Starting with the results of Li et al. in 1992 there is valuable interest in
finding long range correlations in dna sequences since it raises questions
about the role of introns and intron-containing genes. In the present paper we
studied two sequences. We applied the method of the recurrence quantification
analysis (rqa) that was introduced by Zbilut and Webber in 1994. The
significant result that we have here is that both Lmax and Laminarity exhibit
very large values in non coding respect to coding sequences. Therefore we
suggest that there the claimed higher long range correlations of introns
respect to exons from many authors may be explained here in reason of such
found higher values of Lmax and of Laminarity.
