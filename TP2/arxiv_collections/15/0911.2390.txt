There are both benefits and drawbacks to creativity. In a social group it is
not necessary for all members to be creative to benefit from creativity; some
merely imitate or enjoy the fruits of others' creative efforts. What proportion
should be creative? This paper contains a very preliminary investigation of
this question carried out using a computer model of cultural evolution referred
to as EVOC (for EVOlution of Culture). EVOC is composed of neural network based
agents that evolve fitter ideas for actions by (1) inventing new ideas through
modification of existing ones, and (2) imitating neighbors' ideas. The ideal
proportion with respect to fitness of ideas occurs when thirty to forty percent
of the individuals is creative. When creators are inventing 50% of iterations
or less, mean fitness of actions in the society is a positive function of the
ratio of creators to imitators; otherwise mean fitness of actions starts to
drop when the ratio of creators to imitators exceeds approximately 30%. For all
levels or creativity, the diversity of ideas in a population is positively
correlated with the ratio of creative agents.
