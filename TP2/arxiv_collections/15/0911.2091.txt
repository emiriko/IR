We study the (K-,p) reaction on C12 with a kaon beam of 1 GeV momentum,
paying a special attention to the region of emitted protons having kinetic
energy above 600 MeV, which was used to claim a deep kaon nucleus optical
potential [1]. The experiment looks for fast protons emitted from the
absorption of in flight kaons by nuclei, but in coincidence with at least one
charged particle in the decay counters sandwiching the target. The analysis of
the data is done in [1] assuming that the coincidence requirement does not
change the shape of the final spectra. However our detailed calculations show
that this assumption doesn't hold, and, thus, the final conclusion of this
experiment is doubtful.
  We perform Monte Carlo simulation of this reaction. The advantage of our
method with respect to Green's function method used in [1] is that it allows to
account not only for quasi-elastic K- p scattering, but also for the other
processes which contribute to the proton spectra. We investigated the effect of
the multi-scatterings and of the K- absorptions by one and two nucleons (K- N
--> pi Y and K- N N --> Y N) followed by the decay of the hyperon in pi N. We
show that all these mechanisms allow us to explain reasonably well the observed
spectrum with standard shallow kaon nucleus optical potential, obtained in
chiral models.
