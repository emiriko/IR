In this paper we study a generalized model named one-way general quantum
finite automata} (1gQFA), in which each symbol in the input alphabet induces a
trace-preserving quantum operation, instead of a unitary transformation. Two
different kinds of 1gQFA will be studied: measure-once one-way general quantum
finite automata} (MO-1gQFA), and measure-many one-way general quantum finite
automata (MM-1gQFA). We prove that MO-1gQFA recognize, with bounded error,
precisely the set of all regular languages. We prove that MM-1gQFA also
recognize only regular languages with bounded error. Thus, MM-1gQFA and
MO-1gQFA have the same language recognition power, which is greatly different
from the conventional case in which the number of times the measurement is
performed in the computation generally affects the language recognition power
of one-way QFA. Finally, we present a sufficient and necessary condition for
two MM-1gQFA to be equivalent.
