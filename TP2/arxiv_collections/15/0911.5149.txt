This article is dedicated to prove Buser's conjecture about Bers' constants
for spheres with cusps (or marked points) and for hyperelliptic surfaces. More
specifically, our main theorem states that any hyperbolic sphere with $n$ cusps
has a pants decomposition with all of its geodesics of length bounded by a
constant roughly square root of $n$. Other results include lower and upper
bounds for Bers' constants for hyperelliptic surfaces and spheres with boundary
geodesics.
