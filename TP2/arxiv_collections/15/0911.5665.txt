We collect here various conjectures on congruences made by the author in a
series of papers, some of which involve binary quadratic forms and other
advanced theories. Part A consists of 100 unsolved conjectures of the author
while conjectures in Part B have been recently confirmed. We hope that this
material will interest number theorists and stimulate further research. Number
theorists are welcome to work on those open conjectures; for some of them we
offer prizes for the first correct proofs.
