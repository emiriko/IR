We consider the Nernst effect in the underdoped regime of the cuprate high
temperature superconductors within the d-density wave (DDW) model of the
pseudogap phase. By a combination of analytical and numerical arguments, we
show that there is a robust low-temperature positive peak (i.e., maximum) in
the temperature dependence of the Nernst coefficient when the DDW state is
ambipolar, i.e., when the broken symmetry supports the coexistence of both
electron- and hole-like quasiparticles in the excitation spectrum, and the
electron pocket dominates at the low temperatures. In contrast, the Nernst
coefficient is negative and there is no such positive peak if the underlying
state is non-ambipolar, i.e., when it supports only one type of quasiparticles.
More generally, in the ambipolar state, the sign of the Nernst coefficient can
be positive or negative depending on the dominance of the electron or hole
pockets, respectively, in the low temperature thermoelectric transport. By
modeling the pseudogap phase by a doping-dependent DDW order parameter with a
Fermi surface topology that supports both hole and electron pockets, and
assuming energy-independent transport scattering times, we analyze the
evolution of the Nernst effect with doping concentration at low temperatures in
the cuprate phase diagram.
