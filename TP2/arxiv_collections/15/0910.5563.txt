The generalized coherent states attached to the Jacobi group realize the
squeezed states. Imposing hermitian conjugacy to the generators of the Jacobi
algebra, we find out the form of the weight function appearing in the scalar
product. We show effectively the orthonormality of the base functions with
respect to the scalar product. From the explicit form of the reproducing
kernel, we find out the expression of the multiplier in a holomorphic
representation of the Jacobi group.
