We consider models of heavy fermions in the strong coupling or local moment
limit and include phonon degrees of freedom on the conduction electrons. Due to
the large mass or low coherence temperature of the heavy fermion state, it is
shown that such a regime is dominated by vertex corrections which leads to the
complete failure of the Migdal theorem. Even at weak electron-phonon couplings,
binding of the conduction electrons competes with the Kondo effect and
substantially reduces the coherence temperature, ultimately leading to the
Kondo breakdown. Those results are obtained using a combination of the slave
boson method and Migdal-Eliashberg approximation as well as the dynamical
mean-field theory approximation.
