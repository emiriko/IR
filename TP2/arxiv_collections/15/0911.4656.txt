Durhuus and Jonsson (1995) introduced the class of "locally constructible"
(LC) triangulated manifolds and showed that all the LC 2- and 3-manifolds are
spheres. We show here that for each d>3 some LC d-manifolds are not spheres. We
prove this result by studying how to collapse products of manifolds with
exactly one facet removed.
