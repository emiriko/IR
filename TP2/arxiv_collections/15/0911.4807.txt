This paper presents a new design of the RETGEM (Resistive Electrode Thick
GEM) based on electrodes made of a polyvinylchloride material (PVC). Our device
can operate with gains of 10E5 as a conventional TGEM at low counting rates and
as RPC in the case of high counting rates without of the transit to the violent
sparks. The distinct feature of present RETGEM is the absent of the metal
coating and lithographic technology for manufacturing of the protective
dielectric rms. The electrodes from PVC permit to do the holes by a simple
drilling machine. Detectors on a RETGEM basis could be useful in many fields of
an application requiring a more cheap manufacturing and safe operation, for
example, in a large neutrino experiments, in TPC, RICH systems.
