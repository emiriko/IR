The current communication presents a simple exercise with the aim of solving
a singular problem: the retrieval of extremely large amounts of items in the
Web of Science interface. As it is known, Web of Science interface allows a
user to obtain at most 100,000 items from a single query. But what about
queries that achieve a result of more than 100,000 items? The exercise
developed one possible way to achieve this objective. The case study is the
retrieval of the entire scientific production from the United States in a
specific year. Different sections of items were retrieved using the field
Source of the database. Then, a simple Boolean statement was created with the
aim of eliminating overlapping and to improve the accuracy of the search
strategy. The importance of team work in the development of advanced search
strategies was noted.
