To explain important properties of extrasolar planetary systems (eg. close-in
hot Jupiters, resonant planets) an evolutionary scenario which allows for
radial migration of planets in disks is required. During their formation
protoplanets undergo a phase in which they are embedded in the disk and
interact gravitationally with it. This planet-disk interaction results in
torques (through gravitational forces) acting on the planet that will change
its angular momentum and result in a radial migration of the planet through the
disk. To determine the outcome of this very important process for planet
formation, dedicated high resolution numerical modeling is required. This
contribution focusses on some important aspects of the numerical approach that
we found essential for obtaining successful results. We specifically mention
the treatment of Coriolis forces, Cartesian grids, and the FARGO method.
