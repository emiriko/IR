The influence of the environment in the thermal equilibrium properties of a
bipartite continuous variable quantum system is studied. The problem is treated
within a system-plus-reservoir approach. The considered model reproduces the
conventional Brownian motion when the two particles are far apart and induces
an effective interaction between them, depending on the choice of the spectral
function of the bath. The coupling between the system and the environment
guarantees the translational invariance of the system in the absence of an
external potential. The entanglement between the particles is measured by the
logarithmic negativity, which is shown to monotonically decrease with the
increase of the temperature. A range of finite temperatures is found in which
entanglement is still induced by the reservoir.
