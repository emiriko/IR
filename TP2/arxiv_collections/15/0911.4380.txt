We review Fujiwara's scheme, a sixth order weak approximation scheme for the
numerical approximation of SDEs, and embed it into a general method to
construct weak approximation schemes of order $ 2m $ for $ m \in \mathbf{N} $.
Those schemes cannot be seen as cubature schemes, but rather as universal ways
how to extrapolate from a lower order weak approximation scheme, namely the
Ninomiya-Victoir scheme, for higher orders.
