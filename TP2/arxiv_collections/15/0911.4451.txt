We consider the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) with varying
amounts of non-universality in the soft supersymmetry-breaking contributions to
the Higgs scalar masses. In addition to the constrained MSSM (CMSSM) in which
these are universal with the soft supersymmetry-breaking contributions to the
squark and slepton masses at the input GUT scale, we consider scenarios in
which both the Higgs masses are non-universal by the same amount (NUHM1), and
scenarios in which they are independently non-universal (NUHM2). As the
lightest neutralino is a dark matter candidate, we demand that the relic
density of neutralinos not be in conflict with measurements by WMAP and others,
and examine the viable regions of parameter space. Prospects for direct
detection of neutralino dark matter via elastic scattering in these scenarios
are discussed.
