Some theories of particle physics are so compelling that it is worth doing a
comprehensive and systematic set of experimental searches to see if they are
realized in nature. Supersymmetry is one such theory. This review focuses on
the motivation for a broad set of cosmology-inspired search strategies at the
Tevatron and on their implementation and results at the Collider Detector at
Fermilab (CDF) with the first few fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity of data.
