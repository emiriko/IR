We demonstrate pseudo spin valves with a (112)-textured DO_22 MnGa (MnGa)
tilted magnetization fixed layer and an in-plane CoFe free layer. Single D0_22
MnGa films exhibit a small magnetoresistance (MR) typically observed in metals.
In MnGa/Cu/ CoFe spin valves a transition from a negative (-0.08%) to positive
(3.88%) MR is realized by introducing a thin spin polarizing CoFe insertion
layer at the MnGa/Cu interface and tailoring the MnGa thickness. Finally, the
exchange coupling between the MnGa and CoFe insertion layer is studied using a
first-order reversal curve (FORC) technique.
