Following Einstein's definition of Lagrangian density and gravitational field
energy density (Einstein, A., Ann. Phys. Lpz., 49, 806 (1916); Einstein, A.,
Phys. Z., 19, 115 (1918); Pauli, W., {\it Theory of Relativity}, B.I.
Publications, Mumbai, 1963, Trans. by G. Field), Tolman derived a general
formula for the total matter plus gravitational field energy ($P_0$) of an
arbitrary system (Tolman, R.C., Phys. Rev., 35(8), 875 (1930); Tolman, R.C.,
{\it Relativity, Thermodynamics & Cosmology}, Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1962));
Xulu, S.S., arXiv:hep-th/0308070 (2003)). For a static isolated system, in
quasi-Cartesian coordinates, this formula leads to the well known result $P_0 =
\int \sqrt{-g} (T_0^0 - T_1^1 -T_2^2 -T_3^3) ~d^3 x$, where $g$ is the
determinant of the metric tensor and $T^a_b$ is the energy momentum tensor of
the {\em matter}. Though in the literature, this is known as "Tolman Mass", it
must be realized that this is essentially "Einstein Mass" because the
underlying pseudo-tensor here is due to Einstein. In fact, Landau -Lifshitz
obtained the same expression for the "inertial mass" of a static isolated
system without using any pseudo-tensor at all and which points to physical
significance and correctness of Einstein Mass (Landau, L.D., and Lifshitz,
E.M., {\it The Classical Theory of Fields}, Pergamon Press, Oxford, 2th ed.,
1962)! For the first time we apply this general formula to find an expression
for $P_0$ for the Friedmann- Robertson -Walker (FRW) metric by using the same
quasi-Cartesian basis. As we analyze this new result, physically, a spatially
flat model having no cosmological constant is suggested. Eventually, it is seen
that conservation of $P_0$ is honoured only in the a static limit.
