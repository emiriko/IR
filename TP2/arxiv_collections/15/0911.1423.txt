1) Harmonic oscillations (HO) in numerous electroencephalograms (EEG) from
different humans are introduced. 2) The probability density functions (PDF,
p(X)) of the EEG voltages (X) are normal (Gauss) for OO whereas, the plots for
the distributions of HO (pure) are convex. Gaussians for OO may turn to be
convex as HO become dominant in MO or vice versa. However, distributions of the
most of the data are found normal which means that most of the EEG oscillations
consist of OO (or MO). 3) Shannon entropies (information measures) of the
distributions of the data from different brain regions in the ictal intervals
or inter-ictal intervals are calculated for each individual recording and
compared. The averages of Shannon entropies over the individual recordings
during the ictal intervals come out bigger than those from the inter-ictal
intervals. These averages are found to be bigger for the data from
epileptogenic brain areas than those recorded from non epileptogenic ones in
different intervals.
