Non-commutative torsors (equivalently, two-cocycles) for a Hopf algebra can
be used to twist comodule algebras. After surveying and extending the
literature on the subject, we prove a theorem that affords a presentation by
generators and relations for the algebras obtained by such twisting. We give a
number of examples, including new constructions of the quantum affine spaces
and the quantum tori.
