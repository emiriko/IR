In supersymmetric scenarios with a long-lived stau, the LHC experiments
provide us with a great environment for precise mass measurements of
superparticles. We study a case in which the mass differences between the
lightest stau and other sleptons are about 10 GeV or larger, so that the decay
products of heavier sleptons are hard enough to be detected. We demonstrate
that the masses of neutralinos, sleptons, and squarks can be measured with a
good accuracy.
