Correct interpretation of acoustic travel times measured by time-distance
helioseismology is essential to get an accurate understanding of the solar
properties that are inferred from them. It has long been observed that sunspots
suppress p-mode amplitude, but its implications on travel times has not been
fully investigated so far. It has been found in test measurements using a
'masking' procedure, in which the solar Doppler signal in a localized quiet
region of the Sun is artificially suppressed by a spatial function, and using
numerical simulations that the amplitude modulations in combination with the
phase-speed filtering may cause systematic shifts of acoustic travel times. To
understand the properties of this procedure, we derive an analytical expression
for the cross-covariance of a signal that has been modulated locally by a
spatial function that has azimuthal symmetry, and then filtered by a phase
speed filter typically used in time-distance helioseismology. Comparing this
expression to the Gabor wavelet fitting formula without this effect, we find
that there is a shift in the travel times, that is introduced by the amplitude
modulation. The analytical model presented in this paper can be useful also for
interpretation of travel time measurements for non-uniform distribution of
oscillation amplitude due to observational effects.
