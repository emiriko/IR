In the field of Double Beta Decay (DBD) searches, the use of high resolution
detectors in which background can be actively discriminated is very appealing.
Scintillating bolometers containing a Double Beta Decay emitter can largely
fulfill this very interesting possibility. In this paper we present the latest
results obtained with CdWO4 and CaMoO4 crystals. Moreover we report, for the
first time, a very interesting feature of CaMoO4 bolometers: the possibility to
discriminate beta-gamma events from those induced by alpha particles thanks to
different thermal pulse shape.
