QCD results are presented for a 2+1 flavour fermion clover action (which we
call the SLiNC action). A method of tuning the quark masses to their physical
values is discussed. In this method the singlet quark mass is kept fixed, which
solves the problem of different renormalisations (for singlet and non-singlet
quark masses) occuring for non-chirally invariant lattice fermions. This
procedure enables a wide range of quark masses to be probed, including the case
with a heavy up-down quark mass and light strange quark mass. Preliminary
results show the correct splittings for the baryon (octet and) decuplet
spectrum.
