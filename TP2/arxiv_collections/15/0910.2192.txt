In the presence of an intense ion acoustic wave, the energy-momentum
dispersion relation of plasmons is strongly modified to exhibit a band gap
structure. The intensity of an ion acoustic wave might be measured from the
band gap width. The plasmon band gap can be used to block the nonlinear
cascading channel of Langmuir wave decay
