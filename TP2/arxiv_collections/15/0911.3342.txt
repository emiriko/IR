We study some mechanical problems in which a friction force is acting on the
system. Using the fundamental concepts of state, time evolution and energy
conservation we explain how to extend Newtonian mechanics to thermodynamics. We
arrive at the two laws of thermodynamics and then apply them to investigate
time evolution and heat transfer of some significant examples.
