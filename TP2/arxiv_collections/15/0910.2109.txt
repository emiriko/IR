We measured, for the first time, two photon radiative cascades due to
sequential recombination of quantum dot confined electron hole pairs in the
presence of an additional spectator charge carrier. We identified direct, all
optical cascades involving spin blockaded intermediate states, and indirect
cascades, in which non radiative relaxation precedes the second recombination.
Our measurements provide also spin dephasing rates of confined carriers.
