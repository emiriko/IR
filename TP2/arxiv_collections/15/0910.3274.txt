OPERA is an experiment that aims at detecting the appearance of tau-neutrino
in an almost pure mu-neutrino beam (the CNGS neutrino beam) through
oscillation. OPERA is a hybrid detector that associates nuclear emulsions to
electronic detectors. The nuclear emulsion provides the resolution necessary to
detect tau-neutrino CC interactions. The first physics run started in July and
ended in November 2008. In this presentation, the status of the emulsion
technology and of the analysis of its data is reported.
