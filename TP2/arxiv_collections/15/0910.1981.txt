Taking Mn doped Germanium as an example, we evoke the consideration of a
two-band-like conduction in diluted ferromagnetic semiconductor (FMS). The main
argument for claiming Ge:Mn as a FMS is the occurrence of the anomalous Hall
effect (AHE). Usually, the reported AHE (1) is observable at temperatures above
10 K, (2) exhibits no hysteresis, and (3) changes the sign of slope. We
observed a similar Hall resistance in Mn implanted Ge with the Mn concentration
as low as 0.004%. We show that the puzzling AHE features can be explained by
considering a two-band-like conduction in Ge:Mn.
