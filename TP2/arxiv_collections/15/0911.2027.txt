To understand the band bending caused by metal contacts, we study the
potential and charge density induced in graphene in response to contact with a
metal strip. We find that the screening is weak by comparison with a normal
metal as a consequence of the ultra-relativistic nature of the electron
spectrum near the Fermi energy. The induced potential decays with the distance
from the metal contact as x^{-1/2} and x^{-1} for undoped and doped graphene,
respectively, breaking its spatial homogeneity. In the contact region the metal
contact can give rise to the formation of a p-p', n-n', p-n junction (or with
additional gating or impurity doping, even a p-n-p' junction) that contributes
to the overall resistance of the graphene sample, destroying its electron-hole
symmetry. Using the work functions of metal-covered graphene recently
calculated by Khomyakov et al. [Phys. Rev. B 79, 195425 (2009)] we predict the
boundary potential and junction type for different metal contacts.
