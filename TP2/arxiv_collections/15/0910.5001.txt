The dialogue develops arguments for and against adopting a new world system,
info-computationalist naturalism, that is poised to replace the traditional
mechanistic world system. We try to figure out what the info-computational
paradigm would mean, in particular its pancomputationalism. We make some steps
towards developing the notion of computing that is necessary here, especially
in relation to traditional notions. We investigate whether pancomputationalism
can possibly provide the basic causal structure to the world, whether the
overall research programme appears productive and whether it can revigorate
computationalism in the philosophy of mind.
