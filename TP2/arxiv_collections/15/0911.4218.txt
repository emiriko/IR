We study a weighted-set graph coloring problem in which one assigns $q$
colors to the vertices of a graph such that adjacent vertices have different
colors, with a vertex weighting $w$ that either disfavors or favors a given
subset of $s$ colors contained in the set of $q$ colors. We construct and
analyze a weighted-set chromatic polynomial $Ph(G,q,s,w)$ associated with this
coloring. General properties of this weighted-set chromatic polynomial are
proved, and illustrative calculations are presented for various families of
graphs. This study extends a previous one for the case $s=1$ and reveals a
number of interesting new features.
