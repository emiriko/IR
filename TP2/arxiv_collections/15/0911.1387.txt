We show that cavitation of a solution of thorium-228 in water does not induce
its transformation at a faster rate than the natural radioactive decay. We
measured the activity of a thorium-228 solution in water before, and after, it
was subjected to a cavitation at 44 kHz and $250 $W for 90 minutes in order to
observe any change in the thorium half-life. The results were compared to the
original activity of the sample and we observed no change. Our results and
conclusions conflict with those in a recent paper by F. Cardone et. al. [Phys.
Lett. A 373 (2009) 1956-1958].
