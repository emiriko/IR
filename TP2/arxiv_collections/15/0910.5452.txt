Different thicknesses of cobalt thin films were growth by magnetron
sputtering deposition techniques. The films thicknesses were determinated with
X ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and Quartz Crystal Monitoring (QCM). XPS
is also used to determinate the films quality. The films magnetic properties
were determinated by Ferromagnetic Resonance (FMR) technique.
