Measurement results for a meandered planar inverted-F antenna (PIFA) loaded
with magneto-dielectric and dielectric materials are presented. Figures of
merit and ways to compare antennas with different fillings materials are
discussed. The used magneto-dielectric material is described, the radiation
mechanism of the meandered PIFA is studied, and the proper position for
dielectric and magneto-dielectric filling is discussed and identified.
Identical-size antennas with dielectric and magneto-dielectric fillings are
compared at the same resonance frequency using the radiation quality factor as
the figure of merit. It is seen, that the benefit from the magneto-dielectric
filling material is moderate and strongly dependent on the positioning of the
filling.
