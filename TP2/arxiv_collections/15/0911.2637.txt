We present near-IR SINFONI observations of three Galactic HII regions: RVW79,
RCW82 and RCW120. We identify the ionizing stars of each region: they are early
to late O stars, close to the main sequence. We derive their stellar and wind
properties using atmosphere models computed with the code CMFGEN. The cluster
ionizing RCW~79 formed 2.3+/-0.5 Myr ago. Similar ages are estimated, albeit
with a larger uncertainty, for the ionizing stars of the other two regions. In
RCW79 the mechanical wind luminosity represents only 0.1% of the ionizing
luminosity, questioning the influence of stellar winds on the dynamics of the
the HII region. The young stellar objects show four main types of spectral
features: H2 emission, Br gamma emission, CO bandheads emission and CO
bandheads absorption. These features are typical of young stellar objects
surrounded by disks and/or envelopes. The radial velocities of most YSOs are
consistent with that of the ionized gas, firmly establishing that star
formation is taking place on the borders of the HII regions. Outflows are
detected in a few YSOs. All YSOs have moderate to strong near-IR excess. In the
[24] versus K-[24] diagram, the majority of the sources dominated by H2
emission lines stand out as redder and brighter than the rest of the YSOs.
Their H2 emission is mainly due to shocks. We tentatively propose that they
represent an earlier phase of evolution compared to sources dominated by Br
gamma and CO bandheads. We suggest that they still possess a dense envelope in
which jets or winds create shocks. The other YSOs have partly lost their
envelopes and show signatures of accretion disks.
