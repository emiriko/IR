Transverse momentum correlation in azimuthal angle of produced hadrons due to
mini-jets are studied first within the HIJING Monte Carlo model in high-energy
heavy-ion collisions. Jet quenching in the early stage of thermalization is
shown to lead to significant diffusion (broadening) of the correlation.
Evolution of the transverse momentum density fluctuation that gives rise to
such correlation in azimuthal angle in the later stage of heavy-ion collisions
is further investigated within a linearized diffusion-like equation and is
shown to be determined by the shear viscosity of the evolving dense matter.
Such a diffusion equation for the transverse momentum fluctuation is solved
with initial values given by HIJING and together with the hydrodynamic equation
for the bulk medium. The final transverse momentum correlation in azimuthal
angle is calculated along the freeze-out hyper-surface and is found further
diffused for larger values of shear viscosity to entropy density ratio $\eta/s
\sim 0.2-0.4$. Therefore the final transverse momentum correlation in azimuthal
angle can be used to study the thermalization of mini-jets in the early stage
of heavy-ion collisions and the viscous effect in the hydrodynamic evolution of
the strongly coupled quark gluon plasma.
