Topological methods, including persistent homology, are powerful tools for
analysis of high-dimensional data sets but these methods rely almost
exclusively on thresholding techniques. In noisy data sets, thresholding does
not always allow for the recovery of topological information. We present an
easy to implement, computationally efficient pre-processing algorithm to
prepare noisy point cloud data sets for topological data analysis. The
topological de-noising algorithm allows for the recovery of topological
information that is inaccessible by thresholding methods. We apply the
algorithm to synthetically-generated noisy data sets and show the recovery of
topological information which is impossible to obtain by thresholding. We also
apply the algorithm to natural image data in R^8 and show a very clean recovery
of topological information previously only available with large amounts of
thresholding. Finally, we discuss future directions for improving this
algorithm using zig-zag persistence methods.
