The single-particle spectrum obtained from the relativistic mean field (RMF)
theory is used to extract the shell correction energy with the Strutinsky
method. Considering the delicate balance between the plateau condition in the
Strutinsky smoothing procedure and the convergence for the total binding
energy, the proper space sizes used in solving the RMF equations are
investigated in detail by taking 208Pb as an example. With the proper space
sizes, almost the same shell correction energies are obtained by solving the
RMF equations either on basis space or in coordinate space.
