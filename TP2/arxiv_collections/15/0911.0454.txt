On 2 November 2009, the Financial Bubble Experiment was launched within the
Financial Crisis Observatory (FCO) at ETH Zurich
(\url{http://www.er.ethz.ch/fco/}). In that initial report, we diagnosed and
announced three bubbles on three different assets. In this latest release of 23
December 2009 in this ongoing experiment, we add a diagnostic of a new bubble
developing on a fourth asset.
