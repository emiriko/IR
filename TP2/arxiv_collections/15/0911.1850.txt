We study the influence of diagonal disorder (random site energy) of local
pair (LP) site energies on the superconducting properties of a system of
coexisting local pairs and itinerant electrons described by the (hard-core)
boson-fermion model. Our analysis shows that the properties of such a model
with s-wave pairing can be very strongly affected by the diagonal disorder in
LP subsystem (the randomness of the LP site energies). This is in contrast with
the conventional s-wave BCS superconductors, which according to the Anderson's
theorem are rather insensitive to the diagonal disorder (i.e. to nonmagnetic
impurities). It has been found that the disorder effects depend in a crucial
way on the total particle concentration n and the LP level position DELTA_o and
depending on the parameters the system can exhibit various types of
superconducting behaviour, including the LP-like, intermediate (MIXED)and the
'BCS'-like. In the extended range of {n,DELTA_o} the superconducting ordering
is suppressed by the randomness of the LP site energies and the increasing
disorder induces a changeover from the MIXEDlike behaviour to the BCS-like one,
connected with abrupt reduction of T_c and energy gap to zero. However, there
also exist a definite range of {n,DELTA_o} in which the increasing disorder has
a quite different effect: namely it can substantially enhance T_c or even lead
to the phenomenon which can be called disorder induced superconductivity.
Another interesting effect is a possibility of a disorder induced bound pair
formation of itinerant electrons, connected with the change-over to the LP-like
regime.
