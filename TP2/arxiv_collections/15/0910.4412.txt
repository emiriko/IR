Powerful non-thermal emission has been detected coming from relativistic
collimated outflows launched in the vicinity of black holes of a very wide
range of masses, from few to $\sim 10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$. At different scales
along the outflows, i.e. $\sim 10-10^{10} R_{\rm Sch}$ from the black hole, the
local conditions can lead to the generation of non-thermal populations of
particles via, e.g., magnetic reconnection, magneto-centrifugal mechanisms,
diffusive processes, or the so-called converter mechanism. These non-thermal
populations of particles, interacting with dense matter, magnetic, and
radiation fields, could yield radio-to-gamma-ray emission via synchrotron
process, inverse Compton scattering, relativistic Bremsstrahlung, proton-proton
and photo-hadron colissions, and even heavy nuclei photo-disintegration. Other
processes, like pair creation or the development of electromagnetic cascades,
could be also relevant in black-hole jets and their surroundings. Black holes
of different masses, accretion rates and environments show different
phenomenologies, as can be observed in AGNs, GRBs or microquasars. Nonetheless,
these sources basically share the same fundamental physics: accretion,
black-hole rotation, plus an environment, but they are individualized due to
their own specific conditions. In this paper, we qualitatively review the main
characteristics of the non-thermal emission produced in jets from black holes,
giving also a brief overview on the physical properties of black hole/jet
systems. We comment as well on some important differences and similarities
between classes of sources, and on the prospects for the study of the
non-thermal emission from astrophysical sources powered by black holes.
