The variational cluster approximation is applied to the calculation of
thermodynamical quantities and single-particle spectra of LaCoO3. Trial
self-energies and the numerical value of the Luttinger-Ward functional are
obtained by exact diagonalization of a CoO6 cluster. The VCA correctly predicts
LaCoO3 as a paramagnetic insulator and a gradual and relatively smooth increase
of the occupation of high-spin Co3+ ions causes the temperature dependence of
entropy and magnetic susceptibility. The single particle spectral function
agrees well with experiment, the experimentally observed temperature dependence
of photoelectron spectra is reproduced satisfactorily. Remaining discrepancies
with experiment highlight the importance of spin orbit coupling and local
lattice relaxation.
