The theory of finite and infinitary term rewriting is extensively developed
for orthogonal rewrite systems, but to a lesser degree for weakly orthogonal
rewrite systems. In this note we present some contributions to the latter case
of weak orthogonality, where critial pairs are admitted provided they are
trivial.
  We start with a refinement of the by now classical Compression Lemma, as a
tool for establishing infinitary confluence, and hence the property of unique
infinitary normal forms, for the case of weakly orthogonal TRSs that do not
contain collapsing rewrite rules.
  That this restriction of collapse-freeness is crucial, is shown in a
elaboration of a simple TRS which is weakly orthogonal, but has two collapsing
rules. It turns out that all the usual theory breaks down dramatically.
  We conclude with establishing a positive fact: the diamond property for
infinitary developments for weakly orthogonal TRSs, by means of a detailed
analysis initiated by van Oostrom for the finite case.
