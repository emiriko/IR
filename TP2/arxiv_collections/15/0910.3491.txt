We report measurements of the thermoelectric power (TEP) for a series of
Pb(1-x)Tl(x)Te crystals with x = 0.0 to 1.3%. Although the TEP is very large
for x = 0.0, using a single band analysis based on older work for dilute
magnetic alloys we do find evidence for a Kondo contribution of 11 - 18 uV/K.
This analysis suggests that Tk is ~ 50 - 70 K, a factor 10 higher than
previously thought.
