Under the assumption of classical conformal invariance, we study the
Coleman-Weinberg symmetry breaking mechanism in the minimal left-right
symmetric model. This model is attractive as it provides a natural framework
for small neutrino masses and the restoration of parity as a good symmetry of
nature. We find that, in a large fraction of the parameter space, the parity
symmetry is maximally broken by quantum corrections in the Coleman-Weinberg
potential, which are a consequence of the conformal anomaly. As the left-right
symmetry breaking scale is connected to the Planck scale through the
logarithmic running of the dimensionless couplings of the scalar potential, a
large separation of the two scales can be dynamically generated. The symmetry
breaking dynamics of the model was studied using a renormalization group
analysis. Electroweak symmetry breaking is triggered by the breakdown of
left-right symmetry, and the left-right breaking scale is therefore expected in
the few TeV range. The phenomenological implications of the symmetry breaking
mechanism are discussed.
