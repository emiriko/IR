We develop a theory of normal-metal - superconductor (NS) and superconductor
- superconductor (SS) tunnelling in bosonic superconductors with strong
attractive correlations taking into account coherence effects in
single-particle excitation spectrum and disorder. The theory accounts for the
existence of two energy scales, their temperature and doping dependencies,
asymmetry and inhomogeneity of tunnelling spectra of underdoped cuprate
superconductors.
