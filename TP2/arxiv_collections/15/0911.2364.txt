Purpose: to provide a view and analysis of the immediate field of journals
which surround a number of key heterodox economics journals.
Design/methodology/approach: Using citation data from the Science and Social
Science Citation Index, the individual and collective networks of a number of
journals in this field are analyzed. Findings: The size and shape of the
citation networks of journals can differ substantially, even if in a broadly
similar category. Heterodox economics cannot (yet) be considered as an
integrated specialty: authors in several journals in heterodox economics cite
more from mainstream economics than from other heterodox journals. There are
also strong links with other disciplinary fields such as geography, development
studies, women studies, etc.
