Radiative transfer and radiation hydrodynamics use the relativistic Boltzmann
equation to describe the kinetics of photons. It is difficult to solve the
six-dimensional time-dependent transfer equation unless the problem is highly
symmetric or in equilibrium. When the radiation field is smooth, it is natural
to take angular moments of the transfer equation to reduce the degrees of
freedom. However, low order moment equations contain terms that depend on
higher order moments. To close the system of moment equations, approximations
are made to truncate this hierarchy. Popular closures used in astrophysics
include flux limited diffusion and the M1 closure, which are rather ad hoc and
do not necessarily capture the correct physics. In this paper, we propose a new
class of closures for radiative transfer and radiation hydrodynamics. We start
from a different perspective and highlight the consistency of a fully
relativistic formalism. We present a generic framework to approximate radiative
transfer based on relativistic Grad's moment method. We then derive a 14-field
method that minimizes unphysical photon self-interaction.
