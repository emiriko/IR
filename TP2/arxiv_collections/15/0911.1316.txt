N=2 four dimensional gauge theories admit interesting half BPS surface
operators preserving a (2,2) two dimensional SUSY algebra. Typical examples are
(2,2) 2d sigma models with a flavor symmetry which is coupled to the 4d gauge
fields. Interesting features of such 2d sigma models, such as (twisted) chiral
rings, and the tt* geometry, can be carried over to the surface operators, and
are affected in surprising ways by the coupling to 4d degrees of freedom. We
will describe in detail a relation between the parameter space of twisted
couplings of the surface operator and the Seiberg-Witten geometry of the bulk
theory. We will discuss a similar result about the tt* geometry of the surface
operator. We will predict the existence and general features of a wall-crossing
formula for BPS particles bound to the surface operator.
