The spreading of surfactants on thin films is an industrially and medically
important phenomenon, but the dynamics are highly nonlinear and visualization
of the surfactant dynamics has been a long-standing experimental challenge. We
perform the first quantitative, spatiotemporally-resolved measurements of the
spreading of an insoluble surfactant on a thin fluid layer. During the
spreading process, we directly observe both the radial height profile of the
spreading droplet and the spatial distribution of the fluorescently-tagged
surfactant. We find that the leading edge of spreading circular layer of
surfactant forms a Marangoni ridge in the underlying fluid, with a trough
trailing the ridge as expected. However, several novel features are observed
using the fluorescence technique, including a peak in the surfactant
concentration which trails the leading edge, and a flat, monolayer-scale
spreading film which differs from concentration profiles predicted by current
models. Both the Marangoni ridge and surfactant leading edge can be described
to spread as $R \propto t^{\delta}$. We find spreading exponents, $\delta_H
\approx 0.30$ and $\delta_\Gamma \approx 0.22$ for the ridge peak and
surfactant leading edge, respectively, which are in good agreement with
theoretical predictions of $\delta = 1/4$. In addition, we observe that the
surfactant leading edge initially leads the peak of the Marangoni ridge, with
the peak later catching up to the leading edge.
