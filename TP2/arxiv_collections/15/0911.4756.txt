The properties of the ground state $U$-Spin $={3/2}$ baryon decuplet magnetic
moments $\Delta^{-}$, $\Xi^{* -}$, $\Sigma^{* -}$ and $\Omega^{-}$ and their
ground state spin 1/2 cousins $p$, $n$, $\Lambda$, $\Sigma^{+}$, $\Sigma^{0}$,
$\Sigma^{-}$, $\Xi^{+}$, and $\Xi^{-}$ have been studied for many years with a
modicum of success. The magnetic moments of many are yet to be determined. Of
the decuplet baryons, only the magnetic moment of the $\Omega^{-}$ has been
accurately determined. We calculate the magnetic moments of the \emph{physical}
decuplet $U$-Spin $={3/2}$ quartet members without ascribing any specific form
to their quark structure or intra-quark interactions.
