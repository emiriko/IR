When electrons are confined in two dimensions and subjected to strong
magnetic fields, the Coulomb interactions between them become dominant and can
lead to novel states of matter such as fractional quantum Hall liquids. In
these liquids electrons linked to magnetic flux quanta form complex composite
quasipartices, which are manifested in the quantization of the Hall
conductivity as rational fractions of the conductance quantum. The recent
experimental discovery of an anomalous integer quantum Hall effect in graphene
has opened up a new avenue in the study of correlated 2D electronic systems, in
which the interacting electron wavefunctions are those of massless chiral
fermions. However, due to the prevailing disorder, graphene has thus far
exhibited only weak signatures of correlated electron phenomena, despite
concerted experimental efforts and intense theoretical interest. Here, we
report the observation of the fractional quantum Hall effect in ultraclean
suspended graphene, supporting the existence of strongly correlated electron
states in the presence of a magnetic field. In addition, at low carrier density
graphene becomes an insulator with an energy gap tunable by magnetic field.
These newly discovered quantum states offer the opportunity to study a new
state of matter of strongly correlated Dirac fermions in the presence of large
magnetic fields.
