We present a simulation protocol that allows for efficient sampling of the
degrees of freedom of a solute in explicit solvent. The protocol involves using
a non-equilibrium umbrella sampling method, in this case the recently developed
adaptively biased molecular dynamics method, to compute an approximate free
energy for the slow modes of the solute in explicit solvent. This approximate
free energy is then used to set up a Hamiltonian replica exchange scheme that
samples both from biased and unbiased distributions. The final accurate free
energy is recovered via the WHAM technique applied to all the replicas, and
equilibrium properties of the solute are computed from the unbiased trajectory.
We illustrate the approach by applying it to the study of the puckering
landscapes of the methyl glycosides of $\alpha$-L-iduronic acid and its C5
epimer $\beta$-D-glucuronic acid in water. Big savings in computational
resources are gained in comparison to the standard parallel tempering method.
