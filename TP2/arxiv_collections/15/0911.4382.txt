We present a direct N-body simulation modeling the evolution of the old (7
Gyr) open cluster NGC 188. This is the first N-body open cluster simulation
whose initial binary population is directly defined by observations of a
specific open cluster: M35 (150 Myr). We compare the simulated color-magnitude
diagram at 7 Gyr to that of NGC 188, and discuss the blue stragglers produced
in the simulation. We compare the solar-type main sequence binary period and
eccentricity distributions of the simulation to detailed observations of
similar binaries in NGC 188. These results demonstrate the importance of
detailed observations in guiding N-body open cluster simulations. Finally, we
discuss the implications of a few discrepancies between the NGC 188 model and
observations and suggest a few methods for bringing N-body open cluster
simulations into better agreement with observations.
