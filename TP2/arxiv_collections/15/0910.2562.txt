We simulate SU(2) gauge theory with two massless Dirac fermions in the
adjoint representation. We calculate the running of the Schroedinger Functional
coupling and the renormalised quark mass over a wide range of length scales.
The running of the coupling is consistent with the existence of an infrared
fixed point (IRFP), and we find 0.07 < gamma < 0.56 at the IRFP, depending on
the value of the critical coupling.
