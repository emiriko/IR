We report new results on identified (anti)proton and charged pion spectra at
large transverse momenta (3<$p_{T}$<10 GeV/c) from Cu+Cu collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=200 GeV using the STAR detector at the Relativistic Heavy Ion
Collider (RHIC). This study explores the system size dependence of two novel
features observed at RHIC with heavy ions: the hadron suppression at
high-$p_{T}$ and the anomalous baryon to meson enhancement at intermediate
transverse momenta. Both phenomena could be attributed to the creation of a new
form of QCD matter. The results presented here bridge the system size gap
between the available pp and Au+Au data, and allow the detailed exploration for
the on-set of the novel features. Comparative analysis of all available 200 GeV
data indicates that the system size is a major factor determining both the
magnitude of the hadron spectra suppression at large transverse momenta and the
relative baryon to meson enhancement.
