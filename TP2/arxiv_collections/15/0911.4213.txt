The twisted $T$-adic exponential sum associated to a polynomial in one
variable is studied. An explicit arithmetic polygon is proved to be the generic
Newton polygon of the twisted $C$-function of the T-adic exponential sum. It
gives the generic Newton polygon of the twisted $L$-functions of $p^m$-power
order exponential sums, for all $m$.
