We report the result of a search for the infrared counterparts of 37
planetary nebulae (PNs) and PN candidates in the Spitzer Galactic Legacy
Infrared Mid-Plane Survey Extraordinaire II (GLIMPSE II) survey. The photometry
and images of these PNs at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, 8.0, and 24mum, taken through the
Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) and the Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer
(MIPS), are presented. Most of these nebulae are very red and compact in the
IRAC bands, and are found to be bright and extended in the 24mum band. The
infrared morphology of these objects are compared with Ha images of the
Macquarie-AAO-Strasbourg (MASH) and MASH II PNs. The implications for
morphological difference in different wavelengths are discussed. The IRAC data
allow us to differentiate between PNs and HII regions and be able to reject
non-PNs from the optical catalogue (e.g., PNG 352.1-00.0). Spectral energy
distributions (SEDs) are constructed by combing the IRAC and MIPS data with
existing near-, mid-, and far-IR photometry measurements. The anomalous colors
of some objects allow us to infer the presence of aromatic emission bands.
These multi-wavelength data provide useful insights into the nature of
different nebular components contributing to the infrared emission of PNs.
