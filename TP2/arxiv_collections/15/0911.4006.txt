We describe the architecture evolution of the highly-parallel dedicated
processor FTK, which is driven by the simulation of LHC events at high
luminosity (1034 cm-2 s-1). FTK is able to provide precise on-line track
reconstruction for future hadronic collider experiments. The processor,
organized in a two-tiered pipelined architecture, execute very fast algorithms
based on the use of a large bank of pre-stored patterns of trajectory points
(first tier) in combination with full resolution track fitting to refine
pattern recognition and to determine off-line quality track parameters. We
describe here how the high luminosity simulation results have produced a new
organization of the hardware inside the FTK processor core.
