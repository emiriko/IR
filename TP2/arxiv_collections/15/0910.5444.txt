The main goal of this paper is proving the fixed point theorem for finite
groups acting on weakly systolic complexes. As corollaries we obtain results
concerning classifying spaces for the family of finite subgroups of weakly
systolic groups and conjugacy classes of finite subgroups. As immediate
consequences we get new results on systolic complexes and groups. The fixed
point theorem is proved by using a graph-theoretical tool - dismantlability. In
particular we show that 1-skeleta of weakly systolic complexes, i.e. weakly
bridged graphs, are dismantlable. On the way we show numerous characterizations
of weakly bridged graphs and weakly systolic complexes.
