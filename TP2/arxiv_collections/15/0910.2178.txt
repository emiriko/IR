The methods of determining the fractal dimension and irregularity scale in
simulated galaxy catalogs and the application of these methods to the data of
the 2dF and 6dF catalogs are analyzed. Correlation methods are shown to be
correctly applicable to fractal structures only at the scale lengths from
several average distances between the galaxies, and up to (10-20)% of the
radius of the largest sphere that fits completely inside the sample domain.
Earlier the correlation methods were believed to be applicable up to the entire
radius of the sphere and the researchers did not take the above restriction
into account while finding the scale length corresponding to the transition to
a uniform distribution. When an empirical formula is applied for approximating
the radial distributions in the samples confined by the limiting apparent
magnitude, the deviation of the true radial distribution from the approximating
formula (but not the parameters of the best approximation) correlate with
fractal dimension. An analysis of the 2dF catalog yields a fractal dimension of
2.20 +-m 0.25 on scale lengths from 2 to 20 Mpc, whereas no conclusive
estimates can be derived by applying the conditional density method for larger
scales due to the inherent biases of the method. An analysis of the radial
distributions of galaxies in the 2dF and 6dF catalogs revealed significant
irregularities on scale lengths of up to 70 Mpc. The magnitudes and sizes of
these irregularities are consistent with the fractal dimension estimate of D =
2.1-2.4
