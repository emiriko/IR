A language L over a finite alphabet is growth-sensitive (or entropy
sensitive) if forbidding any set of subwords F yields a sub-language L^F whose
exponential growth rate (entropy) is smaller than that of L. Let (X, E, l) be
an infinite, oriented, labelled graph. Considering the graph as an (infinite)
automaton, we associate with any pair of vertices x,y in X the language
consisting of all words that can be read as the labels along some path from x
to y. Under suitable, general assumptions we prove that these languages are
growth-sensitive. This is based on using Markov chains with forbidden
transitions.
