The origin of large scale magnetic fields in astrophysical rotators, and the
conversion of gravitational energy into radiation near stars and compact
objects via accretion have been subjects of active research for a half century.
Magnetohydrodynamic turbulence makes both problems highly nonlinear, so both
subjects have benefitted from numerical simulations.However, understanding the
key principles and practical modeling of observations warrants testable
semi-analytic mean field theories that distill the essential physics. Mean
field dynamo (MFD) theory and alpha-viscosity accretion disc theory exemplify
this pursuit. That the latter is a mean field theory is not always made
explicit but the combination of turbulence and global symmetry imply such. The
more commonly explicit presentation of assumptions in 20th century textbook
MFDT has exposed it to arguably more widespread criticism than incurred by 20th
century alpha-accretion theory despite complementary weaknesses. In the 21st
century however, MFDT has experienced a breakthrough with a dynamical
saturation theory that consistently agrees with simulations. Such has not yet
occurred in accretion disc theory, though progress is emerging. Ironically
however, for accretion engines, MFDT and accretion theory are presently two
artificially uncoupled pieces of what should be a single coupled theory. Large
scale fields and accretion flows are dynamically intertwined because large
scale fields likely play a key role in angular momentum transport. I discuss
and synthesize aspects of recent progress in MFDT and accretion disc theory to
suggest why the two likely conspire in a unified theory.
