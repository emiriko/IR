The Wiener measure induces a measure of closed, convex, (d-1)-dimensional,
Euclidean (hyper-)surfaces that are the convex hulls of closed d-dimensional
Brownian bridges. I present arguments and numerical evidence that this measure,
for odd d, is generated by a local classical action of length dimension two
that depends on geometric invariants of the (d-1)-dimensional surface only.
