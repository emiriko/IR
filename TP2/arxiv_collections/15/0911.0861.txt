We demonstrate theoretically that electric field can drive a quantum phase
transition between band insulator to topological insulator in CdTe/HgCdTe/CdTe
quantum wells. The numerical results suggest that the electric field could be
used as a switch to turn on or off the topological insulator phase, and
temperature can affect significantly the phase diagram for different gate
voltage and compositions. Our theoretical results provide us an efficient way
to manipulate the quantum phase of HgTe quantum wells.
