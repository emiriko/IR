We investigate the evolution of the electrical resistivity of BaFe2As2 single
crystals with pressure. The samples used were from the same batch grown from
self flux and showed properties that were highly reproducible. Samples were
pressurised using three different pressure media: pentane-isopentane (in a
piston cylinder cell), Daphne oil (in an alumina anvil cell) and steatite (in a
Bridgman cell). Each pressure medium has its own intrinsic level of
hydrostaticity, which dramatically affects the phase diagram. An increasing
uniaxial pressure component in this system quickly reduces spin density wave
order and favours the appearance of superconductivity, similar to what is seen
in SrFe2As2.
