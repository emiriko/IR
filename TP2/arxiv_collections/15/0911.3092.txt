This report presents results of our endeavor towards developing a
failure-recovery variant of a CORBA-based bank server that provides fault
tolerance features through message logging and checkpoint logging. In this
group of projects, three components were developed to satisfy the requirements:
1) a message-logging protocol for the branch servers of the distributed banking
system to log required information; 2) a recovery module that restarts the bank
server using the message log to help the restarted bank server process
subsequent requests for various operations; 3) a monitor module that
periodically checks whether the bank server is down and helps the recovery
module restart the bank server if the latter has crashed.
