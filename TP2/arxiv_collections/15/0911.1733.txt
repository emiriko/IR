We argue that the physics of interacting Kelvin Waves (KWs) is highly
non-trivial and cannot be understood on the basis of pure dimensional
reasoning. A consistent theory of KW turbulence in superfluids should be based
upon explicit knowledge of their interactions. To achieve this, we present a
detailed calculation and comprehensive analysis of the interaction coefficients
for KW turbulence, thereby, resolving previous mistakes stemming from
unaccounted contributions. As a first application of this analysis, we derive a
new Local Nonlinear (partial differential) Equation. This equation is much
simpler for analysis and numerical simulations of KWs than the Biot-Savart
equation, and in contrast to the completely integrable Local Induction
Approximation (in which the energy exchange between KWs is absent), describes
the nonlinear dynamics of KWs. Secondly, we show that the previously suggested
Kozik-Svistunov energy spectrum for KWs, which has often been used in the
analysis of experimental and numerical data in superfluid turbulence, is
irrelevant, because it is based upon an erroneous assumption of the locality of
the energy transfer through scales. Moreover, we demonstrate the weak
non-locality of the inverse cascade spectrum with a constant particle-number
flux and find resulting logarithmic corrections to this spectrum.
