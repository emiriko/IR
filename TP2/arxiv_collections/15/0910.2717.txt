We determine which singular del Pezzo surfaces are equivariant
compactifications of G_a^2, to assist with proofs of Manin's conjecture for
such surfaces. Additionally, we give an example of a singular quartic del Pezzo
surface that is an equivariant compactification of a semidirect product of G_a
and G_m.
