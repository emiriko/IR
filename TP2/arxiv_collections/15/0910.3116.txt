The excitation of plasma waves over a length of up to 8 centimeters is, for
the first time, demon- strated using laser guiding of intense laser pulses
through hydrogen filled glass capillary tubes. The plasma waves are diagnosed
by spectral analysis of the transmitted laser radiation. The dependence of the
spectral redshift, measured as a function of filling pressure, capillary tube
length and incident laser energy, is in excellent agreement with simulation
results. The longitudinal accelerating field inferred from the simulations is
in the range 1 -10 GV/m.
