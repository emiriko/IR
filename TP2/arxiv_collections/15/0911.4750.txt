Much more image details can be resolved by improving the system's imaging
resolution and enhancing the resolution beyond the system's Rayleigh
diffraction limit is generally called super-resolution. By combining the sparse
prior property of images with the ghost imaging method, we demonstrated
experimentally that super-resolution imaging can be nonlocally achieved in the
far field even without looking at the object. Physical explanation of
super-resolution ghost imaging via compressive sampling and its potential
applications are also discussed.
