After summarizing neutrino oscillation results I discuss high and low-scale
seesaw mechanisms, with or without supersymmetry, as well as recent attempts to
understand the pattern of neutrino mixing from flavor symmetries. I also
mention the possibility of intrinsic supersymmetric neutrino masses in the
context of broken R parity models, showing how this leads to clear tests at the
LHC.
