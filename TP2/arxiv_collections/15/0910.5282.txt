We present the results of a search for occultation events by objects at
distances between 100 and 1000 AU in lightcurves from the Taiwanese-American
Occultation Survey (TAOS). We searched for consecutive, shallow flux reductions
in the stellar lightcurves obtained by our survey between 7 February 2005 and
31 December 2006 with a total of $\sim4.5\times10^{9}$ three-telescope
simultaneous photometric measurements. No events were detected, allowing us to
set upper limits on the number density as a function of size and distance of
objects in Sedna-like orbits, using simple models.
