The line shape of the plasma resonance in both neutral and charged small
sodium clusters is calculated. The overall properties of the multipeak
structure observed in the photoabsorption cross section of spherical Na_8 and
Na_20 neutral clusters can be understood in terms of Landau damping. Quantal
configurations are shown to play an important role. In the case of charged
Na_9+ and Na_21^+ clusters a single peak is predicted that carries most of the
oscillator strength.
