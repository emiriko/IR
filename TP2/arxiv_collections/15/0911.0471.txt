In the Aharonov-Albert-Vaidman (AAV) weak measurement, it is assumed that the
measuring device or the pointer is in a quantum mechanical pure state. In
reality, however, it is often not the case. In this paper, we generalize the
AAV weak measurement scheme to include more generalized situations in which the
measuring device is in a mixed state. We also report an optical implementation
of the weak value measurement in which the incoherent pointer is realized with
the pseudo-thermal light. The theoretical and experimental results show that
the measuring device under the influence of partial decoherence could still be
used for amplified detection of minute physical changes and are applicable for
implementing the weak value measurement for massive particles.
