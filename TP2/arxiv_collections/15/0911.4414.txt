We propose a novel scheme for designing fuzzy rule based classifier. An SOFM
based method is used for generating a set of prototypes which is used to
generate a set of fuzzy rules. Each rule represents a region in the feature
space that we call the context of the rule. The rules are tuned with respect to
their context. We justified that the reasoning scheme may be different in
different context leading to context sensitive inferencing. To realize context
sensitive inferencing we used a softmin operator with a tunable parameter. The
proposed scheme is tested on several multispectral satellite image data sets
and the performance is found to be much better than the results reported in the
literature.
