Consider two identical atoms in a spherical harmonic oscillator interacting
with a zero-range interaction which is tuned to produce an s-wave zero-energy
bound state. The quantum spectrum of the system is known to be exactly
solvable. We note that the same partial wave quantum spectrum is obtained by
the one-dimensional scale-invariant inverse square potential. Long known as the
Calogero-Sutherland-Moser (CSM) model, it leads to Fractional Exclusion
Statistics (FES) of Haldane and Wu. The statistical parameter is deduced from
the analytically calculated second virial coefficient. When FES is applied to a
Fermi gas at unitarity, it gives good agreement with experimental data without
the use of any free parameter.
