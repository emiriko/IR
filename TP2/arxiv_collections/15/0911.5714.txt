We present in this letter a scheme for optical interferometry. We utilize
coherent-beam-stimulated two-mode squeezed light, which interacts with a phase
shifter and is then squeezed again before detection. Our theoretical device has
the potential to reach far below the shot noise limit (SNL) in phase
sensitivity. This new proposal avoids the pitfalls of other setups, such as
difficulty in creating the required resource. Furthermore, our scheme requires
no complicated detection protocol, relying instead only on simple intensity
measurement. Also, bright, coherent sources "boost" squeezed light, creating a
very sensitive device. This hybrid scheme relies on no unknown components and
can be constructed with current technology. In the following we present our
analysis of this relatively straightforward device, using the operator
propagation method. We derive the phase sensitivity and provide a simple
numerical example of the power of our new proposal. Sensitivity scales as a
shot noise limited Mach-Zehnder Interferometer, multiplied by a sub-Heisenberg
contribution from the squeezed light.
