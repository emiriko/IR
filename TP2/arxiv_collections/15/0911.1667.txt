We introduce generalized quantum Markov states and generalized d-Markov
chains which extend the notion quantum Markov chains on spin systems to that on
$C^*$-algebras defined by general graphs. As examples of generalized d-Markov
chains, we construct the entangled Markov fields on tree graphs. The concrete
examples of generalized d-Markov chains on Cayley trees are also investigated.
