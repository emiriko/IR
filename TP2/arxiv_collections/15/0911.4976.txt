We calculate the Ohmic and Hall conductivities from linear response theory in
a system consisting of the intersection of Nc Dp-branes and Nf << N_c
Dq-branes. Agreement is found between previous results found in a macroscopic
approach comparing induced currents with external electric fields. The issue of
how to deal with mixed operators is raised. The retarded Green's function is
given by a matrix that can be computed from the boundary action similarly to
the Green's function for uncoupled operators.
