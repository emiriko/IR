Various forms of matter may be produced in ultra-relativistic heavy ion
collisions. These are the Quark Gluon Plasma, the Color Glass Condensate, the
Glasma and Quarkyonic Matter. A novel effect that may be associated with
topological charge fluctuations is the Chiral Magnetic Effect. I explain these
concepts and explain how they may be seen in ultra-relativistic heavy ion
collisions.
