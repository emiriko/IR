Based on the proceding Letter [Int. J. Theor. Phys. 48, 1539 (2009)], we
expand the relation between wavelet transformation and Husimi distribution
function to the entangled case. We find that the optical complex wavelet
transformation can be used to study the entangled Husimi distribution function
in phase space theory of quantum optics. We prove that the entangled Husimi
distribution function of a two-mode quantum state |phi> is just the modulus
square of the complex wavelet transform of exp{-(|eta|^2)/2} with phi(eta)being
the mother wavelet up to a Gaussian function.
