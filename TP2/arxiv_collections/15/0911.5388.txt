As a classical state, for instance a digitized image, is transferred through
a classical channel, it decays inevitably with the distance due to the
surroundings' interferences. However, if there are enough number of repeaters,
which can both check and recover the state's information continuously, the
state's decay rate will be significantly suppressed, then a classical Zeno
effect might occur. Such a physical process is purely classical and without any
interferences of living beings, therefore, it manifests that the Zeno effect is
no longer a patent of quantum mechanics, but does exist in classical stochastic
processes.
