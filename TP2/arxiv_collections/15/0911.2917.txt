This paper discusses the Lyapunov exponent for small particles in a spatially
and temporally smooth flow in one dimension. Using a plausible model for the
statistics of the velocity gradient in the vicinity of a particle, the Lyapunov
exponent is obtained as a series expansion in the Stokes number, St, which is a
dimensionless measure of the importance of inertial effects. The approach
described here can be extended to calculations of the Lyapunov exponents and of
the correlation dimension for inertial particles in higher dimensions. It is
also shown that there is correction to this theory which arises because the
particles do not sample the velocity field ergodically. Using this non-ergodic
correction, it is found that (contrary to expectations) the first order term in
the expansion does not vanish.
