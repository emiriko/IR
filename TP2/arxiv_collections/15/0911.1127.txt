We present the discovery of a brown dwarf or possible planet at a projected
separation of 1.9" = 29 AU around the star GJ 758, placing it between the
separations at which substellar companions are expected to form by core
accretion (~5 AU) or direct gravitational collapse (typically >100 AU). The
object was detected by direct imaging of its thermal glow with Subaru/HiCIAO.
At 10-40 times the mass of Jupiter and a temperature of 550-640 K, GJ 758 B
constitutes one of the few known T-type companions, and the coldest ever to be
imaged in thermal light around a Sun-like star. Its orbit is likely eccentric
and of a size comparable to Pluto's orbit, possibly as a result of
gravitational scattering or outward migration. A candidate second companion is
detected at 1.2" at one epoch.
