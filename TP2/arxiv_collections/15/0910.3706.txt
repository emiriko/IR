Using Raman scattering, the solid solution nanoparticles of
paradibrombenzol/paradihlorbenzol are investigated. It is found that in a
spectrum of nanoparticles of solid solution frequencies of spectral lines are
reduced in comparison with similar lines of a single crystal with the same
concentration of components. Calculations of the lattice oscillations by Dyne's
method are performed. It is shown that these modifications of frequencies can
be caused by the increase of lattice parameters with the reduction of
nanoparticles sizes.
