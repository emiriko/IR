The higher order symmetries are investigated in a covariant Hamiltonian
formulation. The covariant phase-space approach is extended to include the
presence of external gauge fields and scalar potentials. The special role of
the Killing-Yano tensors is pointed out. Some non-trivial examples involving
Runge-Lenz type conserved quantities are explicitly worked out.
