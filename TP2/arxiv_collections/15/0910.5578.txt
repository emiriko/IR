We report on our on-going project to compute mesonic and baryonic two- and
three-point correlation functions in simulations using Nf=2 flavours of O(a)
improved Wilson quarks and the Wilson plaquette action. We present performance
figures for the DD-HMC algorithm on commodity cluster hardware and discuss the
issue of critical slowing down, which is particularly pronounced for the
topological charge. The effectiveness of stochastic noise sources and Jacobi
smearing are investigated. Our preliminary results obtained at three quark
masses on 96x48^3 at beta=5.5 imply that the lattice spacing is about 0.06 fm,
while the smallest pion mass in the current runs is around 360 MeV, which
corresponds to m_pi*L=5.3.
