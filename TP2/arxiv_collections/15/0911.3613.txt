Here a preliminary study is presented concerning the detection of the
normally unseen Drell-Yan fragments, possible in the PANDA experiment. To work
as a multi-purpose apparatus, this experiment will record all the particles
produced in the collisions between the antiproton beam and the target, with a
rather wide acceptance. So detecting Drell-Yan dileptons with or without
analyzing the other fragments is just a matter of applying cutoffs in the data
analysis stage. The distribution of the products of 50,000 typical Drell-Yan
events is here simulateded using a well-known generator code (Pythia-8). The
resulting distributions are inserted within the PANDA acceptance region, to
analyze the chances of missing some searched fragment combinations, or of
confusing different sets of particles. The most interesting result is that, due
to the reduced phase space, the produced states are much simpler than one could
imagine: (i) almost 50 % of the events just consist of a dilepton plus a
nucleon-antinucleon pair; (ii) practically all events present a
nucleon-antinucleon pair; (iii) the number of light particles (photons over an
infrared cutoff and pions) is pretty small. The presented simulations show that
it is possible to study experimentally some, or some aspects, of the most
relevant final states, with good statistics and precision.
