We suggest a rigorous generalization of the pseudoscalar mesons mixing
description in SU(3) basis. It is shown that the appearance of extra massive
state nicknamed in the paper as glueball is unavoidable in any scheme with more
than one angle. In this framework we develop the dispersive approach to Abelian
axial anomaly of isoscalar non-singlet current. Combining it with the analysis
of experimental data of charmonium radiative decays ratio we get the number of
quite strict constraints for mixing parameters. Our analysis favors the equal
values of axial currents coupling constants which may be considered as a
manifestation of SU(3) symmetry and possible violation of chiral symmetry based
predictions.
