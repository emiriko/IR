The excitation function of freeze-out time, average freeze-out temperature
and freeze-out energy density of (multi-) strange baryons created in
relativistic heavy-ion collisions is investigated in the framework of a
microscopic transport model. We find that the Omega on average freezes out
earlier than the nucleon, Xi and Lambda. The average freeze-out temperature and
energy density as well as the spread between the different baryonicstates
increase monotonously with increasing beam energy and should approach a
universal value in the case of a hadronizing Quark-Gluon-Plasma.
