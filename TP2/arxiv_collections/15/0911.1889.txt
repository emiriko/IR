We present new measurements of the energy spectra of cosmic-ray (CR) nuclei
from the second flight of the balloon-borne experiment Cosmic Ray Energetics
And Mass (CREAM). The instrument included different particle detectors to
provide redundant charge identification and measure the energy of CRs up to
several hundred TeV. The measured individual energy spectra of C, O, Ne, Mg,
Si, and Fe are presented up to $\sim 10^{14}$ eV. The spectral shape looks
nearly the same for these primary elements and it can be fitted to an $E^{-2.66
\pm 0.04}$ power law in energy. Moreover, a new measurement of the absolute
intensity of nitrogen in the 100-800 GeV/$n$ energy range with smaller errors
than previous observations, clearly indicates a hardening of the spectrum at
high energy. The relative abundance of N/O at the top of the atmosphere is
measured to be $0.080 \pm 0.025 $(stat.)$ \pm 0.025 $(sys.) at $\sim $800
GeV/$n$, in good agreement with a recent result from the first CREAM flight.
