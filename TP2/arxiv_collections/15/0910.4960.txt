(abridged) Here we discuss the question whether the extreme circumstances in
the centre of the Milky Way may be the reason for a significant variation of
the IMF. By means of stellar evolution models using different codes we show
that the observed luminosity in the central parsec is too high to be explained
by a long-standing top-heavy IMF, considering the limited amount of mass
inferred from stellar kinematics in this region. In contrast, continuous star
formation over the Galaxy's lifetime following a canonical IMF results in a
mass-to-light ratio and a total mass of stellar black holes (SBHs) consistent
with the observations. Furthermore, these SBHs migrate towards the centre due
to dynamical friction, turning the cusp of visible stars into a core as
observed in the Galactic Centre. For the first time here we explain the
luminosity and dynamical mass of the central cluster and both the presence and
extent of the observed core, since the number of SBHs expected from a canonical
IMF is just enough to make up for the missing luminous mass. We conclude that
the Galactic Centre is consistent with the canonical IMF and do not suggest a
systematic variation as a result of the region's properties such as high
density, metallicity, strong tidal field etc.
