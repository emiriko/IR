A method to facilitate the consistent inclusion of cross-section measurements
based on complex final-states from HERA, TEVATRON and the LHC in proton parton
density function (PDF) fits has been developed. This can be used to increase
the sensitivity of LHC data to deviations from Standard Model predictions. The
method stores perturbative coefficients of NLO QCD calculations of final-state
observables measured in hadron colliders in look-up tables. This allows the
posteriori inclusion of parton density functions (PDFs), and of the strong
coupling, as well as the a posteriori variation of the renormalisation and
factorisation scales in cross-section calculations.
  The main novelties in comparison to original work on the subject are the use
of higher-order interpolation, which substantially improves the trade-off
between accuracy and memory use, and a CPU and computer memory optimised way to
construct and store the look-up table using modern software tools.
  It is demonstrated that a sufficient accuracy on the cross-section
calculation can be achieved with reasonably small look-up table size by using
the examples of jet production and electro-weak boson (Z, W) production in
proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 14 TeV at the LHC.
  The use of this technique in PDF fitting is demonstrated in a PDF-fit to HERA
data and simulated LHC jet cross-sections as well as in a study of the jet
cross-section uncertainties at various centre-of-mass energies.
