In this paper, we consider decoherence in continuous-time quantum walks on
long-range interacting cycles (LRICs), which are the extensions of the cycle
graphs. For this purpose, we use Gurvitz's model and assume that every node is
monitored by the corresponding point contact induced the decoherence process.
Then, we focus on large rates of decoherence and calculate the probability
distribution analytically and obtain the lower and upper bounds of the mixing
time. Our results prove that the mixing time is proportional to the rate of
decoherence and the inverse of the distance parameter ($\emph{m}$) squared.
This shows that the mixing time decreases with increasing the range of
interaction. Also, what we obtain for $\emph{m}=0$ is in agreement with
Fedichkin, Solenov and Tamon's results \cite{FST} for cycle, and see that the
mixing time of CTQWs on cycle improves with adding interacting edges.
