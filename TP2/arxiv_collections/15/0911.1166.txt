Waveform Relaxation method (WR) is a beautiful algorithm to solve Ordinary
Differential Equations (ODEs). However, because of its poor convergence
capability, it was rarely used. In this paper, we propose a new distributed
algorithm, named Waveform Transmission Method (WTM), by virtually inserting
waveform transmission lines into the dynamical system to achieve distributed
computing of extremely large ODEs. WTM has better convergence capability than
the traditional WR algorithms.
