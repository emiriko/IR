Antiferromagnetism of ultracold fermions in an optical lattice can be
detected by Bragg diffraction of light, in analogy to the diffraction of
neutrons from solid state materials. A finite sublattice magnetization will
lead to a Bragg peak from the (1/2 1/2 1/2) crystal plane with an intensity
depending on details of the atomic states, the frequency and polarization of
the probe beam, the direction and magnitude of the sublattice magnetization,
and the finite optical density of the sample. Accounting for these effects we
make quantitative predictions about the scattering intensity and find that with
experimentally feasible parameters the signal can be readily measured with a
CCD camera or a photodiode and used to detect antiferromagnetic order.
