The transverse and longitudinal Doppler effects of the sunbeam spectra are
shown to result in the earth parameters such as the earth-self rotation and
revolution velocities, the earth orbit semi-major axis, the earth orbital
angular momentum, the earth axial tilt, the earth orbit eccentricity, the local
latitude and the mass of the sun. The sunbeam global positioning scheme is
realized, including the earth orbital position.
