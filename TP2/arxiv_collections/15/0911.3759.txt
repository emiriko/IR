Thermodynamical Behaviour of Inhomogeneous Universe with Varying $ \Lambda $
in Presence of Electromagnetic Field is obtained. $ F_{12} $ is the
non-vanishing component of electromagnetic field tensor. To get a deterministic
solution, it is assumed that the free gravitational field is Petrov type-II
non-degenerate.The value of cosmological constant is found to be small and
pasitive supported by recent results from the supernovae observations recently
obtained by High-Z Supernovae Ia Team and Supernovae Cosmological Project. A
relation between cosmological constant and thermodynamical quantities is
established. Some physical and geometric properties of the model are also
discussed.
