We compute and compare the baryon asymmetry of the universe in thermal
leptogenesis scenario with and without flavour effects for different neutrino
mass models namely degenerate, inverted hierarchical and normal hierarchical
models, with tribimaximal mixings and beyond. Considering three possible
diagonal forms of Dirac neutrino mass matrices $m_{LR}$, the right-handed
Majorana mass matrices $M_{RR}$ are constructed from the light neutrino mass
matrices $m_{LL}$ through the inverse seesaw formula. The normal hierarchical
model is found to give the best predictions of the baryon asymmetry for both
cases. This analysis serves as an additional information in the discrimination
of the presently available neutrino mass models. Moreover, the flavour effects
is found to give enhancement of the baryon asymmetry in thermal leptogenesis.
