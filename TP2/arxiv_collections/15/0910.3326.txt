In the framework of superanalysis we get a functions theory close to complex
analysis, under a suitable condition (A) on the real superalgebras in
consideration. Under the condition (A), we get an integral representation
formula for the superdifferentiable functions.We give a result of Hartogs type
of separated superdifferentiability and a continuation theorem of
Hartogs-Bochner type for the superdifferentiable functions.
