The effects of non-zero baryonic chemical potential on the drag and diffusion
coefficients of heavy quarks propagating through a baryon rich quark gluon
plasma have been studied. The nuclear suppression factor, $R_{\mathrm AA}$ for
non-photonic single electron spectra resulting from the semileptonic decays of
hadrons containing heavy flavours have been evaluated for low energy
collisions. The role of non-zero baryonic chemical potential on $R_{\mathrm
AA}$ has been highlighted.
