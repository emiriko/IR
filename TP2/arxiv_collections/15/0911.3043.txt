The paper studies the robust maximization of utility of terminal wealth in
the diffusion financial market model. The underlying model consists with risky
tradable asset, whose price is described by diffusion process with misspecified
trend and volatility coefficients, and non-tradable asset with a known
parameter. The robust utility functional is defined in terms of a HARA utility
function. We give explicit characterization of the solution of the problem by
means of a solution of the HJBI equation.
