We investigate entanglement transfer from a system of two spin-entangled
electron-hole pairs, each placed in a separate single mode cavity, to the
photons emitted during their recombination process. Dipole selection rules and
a splitting between the light-hole and the heavy-hole subbands are the crucial
ingredients establishing a one-to-one correspondence between electron spins and
circular photon polarizations. To account for the measurement of the photons as
well as dephasing effects, we choose a stochastic Schroedinger equation and a
conditional master equation approach, respectively. The influence of
interactions with the environment as well as asymmetries in the coherent
couplings on the photon-entanglement is analyzed for two concrete measurement
schemes. The first one is designed to violate the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt
(CHSH) inequality, while the second one employs the visibility of interference
fringes to prove the entanglement of the photons. Because of the spatial
separation of the entangled electronic system over two quantum dots, a
successful verification of entangled photons emitted by this system would imply
the detection of nonlocal spin-entanglement of massive particles in a solid
state structure.
