This article serves as a continuation for the discussion in arXiv:0911.3433,
we analyze the invariance properties of the gravity path-integral measure
derived from canonical framework, and discuss which path-integral formula may
be employed in the concrete computation e.g. constructing a spin-foam model, so
that the final model can be interpreted as a physical inner product in the
canonical theory.
