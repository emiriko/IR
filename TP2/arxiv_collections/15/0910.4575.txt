We report a study of the cyclotron resonance (CR) transitions to and from the
unusual $n=0$ Landau level (LL) in monolayer graphene. Unexpectedly, we find
the CR transition energy exhibits large (up to 10%) and non-monotonic shifts as
a function of the LL filling factor, with the energy being largest at
half-filling of the $n=0$ level. The magnitude of these shifts, and their
magnetic field dependence, suggests that an interaction-enhanced energy gap
opens in the $n=0$ level at high magnetic fields. Such interaction effects
normally have limited impact on the CR due to Kohn's theorem [W. Kohn, Phys.
Rev. {\bf 123}, 1242 (1961)], which does not apply in graphene as a consequence
of the underlying linear band structure.
