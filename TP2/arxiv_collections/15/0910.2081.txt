Full jet reconstruction in heavy ion events has been thought to be difficult
due to large multiplicity backgrounds. A new generation of jet reconstruction
algorithms to search for new physics in high luminosity p+p collisions at the
LHC is developed to precisely measure jets over large backgrounds caused by
pile up. From simulations it turns out, this new generation of reconstruction
algorithms are also applicable in the heavy ion environment. We review the
latest results on jet-medium interactions as seen in A+A collisions at RHIC,
focusing on the new techniques for full jet reconstruction.
