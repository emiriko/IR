We study spectral distortions of diffuse ultra-high energy (UHE) neutrino
flavour fluxes resulting due to physics beyond the Standard Model (SM). Even
large spectral differences between flavours at the source are massaged into a
common shape at earth by SM oscillations, thus, any significant observed
spectral differences are an indicator of new physics present in the oscillation
probability during propagation. Neutrino decay and Lorentz symmetry violation
(LV) are examples, and result in significant distortion of the fluxes and the
well-known bounds on them, which may allow UHE detectors to probe lifetimes,
the mass hierarchy and LV parameters over a broad range.
