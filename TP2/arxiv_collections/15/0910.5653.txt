The search for physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM) is one of the most
important goals for the general purpose detector ATLAS at the Large Hadron
Collider at CERN. Already with early LHC data, the ATLAS experiment should be
sensitive to discover physics beyond the Standard Model. This paper summarizes
the prospects of the ATLAS experiment to find experimental evidence for
Supersymmetry (SUSY) and Universal Extra Dimensions (UED) in channels with
jets, leptons and missing transverse energy for an integrated luminosity of L =
200pb-1 at a centre-of-mass energy sqrt s = 10 TeV. Only a selection of the
results is presented focussing on the the discovery reach for inclusive
searches.
