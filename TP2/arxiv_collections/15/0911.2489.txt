Recent detection of blazar 3C279 by MAGIC has confirmed previous indications
by H.E.S.S. that the Universe is more transparent to very-high-energy gamma
rays than currently thought. This circumstance can be reconciled with
observations of nearby blazars provided that photon oscillations into a very
light Axion-Like Particle occur in extragalactic magnetic fields. The emerging
"DARMA scenario" can be tested in the near future by the satellite-borne Fermi
LAT detector as well as by the ground-based Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov
Telescopes H.E.S.S., MAGIC, CANGAROO III, VERITAS and by the Extensive Air
Shower arrays ARGO-YBJ and MILAGRO.
