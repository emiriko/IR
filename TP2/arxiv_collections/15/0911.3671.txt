Within the framework of classical field theory, the connection between the
Dirac field as the field of matter and the spacetime metric is discussed.
Polarization structure of the Dirac field is shown to be rich enough to
determine the spacetime metric locally and to explain the emergence of observed
matter as localized waveforms. The localization of the waveforms is explained
as the result of the local time slowdown and the Lorentz contraction as a
dynamic re-shaping of the waveforms in the course of their acceleration. A
definition of mass as a limiting curvature of the spinor-induced metric is
proposed. A view of the vacuum as a uniformly distributed unit invariant
density of the Dirac field with an explicitly preserved invariance of the light
cone is brought forward. Qualitative explanation of the observed charge
asymmetry as the consequence of the dynamics of localization is given. The
classical pion field is obtained as a manifestation of stresses, mass and
charge flux in localized waveforms of the Dirac field. Some implications of the
finite size of colliding objects for high-energy processes are discussed. A
hypothesis that known internal degrees of freedom are the local spacetime
(angular) coordinates that have no precise counterparts in Riemannian geometry
is proposed.
