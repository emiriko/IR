A novel video watermarking system operating in the three dimensional wavelet
transform is here presented. Specifically the video sequence is partitioned
into spatio temporal units and the single shots are projected onto the 3D
wavelet domain. First a grayscale watermark image is decomposed into a series
of bitplanes that are preprocessed with a random location matrix. After that
the preprocessed bitplanes are adaptively spread spectrum and added in 3D
wavelet coefficients of the video shot. Our video watermarking algorithm is
robust against the attacks of frame dropping, averaging and swapping.
Furthermore, it allows blind retrieval of embedded watermark which does not
need the original video and the watermark is perceptually invisible. The
algorithm design, evaluation, and experimentation of the proposed scheme are
described in this paper.
