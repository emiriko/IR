We propose two phenomenological scenarios of lepton mass matrices and show
that either of them can exactly give rise to \tan^2\theta_{13} = m_e/(m_e +
2m_\mu), \tan^2\theta_{23} = m_\mu/(m_e + m_\mu) and \tan^2\theta_{12} = (m_e
m_2 + 2m_\mu m_1)/(m_e m_1 + 2m_\mu m_2) in the standard parametrization of
lepton flavor mixing. The third relation, together with current experimental
data, predicts a normal but weak hierarchy for the neutrino mass spectrum. We
also obtain \theta_{13} \approx 2.8^\circ for the smallest neutrino mixing
angle and J \approx 1.1% for the Jarlskog invariant of leptonic CP violation,
which will soon be tested in the long-baseline reactor and accelerator neutrino
oscillation experiments. A seesaw realization of both scenarios is briefly
discussed.
