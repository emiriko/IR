We propose a comparative performance evaluation of security protocols. The
novelty of our approach lies in the use of a polynomial mathematical model that
captures the performance of classes of cryptographic algorithms instead of
capturing the performance of each algorithm separately, approach that is used
in other papers. A major advantage of using such a model is that it does not
require implementation-specific information, because the decision is based on
comparing the estimated performances of protocols instead of actually
evaluating them. The approach is validated by comparatively evaluating the
performances of 1000 automatically generated security protocols against the
performances of their actual implementations.
