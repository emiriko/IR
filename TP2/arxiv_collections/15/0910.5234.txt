We present a theory that allows us to accurately calculate the distribution
functions and the emittance growth of a thermal charged-particle beam after it
relaxes to equilibrium. The theory can be used to obtain the fraction of
particles, which will evaporate from the beam to form a halo. The calculated
emittance growth is found to be in excellent agreement with the simulations.
