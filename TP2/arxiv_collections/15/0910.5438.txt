First-principles density-functional calculations reveal a large spin-phonon
coupling in cubic SrMnO$_{3}$, with ferromagnetic ordering producing a polar
instability. Through combination of this coupling with the strain-polarization
coupling characteristic of perovskites, the bulk antiferromagnetic paraelectric
ground state of SrMnO$_3$ is shown to be driven to a previously unreported
multiferroic ferroelectric-ferromagnetic state by increasing epitaxial strain,
both tensile and compressive. This state has a computed polarization and
estimated Curie temperature above 54 $\mu$C/cm$^2$ and 92 K. Large mixed
magnetic-electric-elastic responses are predicted in the vicinity of the phase
boundaries.
