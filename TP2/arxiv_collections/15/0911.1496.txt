All software development processes include steps where several alternatives
induce a choice, a decision-making. Sometimes, methodologies offer a way to
make decisions. However, in a lot of cases, the arguments to carry out the
decision are very poor and the choice is made in an intuitive and hazardous
way. The aim of our work is to offer a scientifically founded way to guide the
engineer through tactical choices with the application of multicriteria methods
in software development processes. This approach is illustrated with three
cases: risks, use cases and tools within Rational Unified Process.
