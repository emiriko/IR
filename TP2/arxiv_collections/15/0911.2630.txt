The main goal of a beta-beam facility is to determine the possible existence
of CP violation in the lepton sector, the value of the third neutrino mixing
angle and the mass hierarchy. Here we argue that a much broader physics case
can be covered since the beta-beam concept can also be used to establish a low
energy beta-beam facility. We discuss that the availability of neutrino beams
in the 100 MeV energy range offers a unique opportunity to perform neutrino
scattering experiments of interest for nuclear physics, for the study of
fundamental interactions and of core-collapse supernova physics.
