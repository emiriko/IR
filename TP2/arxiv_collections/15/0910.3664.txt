Next-to-Leading-Order (NLO) effects play a crucial role in tests of the
Standard Model (SM), and require careful theoretical evaluation. Electroweak
physics, which has just entered the precision age, is an excellent place to
search for new physics, but also requires considerable theoretical input. We
show how we applied computational packages such as FeynArts, FormCalc, Form and
LoopTools for the evaluation of one-loop electroweak and hadronic radiative
corrections.
