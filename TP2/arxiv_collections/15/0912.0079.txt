Entanglement purification is a very important element for long-distance
quantum communication. Different from all the existing entanglement
purification protocols (EPPs) in which two parties can only obtain some quantum
systems in a mixed entangled state with a higher fidelity probabilistically by
consuming quantum resources exponentially, here we present a deterministic EPP
with hyperentanglement. Using this protocl, the two parties can, in principle,
obtain deterministically maximally entangled pure states in polarization
without destroying any less-entangled photon pair, which will improve the
efficiency of long-distance quantum communication exponentially. Meanwhile, it
will be shown that this EPP can be used to complete nonlocal Bell-state
analysis perfectly. We also discuss this EPP in a practical transmission.
