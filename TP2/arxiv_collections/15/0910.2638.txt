One of the most important goals of information management (IM) is supporting
the knowledge workers in performing their works. In this paper we examine
issues of relevance, linkage and provenance of information, as accessed and
used by the knowledge workers. These are usually not adequately addressed in
most of the IT based solutions for IM. Here we propose a non-conventional
approach for building information systems for supporting the knowledge workers
which addresses these issues. The approach leads to the ideas of building
Information Warehouses (IW) and Knowledge work Support Systems (KwSS). Such
systems can open up potential for building innovative applications of
significant impact, including those capable of helping organizations in
implementing processes for double-loop learning.
