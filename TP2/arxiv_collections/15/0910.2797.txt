The risk of systemic war seems dependant on the level of criticality and
sensitivity of the International System, and the system's conditions. The level
of criticality and sensitivity is dependant on the developmental stage of the
International System. Initially, following a systemic war, the increase of the
level of criticality and sensitivity go hand in hand. However, at a certain
stage the sensitivity of the International System for larger sized wars
decreases; as a consequence of a network effect, we argue. This network effect
results in increased local stability of the System. During this phase the
criticality of the International System steadily increases, resulting in a
release deficit. This release deficit facilitates a necessary build up of
energy to push the International System, by means of systemic war, into a new
stability domain. Systemic war is functional in the periodic rebalancing of an
anarchistic international system.
