We present a catalogue of 1602 white dwarf-main sequence binaries (WDMS) from
the spectroscopic Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 6 (SDSS DR6). Among
these we identify 440 as new WDMS binaries. We select WDMS binary candidates
from template fitting all 1.27 million DR6 spectra, using combined constraints
in both $\chi^{2}$ and signal-to-noise ratio. In addition, we use Galaxy
Evolution Explorer (GALEX) and UKIRT Infrared Sky Survey (UKIDSS) magnitudes to
search for objects in which one of the two components dominates the SDSS
spectrum. We use a decomposition/fitting technique to measure the effective
temperatures, surface gravities, masses and distances to the white dwarfs, as
well as the spectral types and distances to the companions in our catalogue.
Distributions and density maps obtained from these stellar parameters are then
used to study both the general properties and the selection effects of WDMS
binaries in SDSS. We also make use of SDSS-GALEX-UKIDSS magnitudes to
investigate the distribution of WDMS binaries, as well as their white dwarf
effective temperatures and companion star spectral types, in ultraviolet to
infrared colour space. We show that WDMS binaries can be very efficiently
separated from single main sequence stars and white dwarfs when using a
combined ultraviolet, optical, and infrared colour selection. Finally, we also
provide radial velocities for 1068 systems measured from the
\Lines{Na}{I}{8183.27,8194.81} absorption doublet and/or the H$\alpha$ emission
line. Among the systems with multiple SDSS spectroscopy, we find five new
systems exhibiting significant radial velocity variations, identifying them as
post-common-envelope binary candidates.
