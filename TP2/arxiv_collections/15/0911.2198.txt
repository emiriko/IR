The search for neutrinoless double-beta decay is an important part of the
global neutrino physics program. One double-beta decay isotope currently under
investigation is 100Mo. In this article, we discuss the results of a
feasibility study investigating the use of molybdenum-loaded liquid
scintillator. A large, molybdenum-loaded liquid scintillator detector is one
potential design for a low-background, internal-source neutrinoless double-beta
decay search with 100Mo. The program outlined in this article included the
selection of a solute containing molybdenum, a scintillating solvent and the
evaluation of the mixture's performance as a radiation detector.
