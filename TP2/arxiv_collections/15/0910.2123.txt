New very precise KLOE data on $\m{e}^+\m{e}^-\to\pi^+\pi^-$ obtained by
radiative return method in Frascati are unified with corrected CMD-2 and SND
Novosibirsk $\m{e}^+\m{e}^-\to\pi^+\pi^-$ data and supplemented below and
beyond by older data in order to be described by the unitary and analytic pion
electromagnetic form factor model, which provides the most precise neutral
$\rho$-meson family parameters.
  Then the recently appeared accurate Belle (KEK) data of the weak pion form
factor are described by the same unitary and analytic model, as it follows from
the CVC hypothesis, providing the charged $\rho$-meson family parameters. As a
result the most reliable parameter differences of the $\rho$-meson family are
determined.
