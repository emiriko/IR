We propose a novel method to reconstruct the spatio-temporal amplitude and
phase of the electric field of ultrashort laser pulses using spatially-resolved
spectral interferometry. This method is based on a fiber-optic coupler
interferometer that has certain advantages in comparison with standard
interferometer systems, such as it being alignment-free and selection of the
reference beam at a single point. Our technique, which we refer to as STARFISH,
offers compactness and simplicity. We report its application to the
experimental characterization of chirped pulses and to spatio-temporal
reconstructions of a convergent beam as well as plane-plane and spherical-plane
waves interferences, which we check with our simulations.
