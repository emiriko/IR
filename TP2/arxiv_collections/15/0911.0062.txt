This paper proposes a new robust control method for quantum systems with
uncertainties involving sliding mode control (SMC). Sliding mode control is a
widely used approach in classical control theory and industrial applications.
We show that SMC is also a useful method for robust control of quantum systems.
In this paper, we define two specific classes of sliding modes (i.e.,
eigenstates and state subspaces) and propose two novel methods combining
unitary control and periodic projective measurements for the design of quantum
sliding mode control systems. Two examples including a two-level system and a
three-level system are presented to demonstrate the proposed SMC method. One of
main features of the proposed method is that the designed control laws can
guarantee desired control performance in the presence of uncertainties in the
system Hamiltonian. This sliding mode control approach provides a useful
control theoretic tool for robust quantum information processing with
uncertainties.
