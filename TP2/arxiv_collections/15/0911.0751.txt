The one-dimensional half-filled Hubbard model is considered at zero
temperature within the cellular dynamical mean-field theory (CDMFT). By the
computation of the spectral gap and the energy density with various cluster and
bath sizes we examine the accuracy of the CDMFT in a systematic way, which
proves the accurate description of the one-dimensional systems by the CDMFT
with small clusters. We also calculate the spectral weights in a full range of
the momentum for various interaction strengths. The results do not only account
for the spin-charge separation, but they also reproduce all the features of the
Bethe ansatz dispersions, implying that the CDMFT provides an excellent
description of the spectral properties of low-dimensional interacting systems.
