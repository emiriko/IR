The critical phenomena in strongly interaction matter are generally
investigated using the mean-field model and are characterized by well defined
critical exponents. However, such models provide only average properties of the
corresponding order parameters and neglect altogether their possible
fluctuations. Also the possible long range effect are neglected in the mean
field approach. Here we investigate the critical behavior in the nonextensive
version of the Nambu Jona-Lasinio model (NJL). It allows to account for such
effects in a phenomenological way by means of a single parameter $q$, the
nonextensivity parameter. In particular, we show how the nonextensive
statistics influence the region of the critical temperature and chemical
potential in the NJL mean field approach.
