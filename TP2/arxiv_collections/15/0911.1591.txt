A combined fit is performed to the BaBar and Belle measurements of the $\EE
\to \phi \pi^+ \pi^-$ and $\phi \fzero$ cross sections for center-of-mass
energy between threshold and 3.0 GeV. The resonance parameters of the
$\phi(1680)$ and Y(2175) are determined. The mass is $(1681^{+10}_{-12})$
MeV/$c^2$ and the width is $(221^{+34}_{-24})$ MeV/$c^2$ for the $\phi(1680)$,
and the mass is $(2117^{+59}_{-49})$ MeV/$c^2$ and the width is
$(164^{+69}_{-80})$ MeV/$c^2$ for the Y(2175). These information will shed
light on the understanding of the nature of the excited $\phi$ and $Y$ states
observed in $\EE$ annihilation.
