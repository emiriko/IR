We show that in a quantum wire the spin-orbit interaction leads to a narrow
spin resonance at low temperatures, even in the absence of an external magnetic
field. Resonance absorption by linearly polarized radiation gives a dc spin
current; resonance absorption by circularly polarized radiation gives a dc
electric current or magnetization.
