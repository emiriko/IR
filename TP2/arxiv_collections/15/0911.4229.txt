We report structural and magnetic properties of pure ZnO rods using X-ray
diffraction (XRD), magnetization hysteresis (M-H) loop and near edge x-ray fine
structure spectroscopy (NEXAFS) study at O K edge. Sample of ZnO was prepared
by co-precipitation method. XRD and selective area electron diffraction
measurements infer that ZnO rods exhibit a single phase polycrystalline nature
with wurtzite lattice. Field emission transmission electron microscopy, field
emission scanning electron microscopy micrographs infers that ZnO have rod type
microstructures with dimension 200 nm in diameter and 550 nm in length. M-H
loop studies performed at room temperature display room temperature
ferromagnetism in ZnO rods. NEXAFS study reflects absence of the oxygen
vacancies in pure ZnO rods.
