We have computed the full one-loop corrections (electroweak as well as QCD)
to processes contributing to the relic density of dark matter in the MSSM where
the LSP is the lightest neutralino. We cover scenarios where the most important
channels are those with gauge boson pair production. This includes the case of
a bino with some wino admixture, a higgsino and a wino. In this paper we
specialise to the case of light dark matter much below the TeV scale. The
corrections can have a non-negligible impact on the predictions and should be
taken into account in view of the present and forthcoming increasing precision
on the relic density measurements. Our calculations are made with the help of
\SloopS, an automatic tool for the calculation of one-loop processes in the
MSSM. The renormalisation scheme dependence of the results as concerns $\tgb$
is studied.
