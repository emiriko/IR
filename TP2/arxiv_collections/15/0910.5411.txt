We first consider a method of centering and a change of variable formula for
a quantum integral. We then present three types of quantum integrals. The first
considers the expectation of the number of heads in $n$ flips of a "quantum
coin". The next computes quantum integrals for destructive pairs examples. The
last computes quantum integrals for a (Lebesgue)^2 quantum measure. For this
last type we prove some quantum counterparts of the fundamental theorem of
calculus.
