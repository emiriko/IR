The blue straggler phenomenon is not yet well explained by current theory;
however, evolutionary models of star clusters call for a good knowledge of it.
Here we try to understand the possible formation scenario of HD 73666, a blue
straggler member of the Praesepe cluster. We compile the known physical
properties of HD 73666 found in the literature, focusing in particular on
possible binarity and the abundance pattern. HD 73666 appears to be slowly
rotating, has no detectable magnetic field, and has normal abundances, thereby
excluding close binary evolution and mass transfer processes. There is no
evidence of a hot radiation source. With the use of theoretical results on blue
straggler formation present in literature, we are able to conclude that HD
73666 was probably formed by physical collision involving at least one binary
system, between 5 and 350 Myr (50 Myr if the star is an intrinsic slow rotator)
ago.
