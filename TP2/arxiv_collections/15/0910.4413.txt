We report measurements of the effects of a random vector potential generated
by applying an in-plane magnetic field to a graphene flake. Magnetic flux
through the ripples cause orbital effects: phase-coherent weak localization is
suppressed, while quasi-random Lorentz forces lead to anisotropic
magnetoresistance. Distinct signatures of these two effects enable an
independent estimation of the ripple amplitude and correlation length.
