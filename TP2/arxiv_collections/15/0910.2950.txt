We present initial results of the use of Force Gradient integrators for
lattice field theories. These promise to give significant performance
improvements, especially for light fermions and large lattices. Our results
show that this is indeed the case, indicating a speed-up of more than a factor
of two, which is expected to increase as the integration step size becomes
smaller for larger lattices and smaller fermion masses.
