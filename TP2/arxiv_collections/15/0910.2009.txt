This paper is devoted to the study of the quasitriangularity of Hopf algebras
via Hopf quiver approaches. We give a combinatorial description of the Hopf
quivers whose path coalgebras give rise to coquasitriangular Hopf algebras.
With a help of the quiver setting, we study general coquasitriangular pointed
Hopf algebras and obtain a complete classification of the finite-dimensional
ones over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0.
