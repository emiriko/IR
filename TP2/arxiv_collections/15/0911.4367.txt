Revivals of electric current in graphene in the presence of an external
magnetic field are described. It is shown that when the electrons are prepared
in the form of wave packets assuming a Gaussian population of only positive (or
negative) energy Landau levels, the presence of the magnetic field induce
revivals of the electron currents, besides the classical cyclotron motion. When
the population comprises both positive and negative energy Landau levels,
revivals of the electric current manifest simultaneously with zitterbewegung
and the classical cyclotron motion. We relate the temporal scales of these
three effects and discuss to what extent these results hold for real graphene
samples.
