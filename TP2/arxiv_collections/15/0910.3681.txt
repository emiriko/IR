We explore the scenario in which the breaking of the electroweak symmetry is
due to the simultaneous presence and interplay of a dynamical sector and an
unnatural elementary Higgs. We introduce a low energy effective Lagrangian and
constrain the various couplings via direct search limits and electroweak and
flavor precision tests. We find that the model we study is a viable model of
dynamical breaking of the electroweak symmetry.
