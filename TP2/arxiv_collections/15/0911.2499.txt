We consider a biased molecular junction subjected to external time-dependent
electromagnetic field. The field for two typical junction geometries (bowtie
antennas and metal nanospheres) is calculated within finite-difference
time-domain technique. Time-dependent transport and optical response of the
junctions is calculated within non-equilibrium Green's function approach
expressed in a form convenient for description of multi-level systems. We
present numerical results for a two-level (HOMO-LUMO) model, and discuss
influence of localized surface plasmon polariton modes on transport.
