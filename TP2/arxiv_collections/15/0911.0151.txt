Content management systems use various strategies to store and manage
information. One of the most usual methods encountered in commercial products
is to make use of the file system to store the raw content information, while
the associated metadata is kept synchronized in a relational database
management system. This strategy has its advantages but we believe it also has
significant limitations which should be addressed and eventually solved. In
this paper we propose an alternative method of storing and managing content
aiming at finding solutions for current limitations both in terms of functional
and nonfunctional requirements.
