We present a brief survey of methods that utilize computer simulations and
quantum and statistical mechanics in the analysis of electrochemical systems.
The methods, Molecular Dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations and
quantum-mechanical density-functional theory, are illustrated with examples
from simulations of lithium-battery charging and electrochemical adsorption of
bromine on single-crystal silver electrodes.
