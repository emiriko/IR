In recent years lot of interest has been observed in the nucleus-nucleus
collisions at RHIC energies in phenomena related to high $p_{t}$ physics
\cite{ref1}. The suppression of high $p_{t}$ particles and disappearance of
back-to-back jets compared to the scaling with number of binary nucleon-nucleon
collisions indicates that a nearly perfect liquid is produced in these
collisions. Results on self shadowing of high $p_{t}$ events are presented
using hadron multiplicity associated to high $p_{t}$ and unbiased events in
nucleus-nucleus collisions \cite{ref2} obtained from the hijing event
generator.
