We propose a quantum model of dark energy. The proposed candidate for dark
energy is gluon field, as is well-known, gluons are the elementary particles.
We assume that gluons may not be completely massless but have tiny masses, thus
the gluon field can provide a non-zero energy-momentum tensor. This model
corresponds to Einstein's cosmological constant which is one of the generally
accepted models for dark energy. Besides the gluon field, we also discuss the
properties of electroweak boson field and compare our results with previous
known results.
