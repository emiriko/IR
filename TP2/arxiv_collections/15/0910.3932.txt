The multiconfiguration Dirac-Fock method allows to calculate the state of
relativistic electrons in atoms or molecules. This method has been known for a
long time to provide certain wrong predictions in the nonrelativistic limit. We
study in full mathematical details the nonlinear model obtained in the
nonrelativistic limit for Be-like atoms. We show that the method with sp+pd
configurations in the J=1 sector leads to a symmetry breaking phenomenon in the
sense that the ground state is never an eigenvector of L^2 or S^2. We thereby
complement and clarify some previous studies.
