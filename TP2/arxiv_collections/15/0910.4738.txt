Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic (PCTL) is a well-known modal logic which
has become a standard for expressing temporal properties of finite-state Markov
chains in the context of automated model checking. In this paper, we give a
definition of PCTL for noncountable-space Markov chains, and we show that there
is a substantial affinity between certain of its operators and problems of
Dynamic Programming. After proving some uniqueness properties of the solutions
to the latter, we conclude the paper with two examples to show that some
recovery strategies in practical applications, which are naturally stated as
reach-avoid problems, can be actually viewed as particular cases of PCTL
formulas.
