I propose the index $\hbar$ ("hbar"), defined as the number of papers of an
individual that have citation count larger than or equal to the $\hbar$ of all
coauthors of each paper, as a useful index to characterize the scientific
output of a researcher that takes into account the effect of multiple
coauthorship. The bar is higher for $\hbar$.
