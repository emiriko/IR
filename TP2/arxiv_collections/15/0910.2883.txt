Prominences are partially ionized, magnetized plasmas embedded in the solar
corona. Damped oscillations and propagating waves are commonly observed. These
oscillations have been interpreted in terms of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves.
Ion-neutral collisions and non-adiabatic effects (radiation losses and thermal
conduction) have been proposed as damping mechanisms. We study the effect of
the presence of helium on the time damping of non-adiabatic MHD waves in a
plasma composed by electrons, protons, neutral hydrogen, neutral helium (He I),
and singly ionized helium (He II) in the single-fluid approximation. The
dispersion relation of linear non-adiabatic MHD waves in a homogeneous,
unbounded, and partially ionized prominence medium is derived. The period and
the damping time of Alfven, slow, fast, and thermal waves are computed. A
parametric study of the ratio of the damping time to the period with respect to
the helium abundance is performed. The efficiency of ion-neutral collisions as
well as thermal conduction is increased by the presence of helium. However, if
realistic abundances of helium in prominences (~10%) are considered, this
effect has a minor influence on the wave damping. The presence of helium can be
safely neglected in studies of MHD waves in partially ionized prominence
plasmas.
