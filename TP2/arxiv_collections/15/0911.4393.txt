From bird flocks to fish schools, animal groups often seem to react to
environmental perturbations as if of one mind. Most studies in collective
animal behaviour have aimed to understand how a globally ordered state may
emerge from simple behavioural rules. Less effort has been devoted to
understanding the origin of collective response, namely the way the group as a
whole reacts to its environment. Yet collective response is the adaptive key to
survivor, especially when strong predatory pressure is present. Here we argue
that collective response in animal groups is achieved through scale-free
behavioural correlations. By reconstructing the three-dimensional position and
velocity of individual birds in large flocks of starlings, we measured to what
extent the velocity fluctuations of different birds are correlated to each
other. We found that the range of such spatial correlation does not have a
constant value, but it scales with the linear size of the flock. This result
indicates that behavioural correlations are scale-free: the change in the
behavioural state of one animal affects and is affected by that of all other
animals in the group, no matter how large the group is. Scale-free correlations
extend maximally the effective perception range of the individuals, thus
compensating for the short-range nature of the direct inter-individual
interaction and enhancing global response to perturbations. Our results suggest
that flocks behave as critical systems, poised to respond maximally to
environmental perturbations.
