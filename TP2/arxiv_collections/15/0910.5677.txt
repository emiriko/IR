We compute the Andreev reflection coefficient of a flux of thermal
quasiparticles in He3-B incident upon various two-dimensional vortex
configurations. We find that, for the same number of positive and negative
vortex points, the reflection coefficient is much reduced if the points are
arranged in pairs (which corresponds to a gas of vortex rings in
three-dimensions) rather than random (which corresponds to a vortex tangle in
three-dimensions). This results is consistent with measurements performed by
Bradley et al. at the University of Lancaster.
