We develop a marking system for an analog of Hasse diagrams of intervals
$[u,v]$ with $u\leq v$ in a Hermitian symmetric pair $W/W_J$, and use this to
create a closed form algorithm for computing relative R-polynomials. The
uniform nature of this algorithm allows us to show combinatorial invariance of
relative Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials in the Hermitian symmetric space setting.
