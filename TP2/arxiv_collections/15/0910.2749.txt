We address the question whether the lightest scalar mesons sigma and kappa
are tetraquarks, as is strongly supported by many phenomenological studies. We
present a search for possible light tetraquark states with J^PC=0^++ and I=0,
1/2, 3/2, 2 on the lattice. The spectrum is determined using the generalized
eigenvalue method with a number of tetraquark interpolators at the source and
the sink. In all the channels, we unavoidably find lowest scattering states
pi(k)pi(-k) or K(k)pi(-k) with back-to-back momentum k=0,2*pi/L,.. . However,
we find an additional light state in the I=0 and I=1/2 channels, which may be
related to the observed resonances sigma and kappa with a strong tetraquark
component. In the exotic repulsive channels I=2 and I=3/2, where no resonance
is observed, we find no light state in addition to the scattering states.
