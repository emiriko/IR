In [15] we proposed a set of sufficient conditions for the approximate
controllability of a discrete-spectrum bilinear Schr\"odinger equation. These
conditions are expressed in terms of the controlled potential and of the
eigenpairs of the uncontrolled Schr\"odinger operator. The aim of this paper is
to show that these conditions are generic with respect to the uncontrolled and
the controlled potential, denoted respectively by $V$ and $W$. More precisely,
we prove that the Schr\"odinger equation is approximately controllable
generically with respect to $W$ when $V$ is fixed and also generically with
respect to $V$ when $W$ is fixed and non-constant. The results are obtained by
analytic perturbation arguments and through the study of asymptotic properties
of eigenfunctions.
