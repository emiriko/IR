We present evidence for an identical behavior of the precession of the
accretion disk and that of the neutron star (NS) in Her X-1, based on
investigating the well established 35 day modulation in Her X-1 in two
different ways: 1) following the turn-ons, thought to be due to the precession
of the accretion disk, and 2) following the re-appearance of the shape of the
pulse profiles, which we assume to be due to precession of the NS. The turn-on
evolution and the evolution of the phase-zero values of the precessing NS (as
determined from the pulse profiles) track each other very closely. Since the
turn-on evolution is strongly correlated with the pulse period evolution, this
means that there is also a strong correlation between the spin and the
precession of the NS. There is a very strong physical coupling between the NS
and the accretion disk, we suggest through physical feedback in the binary
system. The apparent long-term stability of the 35 d clock may be due to the
interior of the NS, the coupling of which to the observable surface effects is
of general importance for the physics of super-dense, highly magnetized
material.
