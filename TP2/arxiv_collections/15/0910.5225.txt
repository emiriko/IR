V371 Per was found to be a double-mode Cepheid with a fundamental mode period
of 1.738 days, the shortest among Galactic beat Cepheids, and an unusually high
period ratio of 0.731, while the other Galactic beat Cepheids have period
ratios between 0.697 and 0.713. The latter suggests that the star has a
metallicity [Fe/H] between -1 and -0.7. The derived distance from the Galactic
Plane places it in the Thick Disk or the Halo, while all other Galactic beat
Cepheids belong to the Thin Disk. There are indications from historical data
that both the fundamental and first overtone periods have lengthened.
