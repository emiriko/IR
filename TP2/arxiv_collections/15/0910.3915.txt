Droplets on hydrophobic surfaces are ubiquitous in microfluidic applications
and there exists a number of commonly used multicomponent and multiphase
lattice Boltzmann schemes to study such systems. In this paper we focus on a
popular implementation of a multicomponent model as introduced by Shan and
Chen. Here, interactions between different components are implemented as
repulsive forces whose strength is determined by model parameters. In this
paper we present simulations of a droplet on a hydrophobic surface. We
investigate the dependence of the contact angle on the simulation parameters
and quantitatively compare different approaches to determine it. Results show
that the method is capable of modelling the whole range of contact angles. We
find that the a priori determination of the contact angle is depending on the
simulation parameters with an uncertainty of 10 to 20%.
