These lectures discuss the question of whether a key feature is seen in
hadron spectroscopy--the near degeneracy of hadrons with different parity
and/or spin. It has been conjectured that this is due to an effective
restoration of chiral symmetry. The conjecture is that while these states are,
of course, in the symmetry-broken (Nambu-Goldstone) phase, as one goes higher
in the spectrum the states become progressively less sensitive to the dynamics
of chiral symmetry breaking. These lectures discuss the current status of this
conjecture. The motivations for the conjecture are discussed, as is
evidence--both theoretical and experimental--in its favor. Possible alternative
explanations for the data are also discussed.
