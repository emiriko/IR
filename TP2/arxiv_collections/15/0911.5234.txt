I consider a high-Q beta beam peaking at multi-GeV energy for the baseline
CERN-Pyh\"asalmi, with the length of 2288 km, using LENA, a 50 kton liquid
scintillator as the far detector. The beta beam is assumed to be accompanied by
a conventional wide band beam of 1--6 GeV. This combination turns out to be
very powerful to measure neutrino parameters if $\sin^2 2\theta_{13}\sim
(1...3)\cdot 10^{-3}$.
