Given a fixed binary form $f(u,v)$ of degree $d$ over a field $k$, the
associated \emph{Clifford algebra} is the $k$-algebra $C_f=k\{u,v\}/I$, where
$I$ is the two-sided ideal generated by elements of the form $(\alpha u+\beta
v)^{d}-f(\alpha,\beta)$ with $\alpha$ and $\beta$ arbitrary elements in $k$.
All representations of $C_f$ have dimensions that are multiples of $d$, and
occur in families. In this article we construct fine moduli spaces $U=U_{f,r}$
for the irreducible $rd$-dimensional representations of $C_f$ for each $r \geq
2$. Our construction starts with the projective curve $C \subset
\mathbb{P}^{2}_{k}$ defined by the equation $w^d=f(u,v)$, and produces
$U_{f,r}$ as a quasiprojective variety in the moduli space $\mathcal{M}(r,d_r)$
of stable vector bundles over $C$ with rank $r$ and degree $d_r=r(d+g-1)$,
where $g$ denotes the genus of $C$.
