We report an analysis of neutron diffraction from single crystals of the
spin-liquid pyrochlore Tb2Ti2O7 under the application of magnetic fields along
the crystallographic $[110]$ direction. Such a perturbation has been shown to
destroy the spin liquid ground state and induce long-range order, although the
nature of the ordered state was not immediately determined. Recently, it has
been proposed that the ordered state is characterized by spin-ice-like
correlations, evincing an emergent ferromagnetic tendency in this material
despite the large negative Curie-Weiss constant. Here, we argue instead that
the ordered state is dominated by $Q \neq 0$ correlations that emerge either
from strong antiferromagnetism or magnetoelastic distortion of the crystal. In
contrast to previous reports, we observe no evidence for re-entrant behaviour
in the high field limit. Extreme sensitivity of the ordered state to the
alignment of the applied field is suggested to account for these discrepancies.
