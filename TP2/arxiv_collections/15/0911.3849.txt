In the present work, we search static charged black hole solutions to
Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity with or without projectability condition. We
consider the most general form of action which electromagnetic field couples
with Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity. With the projectability condition, we find
dS-Reissner-Nordstrom black hole solution in Painlev\'e-Gullstrand type
coordinates in the IR region and a de-Sitter space-time solution in the UV
region. Without the projectability condition, in the IR region, we find an
especial static charged black hole solution.
