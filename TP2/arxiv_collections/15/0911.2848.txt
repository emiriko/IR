It is well known that many operations in quantum information processing
depend largely on a special kind of quantum correlation, that is, entanglement.
However, there are also quantum tasks that display the quantum advantage
without entanglement. Distinguishing classical and quantum correlations in
quantum systems is therefore of both fundamental and practical importance. In
consideration of the unavoidable interaction between correlated systems and the
environment, understanding the dynamics of correlations would stimulate great
interest. In this study, we investigate the dynamics of different kinds of
bipartite correlations in an all-optical experimental setup. The sudden change
in behaviour in the decay rates of correlations and their immunity against
certain decoherences are shown. Moreover, quantum correlation is observed to be
larger than classical correlation, which disproves the early conjecture that
classical correlation is always greater than quantum correlation. Our
observations may be important for quantum information processing.
