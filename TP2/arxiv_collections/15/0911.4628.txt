A consistent theory to describe the correlated dynamics of quantum mechanical
itinerant spins and semiclassical local magnetization is given. We consider the
itinerant spins as quantum mechanical operators, whereas local moments are
considered within classical Lagrangian formalism. By appropriately treating
fluctuation space spanned by basis functions, including a zero-mode wave
function, we construct coupled equations of motion for the collective
coordinate of the center-of-mass motion and the localized zero-mode coordinate
perpendicular to the domain wall plane. By solving them, we demonstrate that
the correlated dynamics is understood through a hierarchy of two time scales:
Boltzmann relaxation time when a non-adiabatic part of the spin-transfer torque
appears, and Gilbert damping time when adiabatic part comes up.
