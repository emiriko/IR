Quantum nonlocality is typically assigned to systems of two or more well
separated particles, but nonlocality can also exist in systems consisting of
just a single particle, when one considers the subsystems to be distant spatial
field modes. Single particle nonlocality has been confirmed experimentally via
a bipartite Bell inequality. In this paper, we introduce an N-party Hardy-like
proof of impossibility of local elements of reality and a Bell inequality for
local realistic theories for a single particle superposed symmetrical over N
spatial field modes (i.e. a N qubit W state). We show that, in the limit of
large N, the Hardy-like proof effectively becomes an all-versus nothing (or
GHZ-like) proof, and the quantum-classical gap of the Bell inequality tends to
be same of the one in a three-particle GHZ experiment. We detail how to test
the nonlocality in realistic systems.
