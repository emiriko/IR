The distribution of interstellar dust grains (ISDG) observed in the Solar
System depends on the nature of the interstellar medium-solar wind interaction.
The charge of the grains couples them to the interstellar magnetic field (ISMF)
resulting in some fraction of grains being excluded from the heliosphere while
grains on the larger end of the size distribution, with gyroradii comparable to
the size of the heliosphere, penetrate the termination shock. This results in a
skewing the size distribution detected in the Solar System.
  We present new calculations of grain trajectories and the resultant grain
density distribution for small ISDGs propagating through the heliosphere. We
make use of detailed heliosphere model results, using three-dimensional (3-D)
magnetohydrodynamic/kinetic models designed to match data on the shape of the
termination shock and the relative deflection of interstellar neutral H and He
flowing into the heliosphere. We find that the necessary inclination of the
ISMF relative to the inflow direction results in an asymmetry in the
distribution of the larger grains (0.1 micron) that penetrate the heliopause.
Smaller grains (0.01 micron) are completely excluded from the Solar System at
the heliopause.
