Conical inclusions in a lipid bilayer generate an overall spontaneous
curvature of the membrane that depends on concentration and geometry of the
inclusions. Examples are integral and attached membrane proteins, viruses, and
lipid domains. We propose an analytical model to study budding and vesiculation
of the lipid bilayer membrane, which is based on the membrane bending energy
and the translational entropy of the inclusions. If the inclusions are placed
on a membrane with similar curvature radius, their repulsive membrane-mediated
interaction is screened. Therefore, for high inclusion density the inclusions
aggregate, induce bud formation, and finally vesiculation. Already with the
bending energy alone our model allows the prediction of bud radii. However, in
case the inclusions induce a single large vesicle to split into two smaller
vesicles, bending energy alone predicts that the smaller vesicles have
different sizes whereas the translational entropy favors the formation of
equal-sized vesicles. Our results agree well with those of recent computer
simulations.
