In our continuous variable quantum key distribution (QKD) scheme, the
homodyne detection set-up requires balancing the intensity of an incident beam
between two photodiodes. Realistic lens systems are insufficient to provide a
spatially stable focus in the presence of large spatial beam-jitter caused by
atmospheric transmission. We therefore present an improved geometry for optical
tapers which offer up to four times the angular tolerance of a lens. The
effective area of a photodiode can thus be increased, without decreasing its
bandwidth. This makes them suitable for use in our free space QKD experiment
and in free space optical communication in general.
