[Abridged]We exploit a large homogeneous dataset to derive a self-consistent
picture of IR emission based on the time-dependent 24, 15, 12 and 8micron
monochromatic and bolometric IR luminosity functions (LF) over the 0<z<2.5
redshift range. Our analysis is based on the combination of data from deep
Spitzer surveys in the VVDS-SWIRE and GOODS areas. To our limiting flux of
S(24)=400microJy our derived sample in VVDS-SWIRE includes 1494 sources, and
666 and 904 sources brighter than S(24)=80microJy are catalogued in GOODS-S and
GOODS-N, respectively, for a total area of ~0.9 square degs. We obtain reliable
optical identifications and redshifts, providing us a rich and robust dataset
for our luminosity function determination. Based on the multi-wavelength
information available, we constrain the LFs at 8, 12, 15 and 24micron. We also
extrapolate total IR luminosities from our best-fit to the observed SEDs of
each source, and use this to derive the bolometric LF and comoving volume
emissivity up to z~2.5. In the 0<z<1 interval, the bolometric IR luminosity
density evolves as (1+z)^3.8+/-0.4. Although more uncertain at higher-z, our
results show a flattening of the IR luminosity density at z>1. The mean
redshift of the peak in the source number density shifts with luminosity: the
brighest IR galaxies appear to be forming stars earlier in cosmic time (z>1.5),
while the less luminous ones keep doing it at more recent epochs (z~1 for
L(IR)<10^11L_sun). Our results suggest a rapid increase of the galaxy IR
comoving volume emissivity back to z~1 and a constant average emissivity at
z>1. We also seem to find a difference in the evolution rate of the source
number densities as a function of luminosity, a downsizing evolutionary pattern
similar to that reported from other samples of cosmic sources.
