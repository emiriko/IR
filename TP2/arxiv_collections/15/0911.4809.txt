We investigate the dynamics of polymer translocation through nanopores under
external driving by 3D Langevin Dynamics simulations, focusing on the scaling
of the average translocation time $\tau$ versus the length of the polymer,
$\tau\sim N^{\alpha}$. For slow translocation, i.e., under low driving force
and/or high friction, we find $\alpha \approx 1+\nu \approx 1.588$ where $\nu$
denotes the Flory exponent. In contrast, $\alpha\approx 1.37$ is observed for
fast translocation due to the highly deformed chain conformation on the trans
side, reflecting a pronounced non-equilibrium situation. The dependence of the
translocation time on the driving force is given by $\tau \sim F^{-1}$ and
$\tau \sim F^{-0.80}$ for slow and fast translocation, respectively. These
results clarify the controversy on the magnitude of the scaling exponent
$\alpha$ for driven translocation.
