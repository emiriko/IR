The Triple Helix of university-industry-government relations is elaborated
into a systemic model that accounts for interactions among three dimensions. By
distinguishing between the respective micro-operations, this model enables us
to recombine the "Mode 2" thesis of a new production of scientific knowledge
and the study of systems of innovation with the neo-classical perspective on
the dynamics of the market. The mutual information in three dimensions provides
us with an indicator for the self-organization of the resulting network
systems. The probabilistic entropy in this mutual information can be negative
in knowledge-based configurations. The knowledge base of an economy can be
considered as a second-order interaction effect among interactions at
interfaces between institutions and functions in different spheres. Proximity
enhances the chances for couplings and, therefore, the formation of
technological trajectories. The next-order regime of the knowledge base,
however, can be expected to remain pending as selection pressure.
