We analyze the statistics of the electromagnetic radiation emitted from
electrons pushed through a quantum point contact. We consider a setup
implemented in a two-dimenional electron gas (2DEG) where the radiation
manifests itself in terms of 2D plasmons emitted from electrons scattered at
the point contact. The bosonic statistics of the plasmons competes with the
fermionic statistics of the electrons; as a result, the quantum point contact
emits non-classical radiation with a statistics which can be tuned from
bunching to anti-bunching by changing the driving voltage. Our perturbative
calculation of the irreducible two-plasmon probability correlator provides us
with information on the statistical nature of the emitted plasmons and on the
underlying electronic current flow.
