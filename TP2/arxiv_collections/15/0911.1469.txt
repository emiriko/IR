We present the status and prospects of Higgs searches at the Tevatron and the
LHC. Results from the Tevatron are using up to 5/fb of data collected with the
CDF and D0 detectors. The major contributing processes include associated
production with vector bosons and gluon fusion. Improvements across the full
mass range resulting from the larger data sets, improved analyses techniques
and increased signal acceptance are discussed. Recent results exclude the SM
Higgs boson in a mass range of 160 < mH < 170 GeV. Searches for the neutral
MSSM Higgs boson in the region 90 < mA < 200 GeV exclude tanB values down to 30
for several benchmark scenarios.
