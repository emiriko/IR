We present evidence of magnetic ordering in type-II (Zn, Mn) Te quantum dots.
This ordering is attributed to the formation of bound magnetic polarons caused
by the exchange interaction between the strongly localized holes and Mn within
the dots. In our photoluminescence studies, the magnetic polarons are detected
at temperatures up to ~ 200 K, with a binding energy of ~ 40 meV. In addition,
these dots display an unusually small Zeeman shift with applied field (2 meV at
10 T). This behavior is explained by a small and weakly temperature-dependent
magnetic susceptibility due to anti-ferromagnetic coupling of the Mn spins.
