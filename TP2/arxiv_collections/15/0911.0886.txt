We study the SU(3) lattice gauge theory, with two flavors of sextet
Wilson-clover fermions, near its finite-temperature phase transition. We find
metastable states that have Wilson line expectation values whose complex phases
are near 2pi/3 or pi. The true equilibrium phase at these couplings and
temperatures has its Wilson line oriented only towards the positive real axis,
in agreement with perturbation theory.
