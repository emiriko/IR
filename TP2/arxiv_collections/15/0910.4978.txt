Compact groups of galaxies are in particular good laboratories for studying
galaxy interactions and their effects on the evolution of galaxies due to their
high density and low velocity dispersion. SCG0018-4854 is a remarkably high
galaxy density and low velocity dispersion group with evidence of a recent
interaction. We obtained VLT FORS2 optical observations and we present
spectroscopic and photometric evidence of how dramatically galaxy interactions
have affected each of the four member galaxies. We found peculiar kinematics
for each galaxy and evidence of recent star formation. In particular, the gas
and stellar radial velocity curves of two galaxies are irregular with a level
of asymmetry similar to that of other interacting galaxies. We discovered the
presence of a bar for NGC 92 therefore revising a previous morphological
classification and we obtained spectroscopic confirmation of a galactic-scale
outflow of NGC 89. Peculiar kinematics and dynamic consideration lead to a
rough estimate of the age of the latest interaction: 0.2-0.7 Gyr, suggesting
that SCG0018-4854 is a young and dynamical group.
