We have imaged spontaneously created arrays of vortices (magnetic flux
quanta), generated in a superconducting film quenched through its transition
temperature at rates around $10^9 K/s$. Spontaneous appearance of vortices is
predicted by Kibble-Zurek and by Hindmarsh-Rajantie models of phase transitions
under non-equilibrium conditions. Differentiating between these models requires
a measurement of the internal correlations within the emerging vortex array. In
addition to short range correlations predicted by Kibble and Zurek, we found
unexpected long range correlations which are not described by any of the
existing models.
