Analytical solution of one dimensional hydrodynamical model is derived, where
phase transition from the QGP state to the hadronic state is effectively taken
into account. The single particle rapidity distribution of charged $\pi$ mesons
observed in relativistic heavy ion collisions is analyzed by the model.
Space-time development of the fluid is also investigated.
