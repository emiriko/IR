We consider the black hole solutions of five-dimensional gravity with a
Gauss-Bonnet term in the bulk and an induced gravity term on a 2-brane of
codimension-2. Applying the Kerr-Schild method we derive additional solutions
which include charge and angular momentum. To improve our understanding of this
geometry we study the geodesic structure of such spacetimes.
