The comparison of samples with different number of charged leptons shows that
trilepton signals are the most significant ones for seesaw mediators. As
previously pointed out, this is indeed the case for scalar (type II) and
fermion (type III) triplets at LHC, which can be discovered in this channel for
masses up to 500-700 GeV and an integrated luminosity of 30 fb^-1; whereas
fermion singlets (type I) are marginally observable if there are no further new
physics near the TeV scale. However, if there are new gauge interactions at
this scale coupling to right-handed neutrinos, as in left-right models, heavy
neutrinos are observable up to masses ~ 2 TeV for new gauge boson masses up to
~ 4 TeV, as we discuss in some detail.
