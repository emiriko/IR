We have theoretically and experimentally address the possible tandem
electro-optical modulator configurations that can be employed to implement
Frequency Coded Quantum Key Distribution systems (FC-QKD). A closed and general
formulation of the end to end field propagation in a dispersion compensated
FC-QKD optical fiber system under the low modulation index regime is presented
which accounts for all the possible tandem combinations. The properties and the
parameter selection of the modulators to achieve each one are summarized. We
also address which protocol (B92, BB84 or either) is feasible to be implemented
with each configuration. The results confirm those reported for the
configurations previously reported in the literature and, at the same time,
show the existence of four novel tandem modulator configurations that can also
be employed. We have also provided experimental evidence of the successful
operation of the novel configurations that confirm the behavior predicted by
the theoretical results.
