MD simulations of methane confined between graphite walls with up to
4,800,000 interaction sites, i.e., carbon atoms and methane molecules, are
conducted, where the channel width is varied to include both the
boundary-dominated regime and the transition to the continuum regime. This
proves that MD can be used today to cover the entire range of characteristic
lengths for which continuum methods fail.
