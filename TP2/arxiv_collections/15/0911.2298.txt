We investigate the finite-temperature spectral functions of heavy quarkonia
by using the soft-wall AdS/QCD model. We discuss the scalar, the pseudo-scalar,
the vector, and the axial-vector mesons and compare their qualitative features
of the melting temperature and growing width. We find that the axial-vector
meson melts earlier than the vector meson, while there appears only a slight
difference between the scalar and pseudo-scalar mesons which also melt earlier
than the vector meson.
