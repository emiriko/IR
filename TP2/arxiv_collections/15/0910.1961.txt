For the super AKNS system, an implicit symmetry constraint between the
potentials and the eigenfunctions is proposed. After introducing some new
variables to explicitly express potentials, the super AKNS system is decomposed
into two compatible finite-dimensional super systems (x-part and $t_n$-part).
Furthermore, we show that the obtained super systems are integrable super
Hamiltonian systems in supersymmetry manifold $\mathbb{R}^{4N+2|2N+2}$.
