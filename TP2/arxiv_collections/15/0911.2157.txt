This paper attempts to make feasible the evolutionary emergence of novelty in
a supposedly deterministic world which behavior is associated with those of the
mathematical dynamical systems. The work was motivated by the observation of
complex oscillatory behaviors in a family of physical devices, for which there
is no known explanation in the mainstream of nonlinear dynamics. The paper
begins by describing a nonlinear mechanism of oscillatory mode mixing
explaining such behaviors and establishes a generic dynamical scenario with
extraordinary oscillatory possibilities, including expansive growing
scalability. The relation of the scenario to the oscillatory behaviors of
turbulent fluids and living brains is discussed. Finally, by considering the
scenario as a dynamic substrate underlying generic aspects of both the
functioning and the genesis of complexity in a supposedly deterministic world,
a theoretical framework covering the evolutionary development of structural
transformations in the time evolution of that world is built up.
