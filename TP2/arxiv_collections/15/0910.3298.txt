We show how the charge input signal applied to the gate electrode in a double
and triple quantum dot may be converted to a pulse in the Kondo cotunneling
current being a spin response of a nano-device under a strong Coulomb blockade.
The stochastic component of the input signal results in the infrared cutoff of
Kondo transmission. The stochastization of the orbital component of the Kondo
effect in triple quantum dots results in a noise-induced SU(4) - SU(2) quantum
transition.
