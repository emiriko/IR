In recent years we have been witnessing the discovery of one extrasolar gas
giant after another. Now the time has come to detect more low-mass planets like
Super-Earths and Earth-like objects. An interesting question to ask is: where
should we look for them? We have explored here the possibility of finding
Super-Earths in the close vicinity of gas giants, as a result of the early
evolution of planetary systems. For this purpose, we have considered a young
planetary system containing a Super-Earth and a gas giant, both embedded in a
protoplanetary disc. We have shown that, if the Super-Earth is on the internal
orbit relative to the gas giant, the planets can easily become locked in a mean
motion resonance. This is no longer true, however, if the Super-Earth is on the
external orbit. In this case we have obtained that the low-mass planet is
captured in a trap at the outer edge of the gap opened by the giant planet and
no first order mean motion commensurabilities are expected. Our investigations
might be particularly useful for the observational TTV (Transit Timing
Variation) technique.
