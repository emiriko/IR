We study the angle-resolved spontaneous emission of near-infrared light
sources in 3D photonic crystals over a wavelength range from 1200 to 1550 nm.
To this end PbSe quantum dots are used as light sources inside titania inverse
opal photonic crystals. Strong deviations from the Lambertian emission profile
are observed. An attenuation of 60 % is observed in the angle dependent radiant
flux emitted from the samples due to photonic stop bands. At angles that
correspond to the edges of the stop band the emitted flux is increased by up to
34 %. This increase is explained by the redistribution of Bragg-diffracted
light over the available escape angles. The results are quantitatively
explained by an expanded escape-function model. This model is based on
diffusion theory and adapted to photonic crystals using band structure
calculations. Our results are the first angular redistributions and escape
functions measured at near-infrared, including telecom, wavelengths. In
addition, this is the first time for this model to be applied to describe
emission from samples that are optically thick for the excitation light and
relatively thin for the photoluminesence light.
