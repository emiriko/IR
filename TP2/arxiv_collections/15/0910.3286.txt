A concept of the total velocity that contains velocity and oscillatory
velocity is proposed for the velocity solution of Dirac equation. It is shown
that the electronic rest energy all comes from the oscillation of the electron
itself. For this reason, the velocity solution of Dirac equation is taken as
the definition of elementary particles. Leptons, mesons and baryons appear in
results as the newly defined elementary particles, but the particle that
consists of more than three quarks is ruled out. The results also show that a
quark is not a particle, but part of the hadron or a partial particle and that
quark confinement may serve as an evidence of this conclusion.
