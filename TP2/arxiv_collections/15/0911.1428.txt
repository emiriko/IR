An induced gravity brane-world model is considered herein. A Gauss-Bonnet
term is provided for the bulk, whereas phantom matter is present on the brane.
It is shown that a combination of infra-red and ultra-violet modifications to
general relativity replaces a big rip singularity: A sudden singularity emerges
instead. Using current observational data, we also determine a range of values
for the cosmic time corresponding to the sudden singularity occurrence.
