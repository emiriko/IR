Faraday Rotation Measure (RM) Synthesis, as a method for analyzing
multi-channel observations of polarized radio emission to investigate galactic
magnetic fields structures, requires the definition of complex polarized
intensity in the range of the negative lambda square. We introduce a simple
method for continuation of the observed complex polarized intensity into this
domain using symmetry arguments. The method is suggested in context of magnetic
field recognition in galactic disks where the magnetic field is supposed to
have a maximum in the equatorial plane. The method is quite simple when applied
to a single Faraday-rotating structure on the line of sight. Recognition of
several structures on the same line of sight requires a more sophisticated
technique. We also introduce a wavelet-based algorithm which allows us to
consider a set of isolated structures. The method essentially improves the
possibilities for reconstruction of complicated Faraday structures using the
capabilities of modern radio telescopes.
