The intrinsic doping level of graphene prepared by mechanical exfoliation and
standard lithography procedures on thermally oxidized silicon varies
significantly and seems to depend strongly on processing details and the
substrate morphology. Moreover, transport properties of such graphene devices
suffer from hysteretic behavior under ambient conditions. The hysteresis
presumably originates from dipolar adsorbates on the substrate or graphene
surface. Here, we demonstrate that it is possible to reliably obtain low
intrinsic doping levels and to strongly suppress hysteretic behavior even in
ambient air by depositing graphene on top of a thin, hydrophobic self assembled
layer of hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS). The HMDS serves as a reproducible
template that prevents the adsorption of dipolar substances. It may also screen
the influence of substrate deficiencies.
