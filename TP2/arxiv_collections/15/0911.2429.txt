We have characterized two state-of-the-art solid-state photomultipliers, one
by SensL, the other by Hamamatsu, coupled to scintillators by Saint-Gobain
Crystals in the -25 to 50 degrees C temperature range. At room temperature, the
energy resolution at 661.6 keV measured with both detectors is worse than the
resolution obtained when the crystals are coupled to a regular photomultiplier
tube. Both the pulse height and pulse height resolution of the 661.6 keV gamma
rays in the 137Cs spectrum vary strongly with temperature. The noise threshold
determined from the 22Na spectrum increases quadratically as the temperature is
increased to well above 100 keV at +50 degrees C for both detectors.
