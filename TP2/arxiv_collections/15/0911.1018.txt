We investigate the possibility to explain the MiniBooNE anomaly by CPT and
Lorentz symmetry violating neutrino-antineutrino oscillations in a two
generation framework. We work with four non-zero CPT-violating parameters that
allow for resonant enhancements in neutrino-antineutrino oscillation phenomena
in vacuo which are suitably described in terms of charge conjugation
eigenstates of the system. We study the relation between the flavor, charge
conjugation and mass eigenbasis of neutrino-antineutrino oscillations and
examine the interplay between the available CPT-violating parameter space and
possible resonance structures.
