Recent progress in theories of quantum information has determined
nonclassical correlation defined differently from widely-used entanglement as
an important property to evaluate computation and communication with mixed
quantum states. We introduce an operational method to detect nonclassical
correlation of bipartite systems. In this method, we use particular maps
analogous to the well-established entanglement witnesses. Thus, the maps are
called nonclassical correlation witness maps. Furthermore, it is proved that
such a map can be generally decomposed so that a single-run experiment is
feasible for implementation in bulk-ensemble systems.
