We investigate the role of the nucleon recoil for antikaon-deuteron
scattering using EFT. In particular, we show that the leading correction to the
static term that appears at order $\xi^{1/2}$ (where $\xi=m_K/M_N$) cancels
completely in the double scattering process. We calculate the higher order
recoil corrections and study the pattern of convergence of the expansion
method. We find that the recoil correction to the double scattering process is
of order of 10-15% of the static contribution.
