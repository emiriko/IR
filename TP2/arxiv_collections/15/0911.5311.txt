We report a classical interatomic force field for TiO$_2$, which has been
parameterized using density functional theory forces, energies, and stresses in
the rutile crystal structure. The reliability of this new classical potential
is tested by evaluating the structural properties, equation of state, phonon
properties, thermal expansion, and some thermodynamic quantities such as
entropy, free energy, and specific heat under constant volume. The good
agreement of our results with {\em ab initio} calculations and with
experimental data, indicates that our force-field describes the atomic
interactions of TiO$_2$ in the rutile structure very well. The force field can
also describe the structures of the brookite and anatase crystals with good
accuracy.
