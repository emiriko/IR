We explore the implications of SU(3) flavor symmetry in the soft handbag
mechanism for two-photon annihilation into pairs of pseudoscalar octet mesons.
In this approach we obtain a good description of the experimental results for
all measured channels at high energy, with two complex form factors adjusted to
the data. We also predict the cross section for gamma gamma -> eta eta.
