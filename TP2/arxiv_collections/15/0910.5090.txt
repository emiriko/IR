Theoretical background of our proposed relation between the accelerating
universe and the time-variability of the fine-structure constant is discussed,
based on the scalar-tensor theory, with emphases on the intuitive aspects of
underlying physical principles. An important comment is added on the successful
understanding of the size of the effective cosmological constant responsible
for the acceleration, without appealing to fine-tuning parameters.
