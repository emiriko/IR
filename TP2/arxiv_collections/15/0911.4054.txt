Rare B decays allow to investigate fundamental interactions regarding their
flavor, chiral, Dirac and CP properties. In anticipation of the large data
samples of exclusive B decays into muons from the forthcoming LHC experiments,
in particular LHCb, as well as possible super flavor factories, we review the
theoretical status and outline future opportunities to explore the borders of
the Standard Model and beyond.
