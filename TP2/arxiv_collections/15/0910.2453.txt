We give a sufficient condition for the existence of a quadratic exponential
vector with test function in L2(Rd) ? L?(Rd). We prove the linear independence
and totality, in the quadratic Fock space, of these vectors. Using a technique
different from the one used, we also extend, to a more general class of test
functions, the explicit form of the scalar product between two such vectors.
