Using analytic arguments, we show that dynamical attractor periods in large
critical Boolean networks are power-law distributed. Our arguments are based on
the method of relevant components, which focuses on the behavior of the nodes
that control the dynamics of the entire network and thus determine the
attractors. Assuming that the attractor period is equal to the least common
multiple of the size of all relevant components, we show that the distribution
in large networks is well approximated by a power-law with an exponent of -1.
Numerical evidence based on sampling of attractors supports the conclusions of
our analytic arguments.
