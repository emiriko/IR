We solve the conjecture posed by Fill, Scheinerman and Singer-Cohen and show
the equivalence of the sharp threshold functions of the random intersection
graph G(n,m,p) with $m >= n^3$ and a graph in which each edge appears
independently. Moreover we prove sharper equivalence results under some
additional assumptions.
