We report Bose-Einstein condensation of 84-Sr in an optical dipole trap.
Efficient laser cooling on the narrow intercombination line and an ideal s-wave
scattering length allow creation of large condensates (N0 ~ 3x10^5) even though
the natural abundance of this isotope is only 0.6%. Condensation is heralded by
the emergence of a low-velocity component in time-of-flight images.
