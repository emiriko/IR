Neutrino-neutrino interactions inside core-collapse supernovae may give rise
to collective flavor oscillations resulting in swap between flavors. These
oscillations depend on the initial energy spectra, and relative fluxes or
relative luminosities of the neutrinos. It has been observed that departure
from energy equipartition among different flavors can give rise to one or more
sharp spectral swap over energy, termed as splits. We study the occurrence of
splits in the neutrino and antineutrino spectra, varying the initial relative
fluxes for different models of initial energy spectrum, in both normal and
inverted hierarchy. These initial relative flux variations give rise to several
possible split patterns whereas variation over different models of energy
spectra give similar results. We explore the effect of these spectral splits on
the electron fraction, $Y_e$, that governs r-process nucleosynthesis inside
supernovae. Since spectral splits modify the electron neutrino and antineutrino
spectra in the region where r-process is postulated to happen, and since the
pattern of spectral splits depends on the initial conditions of the spectra and
the neutrino mass hierarchy, we show that the condition $Y_e < 0.5$ required
for successful r-process nucleosynthesis will lead to constraints on the
initial spectral conditions, for a given neutrino mass hierarchy.
