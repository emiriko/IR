We analyze the exact meaning of expressions for nonequilibrium stationary
distributions in terms of entropy changes. They were originally introduced by
McLennan for mechanical systems close to equilibrium and more recent work by
Komatsu and Nakagawa has shown their intimate relation to the transient
fluctuation symmetry. Here we derive these distributions for jump and diffusion
Markov processes and we clarify the order of the limits that take the system
both to its stationary regime and to the close-to-equilibrium regime. In
particular, we prove that it is exactly the (finite) transient component of the
irreversible part of the entropy flux that corrects the Boltzmann distribution
to first order in the driving. We add further connections with the notion of
local equilibrium, with the Green-Kubo relation and with a generalized
expression for the stationary distribution in terms of a reference equilibrium
process.
