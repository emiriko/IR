The AGILE gamma-ray satellite accumulated data over two years on several
blazars. Moreover, for all of the sources detected by AGILE, we exploited
multiwavelength observations involving both space and ground based telescopes
and consortia, obtaining in several cases broad-band spectral energy
distributions (SEDs) which span from the radio wavelengths up to the TeV energy
band. I will review both published and yet unpublished AGILE results on
gamma-ray blazars, discussing their time variability, their gamma-ray flare
durations and the theoretical modeling of the SEDs. I will also highlight the
GASP-WEBT and Swift fundamental contributions to the simultaneous and long-term
studies of gamma-ray blazars.
