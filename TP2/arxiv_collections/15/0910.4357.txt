A method combining photogrammetry with ballistic analysis is demonstrated to
identify flying debris in a rocket launch environment. Debris traveling near
the STS-124 Space Shuttle was captured on cameras viewing the launch pad within
the first few seconds after launch. One particular piece of debris caught the
attention of investigators studying the release of flame trench fire bricks
because its high trajectory could indicate a flight risk to the Space Shuttle.
Digitized images from two pad perimeter high-speed 16-mm film cameras were
processed using photogrammetry software based on a multi-parameter optimization
technique. Reference points in the image were found from 3D CAD models of the
launch pad and from surveyed points on the pad. The three-dimensional reference
points were matched to the equivalent two-dimensional camera projections by
optimizing the camera model parameters using a gradient search optimization
technique. Using this method of solving the triangulation problem, the xyz
position of the object's path relative to the reference point coordinate system
was found for every set of synchronized images. This trajectory was then
compared to a predicted trajectory while performing regression analysis on the
ballistic coefficient and other parameters. This identified, with a high degree
of confidence, the object's material density and thus its probable origin
within the launch pad environment. Future extensions of this methodology may
make it possible to diagnose the underlying causes of debris-releasing events
in near-real time, thus improving flight safety.
