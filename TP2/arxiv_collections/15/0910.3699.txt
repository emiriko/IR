This paper presents a comparison of two finite-temperature BCS-Bose Einstein
condensation (BEC) crossover theories above the transition temperature:
Nozieres Schmitt-Rink (NSR) theory and finite $T$-extended BCS-Leggett theory.
The comparison is cast in the form of numerical studies of the behavior of the
fermionic spectral function both theoretically and as constrained by
(primarily) radio frequency (RF) experiments. Both theories include pair
fluctuations and exhibit pseudogap effects, although the nature of this
pseudogap is very different. The pseudogap in finite $T$-extended BCS-Leggett
theory is found to follow a BCS-like dispersion which, in turn, is associated
with a broadened BCS-like self energy, rather more similar to what is observed
in high temperature superconductors (albeit, for a d-wave case). The fermionic
quasi-particle dispersion is different in NSR theory and the damping is
considerably larger. We argue that the two theories are appropriate in
different temperature regimes with the BCS-Leggett approach more suitable
nearer to condensation. There should, in effect, be little difference at higher
$T$ as the pseudogap becomes weaker and where the simplifying approximations
used in the BCS-Leggett approach break down. On the basis of
momentum-integrated radio frequency studies of unpolarized gases, it would be
difficult to distinguish which theory is the better. A full comparison for
polarized gases is not possible since there is claimed to be inconsistencies in
the NSR approach (not found in the BCS-Leggett scheme). Future experiments
along the lines of momentum resolved experiments look to be very promising in
distinguishing the two theories.
