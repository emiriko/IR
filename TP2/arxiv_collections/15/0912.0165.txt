We study the evolution of the plasma instabilities induced by two jets of
particles propagating in opposite directions and crossing a thermally
equilibrated non-Abelian plasma. In order to simplify the analysis we assume
that the two jets of partons can be described with uniform distribution
functions in coordinate space and by Gaussian distribution functions in
momentum space. We find that while crossing the quark-gluon plasma, the jets of
particles excite unstable chromomagnetic and chromoelectric modes. These fields
interact with the particles (or hard modes) of the plasma inducing the
production of currents; thus, the energy lost by the jets is absorbed by both
the gauge fields and the hard modes of the plasma. We compare the outcome of
the numerical simulations with the analytical calculation performed assuming
that the jets of particles can be described by a tsunami-like distribution
function. We find qualitative and semi-quantitative agreement between the
results obtained with the two methods.
