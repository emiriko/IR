We demonstrate a combined magneto-optical trap and imaging system that is
suitable for the investigation of cold atoms near surfaces. In particular, we
are able to trap atoms close to optically scattering surfaces and to image them
with an excellent signal-to-noise ratio. We also demonstrate a simple
magneto-optical atom cloud launching method. We anticipate that this system
will be useful for a range of experimental studies of novel atom-surface
interactions and atom trap miniaturization.
