A new method for the measurement of the muon flux in the deep-sea ANTARES
neutrino telescope and its dependence on the depth is presented. The method is
based on the observation of coincidence signals in adjacent storeys of the
detector. This yields an energy threshold of about 4 GeV. The main sources of
optical background are the decay of 40K and the bioluminescence in the sea
water. The 40K background is used to calibrate the efficiency of the
photo-multiplier tubes.
