A detailed numerical analysis is performed to obtain the Hawking spectrum for
charged, massive brane scalars and fermions on the approximate background of a
brane charged rotating higher-dimensional black hole constructed in
arXiv:0907.5107. We formulate the problem in terms of a "spinor-like" first
order system of differential wave equations not only for fermions, but for
scalars as well and integrate it numerically. Flux spectra are presented for
non-zero mass, charge and rotation, confirming and extending previous results
based on analytic approximations. In particular we describe an inverted charge
splitting at low energies, which is not present in four or five dimensions and
increases with the number of extra dimensions. This provides another signature
of the evaporation of higher-dimensional black holes in TeV scale gravity
scenarios.
