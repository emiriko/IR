We apply a recently developed technique to extract for the first time the
neutron F_2^n structure function from inclusive proton and deuteron data in the
nucleon resonance region, and test the validity of quark-hadron duality in the
neutron. We establish the accuracy of duality in the low-lying neutron
resonance regions over a range of Q^2, and compare with the corresponding
results on the proton and with theoretical expectations. The confirmation of
duality in both the neutron and proton opens the possibility of using resonance
region data to constrain parton distributions at large x.
