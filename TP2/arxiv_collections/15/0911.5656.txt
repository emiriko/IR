In this paper, we report on the production of a Bose--Einstein condensate
(BEC) of sodium using light--induced desorption as an atomic source. We load
about 2X10^7 atoms in a MOT from this source with a ~6 s loading time constant.
The MOT lifetime can be kept around 27 s by turning off the desorbing light
after loading. We show that the pressure drops down by a factor of 40 in less
than 100 ms after the extinction of the desorbing light, restoring the low
background pressure for evaporation. Using this technique, a \na BEC with 10^4
atoms is produced after a 6 s evaporation in an optical dipole trap.
