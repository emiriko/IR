The contribution of an extent component of source radio emission is estimated
for quasars and galaxies. The consideration of source radio structures at
kiloparsec scales is used at the decameter and the higher frequency bands. The
determination of the contribution of an extent component to source radio
emission as well as main physical parameters of sample sources is carried out.
We found that especially extent sources, giant radio galaxies, have smaller
luminosity of core region, weaker magnetic field and greater characteristic age
in comparison with compact radio galaxies and quasars. As it follows from our
examination, the extent component contribution to source emission may be the
indicator of the radio source age.
