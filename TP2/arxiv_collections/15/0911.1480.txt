We consider extension of the standard model $SU(2)_l \times SU(2)_h \times
U(1)$ where the first two families of quarks and leptons transform according to
the $SU(2)_l$ group and the third family according to the $SU(2)_h$ group. In
this approach, the largeness of top-quark mass is associated with the large
vacuum expectation value of the corresponding Higgs field. The model predicts
almost degenerate heavy $W'$ and $Z'$ bosons with non-universal couplings, and
extra Higgs bosons. We present in detail the symmetry breaking mechanism, and
carry out the subsequent phenomenology of the gauge sector. We compare the
model with electroweak precision data, and conclude that the extra gauge bosons
and the Higgs bosons whose masses lie in the TeV range, can be discovered at
the LHC.
