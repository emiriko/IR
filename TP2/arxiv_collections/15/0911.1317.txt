The interaction of atomic hydrogen with a single layer of hexagonal boron
nitride on rhodium leads to a removal of the h-BN surface corrugation. The
process is reversible as the hydrogen may be expelled by annealing to about 500
K whereupon the texture on the nanometer scale is restored. This effect is
traced back to hydrogen intercalation. It is expected to have implications for
applications, like the storage of hydrogen, the peeling of sp2-hybridized
layers from solid substrates or the control of the wetting angle, to name a
few.
