The first supersoft source (SSS) identification with an optical nova in M 31
was based on ROSAT observations. Twenty additional X-ray counterparts (mostly
identified as SSS by their hardness ratios) were detected using archival ROSAT,
XMM-Newton and Chandra observations obtained before July 2002. Based on these
results optical novae seem to constitute the major class of SSS in M 31. An
analysis of archival Chandra HRC-I and ACIS-I observations obtained from July
2004 to February 2005 demonstrated that M 31 nova SSS states lasted from months
to about 10 years. Several novae showed short X-ray outbursts starting within
50 d after the optical outburst and lasting only two to three months. The
fraction of novae detected in soft X-rays within a year after the optical
outburst was more than 30%. Ongoing optical nova monitoring programs, optical
spectral follow-up and an up-to-date nova catalogue are essential for the X-ray
work. Re-analysis of archival nova data to improve positions and find
additional nova candidates are urgently needed for secure recurrent nova
identifications. Dedicated XMM-Newton/Chandra monitoring programs for X-ray
emission from optical novae covering the center area of M 31 continue to
provide interesting new results (e.g. coherent 1105s pulsations in the SSS
counterpart of nova M31N 2007-12b). The SSS light curves of novae allow us -
together with optical information - to estimate the mass of the white dwarf, of
the ejecta and the burned mass in the outburst. Observations of the central
area of M 31 allow us - in contrast to observations in the Galaxy - to monitor
many novae simultaneously and proved to be prone to find many interesting SSS
and nova types.
