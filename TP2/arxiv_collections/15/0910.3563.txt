Motivated by recent works of Sun and Tauraso, we prove some variations on the
Green-Krammer identity involving central q-binomial coefficients, such as $$
\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}(-1)^kq^{-{k+1\choose 2}}{2k\brack k}_q \equiv (\frac{n}{5})
q^{-\lfloor n^4/5\rfloor} \pmod{\Phi_n(q)}, $$ where $\big(\frac{n}{p}\big)$ is
the Legendre symbol and $\Phi_n(q)$ is the $n$th cyclotomic polynomial. As
consequences, we deduce that $$ \sum_{k=0}^{3^a m-1} q^{k}{2k\brack k}_q
&\equiv 0 \pmod{(1-q^{3^a})/(1-q)}, \sum_{k=0}^{5^a m-1}(-1)^kq^{-{k+1\choose
2}}{2k\brack k}_q &\equiv 0 \pmod{(1-q^{5^a})/(1-q)}, $$ for $a,m\geq 1$, the
first one being a partial q-analogue of the Strauss-Shallit-Zagier congruence
modulo powers of 3. Several related conjectures are proposed.
