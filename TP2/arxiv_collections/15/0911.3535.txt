The early part of the gravitational wave signal of binary neutron star
inspirals can potentially yield robust information on the nuclear equation of
state. The influence of a star's internal structure on the waveform is
characterized by a single parameter: the tidal deformability lambda, which
measures the star's quadrupole deformation in response to the companion's
perturbing tidal field. We calculate lambda for a wide range of equations of
state and find that the value of lambda spans an order of magnitude for the
range of equation of state models considered.
  An analysis of the feasibility of discriminating between neutron star
equations of state with gravitational wave observations of the early part of
the inspiral reveals that the measurement error in lambda increases steeply
with the total mass of the binary. Comparing the errors with the expected range
of lambda, we find that Advanced LIGO observations of binaries at a distance of
100 Mpc will probe only unusually stiff equations of state, while the proposed
Einstein Telescope is likely to see a clean tidal signature.
