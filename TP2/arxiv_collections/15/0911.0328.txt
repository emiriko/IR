Correct distributions of extrasolar systems for their orbital parameters
(semi-major axes, period, eccentricity) and physical characteristics (mass,
spectral type of parent star) are received. Orbital resonances in extrasolar
systems are considered. It is shown, that the account of more thin effects,
including with use of wavelet methods, in obviously incorrectly reduced
distributions it is not justified, to what the homogeneous statistical
distributions for dynamic parameters of exoplanets, received in the present
work, testify.
