Because cosmic superstrings generically form junctions and gauge theoretic
strings typically do not, junctions may provide a signature to distinguish
between cosmic superstrings and gauge theoretic cosmic strings. In cosmic
microwave background anisotropy maps, cosmic strings lead to distinctive line
discontinuities. String junctions lead to junctions in these line
discontinuities. In turn, edge detection algorithms such as the Canny algorithm
can be used to search for signatures of strings in anisotropy maps. We apply
the Canny algorithm to simulated maps which contain the effects of cosmic
strings with and without string junctions. The Canny algorithm produces edge
maps. To distinguish between edge maps from string simulations with and without
junctions, we examine the density distribution of edges and pixels crossed by
edges. We find that in string simulations without Gaussian noise (such as
produced by the dominant inflationary fluctuations) our analysis of the output
data from the Canny algorithm can clearly distinguish between simulations with
and without string junctions. In the presence of Gaussian noise at the level
expected from the current bounds on the contribution of cosmic strings to the
total power spectrum of density fluctuations, the distinction between models
with and without junctions is more difficult. However, by carefully analyzing
the data the models can still be differentiated.
