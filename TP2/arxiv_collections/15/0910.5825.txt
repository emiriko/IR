With the invention of scanning probe techniques, direct imaging of single
atoms and molecules became possible. Today, scanning tunnelling microscopy
(STM) routinely provides angstrom-scale image resolution. At the same time,
however, STM images suffer from a serious drawback - the absence of chemical
information. Here we demonstrate a modification of STM that resolves the
chemical structure of molecular adsorbates. The key to the new STM mode is a
combined force sensor and signal transducer that is formed within the
tunnelling junction when a suitable gas condenses there. The method probes the
repulsive branch of the surface adsorption potential and transforms the force
signal into a current. Obtained images achieve the same resolution as
state-of-the-art atomic force microscopy (AFM). In contrast to AFM, however,
our (uncalibrated) force sensor is of nanoscale dimensions and therefore
intrinsically insensitive to those long-range interactions that make
atomic-resolution AFM so demanding.
