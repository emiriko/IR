We have measured spin transfer-induced dynamics in magnetic nanocontact
devices having a perpendicularly magnetized Co/Ni free layer and an in-plane
magnetized CoFe fixed layer. The frequencies and powers of the excitations
agree well with the predictions of the single-domain model and indicate that
the excited dynamics correspond to precessional orbits with angles ranging from
zero to 90 degrees as the applied current is increased at a fixed field. From
measurements of the onset current as a function of applied field strength we
estimate the magnitude of the spin torque asymmetry parameter lambda ~ 1.5. By
combining these with spin torque ferromagnetic resonance measurements, we also
estimate the spin wave radiation loss in these devices.
