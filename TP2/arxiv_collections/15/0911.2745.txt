We measure magnetic quantum oscillations in the underdoped cuprates
YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$ with $x=0.61$, 0.69, using fields of up to 85 T. The
quantum-oscillation frequencies and effective masses obtained suggest that the
Fermi energy in the cuprates has a maximum at $p\approx 0.11-0.12$. On either
side, the effective mass may diverge, possibly due to phase transitions
associated with the T=0 limit of the metal-insulator crossover (low-$p$ side),
and the postulated topological transition from small to large Fermi surface
close to optimal doping (high $p$ side).
