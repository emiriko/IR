We report a study of suppressed spin dephasing for quasi-one-dimensional
electron ensembles in wires etched into a GaAs/AlGaAs heterojunction system.
Time-resolved Kerr-rotation measurements show a suppression that is most
pronounced for wires along the [110] crystal direction. This is the fingerprint
of a suppression that is enhanced due to a strong anisotropy in spin-orbit
fields that can occur when the Rashba and Dresselhaus contributions are
engineered to cancel each other. A surprising observation is that this
mechanisms for suppressing spin dephasing is not only effective for electrons
in the heterojunction quantum well, but also for electrons in a deeper bulk
layer.
