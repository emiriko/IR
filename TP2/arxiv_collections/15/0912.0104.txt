An exact statistical mechanical derivation is given of the critical Casimir
forces for Ising strips with arbitrary surface fields applied to edges. Our
results show that the strength as well as the sign of the force can be
controled by varying the temperature or the fields. An interpretation of the
results is given in terms of a linked cluster expansion. This suggests a
systematic approach for deriving the critical Casimir force which can be used
in more general models.
