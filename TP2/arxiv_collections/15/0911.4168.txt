Effective potential for a class of static solutions of Kaluza-Klein equations
with three-dimensional spherical symmetry is studied. Test particles motion is
analyzed. In attempts to read the obtained results with the experimental data,
particular attention is devoted to the Schwarzschild's limit of the four
dimensional counterpart of these electromagnetic-free solutions. Massive
particles stable circular orbits in particular are studied, and a comparison
between the well known results if the Schwarzschild's case and those found for
the static higher-dimensional case is performed. A modification of the circular
stable orbits is investigated in agreement with the experimental constraints.
