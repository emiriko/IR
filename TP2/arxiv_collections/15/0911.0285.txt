Project management education programmes are often proposed in higher
education to give students competences in project planning (Gantt's chart),
project organizing, human and technical resource management, quality control
and also social competences (collaboration, communication), emotional ones
(empathy, consideration of the other, humour, ethics), and organizational ones
(leadership, political vision, and so on). This training is often given
according a training-by-project type of learning with case studies. This
article presents one course characterized by a pedagogical organization based
upon Knowledge Management (KM) concepts: knowledge transfer and construction
throughout a learning circle and social interactions. The course is supported
by a rich and complex tutor organization. We have observed this course by using
another KM method inspired from KADS with various return of experience
formalized into cards and charts. Our intention is, according to the model of
Argyris and Sch\"on (Smith, 2001), to gain feedback information about local and
global processes and about actors' experience in order to improve the course.
This paper describes precisely the course (pedagogical method and tutor
activity) and the KM observation method permitting to identify problem to
solve. In our case, we observe problem of pedacogical coordination and skills
acquisition. We propose to design a metacognitive tool for tutors and students,
usable for improving knowledge construction and learning process organisation
