Spectroscopic factors have been extracted for proton rich 34Ar and neutron
rich 46Ar using the (p,d) neutron transfer reaction. The experimental results
show little reduction of the ground state neutron spectroscopic factor of the
proton rich nucleus 34Ar compared to that of 46Ar. The results suggest that
correlations, which generally reduce such spectroscopic factors, do not depend
strongly on the neutron-proton asymmetry of the nucleus in this isotopic region
as was reported in knockout reactions. The present results are consistent with
results from systematic studies of transfer reactions but inconsistent with the
trends observed in knockout reaction measurements.
