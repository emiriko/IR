We construct an asymmetric braneworld embedding with induced gravity on the
brane, where stringy effects are taken into account by incorporation of the
Gauss-Bonnet term in the bulk action. We derive the effective Friedmann
equation of the brane and then we investigate the possible realization of the
phantom-like behavior in this setup. We show that in the absence of the
Gauss-Bonnet term in the bulk action (a pure induced gravity scenario), the
phantom-like behavior in asymmetric case can be realized in smaller redshift
than the corresponding symmetric case. We show also that in the general case
with curvature effect, the phantom-like behavior can be realized in two
subcases: in a symmetric subcase and also in an asymmetric branch of the
solutions. In either cases this phantom-like behavior happens without
introducing any phantom fields neither on the brane nor in the bulk.
