The giant HII region NGC 604 constitutes a complex and rich population to
studying detail many aspects of massive star formation, such as their
environments and physical conditions, the evolutionary processes involved, the
initial mass function for massive stars and star-formation rates, among many
others. Here, we present our first results of a near-infrared study of NGC 604
performed with NIRI images obtained with Gemini North. Based on deep JHK
photometry, 164 sources showing infrared excess were detected, pointing to the
places where we should look for star-formation processes currently taking
place. In addition, the color-color diagram reveals a great number of objects
that could be giant/supergiant stars or unresolved, small, tight clusters. A
extinction map obtained based on narrow-band images is also shown.
