When a biased conductor is put in proximity with an unbiased conductor a drag
current can be induced in the absence of detailed balance. This is known as the
Coulomb drag effect. However, even in this situation far away from equilibrium
where detailed balance is explicitly broken, theory predicts that fluctuation
relations are satisfied. This surprising effect has, to date, not been
confirmed experimentally. Here we propose a system consisting of a capacitively
coupled double quantum dot where the nonlinear fluctuation relations are
verified in the absence of detailed balance.
