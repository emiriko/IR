P-dibromobenzene nanoparticles in a case of paradihlorbenzol molecules have
been synthesized. Raman spectrums of these nanoparticles are measured. At
diffusion of molecules of paradihlorbenzol in a pdibromobenzene nanoparticle
solid solution formed. Modifications in structure of nanoparticles at diffusion
are reflected in Raman spectrums. Unlike a solid solution single crystal, in
nanoparticles the accelerated diffusion, $D = 1.3 \pm 0.02 10^{-11} cm^2/s$, is
observed at room temperature. Calculations show that the accelerated diffusion
is caused by magnification of parametres of a lattice at reduction of sizes of
nanoparticles.
