Entanglement in incoherent mixtures of pure states of two qubits is
considered via the concurrence measure. A set of pure states is optimal if the
concurrence for any mixture of them is the weighted sum of the concurrences of
the generating states. When two or three pure real states are mixed it is shown
that 28.5% and 5.12% of the cases respectively, are optimal. Conditions that
are obeyed by the pure states generating such optimally entangled mixtures are
derived. For four or more pure states it is shown that there are no such sets
of real states. The implications of these on superposition of two or more
dimerized states is discussed. A corollary of these results also show in how
many cases rebit concurrence can be the same as that of qubit concurrence.
