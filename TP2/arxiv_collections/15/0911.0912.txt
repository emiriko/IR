Coordination between organizations on strategic, tactical and operation
levels leads to more effective and efficient supply chains. Supply chain
management is increasing day by day in modern enterprises. The environment is
becoming competitive and many enterprises will find it difficult to survive if
they do not make their sourcing, production and distribution more efficient.
Multi-agent supply chain management has recognized as an effective methodology
for supply chain management. Multi-agent systems (MAS) offer new methods
compared to conventional, centrally organized architectures in the scope of
supply chain management (SCM). Since necessary data are not available within
the whole supply chain, an integrated approach for production planning and
control taking into account all the partners involved is not feasible. In this
study we show how MAS architecture interacts in the integrated SCM architecture
with the help of various intelligent agents to highlight the above problem.
