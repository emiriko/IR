The V2O5-MoO3 mixtures offer a whole range of materials where properties can
be adjusted by simple modification of experimental parameters, which may be
utilized in manufacturing of metamaterials with on-demand properties. The
V2O5-MoO3 system contains an intermediate phase V9Mo6O40, with a small fraction
of V4+ instead of V5+. Consequently, this system should rather be considered as
pseudobinary. The V4+ content depends on the oxygen partial pressure in the
atmosphere. Thus, by changing the oxygen partial pressure one can tailor the
electric properties of the system, and by changing the supercooling, the
morphologic structure of crystallized bodies as well. For better understanding
of this system differential thermal analysis and thermodynamic modeling was
performed. Fibers of eutectic composition between V9Mo6O40 and MoO3 were grown
by the micro-pulling-down technique. X-ray diffraction confirmed the existence
of the V9Mo6O40 intermediate phase.
