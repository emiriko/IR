We revisit the prospects for IceCube and similar kilometer-scale telescopes
to detect neutrinos produced by the annihilation of weakly interacting massive
dark matter particles (WIMPs) in the Sun. We emphasize that the astrophysics of
the problem is understood; models can be observed or, alternatively, ruled out.
In searching for a WIMP with spin-independent interactions with ordinary
matter, IceCube is only competitive with direct detection experiments if the
WIMP mass is sufficiently large. For spin-dependent interactions IceCube
already has improved the best limits on spin-dependent WIMP cross sections by
two orders of magnitude. This is largely due to the fact that models with
significant spin-dependent couplings to protons are the least constrained and,
at the same time, the most promising because of the efficient capture of WIMPs
in the Sun. We identify models where dark matter particles are beyond the reach
of any planned direct detection experiments while being within reach of
neutrino telescopes. In summary, we find that, even when contemplating recent
direct detection results, neutrino telescopes have the opportunity to play an
important as well as complementary role in the search for particle dark matter.
