We present a new approach to the quantum-classical problem, which treats it
as the problem of modelling the quantum phenomenon described by a coherent
superposition of microscopically distinct substates (CSMDS) as a compound one
consisting of alternative subprocesses creating unremovable contexts for each
other, or as that of reducing a non-Kolmogorovian quantum probability space to
underlie a CSMDS to the sum of Kolmogorovian ones. We develop such models for a
1D completed scattering and double slit diffraction. The quantum-classical
problem disappears when, in quantum theory with its integral superposition
principle, CSMDSs obey the "either-or" rule to guide alternative random events.
There is no observable which could be associated with the whole ensemble of
statistical data described by a CSMDS, because such data are incompatible -- in
the case of a CSMDS, any observable splits into noncommuting observables
associated with the substates. To calculate the average value of any observable
as well as to introduce characteristic times is meaningful only for the
substates of a CSMDS. Ignoring this feature in the conventional description of
CSMDSs just leads to paradoxical results (e.g., to the Hartman effect and
passing a particle through two slits in the screen simultaneously).
