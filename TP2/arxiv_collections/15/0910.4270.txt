We present results on the Anderson localization in a quasi one-dimensional
metallic wire in the presence of magnetic impurities. We focus within the same
numerical analysis on both the universal localized and metallic regimes, and we
study the evolution of these universal properties as the strength of the
magnetic disorder is varied. For this purpose, we use a numerical Landauer
approach, and derive the scattering matrix of the wire from electron's Green's
function obtained from a recursive algorithm.
