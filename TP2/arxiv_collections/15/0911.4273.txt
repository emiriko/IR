The proton flux and the chemical composition of the cosmic radiation
measured, respectively, by the Kascade and Auger experiments entail radical
changes in Cosmic Ray Physics. A large discrepancy emerges by comparing the
proton flux predicted by the dip model and that measured by Kascade in the
critical energy interval 5 x 10 ** 16 - 10 ** 17 eV. It is mentioned and
substantiated that the proton flux measurements of the Kascade experiment are
consistent with other pertinent empirical observations. It is shown that the
chemical composition measured by Auger by two independent procedures, using the
mean depth reached by cosmic nuclei in giant air cascades, is incompatible with
that predicted by the dip model. A notable consequence suggested here based on
the failures of the dip model is that the spectral index softening of the
primary cosmic radiation above 6 x 10 ** 19 eV observed by HiRes and Auger
experiments, is not due to the extragalactic cosmological protons suffering
energy losses in the intergalactic space via the reactions, p gamma -> pi0 p,
pi+ n, but to some physical phenomena occurring in the cosmic vicinity.
