Speech analyzing in special periods of time has been presented in this paper.
One of the most important periods in signal processing is near to Zero. By this
paper, we analyze noise speech signals when these signals are near to Zero. Our
strategy is defining some subfunctions and compress histograms when a noise
speech signal is in a special period. It can be so useful for wavelet signal
processing and spoken systems analyzing.
