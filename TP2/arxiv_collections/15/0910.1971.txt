The AMIDAS website has been established as an online interactive tool for
running simulations and analyzing data in direct Dark Matter detection
experiments. At the first phase of the website building, only some commonly
used WIMP velocity distribution functions and elastic nuclear form factors have
been involved in the AMIDAS code. In order to let the options for velocity
distribution as well as for nuclear form factors be more flexible, we have
extended the AMIDAS code to be able to include user-uploaded files with their
own functions. In this article, I describe the preparation of files of
user-defined functions onto the AMIDAS website. Some examples will also be
given.
