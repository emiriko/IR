A relativistic electron uniformly rotating along an equatorial orbit around a
dielectric ball may generate Cherenkov radiation tens of times more intense as
that in case of revolution of a particle in a continuous, infinite and
transparent medium. The root-mean-square values of electric and magnetic field
strengths of particle are practically not localized in the central part of the
equatorial plane of ball and close to the poles of ball.
