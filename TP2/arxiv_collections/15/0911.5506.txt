At present, there is a worldwide effort to use cold atoms to simulate
strongly correlated quantum many-body systems. It is hoped that these
"simulations" will provide solutions to many unsolved problems. However, the
relevant energy scales in most of these experiments are so small that one has
to go to entropy regimes far below those achievable today. Here, we present a
general scheme to extract entropy directly from the region of interest. The
late stage of this process is equivalent to a continuous "evaporation", and is
able to combat intrinsic heating of the system. For illustration, we show how
to cool a weak coupling BCS superfluid (with $T_{c}\sim 10^{-10}$K) to
$10^{-11}$K with this simple procedure, with entropy per particle as low as
$5\times 10^{-4}k_{B}$ in the superfluid region.
