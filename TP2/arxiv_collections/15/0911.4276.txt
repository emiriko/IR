For almost one year the Large Area Telescope on board the Fermi observatory
has been surveying high-energy phenomena in our Universe. We will present an
overview of the status of the mission and of some results from the first year
of observations, focusing on the topics of particular interest for the
high-energy Physics community: detection of high-energy gamma-ray bursts, the
discovery of new populations of gamma-ray sources, non-confirmation of the
excess of diffuse GeV gamma-ray emission seen by EGRET and, in greater detail,
the recent measurement of the cosmic-ray electron spectrum from 20 GeV to 1
TeV.
