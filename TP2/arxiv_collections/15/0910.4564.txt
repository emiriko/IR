Quantum mechanics predicts an exponentially small probability that a particle
with energy greater than the height of a potential barrier will nevertheless
reflect from the barrier in violation of classical expectations. This process
can be regarded as tunneling in momentum space, leading to a simple derivation
of the reflection probability.
