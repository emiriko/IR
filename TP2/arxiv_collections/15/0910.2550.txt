Very recently, the new 6K superconductor (SC) LiFeP, the first arsenic-free
analogue of the family of the so-called "111" FeAs SCs, was discovered. Here,
based on first-principle FLAPW-GGA calculations, the band structure, density of
states, Fermi surface topology, electron density distribution and effective
atomic charges for the new SC LiFeP are investigated and discussed in
comparison with isostructural and isoelectronic LiFeAs.
