A new algorithm for minimization of quantum cost of quantum circuits has been
designed. The quantum cost of different quantum circuits of particular interest
(eg. circuits for EPR, quantum teleportation, shor code and different quantum
arithmetic operations) are computed by using the proposed algorithm. The
quantum costs obtained using the proposed algorithm is compared with the
existing results and it is found that the algorithm has produced minimum
quantum cost in all cases.
