It is argued that the appropriate macroscopic description of half-BPS mesonic
chiral operators in generic $d=4$ ${\cal N}=1$ toric gauge theories is in terms
of the geometric quantization of smooth horizonless configurations. The
relevance of different ensemble macroscopic descriptions is emphasized :
lorentzian vs euclidean configurations as (semiclassical) microstates vs saddle
points in an euclidean path integral.
