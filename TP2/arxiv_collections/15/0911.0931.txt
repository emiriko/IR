We introduce the topic of dynamical breaking of the electroweak symmetry and
its link to unparticle physics and cosmology. The knowledge of the phase
diagram of strongly coupled theories plays a fundamental role when trying to
construct viable extensions of the standard model (SM). Therefore we present
the state-of-the-art of the phase diagram for SU, Sp and SO gauge theories with
fermionic matter transforming according to arbitrary representations of the
underlying gauge group. We summarize several analytic methods used recently to
acquire information about these gauge theories. We also provide new results for
the phase diagram of the generalized Bars-Yankielowicz and Georgi-Glashow
chiral gauge theories. These theories have been used for constructing grand
unified models and have been the template for models of extended technicolor
interactions. To gain information on the phase diagram of chiral gauge theories
we will introduce a novel all orders beta function for chiral gauge theories.
This permits the first unified study of all non-supersymmetric gauge theories
with fermionic matter representation both chiral and non-chiral. To the best of
our knowledge the phase diagram of these complex models appears here for the
first time. We will introduce recent extensions of the SM featuring minimal
conformal gauge theories known as minimal walking models. Finally we will
discuss the electroweak phase transition at nonzero temperature for models of
dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking.
