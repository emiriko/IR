The lattice dynamics of Ba1-xKxFe2As2 (x = 0.00, 0.27) have been studied by
inelastic X-ray scattering measurement at room temperature. K doping induces
the softening and broadening of phonon modes in the energy range E = 10-15 meV.
Analysis with a Born-von Karman force-constant model indicates that the
softening results from reduced interatomic force constants around (Ba,K) sites
following the displacement of divalent Ba by monovalent K. The phonon
broadening may be explained by the local distortions induced by the K
substitution. Extra phonon modes are observed around the wave vector q =
(0.5,0,0) at E = 16.5 meV for the x = 0.27 sample. These modes may arise either
from the local disorder induced by K doping or from electron-phonon coupling.
