The de Broglie-Bohm theory is about non-relativistic point-particles that
move deterministically along trajectories. The theory reproduces the
predictions of standard quantum theory, given that the distribution of
particles over an ensemble of systems, all described by the same wavefunction
$\psi$, equals the quantum equilibrium distribution $|\psi|^2$. Numerical
simulations by Valentini and Westman have illustrated that non-equilibrium
particle distributions may relax to quantum equilibrium after some time. Here
we consider non-equilibrium distributions and their relaxation properties for a
particular class of trajectory theories, first studied in detail by Deotto and
Ghirardi, that are empirically equivalent to the de Broglie-Bohm theory in
quantum equilibrium. For the examples of such theories that we consider, we
find a speed-up of the relaxation compared to the ordinary de Broglie-Bohm
theory. Hence non-equilibrium predictions that depend strongly on relaxation
properties, such as those studied recently by Valentini, may vary for different
trajectory theories. As such these theories might be experimentally
distinguishable.
