The self-adjointness of an evolution operator $\Theta_{\Lambda}$
corresponding to the model of flat FRW universe with massless scalar field and
cosmological constant quantized in the framework of Loop Quantum Cosmology is
studied in the case $\Lambda>0$. It is shown, that for
$\Lambda<\Lambda_c\approx 10.3 \lPl^{-2}$ the operator admits many self-adjoint
extensions, each of the purely discrete spectrum. On the other hand for
$\Lambda\geq\Lambda_c$ the operator is essentially self-adjoint, however the
physical Hilbert space of the model does not contain any physically interesting
states.
