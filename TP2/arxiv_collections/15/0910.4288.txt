We propose and numerically simulate a semiconductor device based on coupled
quantum wires, suitable for deterministic quantum teleportation of electrons
trapped in the minima of surface acoustic waves.We exploit a network of
interacting semiconductor quantum wires able to provide the universal set of
gates for quantum information processing, with the qubit defined by the
localization of a single electron in one of two coupled channels.The numerical
approach is based on a time-dependent solution of the three-particle
Schr\"odinger equation. First, a maximally entangled pair of electrons is
obtained via Coulomb interaction between carriers in different channels. Then,
a complete Bell-state measurement involving one electron from this pair and a
third electron is performed. Finally, the teleported state is reconstructed by
means of local one-qubit operations. The large estimated fidelity explicitely
suggests that an efficient teleportation process could be reached in an
experimental setup.
