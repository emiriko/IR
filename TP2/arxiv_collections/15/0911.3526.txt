Using first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that the magnetic
exchange interaction and the magnetocrystalline anisotropy of biatomic Fe
chains grown in the trenches of the 5x1 reconstructed Ir(001) surface depend
sensitively on the atomic arrangement of the Fe atoms. Two structural
configurations have been considered which are suggested from recent
experiments. They differ by the local symmetry and the spacing between the two
strands of the biatomic Fe chain. Since both configurations are very close in
total energy they may coexist in experiment. We have investigated collinear
ferro- and antiferromagnetic solutions as well as a collinear state with two
moments in one direction and one in the opposite direction (up-down-up-state).
For the structure with a small interchain spacing, there is a strong exchange
interaction between the strands and the ferromagnetic state is energetically
favorable. In the structure with larger spacing, the two strands are
magnetically nearly decoupled and exhibit antiferromagnetic order along the
chain. In both cases, due to hybridization with the Ir substrate the exchange
interaction along the chain axis is relatively small compared to freestanding
biatomic iron chains. The easy magnetization axis of the Fe chains also
switches with the structural configuration and is out-of-plane for the
ferromagnetic chains with small spacing and along the chain axis for the
antiferromagnetic chains with large spacing between the two strands. Calculated
scanning tunneling microscopy images and spectra suggest the possibility to
experimentally distinguish between the two structural and magnetic
configurations.
