We review standard holographic derivations of the scalar glueball spectra and
emphasize computational assumptions which rely strongly on the original AdS/CFT
correspondence, and those which are more arbitrary. In the soft-wall model, we
show explicitly that the dual of the spectral mass constraint in the
Kallen-Lehmann representation of the 2-point scalar gluonic correlator is an
eigenvalue constraint on the motion equation of the bulk field corresponding
this correlator.
