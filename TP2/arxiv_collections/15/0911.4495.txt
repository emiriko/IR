An EMCCD camera, designed from the ground up for extreme faint flux imaging,
is presented. CCCP, the CCD Controller for Counting Photons, has been
integrated with a CCD97 EMCCD from e2v technologies into a scientific camera at
the Laboratoire d'Astrophysique Exp\'erimentale (LAE), Universit\'e de
Montr\'eal. This new camera achieves sub-electron read-out noise and very low
Clock Induced Charge (CIC) levels, which are mandatory for extreme faint flux
imaging. Data gathered with the camera suggests that through enhanced
manufacturing processes, which would avoid traps from being created, and with
the help of the clock shapes producible with CCCP, the CIC generated during the
vertical transfer could be virtually suppressed. The camera has been
characterized in laboratory and used on the Observatoire du Mont M\'egantic
1.6-m telescope. The performance of the camera is discussed and experimental
data with the first scientific data are presented.
