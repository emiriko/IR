We describe the procedure of the construction of a sample of distant
($z>0.3$) radio galaxies using the NED, SDSS, and CATS databases. We believe
the sample to be free of objects with quasar properties. This paper is the
second part of the description of the radio galaxies catalog we plan to use for
cosmological tests. We report the photometric parameters for the objects of the
list, and perform its preliminary statistical analysis including the
construction of the Hubble diagrams.
