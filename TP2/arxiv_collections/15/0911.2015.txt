We describe a flasher system designed for use in monitoring the gains of the
photomultiplier tubes used in the VERITAS gamma-ray telescopes. This system
uses blue light-emitting diodes (LEDs) so it can be operated at much higher
rates than a traditional laser-based system. Calibration information can be
obtained with better statistical precision with reduced loss of observing time.
The LEDs are also much less expensive than a laser. The design features of the
new system are presented, along with measurements made with a prototype mounted
on one of the VERITAS telescopes.
