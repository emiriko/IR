I report results of recent integral field spectroscopy of the inner few
hundred parsecs (pc) around nearby Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) at a sampling
of a few pc, obtained with the Gemini Telescopes. In the lowest activity AGNs,
it is possible to observe inflows in ionized gas along nuclear spirals and
filaments. In more luminous AGN inflows have been observed also in hot
molecular gas (H_2) emission in the near-IR. In most cases the H_2 kinematics
is dominated by circular rotation in the plane around the nucleus, tracing the
AGN feeding. The ionized gas, on the other hand, traces the AGN feedback. Its
kinematics shows two components: (1) one originating in the plane, and
dominated by circular rotation; (2) another outflowing along the Narrow-Line
Region (NLR) whose flux distribution and kinematics frequently correlate with
structures seen in radio maps. Mass outflow rates along the NLR range from
10^-2 to 1 M_sun yr^-1, corresponding to 10-100 times the accretion rate to the
AGN, indicating that most of the NLR gas mass has been entrained from the
galaxy plane. The average kinetic power of the NLR outflows is ~10^-4 times the
bolometric luminosity.
