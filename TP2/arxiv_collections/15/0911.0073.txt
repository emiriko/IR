The coherent state of a nonlinear oscillator having a nonlinear spectrum is
constructed using Gazeau Klauder formalism. The weighting distribution and the
Mandel parameter are studied. Details of the revival structure arising from
different time scales underlying the quadratic energy spectrum are investigated
by the phase analysis of the autocorrelation function.
