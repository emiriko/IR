In this paper, we investigate convergence dynamics of $2^N$ almost periodic
encoded patterns of general neural networks (GNNs) subjected to external almost
periodic stimuli, including almost periodic delays. Invariant regions are
established for the existence of $2^N$ almost periodic encoded patterns under
two classes of activation functions. By employing the property of
$\mathscr{M}$-cone and inequality technique, attracting basins are estimated
and some criteria are derived for the networks to converge exponentially toward
$2^N$ almost periodic encoded patterns. The obtained results are new, they
extend and generalize the corresponding results existing in previous
literature.
