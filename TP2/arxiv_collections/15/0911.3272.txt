A wide range of events observed at the giant pulses (high energy density,
observed localization of giant pulses (GPs) relative to the average pulse, fine
structure of GPs with duration up to some nanoseconds, observed circular
polarization of GPs, correlation between the GP phase and the phase of the hard
pulsar emission X-ray and gamma) can be explained from the viewpoint that the
internal polar gap is a cavity-resonator stimulated by discharges and radiating
through the breaks in the magnetosphere. The new results in this field [the
electromagnetic (em) waves generation in the gap in the process of longitudinal
acceleration in the electric field vanishing on the star surface, high
frequency break in the spectrum as a result of switching off this generation,
formation in this process a power-low spectrum with a high frequency (hf)
break, the possibility determination of pulsar magnetic field by the hf break
position, the difference between main pulse and inter pulse mechanism
generation, quantization of em tornado rotation in the gap and appearance of
the bands in the inter pulse spectrum, influence the high energy density in the
gap on pair generation and position of the dead line in pulsars] are added in
the intermediate epilogue.
