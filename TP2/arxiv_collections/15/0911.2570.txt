We have employed a penumbral model, that includes the Evershed flow and
convective motions inside penumbral filaments, to reproduce the azimuthal
variation of the net circular polarization (NCP) in sunspot penumbrae at
different heliocentric angles for two different spectral lines. The theoretical
net circular polarization fits the observations as satisfactorily as penumbral
models based on flux-tubes. The reason for this is that the effect of
convective motions on the NCP is very small compared to the effect of the
Evershed flow. In addition, the NCP generated by convective upflows cancels out
the NCP generated by the downflows. We have also found that, in order to fit
the observed NCP, the strength of the magnetic field inside penumbral filaments
must be very close to 1000 G. In particular, field-free or weak-field filaments
fail to reproduce both the correct sign of the net circular polarization, as
well as its dependence on the azimuthal and heliocentric angles.
