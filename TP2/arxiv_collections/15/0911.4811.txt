A wire GEM (WGEM) detector with a gas gap between meshes was constructed. The
detector provides the amplification 5x10E5 for the gas mixture of Ar +20% CO2
at atmospheric pressure. As compared with well-known GEM detectors produced by
perforation the plastic plate metalized on both sides the WGEM does not suffer
from breakdowns between its electrodes and the effect of accumulation of
charges on holes walls is absent. As a result the WGEM has high reliability and
stability.
