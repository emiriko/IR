We prove a sharp degree bound for polynomials constant on a hyperplane with a
fixed number of distinct monomials for dimensions 2 and 3. We study the
connection with monomial CR maps of hyperquadrics and prove similar bounds in
this setup with emphasis on the case of spheres. The results support
generalizing a conjecture on the degree bounds to the more general case of
hyperquadrics.
