We present a sample of 723 optically selected BL Lac candidates from the SDSS
DR7 spectroscopic database encompassing 8250 deg^2 of sky; our sample
constitutes one of the largest uniform BL Lac samples yet derived. Each BL Lac
candidate has a high-quality SDSS spectrum from which we determine
spectroscopic redshifts for ~60% of the objects. Redshift lower limits are
estimated for the remaining objects utilizing the lack of host galaxy flux
contamination in their optical spectra; we find that objects lacking
spectroscopic redshifts are likely at systematically higher redshifts.
Approximately 80% of our BL Lac candidates match to a radio source in
FIRST/NVSS, and ~40% match to a ROSAT X-ray source. The homogeneous
multiwavelength coverage allows subdivision of the sample into 637 radio-loud
BL Lac candidates and 86 weak-featured radio-quiet objects. The radio-loud
objects broadly support the standard paradigm unifying BL Lac objects with
beamed radio galaxies. We propose that the majority of the radio-quiet objects
may be lower-redshift (z<2.2) analogs to high-redshift weak line quasars (i.e.,
AGN with unusually anemic broad emission line regions). These would constitute
the largest sample of such objects, being of similar size and complementary in
redshift to the samples of high-redshift weak line quasars previously
discovered by the SDSS. However, some fraction of the weak-featured radio-quiet
objects may instead populate a rare and extreme radio-weak tail of the much
larger radio-loud BL Lac population. Serendipitous discoveries of unusual white
dwarfs, high-redshift weak line quasars, and broad absorption line quasars with
extreme continuum dropoffs blueward of rest-frame 2800 Angstroms are also
briefly described.
