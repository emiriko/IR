The relativistic theory of elasticity is reviewed within the spherically
symmetric context with a view towards the modeling of star interiors possessing
elastic properties such as theones expected in neutron stars. Emphasis is
placed on generality in the main sections of the paper, and the results are
then applied to specific examples. Along the way, a few general results for
spacetimes admitting isometries are deduced, and their consequences are fully
exploited in the case of spherical symmetry relating them next to the the case
in which the material content of the spacetime is some elastic material. This
paper extends and generalizes the pioneering work by Magli and Kijowski [1],
Magli [2] and [3], and complements, in a sense, that by Karlovini and
Samuelsson in their interesting series of papers [4], [5] and [6].
