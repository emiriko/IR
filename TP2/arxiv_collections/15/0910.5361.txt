We consider a cold gas of non-interacting fermions in a two dimensional
harmonic trap with two different trapping frequencies $\omega_x \leq \omega_y$,
and discuss the effect of rotation on the density profile. Depending on the
rotation frequency $\Omega$ and the trap anisotropy $\omega_y/\omega_x$, the
density profile assumes two qualitatively different shapes. For small
anisotropy ($\omega_y/\omega_x \ll \sqrt{1+4 \Omega^2/\omega_x^2}$), the
density consists of elliptical plateaus of constant density, corresponding to
Landau levels and is well described by a two dimensional local density
approximation. For large anisotropy ($\omega_y/\omega_x \gg \sqrt{1+4
\Omega^2/\omega_x^2}$), the density profile is Gaussian in the strong confining
direction and semicircular with prominent Friedel oscillations in the weak
direction. In this regime, a one dimensional local density approximation is
well suited to describe the system. The crossover between the two regimes is
smooth where the step structure between the Landau level edges turn into
Friedel oscillations. Increasing the temperature causes the step structure or
the Friedel oscillations to wash out leaving a Boltzmann gas density profile.
