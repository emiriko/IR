A method for the detection of solar neutrino has been developed using the
laboratory bench installations. The efficiency of the extraction of beryllium
from lithium as high as 96.4{%} has been achieved, and it was shown that
lithium losses during the extraction were less than 1{%}. The prospects of a
full-scale experiment with a 10-t lithium detector consisting of twenty 500-kg
lithium modules are discussed. The technical solutions formulated on the basis
of this study enable to make design of a pilot lithium installation containing
500 kg of metallic lithium
