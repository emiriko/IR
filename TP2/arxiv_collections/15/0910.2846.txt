The "reaction" of an extended body to the passage of an exact plane
gravitational wave is discussed following Dixon's model. The analysis performed
shows several general features, e.g. even if initially absent, the body
acquires a spin induced by the quadrupole structure, the center of mass moves
from its initial position, as well as certain "spin-flip" or "spin-glitch"
effects which are being observed.
