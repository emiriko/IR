The variation of E(2+_1) of (134-140)Sn calculated with empirical SMPN
interaction has striking similarity with that of experimental E(2+_1) of
even-even (18-22)O and (42-48)Ca, showing clearly that N=84-88 spectra exhibit
the effect of gradual filling up of \nu(2f_{7/2}) orbital which finally
culminates in a new shell closure at N=90. Realistic two-body interaction CWG
does not show this feature. Spin-tensor decomposition of SMPN and CWG
interactions and variation of their components with valence neutron number
reveals that the origin of the shell closure at 140Sn lies in the three body
effects. Calculations with CWG3, which is obtained by including a simple
three-body monopole term in the CWG interaction, predict decreasing E(2+_1) for
(134-138)Sn and a shell closure at 140Sn.
