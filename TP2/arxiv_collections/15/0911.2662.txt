We study the exclusive production of heavy flavors at central rapidities in
hadron-hadron collisions within the kT factorisation formalism. Since this
involves regions of small Bjorken x in the unintegrated gluon densities, we
include the next-to-leading order BFKL contributions working directly in
transverse momentum representation. Our results are presented in a form
suitable for Monte Carlo implementation.
