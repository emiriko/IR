The noisy-storage model allows the implementation of secure two-party
protocols under the sole assumption that no large-scale reliable quantum
storage is available to the cheating party. No quantum storage is thereby
required for the honest parties. Examples of such protocols include bit
commitment, oblivious transfer and secure identification. Here, we provide a
guideline for the practical implementation of such protocols. In particular, we
analyze security in a practical setting where the honest parties themselves are
unable to perform perfect operations and need to deal with practical problems
such as errors during transmission and detector inefficiencies. We provide
explicit security parameters for two different experimental setups using weak
coherent, and parametric down conversion sources. In addition, we analyze a
modification of the protocols based on decoy states.
