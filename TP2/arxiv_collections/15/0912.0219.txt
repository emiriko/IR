In this paper, we establish the convergence of the Ohta-Kawasaki equation to
motion by nonlocal Mullins-Sekerka law on any smooth domain in space dimensions
$N\leq 3$. These equations arise in modeling microphase separation in diblock
copolymers. The only assumptions that guarantee our convergence result are
$(i)$ well-preparedness of the initial data and $(ii)$ smoothness of the
limiting interface. Our method makes use of the "Gamma-convergence" of gradient
flows scheme initiated by Sandier and Serfaty and the constancy of multiplicity
of the limiting interface due to its smoothness. For the case of radially
symmetric initial data without well-preparedness, we give a new and short proof
of the result of M. Henry for all space dimensions. Finally, we establish
transport estimates for solutions of the Ohta-Kawasaki equation characterizing
their transport mechanism.
