The study of dynamical gluon mass generation at the level of Schwinger-Dyson
equation involves a delicate interplay between various field-theoretic
mechanisms The underlying local gauge invariance remains intact by resorting to
the well-known Schwinger mechanism, which is assumed to be realized by
longitudinally coupled bound state poles, produced by the non-perturbative
dynamics of the theory. These poles are subsequently included into the
Schwinger-Dyson equation of the gluon propagator through the three-gluon
vertex, generating a non-vanishing gluon mass, which, however, is expressed in
terms of divergent seagull integrals. In this talk we explain how such
divergences can be eliminated completely by virtue of a characteristic
identity, valid in dimensional regularization. The ability to trigger this
identity depends, in turn, on the details of the three-gluon vertex employed,
and in particular, on the exact way the bound state poles are incorporated. A
concrete example of a vertex that triggers the aforementioned identity is
constructed, the ensuing cancellation of all seagull divergences is explicitly
demonstrated, and a finite gluon mass is obtained. Due to the multitude of
conditions that must be simultaneously satisfied, this construction appears to
be exclusively realized within the PT-BFM framework. The resulting system of
integral equations gives rise to a gluon mass that displays power-law running
and an effective charge which, due to the presence of the gluon mass, freezes
in the infrared at a finite (non-vanishing) value.
