We quantize the Maxwell theory in the presence of a electric charge in a
"dual" Loop Representation, i.e. a geometric representation of magnetic
Faraday's lines. It is found that the theory can be seen as a theory without
sources, except by the fact that the wave functional becomes multivalued. This
can be seen as the dual counterpart of what occurs in Maxwell theory with a
magnetic pole, when it is quantized in the ordinary Loop Representation. The
multivaluedness can be seen as a result of the multiply-connectedness of the
configuration space of the quantum theory.
