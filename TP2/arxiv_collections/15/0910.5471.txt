Maximally supersymmetric theories can be described by a single scalar
superfield in light-cone superspace. When they are also (super)conformally
invariant, they are uniquely specified by the form of the dynamical
supersymmetry. We present an explicit derivation of the light-cone superspace
form of the dynamical supersymmetry in the cases of ten- and four-dimensional
super-Yang-Mills, and the three-dimensional Bagger-Lambert-Gustavsson theory,
starting from the covariant formulation of these theories.
