We present an analysis of the X-ray properties of 35 submm galaxies(SMGs) in
the CDF-N. Using a sample of robust 850micron-selected galaxies, with accurate
positions from Spitzer and/or radio counterparts, we find 16 objects (45+/-8%)
with significant X-ray detections in the 2Ms Chandra data. 6 of these SMGs
(~17+/-6%) have measured X-ray luminosities or upper limits consistent with
those expected based on the far-infrared (FIR) or radio-derived star formation
rate (SFR), and hence with the X-rays coming solely from star formation. In
another 7 sources (20+/-7%) a dominant AGN contribution to the X-ray emission
is required, while in 3 more it is unclear whether stellar process or accretion
are responsible. Stacking of the X-ray undetected SMGs reveals a highly
significant detection. If due to star formation, this corresponds to an average
X-ray derived SFR of ~150 Msun/yr. We deduce that the AGN fraction in SMGs
based on X-ray observations is 20-29 (+/-7) %, which is towards the lower limit
of previous estimates. Spectral analysis shows that in general the SMGs are not
heavily obscured in the X-ray but most of the SMGs classfied as AGN show
absorption with N_H in excess of 10^22 cm^-2. Of the secure AGN, the bolometric
luminosity appears to be dominated by the AGN in only 3 cases. In ~85% of the
SMGs, the X-ray spectrum effectively rules out an AGN contribution that
dominates the bolometric emission, even if the AGN is Compton thick. The
evidence therefore suggests that intense star formation accounts for both the
FIR and X-ray emission in most SMGs. We argue that, rather than having an
especially high AGN fraction or duty cycle, SMGs have a high X-ray detection
rate at very faint fluxes partly because of their high star formation rates
and, in rarer cases, because the submm emission is from an AGN.(abridged)
