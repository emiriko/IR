We describe here an experimental method that permits to compute a good
candidate for the closed form of a generating function if we know the first few
terms of a series. The method is based on integer relations algorithms and uses
either two programs of symbolic computation: Maple or Pari-Gp. Some results are
presented in the appendix. This method was tested on a set of sequences that
were part of the incoming book on integer sequences (as of 1993). This method
was presented at the FPSAC, Formal Power Series and Algebraic Combinatorics,
Florence, June 1993.
