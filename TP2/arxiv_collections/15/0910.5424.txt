We calculate the vacuum-expectation-value, the meson mass and the meson decay
constant to next-to-next-to-leading-order in the chiral expansion for QCD-like
theories with general $N_F$ degenerate flavours for the cases with a complex
representation, a real and a pseudoreal representation, i.e. with global
symmetry and breaking patters $SU(N_F)_L\times SU(N_F)_R\to SU(N_F)_V$,
$SU(2N_F)\to SO(2N)$ and $SU(2N_F)\to Sp(2N_F)$. These calculations should be
useful for lattice calculations for dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking and
related cases.
