To synthesize proteins in a cell, an mRNA has to work with a finite pool of
ribosomes. When this constraint is included in the modeling by a totally
asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP), non-trivial consequences emerge.
Here, we consider its effects on the power spectrum of the total occupancy,
through Monte Carlo simulations and analytical methods. New features, such as
dramatic suppressions at low frequencies, are discovered. We formulate a theory
based on a linearized Langevin equation with discrete space and time. The good
agreement between its predictions and simulation results provides some insight
into the effects of finite resoures on a TASEP.
