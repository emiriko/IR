The problem of existence of solution for the Heath-Jarrow-Morton equation
with linear volatility and purely jump random factor is studied. Sufficient
conditions for existence and non-existence of the solution in the class of
bounded fields are formulated. It is shown that if the first derivative of the
Levy-Khinchin exponent grows slower then logarithmic function then the answer
is positive and if it is bounded from below by a fractional power function of
any positive order then the answer is negative. Numerous examples including
models with Levy measures of stable type are presented.
