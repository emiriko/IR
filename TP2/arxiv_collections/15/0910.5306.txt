We examine the empirical distribution of the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors
of adjacency matrices of sparse regular random graphs. We find that when the
degree sequence of the graph slowly increases to infinity with the number of
vertices, the empirical spectral distribution converges to the semicircle law.
Moreover, we prove concentration estimates on the number of eigenvalues over
progressively smaller intervals. We also show that, with high probability, all
the eigenvectors are delocalized.
