The mass function of galaxy clusters at high redshifts is a particularly
useful probe to learn about the history of structure formation and constrain
cosmological parameters. We aim at deriving reliable masses for a
high-redshift, high-luminosity sample of clusters of galaxies selected from the
400d survey of X-ray selected clusters. Here, we will focus on a particular
object, CL0030+2618 at z=0.50 Using deep imaging in three passbands with the
MEGACAM instrument at MMT, we show that MEGACAM is well-suited for measuring
gravitational shear. We detect the weak lensing signal of CL0030+2618 at 5.8
sigma significance, using the aperture mass technique. Furthermore, we find
significant tangential alignment of galaxies out to ~10 arcmin or >2r_200
distance from the cluster centre. The weak lensing centre of CL0030+2618 agrees
with several X-ray measurements and the position of the brightest cluster
galaxy. Finally, we infer a weak lensing virial mass of M_200=7.5 10^{14} M_sun
for CL0030+2618. Despite complications by a tentative foreground galaxy group
in the line of sight, the X-ray and weak lensing estimates for CL0030+2618 are
in remarkable agreement. This study paves the way for the largest weak lensing
survey of high-redshift galaxy clusters to date.
