We report studies of photon-stimulated desorption (PSD), also known as
light-induced atomic desorption(LIAD), of sodium atoms from a vacuum cell glass
surface used for loading a magneto-optical trap (MOT). Fluorescence detection
was used to record the trapped atom number and the desorption rate. We observed
a steep wavelength dependence of the desorption process above 2.6 eV photon
energy, a result significant for estimations of sodium vapor density in the
lunar atmosphere. Our data fit well to a simple model for the loading of the
MOT dependent only on the sodium desorption rate and residual gas density. Up
to 3.7x10^7 Na atoms were confined under ultra-high vacuum conditions, creating
promising loading conditions for a vapor cell based atomic Bose-Einstein
condensate of sodium.
