We consider a simplified version of the Wealth Game, which is an agent-based
financial market model with many interesting features resembling the real stock
market. Market makers are not present in the game so that the majority traders
are forced to reduce the amount of stocks they trade, in order to have a
balance in the supply and demand. The strategy space is also simplified so that
the market is only left with strategies resembling the decisions of optimistic
or pessimistic fundamentalists and trend-followers in the real stock market. A
dynamical phase transition between a trendsetters' phase and a bouncing phase
is discovered in the space of price sensitivity and market impact. Analysis
based on a semi-empirical approach explains the phase transition and locates
the phase boundary. A phase transition is also observed when the fraction of
trend-following strategies increases, which can be explained macroscopically by
matching the supply and demand of stocks.
