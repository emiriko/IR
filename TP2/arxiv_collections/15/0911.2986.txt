We study magnetothermal instability in the ionized plasmas including the
effects of Ohmic, ambipolar and Hall diffusion. Magnetic field in the single
fluid approximation does not allow transverse thermal condensations, however,
non-ideal effects highly diminish the stabilizing role of the magnetic field in
thermally unstable plasmas. Therefore, enhanced growth rate of thermal
condensation modes in the presence of the diffusion mechanisms speed up the
rate of structure formation.
