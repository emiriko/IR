When subjected to pressure, the prototypical heavy-fermion antiferromagnet
CeRhIn5 becomes superconducting, forming a broad dome of superconductivity
centered around 2.35 GPa (=P2) with maximal Tc of 2.3 K. Above the
superconducting dome, the normal state shows strange metallic behaviours,
including a divergence in the specific heat and a sub-T-linear electrical
resistivity. The discovery of a field-induced magnetic phase that coexists with
superconductivity for a range of pressures P < P2 has been interpreted as
evidence for a quantum phase transition, which could explain the non-Fermi
liquid behavior observed in the normal state. Here we report electrical
resistivity measurements of CeRhIn5 under magnetic field at P2, where the
resistivity is sub-T-linear for temperatures above Tc (or T_FL) and a
T^2-coefficient A found below T_FL diverges as Hc2 is approached. These results
are similar to the field-induced quantum critical compound CeCoIn5 and confirm
the presence of a quantum critical point in the pressure-induced superconductor
CeRhIn5.
