Recently, a claim of possible evidence for Dark Matter in data from the Fermi
LAT experiment was made by Goodenough and Hooper [8]. We test the Dark Matter
properties consistent with their claim in terms of the MSSM by a 24-dimensional
parameter scan using nested sampling, excluding all but a very small region of
the MSSM. Although this claim is very preliminary, and not made by the Fermi
LAT experiment, our scan shows a possible approach for the analysis of future
firm evidence from an indirect detection experiment, and its potential for
heavily constraining models.
