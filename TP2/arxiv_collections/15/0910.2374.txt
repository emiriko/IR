We report the preparation of sodium alanate, a promising hydrogen storage
material, in a thin film form using co-sputtering in a reactive atmosphere of
atomic hydrogen. We study the phase formation and distribution, and the
hydrogen desorption, with a combination of optical and infrared transmission
spectroscopy. We show that the hydrogen desorption, the phase segregation and
the role of the dopants in these complex metal hydrides can be monitored with
optical measurements. This result shows that a thin film approach can be used
for a model study of technologically relevant lightweight metal hydrides.
