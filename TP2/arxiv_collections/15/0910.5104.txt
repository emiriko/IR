We present a statistical study on parsec scale properties of a sample of
Brigthest Cluster Galaxies (BCGs) in Abell Clusters. These data show a possible
difference between BCGs in cool core clusters (two-sided parsec scale jets) and
in non cool core clusters (one-sided parsec scale jet). We suggest that the
two-sided morphology in cool core clusters could be due to the presence of
mildly relativistic jets slowed down already at mas scale as consequence of the
jet interaction with a dense surrounding medium.
