The supersymmetric finite threshold effects are studied in the presence of
non minimal soft terms that can correct the problematic mass ratios of the
light generations in the minimal SU(5) GUT. We show that with large soft
A-terms, one can achieve simple unification for lighter generations without
additional Higgs multiplet, while having sfermions lighter than 1 TeV. The
presence of such large A-terms will distort the sfermion mass spectrum upon
running from GUT scale down to the electroweak scale making it distinct from
the universal SUSY breaking scenarios, especially in the first two generations.
The implications of these splittings are studied in K and D meson oscillations
and in rare processes D^+ -> pi^+ nu anti-nu and K^+ -> pi^+ nu anti-nu, and in
the latter case the effect is found to be important.
