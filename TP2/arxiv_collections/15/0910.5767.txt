I present a novel macroscopic wave geometric effect of the sunbeam occurring
when the sunbeam directional (shadow by a bar) angle c velocity is observed on
the earth surface and a sunbeam global positioning device with a needle at the
center of radial angle graph paper. The angle c velocity at sunrise or sunset
is found to be same as the rotating rate of swing plane of Foucault pendulum,
showing the earth-self rotation. The angle c velocity at noon is found to have
an additional term resulted from a novel macroscopic wave geometric effect of
the sunbeam. Observing the sunbeam direction same as the earth orbit radial
direction, the inclination angle q of the earth rotation axis in relation to
the sunbeam front plane is found to be related with the earth orbit angle,
describing the earth orbit radial distance. The eccentricity of the earth orbit
and a calendar counting days from perihelion are obtained by dq/dt and q
measured on the earth surface, showing the earth orbiting around the sun.
