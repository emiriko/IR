We demonstrate the existence of superscarring in the LiNC=LiCN isomerization
reaction described by a realistic potential interaction in the range of readily
attainable experimental energies. This phenomenon arises as the effect of two
periodic orbits appearing "out of the blue"in a saddle--node bifurcation taking
place in the dynamics of the system. Potential practical consequences of this
superlocalization in the corresponding wave functions are also considered.
