The zitterbewegung being proportional to $\sin(\epsilon t)$, it is depicted
as the motion of electron from the positive energy state to that of the
negative energy and vice versa in the neighbourhood of Dirac point. Since such
transition involves crossing the Dirac point, the same may be the possible
realisation and measure of the zitterbewegung. In this respect, we draw a
similirity between the zitterbewegung and the Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomaly in
(1+1) QED. In a time dependent perturbation theory, the embodiment of
zitterbewegung is envisaged in the context of graphene.
