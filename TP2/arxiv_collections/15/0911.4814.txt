We have predicted theoretically and detected in laboratory experiments a new
type of particle clustering (tangling clustering of inertial particles) in a
stably stratified turbulence with imposed mean vertical temperature gradient.
In this stratified turbulence a spatial distribution of the mean particle
number density is nonuniform due to the phenomenon of turbulent thermal
diffusion, that results in formation of a gradient of the mean particle number
density, \nabla N, and generation of fluctuations of the particle number
density by tangling of the gradient, \nabla N, by velocity fluctuations. The
mean temperature gradient, \nabla T, produces the temperature fluctuations by
tangling of the gradient, \nabla T, by velocity fluctuations. These
fluctuations increase the rate of formation of the particle clusters in small
scales. In the laboratory stratified turbulence this tangling clustering is
much more effective than a pure inertial clustering that has been observed in
isothermal turbulence. In particular, in our experiments in oscillating grid
isothermal turbulence in air without imposed mean temperature gradient, the
inertial clustering is very weak for solid particles with the diameter 10
microns and Reynolds numbers Re =250. Our theoretical predictions are in a good
agreement with the obtained experimental results.
