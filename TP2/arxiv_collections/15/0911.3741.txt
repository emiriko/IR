The procedure of the construction of a sample of distant ($z>0.3$) radio
galaxies using NED, SDSS, and CATS databases for further application in
statistical tests is described. The sample is assumed to be cleaned from
objects with quasar properties. Primary statistical analysis of the list is
performed and the regression dependence of the spectral index on redshift is
found.
