We propose a Real-Space Gutzwiller variational approach and apply it to a
system of repulsively interacting ultracold fermions with spin 1/2 trapped in
an optical lattice with a harmonic confinement. Using the Real-Space Gutzwiller
variational approach, we find that in system with balanced spin-mixtures on a
square lattice, antiferromagnetism either appears in a checkerboard pattern or
forms a ring and antiferromagnetic order is stable in the regions where the
particle density is close to one, which is consistent with the recent results
obtained by the Real-Space Dynamical Mean-field Theory approach. We also
investigate the imbalanced case and find that antiferromagnetic order is
suppressed there.
