In this note we introduce a method to calculate the finite volume corrections
to the mean field results for the free energy when replica symmetry is broken
at one-step. We find that the naive results are modified by the presence of
additional corrections: these corrections can be interpreted as arising from
fluctuations in the size of the blocks in the replica approach. The computation
suggests a new approach for deriving the replica broken results in a rigorous
way.
