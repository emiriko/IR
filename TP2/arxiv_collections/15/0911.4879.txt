The Multiconjugate Adaptive optics Demonstrator (MAD) has successfully
demonstrated on sky both Star Oriented (SO) and Layer Oriented (LO)
multiconjugate adaptive optics techniques. While SO has been realized using 3
Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensors (WFS), we designed a multi-pyramid WFS for the
LO. The MAD bench accommodates both WFSs and a selecting mirror allows choosing
which sensor to use. In the LO approach up to 8 pyramids can be placed on as
many reference stars and their light is co-added optically on two different
CCDs conjugated at ground and to an high layer. In this paper we discuss LO
commissioning phase and on sky operations.
