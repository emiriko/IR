We demonstrate Cooper-pair's drastic enhancement effect on band-to-band
radiative recombination in a semiconductor. Electron Cooper pairs injected from
a superconducting electrode into an active layer by the proximity effect
recombine with holes injected from a p-type electrode and dramatically
accelerate the photon generation rates of a light emitting diode in the
optical-fiber communication band. Cooper pairs are the condensation of
electrons at a spin-singlet quantum state and this condensation leads to the
observed enhancement of the electric-dipole transitions. Our results indicate
the possibility to open up new interdisciplinary fields between
superconductivity and optoelectronics.
