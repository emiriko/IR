We analyze the photon rates from a hadronic gas in equilibrium using chiral
reduction formulas and a density expansion. The chiral reduction is carried to
second order in the pion density which in principal includes all kinetic
processes of the type $X\to \pi\gamma$ and $X\to \pi\pi\gamma$. The resulting
rates are encoded in the form of vacuum correlation functions which are
amenable to experiment. The hadronic rates computed in this work along with the
known perturbative QGP rates are integrated over the space-time evolution of a
hydrodynamic model tuned to hadronic observables. The resulting yields are
compared to the recent photon and low mass dilepton measurements at the SPS and
RHIC. Predictions for the LHC are made.
