The single-top production cross section is one third that of the top-pair
production cross section at the LHC. During the first year of data taking, the
determination of the major contributions to the total single-top cross section
should be achievable. Comparisons between the measured cross sections and the
theoretical predictions will provide a crucial test of the standard model.
These measurements should also lead to a direct measurement of |V_tb| with a
precision at the level of a few percent. In addition, they will probe for new
physics via the search for evidence of anomalous couplings to the top quark and
measurements of additional bosonic contributions to single-top production.
Methods developed to optimize the selection of single-top events in the three
production channels are presented and the potential for the cross section
measurements is established.
