We present experimental schemes that allow to study the entanglement classes
of all symmetric states in multiqubit photonic systems. In addition to
comparing the presented schemes in efficiency, we will highlight the relation
between the entanglement properties of symmetric Dicke states and a recently
proposed entanglement scheme for atoms. In analogy to the latter, we obtain a
one-to-one correspondence between well-defined sets of experimental parameters
and multiqubit entanglement classes inside the symmetric subspace of the
photonic system.
