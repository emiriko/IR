We examine hybrid thermal-nonthermal synchrotron spectra from a spherically
symmetric, optically-thin wind, taking into account the relativistic effect. In
the relativistic flow from the central object, due to the relativistic beaming
effect, the observed spectra often shift towards high frequency and high
intensity directions. In the optically thin outflows, however, we find that the
intensity of the observed spectra decreases compared with that of the emitted
ones, although the peak frequency shifts towards the high frequency direction.
This is because in the optically thin outflows we can see the far side flows
that go away from the observer. We thus carefully consider optically thin
relativistic flows around a black hole such as Sgr A$^*$.
