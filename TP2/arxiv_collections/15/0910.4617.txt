In this paper, by introducing a wider class of one-parameter group actions
for test configurations, we have a stronger form of the definition of
K-stability. This allows us to obtain some key step of my preceding work in
proving that constant scalar curvature polarization implies K-stability for
polarized algebraic manifolds.
