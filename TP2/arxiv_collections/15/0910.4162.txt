We study magnetic properties of the $S=1/2$ Ising-like XXZ model on the
Shastry-Sutherland lattices with long-range interactions, using the quantum
Monte Carlo method. This model shows magnetization plateau phases at one-half
and one-third of the saturation magnetization when additional couplings are
considered. We investigate the finite temperature transition to one-half and
one-third plateau phases. The obtained results suggest that the former case is
of the first order and the latter case is of the second order. We also find
that the system undergoes two successive transitions with the 2D Ising model
universality, although there is a single phase transition in the Ising limit
case. Finally, we estimate the coupling ratio to explain the magnetization
process observed in ${\rm TmB_4}$
