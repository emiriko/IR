We propose a new method to calculate stellar weak-interaction rates. It is
based on the Thermo-Field-Dynamics formalism and allows the calculation of the
weak-interaction response of nuclei at finite temperatures. The thermal
evolution of the GT$_+$ distributions is presented for the sample nuclei $^{54,
56}$Fe and ~$^{76,78,80}$Ge. For Ge we also calculate the strength distribution
of first-forbidden transitions. We show that thermal effects shift the GT$_+$
centroid to lower excitation energies and make possible negative- and
low-energy transitions. In our model we demonstrate that the unblocking effect
for GT$_+$ transitions in neutron-rich nuclei is sensitive to increasing
temperature. The results are used to calculate electron capture rates and are
compared to those obtained from the shell model.
