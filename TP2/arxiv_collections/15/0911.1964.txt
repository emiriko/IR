In the factorized picture of semi-inclusive hadronic processes the naive time
reversal-odd parton distributions exist by virtue of the gauge link which
renders it color gauge invariant. The link characterizes the dynamical effect
of initial/final-state interactions of the active parton due soft gluon
exchanges with the target remnant. Though these interactions are
non-perturbative, studies of final-state interaction have been approximated by
perturbative one-gluon approximation in Abelian models. We include higher-order
contributions by applying non-perturbative eikonal methods incorporating color
degrees of freedom in a calculation of the Boer-Mulders function of the pion.
Using this framework we explore under what conditions the Boer Mulders function
can be described in terms of factorization of final state interactions and a
spatial distribution in impact parameter space.
