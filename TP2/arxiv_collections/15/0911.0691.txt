We give a brief report on spectroscopic properties of V 393 Scorpii. H alfa
emission and shape and radial velocity of He I 5875 are modulated with the long
cycle. The long cycle is explained as a relaxation cycle in the circumprimary
disc, that cumulates the mass transferred from the donor until certain
instability produces disc depletion.
