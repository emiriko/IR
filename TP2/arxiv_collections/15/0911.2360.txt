We show all-versus-nothing proofs of Bell's theorem in the one-dimensional
transverse-field Ising model, which is one of the most important exactly
solvable models in the field of condensed matter physics. Since this model can
be simulated with nuclear magnetic resonance, our work might lead to a fresh
approach to experimental test of the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger contradiction
between local realism and quantum mechanics.
