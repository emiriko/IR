We calculate the microwave conductivity of a two band superconductor with
$s^\pm$ gap symmetry. Inelastic scattering is included approximately in a BCS
model augmented by a temperature dependent quasiparticle scattering rate
assumed, however, to be frequency independent. The possibility that the s-wave
gap on one or the other of the electron or hole pockets is anisotropic is
explored including cases with and without gap nodes on the Fermi surface. A
comparison of our BCS results with those obtained in the Two Fluid Model (TFM)
is provided as well as with the case of the cuprates where the gap has d-wave
symmetry and with experimental results in Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$. The
presently available microwave conductivity data in this material provides
strong evidence for large anisotropies in the electron pocket s-wave gap. While
a best fit favors a gap with nodes on the Fermi surface this disagrees with
some but not all penetration depth measurements which would favor a node-less
gap as do also thermal conductivity and nuclear magnetic resonance data.
