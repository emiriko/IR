We consider the possibility that the Higgs boson can act as a link to a
hidden sector in the context of pure-glue hidden valley models. In these models
the standard model is weakly coupled, through loops of heavy messengers fields,
to a hidden sector whose low energy dynamics is described by a pure-Yang-Mills
theory. Such a hidden sector contains several metastable hidden glueballs. In
this work we shall extend earlier results on hidden valleys to include
couplings of the messengers to the standard model Higgs sector. The effective
interactions at one-loop couple the hidden gluons to the standard model
particles through the Higgs sector. These couplings in turn induce hidden
glueball decays to fermion pairs, or cascade decays with multiple Higgs
emission. The presence of effective operators of different mass dimensions,
often competing with each other, together with a great diversity of states,
leads to a great variability in the lifetimes and decay modes of the hidden
glueballs. We find that most of the operators considered in this paper are not
heavily constrained by precision electroweak physics, therefore leaving plenty
of room in the parameter space to be explored by the future experiments at the
LHC.
