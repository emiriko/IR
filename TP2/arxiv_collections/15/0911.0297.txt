The rare decay B to K* (to K pi) mu+ mu- is regarded as one of the crucial
channels for B physics since its angular distribution gives access to many
observables that offer new important tests of the Standard Model and its
extensions. We point out a number of correlations among various observables
which will allow a clear distinction between different New Physics (NP)
scenarios. Furthermore, we discuss the decay B to K* nu anti-nu which allows
for a transparent study of Z penguin effects in NP frameworks in the absence of
dipole operator contributions and Higgs penguin contributions. We study all
possible observables in B to K* nu anti-nu and the related b to s transitions B
to K nu anti-nu and B to X_s nu anti-nu in the context of the SM and various NP
models.
