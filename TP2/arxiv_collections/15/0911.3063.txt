We report the detection of pulsed gamma-rays for PSRs J0631+1036, J0659+1414,
J0742-2822, J1420-6048, J1509-5850 and J1718-3825 using the Large Area
Telescope (LAT) on board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (formerly known as
GLAST). Although these six pulsars are diverse in terms of their spin
parameters, they share an important feature: their gamma-ray light curves are
(at least given the current count statistics) single peaked. For two pulsars
there are hints for a double-peaked structure in the light curves. The shapes
of the observed light curves of this group of pulsars are discussed in the
light of models for which the emission originates from high up in the
magnetosphere. The observed phases of the gamma-ray light curves are, in
general, consistent with those predicted by high-altitude models, although we
speculate that the gamma-ray emission of PSR J0659+1414, possibly featuring the
softest spectrum of all Fermi pulsars coupled with a very low efficiency,
arises from relatively low down in the magnetosphere. High-quality radio
polarization data are available showing that all but one have a high degree of
linear polarization. This allows us to place some constraints on the viewing
geometry and aids the comparison of the gamma-ray light curves with high-energy
beam models.
