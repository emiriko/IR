Previously unobservable mirror asymmetry of the solar magnetic field -- a key
ingredient of the dynamo mechanism which is believed to drive the 11-year
activity cycle -- has now been measured. This was achieved through systematic
monitoring of solar active regions carried out for more than 20 years at
observatories in Mees, Huairou, and Mitaka. In this paper we report on detailed
analysis of vector magnetic field data, obtained at Huairou Solar Observing
Station in China. Electric current helicity (the product of current and
magnetic field component in the same direction) was estimated from the data and
a latitude-time plot of solar helicity during the last two solar cycles has
been produced. We find that like sunspots helicity patterns propagate
equatorwards but unlike sunspot polarity helicity in each solar hemisphere does
not change sign from cycle to cycle - confirming the theory. There are,
however, two significant time-latitudinal domains in each cycle when the sign
does briefly invert. Our findings shed new light on stellar and planetary
dynamos and has yet to be included in the theory.
