In this paper, we analyze the performance of an electro-optic modulator based
on a single quantum dot strongly coupled to a nano-resonator, where electrical
control of the quantum dot frequency is achieved via quantum confined Stark
effect. Using realistic system parameters, we show that modulation speeds of a
few tens of GHz are achievable with this system, while the energy per switching
operation can be as small as 0.5 fJ. In addition, we study the non-linear
distortion, and the effect of pure quantum dot dephasing on the performance of
the modulator.
