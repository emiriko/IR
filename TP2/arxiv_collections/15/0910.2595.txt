We propose a new approach for the Higgs boson production by Double Pomeron
Exchange (DPE) in the Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering, where a color dipole
interacts diffractively with the proton by DPE. Applying it to Peripheral
Collisions, we predict a cross section around 0.1 fb, which is similar to that
obtained from the $\gamma\gamma$ subprocess. Although this result is lower than
the prediction from the KMR approach, our results are competitive with the
$\gamma\gamma$ and Pomeron-Pomeron subprocesses with a more precise proposal
for the Gap Survival Probability.
