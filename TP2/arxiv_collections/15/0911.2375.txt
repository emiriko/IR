We present a graph-based technique for estimating sparse covariance matrices
and their inverses from high-dimensional data. The method is based on learning
a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and estimating parameters of a multivariate
Gaussian distribution based on a DAG. For inferring the underlying DAG we use
the PC-algorithm and for estimating the DAG-based covariance matrix and its
inverse, we use a Cholesky decomposition approach which provides a positive
(semi-)definite sparse estimate. We present a consistency result in the
high-dimensional framework and we compare our method with the Glasso for
simulated and real data.
