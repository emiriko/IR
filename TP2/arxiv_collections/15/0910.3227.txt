A methodology is presented for bounding all higher moments of the local
hydrostatic stress field inside random two phase linear thermoelastic media
undergoing macroscopic thermomechanical loading. The method also provides a
lower bound on the maximum local stress. Explicit formulas for the optimal
lower bounds are found that are expressed in terms of the applied macro- scopic
thermal and mechanical loading, coefficients of thermal expansion, elastic
properties, and volume fractions. These bounds provide a means to measure load
transfer across length scales relating the excursions of the local fields to
the applied loads and the thermal stresses inside each phase. These bounds are
shown to be the best possible in that they are attained by the Hashin-Shtrikman
coated sphere assemblage.
