The results related to non-equilibrium phenomena at the very early and late
stages of the processes of A+A collisions are presented. A good description of
the hadron momentum spectra as well as pion and kaon interferometry data at
RHIC is reached within the realistic dynamical picture of A+A collisions:
HydroKinetic Model (HKM). The model accumulates the following features: not too
early thermalization time; $\tau\geq 1$ fm/c; a developing of the pre-thermal
transverse flows; the effectively more hard, than in the case of chemical
equilibrium, equation of state of expanding chemically non-equilibrated
multi-hadronic gas; a continuous non-equilibrated emission of hadrons. All
these factors lead to a good description of the mentioned RHIC data, in
particular, the observed $R_{out}/R_{side}$ ratios, solving, therefore, the HBT
puzzle in detailed realistic model.
