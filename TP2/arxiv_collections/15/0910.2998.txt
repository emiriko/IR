We study the gamma rays observed by the Fermi Gamma Ray Space Telescope from
the direction of the Galactic Center and find that their angular distribution
and energy spectrum are well described by a dark matter annihilation scenario.
In particular, we find a good fit to the data for dark matter particles with a
25-30 GeV mass, an annihilation cross section of ~9x10^-26 cm^3/s, and that are
distributed with a cusped halo profile within the inner kiloparsec of the
Galaxy. We cannot, however, exclude the possibility that these photons
originate from an astrophysical source or sources with a similar morphology and
spectral shape to those predicted in an annihilating dark matter scenario.
