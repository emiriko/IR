We use magnetic levitation and a variable-separation dual optical plug to
obtain clear spatial interference between two condensates axially separated by
up to 0.25 mm -- the largest separation observed with this kind of
interferometer. Clear planar fringes are observed using standard (i.e.
non-tomographic) resonant absorption imaging. The effect of a weak inverted
parabola potential on fringe separation is observed and agrees well with
theory.
