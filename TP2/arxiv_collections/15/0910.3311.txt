The decays of $\chi_{cJ} \to \pi^+\pi^-, K^+K^-$ $(J=0,2)$ are discussed
within the standard and modified hard scattering approach when including the
contributions from twist-3 distribution amplitudes and wave functions of the
light pseudoscalar meson. A model for twist-2 and twist-3 distribution
amplitudes and wave functions of the pion and kaon with BHL prescription are
proposed as the solution to the end-point singularities. The results show that
the contributions from twist-3 parts are actually not power suppressed
comparing with the leading-twist contribution. After including the effects from
the transverse momentum of light meson valence-quark state and Sudakov factors,
the decay widths of the $\chi_{cJ}$ into pions or kaons are comparable with the
their experimental data.
