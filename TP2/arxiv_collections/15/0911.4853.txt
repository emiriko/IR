We have collected continuum data of a sample of D-type symbiotic stars. By
modelling their spectral energy distribution in a colliding-wind theoretical
scenario we have found the common characteristics to all the systems: 1) at
least two dust shells are clearly present, one at \sim 1000 K and the other at
\sim 400 K; they dominate the emission in the IR; 2) the radio data are
explained by thermal self-absorbed emission from the reverse shock between the
stars; while 3) the data in the long wavelength tail come from the expanding
shock outwards the system; 4) in some symbiotic stars, the contribution from
the WD in the UV is directly seen. Finally, 5) for some objects soft X-ray
emitted by bremsstrahlung downstream of the reverse-shock between the stars are
predicted. The results thus confirm the validity of the colliding wind model
and the important role of the shocks. The comparison of the fluxes calculated
at the nebula with those observed at Earth reveals the distribution throughout
the system of the different components, in particular the nebulae and the dust
shells. The correlation of shell radii with the orbital period shows that
larger radii are found at larger periods. Moreover, the temperatures of the
dust shells regarding the sample are found at 1000 K and <=400 K, while, in the
case of late giants, they spread more uniformly throughout the same range.
