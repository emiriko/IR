The number of main-sequence stars for which we can observe solar-like
oscillations is expected to increase considerably with the short-cadence
high-precision photometric observations from the NASA Kepler satellite. Because
of this increase in number of stars, automated tools are needed to analyse
these data in a reasonable amount of time. In the framework of the asteroFLAG
consortium, we present an automated pipeline which extracts frequencies and
other parameters of solar-like oscillations in main-sequence and subgiant
stars. The pipeline uses only the timeseries data as input and does not require
any other input information. Tests on 353 artificial stars reveal that we can
obtain accurate frequencies and oscillation parameters for about three quarters
of the stars. We conclude that our methods are well suited for the analysis of
main-sequence stars, which show mainly p-mode oscillations.
