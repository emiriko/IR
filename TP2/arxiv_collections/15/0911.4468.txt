Quasiparticles in semiconductors -- such as microcavity polaritons -- can
form condensates in which the steady-state density profile is set by the
balance of pumping and decay. By taking account of the polarization degree of
freedom for a polariton condensate, and considering the effects of an applied
magnetic field, we theoretically discuss the interplay between polarization
dynamics, and the spatial structure of the pumped decaying condensate. If
spatial structure is neglected, this dynamics has attractors that are linearly
polarized condensates (fixed points), and desynchronized solutions (limit
cycles), with a range of bistability. Considering spatial fluctuations about
the fixed point, the collective spin modes can either be diffusive, linearly
dispersing, or gapped. Including spatial structure, interactions between the
spin components can influence the dynamics of vortices; produce stable
complexes of vortices and rarefaction pulses with both co- and counter-rotating
polarizations; and increase the range of possible limit cycles for the
polarization dynamics, with different attractors displaying different spatial
structures.
