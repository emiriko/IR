The energy-momentum tensor, which is coordinate independent, is used to
calculate energy, momentum and angular-momentum of two different tetrad fields.
Although, the two tetrad fields reproduce the same space-time their energies
are different. Therefore, a regularized expression of the gravitational
energy-momentum tensor of the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity,
(TEGR), is used to make the energies of the two tetrad fields equal. The
definition of the gravitational energy-momentum is used to investigate the
energy within the external event horizon. The components of angular-momentum
associated with these space-times are calculated. In spite that we use a static
space-times, we get a non-zero component of angular-momentum! Therefore, we
derive the killing vectors associated with these space-times using the
definition of the Lie derivative of a second rank tensor in the framework of
the TEGR to make the picture more clear.
