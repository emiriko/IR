We searched for long-term period changes in the polar EK UMa using new
optical data and archival X-ray/EUV data. An optical ephemeris was derived from
data taken remotely with the MONET/N telescope and compared with the X-ray
ephemeris based on Einstein, Rosat, and EUVE data. A three-parameter fit to the
combined data sets yields the epoch, the period, and the phase offset between
the optical minima and the X-ray absorption dips. An added quadratic term is
insignificant and sets a limit to the period change. The derived linear
ephemeris is valid over 30 years and the common optical and X-ray period is
P=0.0795440225(24) days. There is no evidence of long-term O-C variations or a
period change over the past 17 years Delta P = -0.14+-0.50 ms. We suggest that
the observed period is the orbital period and that the system is tightly
synchronized. The limit on Delta P and the phase constancy of the bright part
of the light curve indicate that O-C variations of the type seen in the polars
DP Leo and HU Aqr or the pre-CV NN Ser do not seem to occur in EK UMa. The
X-ray dips lag the optical minima by 9.5+-0.7 deg in azimuth, providing some
insight into the accretion geometry.
