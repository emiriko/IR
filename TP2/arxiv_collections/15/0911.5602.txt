. Plasma jets are a high temperature flows, then all physical parameters are
temperature dependent. This work aims to address the issue of simulating
plasma-jet from the point of view of extending the applications to simulating
flows with temperature-dependent diffusion parameters (viscosity and
diffusivity), focusing on the phenomena occurring in plasma-jet flow for a
mixture of plasma gases, N2-Ar62.5% vol. Argon and Nitrogen are two gases of
the most ones used in plasma spraying. The mixture is used when looking for
some jet properties. We limit our effort to take out the dynamic and thermal
characteristics of this complex flow using the lattice Boltzmann equation. An
important section focuses mainly on the validation of our results with compute
jet dynamics software such as GENMIX and Jets & Poudres developed in laboratory
SPCTS in several updated edition. These codes established for many turbulence
models (k-epsilon, k-omega, Prandtl's models...) are helpful numerical keys for
understanding the physics of plasma jets and plasma spraying.
