We investigate the spectral evolution of an antiferromagnetic insulator,
La$_{0.2}$Sr$_{0.8}$MnO$_3$ exhibiting linear specific heat using
state-of-the-art high resolution photoemission spectroscopy. Experimental
spectral functions exhibit Fermi liquid like energy dependence at all the
temperatures studied. Room temperature spectrum possess finite density of
states at the Fermi level that vanishes generating a soft gap at about 260 K
(the magnetic transition temperature). High resolution spectra reveal a hard
gap in the magnetically ordered phase (C-type antiferromagnet). These results
indicate signature of an amorphous phase coexisting with the long range ordered
phase in these materials.
