Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber detectors are well suited to study
neutrino interactions, and are an intriguing option for future massive
detectors capable of measuring the parameters that characterize neutrino
oscillations. These detectors combine fine-grained tracking with calorimetry,
allowing for excellent imaging and particle identification ability. In this
talk the details of the MicroBooNE experiment, a 175 ton LArTPC which will be
exposed to Fermilab's Booster Neutrino Beamline starting in 2011, will be
presented. The ability of MicroBooNE to differentiate electrons from photons
gives the experiment unique capabilities in low energy neutrino interaction
measurements.
