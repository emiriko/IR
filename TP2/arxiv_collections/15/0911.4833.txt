In this paper, we consider reachability games over general hybrid systems,
and distinguish between two possible observation frameworks for those games:
either the precise dynamics of the system is seen by the players (this is the
perfect observation framework), or only the starting point and the delays are
known by the players (this is the partial observation framework). In the first
more classical framework, we show that time-abstract bisimulation is not
adequate for solving this problem, although it is sufficient in the case of
timed automata . That is why we consider an other equivalence, namely the
suffix equivalence based on the encoding of trajectories through words. We show
that this suffix equivalence is in general a correct abstraction for games. We
apply this result to o-minimal hybrid systems, and get decidability and
computability results in this framework. For the second framework which assumes
a partial observation of the dynamics of the system, we propose another
abstraction, called the superword encoding, which is suitable to solve the
games under that assumption. In that framework, we also provide decidability
and computability results.
