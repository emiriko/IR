We give a review of recent results on the heavy fermion superconductor
CeRhIn$_5$ which presents ideal conditions to study the interplay of
antiferromagnetism and superconductivity. The main results are the appearance
of domains of microscopic coexistence of antiferromagnetism and
superconductivity under both, pressure and magnetic field scans. At zero
magnetic field, under pressure coexistence appears from the onset of pressure
induced superconductivity up to the critical pressure $p_c^\star$ where
antiferrmognetism disappears abruptly. Under magnetic field, re-entrance of
magnetic order inside the superconducting state occurs in the pressure range
from $p_c^\star$ up to $p_c$. The antiferromagnetic quantum critical point is
hidden by the onset of superconductivity. A striking point is the similarity of
the phase diagram of CeRhIn$_5$ and that of the high $T_c$ cuprate
superconductors where for the cuprates the carrier concentration replaces the
pressure. Both systems are characterized by: hidden magnetic quantum
criticality, field reentrance of magnetism and the strong link to a Fermi
surface instability.
