Tracker detectors can be used to identify charged particles based on their
global chi value obtained during track fitting with the Kalman filter. This
approach builds upon the knowledge of detector material and local position
resolution, using the known physics of multiple scattering and energy loss. The
proposed method is independent of the traditional way of identification using
deposited energy. The performance for present LHC experiments is demonstrated.
