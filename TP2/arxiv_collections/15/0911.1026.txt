In this work we suggest a simplified "quasi-classical" formalism of the
Schwarzschild black hole thermodynamics. We define such small quantum system at
Schwarzschild black hole horizon surface whose reduced Compton wavelength
equals one circumference of a great circle on the black hole horizon surface.
(It is in some way similar to the Bohr orbital momentum quantization postulate
for the ground state interpreted via de Broglie relation.) It admits very
simple functional connections between all black hole basic thermodynamic
characteristics (Unruh temperature, Hawking temperature, Bekenstein-Hawking
entropy, Bekenstein entropy horizon surface quantization, evaporation time) and
small quantum system mass. All this can be very interesting for the quantum
gravity specialists as well as non-specialists.
