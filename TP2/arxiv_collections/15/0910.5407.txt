Charm procceses are usually not considered to be favorable candidates in the
search for new physics. Recent disagreement between experimental and lattice
QCD results on the D_s decay constant has motivated us to systematically
reinvestigate role of leptoquarks in rare charm meson decays. We include
constrains coming from the light meson decays.
