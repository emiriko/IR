One of the important perturbative ("hard") probes of hot and dense QCD matter
is the medium-induced energy loss of energetic partons, so called "jet
quenching", which is predicted to be very different in cold nuclear matter and
in QGP, and leads to a number of phenomena which are already seen in the RHIC
data on the qualitative level. The inclusion of jet quenching and other
important collective effects, such as radial and elliptic flows, in the
existing Monte-Carlo models of relativistic heavy ion collisions is discussed.
Some issues on the corresponding physical observables at RHIC and LHC energies
obtained with HYDJET++ model are presented.
