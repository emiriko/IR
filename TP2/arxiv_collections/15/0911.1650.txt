Half-vortices have been recently shown to be the elementary topological
defects supported by a spinor cavity exciton-polaritons condensates with spin
anisotropic interactions (Y. G. Rubo, Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 106401 (2007)). A
half vortex is composed by an integer vortex for one circular component of the
condensate, whereas the other component remain static. We analyze theoretically
the effect of the splitting between TE and TM polarized eigen modes on the
structure of the vortices in this system. For TE and TM modes, the polarization
states depend on the direction of propagations of particles and imposes some
well defined phase relation between the two circular component. As a result
elementary topogical defects in this system are no more half vortices but
integer vortices correspond to an integer vortex for both circular components
of the condensate. The intrinsic life time of half vortices is given and the
texture of a few vortex states is analyzed.
