We study transport properties of anisotropic Heisenberg model in a disordered
magnetic field experiencing dephasing due to external degrees of freedom. In
the absence of dephasing the model can display, depending on parameter values,
the whole range of possible transport regimes: ideal ballistic conduction,
diffusive, or ideal insulating behavior. We show that the presence of dephasing
induces normal diffusive transport in a wide range of parameters. We also
analyze the dependence of spin conductivity on the dephasing strength. In
addition, by analyzing the decay of spin-spin correlation function we discover
a presence of long-range order for finite chain sizes. All our results for a
one-dimensional spin chain at infinite temperature can be equivalently
rephrased for strongly-interacting disordered spinless fermions.
