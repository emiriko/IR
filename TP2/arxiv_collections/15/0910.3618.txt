We present the status of the MILC collaboration's analysis of the light
pseudoscalar meson sector with SU(3) chiral fits. The analysis includes data
from new ensembles with smaller lattice spacing, smaller light quark masses and
lighter than physical strange quark masses. Our fits include the NNLO chiral
logarithms. We present results for decay constants, quark masses,
Gasser-Leutwyler low energy constants, and condensates in the two- and
three-flavor chiral limits.
