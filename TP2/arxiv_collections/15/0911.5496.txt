We study the steady-state current in a minimal model for a quantum dot
dominated by charge fluctuations and analytically describe the time evolution
into this state. The current is driven by a finite bias voltage V across the
dot, and two different renormalization group methods are used to treat small to
intermediate local Coulomb interactions. The corresponding flow equations can
be solved analytically which allows to identify all microscopic cutoff scales.
Exploring the entire parameter space we find rich non-equilibrium physics which
cannot be understood by simply considering the bias voltage as an infrared
cutoff. For the experimentally relevant case of left-right asymmetric
couplings, the current generically shows a power-law suppression for large V.
The relaxation dynamics towards the steady state features characteristic
oscillations as well as an interplay of exponential and power-law decay.
