The BCS results for the superconducting gap $\Delta$ and $T_C$ are obtained
from a one-particle model. Superconductivity appears when the electronic energy
gains of the band structure surpass the energy needed for atomic vibrations or
magnetic moment oscillations. The vibration/oscillation amplitudes determine
the superconducting gap, and the Fermi surface is important for the
q-dependence. This permits for complementary interpretations of the parameters
for superconductivity and modeling of density-of-state effects. It also makes
the superconducting mechanism less exotic.
