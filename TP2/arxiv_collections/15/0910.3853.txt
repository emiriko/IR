When the surface angular velocity is above about 70% of the critical angular
velocity, many interesting features appear which may be tested by
interferometric observations, like significant deformation of stars, variation
of the effective temperature with the latitude. Also polar winds become
important and equatorial disks may appear. Near the critical limit, convection
is also favored in the outer layers. In the present paper, we emphasize the
need for a proper estimate of the critical velocity since this is the ratio of
the actual velocity of the star to that critical velocity which determines the
amplitude of the above effects. We recall the existence of two critical
velocities. The first one, also called the classical critical velocity is the
one to consider when the star has an Eddington factor inferior to 0.639, while
the second one is the one to be considered when the Eddington factor is above
0.639. The features of the star at these two critical limits may be very
different.
