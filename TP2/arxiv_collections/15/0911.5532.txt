We construct positive-definite pseudofermion actions for one fermion flavor
in lattice field theory, for Wilson and domain-wall fermions respectively. The
positive definiteness of these actions ensures that they can be simulated with
the Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) method. For lattice QCD with optimal domain-wall
quarks, we compare the efficiency of HMC simulations of 2-flavor and
(1+1)-flavor, and find that the efficiency ratio is about 3:2.
