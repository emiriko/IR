We report on a new method to determine the degree of bulk spin polarization
in single crystal Co$_{(1-x)}$Fe$_x$S$_2$ by modeling magnetic Compton
scattering with {\it ab initio} calculations. Spin-dependent Compton profiles
were measured for CoS$_2$ and Co$_{0.9}$Fe$_{0.1}$S$_2$. The {\it ab initio}
calculations were then refined by rigidly shifting the bands to provide the
best fit between the calculated and experimental directional profiles for each
sample. The bulk spin polarizations, $P$, corresponding to the spin-polarized
density of states at the Fermi level, were then extracted from the {\it
refined} calculations. The values were found to be $P=-72 \pm 6 %$ and $P=18
\pm 7%$ for CoS$_2$ and Co$_{0.9}$Fe$_{0.1}$S$_2$ respectively. Furthermore,
determinations of $P$ weighted by the Fermi velocity ($v_F$ or $v_F^2$) were
obtained, permitting a rigorous comparison with other experimental data and
highlighting the experimental dependence of $P$ on $v_F$.
