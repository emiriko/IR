The video shows the flow dynamics within inner and outer regions of a vortex
core. The observed phenomena mimic a transport process occurring within the
Antarctic vortex. The video shows two distinct regions: a strongly mixed core
and broad ring of weakly mixed region extending out the vortex core boundaries.
The two regions are separated by a thin layer that isolates the weakly and
strongly mixed regions; this thin layer behaves as barrier to the mixing of the
two regions. The video shows that the barriers deplete when a swirl of the
vortex core increases and the vortex core espouses a triangular pattern.
