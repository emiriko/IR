We show that proper time, when defined in the quantum theory of 2d gravity,
becomes identical to the stochastic time associated with the stochastic
quantization of space. This observation was first made by Kawai and
collaborators in the context of 2d Euclidean quantum gravity, but the relation
is even simpler and more transparent in he context of 2d gravity formulated in
the framework of CDT (causal dynamical triangulations).
