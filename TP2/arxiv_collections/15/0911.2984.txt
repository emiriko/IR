We investigate the thermodynamics of complexation of functionalized charged
nano-spheres with viral proteins. The physics of this problem is governed by
electrostatic interaction between the proteins and the nano-sphere cores
(screened by salt ions), but also by configurational degrees of freedom of the
charged protein N-tails. We approach the problem by constructing an appropriate
complexation free energy functional. On the basis of both numerical and
analytical studies of this functional we construct the phase diagram for the
assembly which contains the information on the assembled structures that appear
in the thermodynamical equilibrium, depending on the size and surface charge
density of the nano-sphere cores. We show that both the nano-sphere core charge
as well as its radius determine the size of the capsid that forms around the
core.
