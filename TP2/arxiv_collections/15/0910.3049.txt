Through top-quark pair productions at LHC, we study possible effects of
nonstandard top-gluon couplings yielded by SU(3)xSU(2)xU(1) invariant
dimension-6 effective operators. We calculate the total cross section and also
some distributions for p p -> t tbar X as functions of two anomalous-coupling
parameters, i.e., the chromoelectric and chromomagnetic moments of the top,
which are constrained by the total cross section sigma(p pbar -> t tbar X)
measured at Tevatron. We find that LHC might give us some chances to observe
sizable effects induced by those new couplings.
