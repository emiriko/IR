Squark and gluino decays are governed by the same mixing matrices as the
contributions to flavour violating loop transitions of B-mesons. This allows
for possible direct correlations between flavour non-diagonal observables in B
and high-p_T physics. The present bounds on squark mixing, induced by the
low-energy data on b to s transitions, still allow for large contributions to
flavour violating squark decays at tree level. Due to the restrictions in
flavour tagging at the LHC, additional information from future flavour
experiments will be necessary to interpret those LHC data properly. Also the
measurement of correlations between various squark decay modes at a future ILC
would provide information about the flavour violating parameters.
