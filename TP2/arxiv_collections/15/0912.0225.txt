We obtain a modified version of Coulomb's law in two- and three-dimensional
closed spaces. We demonstrate that in a closed space the total electric charge
must be zero. We also discuss the relation between total charge neutrality of a
isotropic and homogenous universe to whether or not its spatial sector is
closed.
