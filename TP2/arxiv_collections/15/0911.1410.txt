In soft matter systems the local displacement field can be accessed directly
by video microscopy enabling one to compute local strain fields and hence the
elastic moduli using a coarse-graining procedure. We study this process for a
simple triangular lattice of particles connected by harmonic springs in
two-dimensions. Coarse-graining local strains obtained from particle
configurations in a Monte Carlo simulation generates non-trivial, non-local
strain correlations (susceptibilities), which may be understood within a
generalized, Landau type elastic Hamiltonian containing up to quartic terms in
strain gradients (K. Franzrahe et al., Phys. Rev. E 78, 026106 (2008)). In
order to demonstrate the versatility of the analysis of these correlations and
to make our calculations directly relevant for experiments on colloidal solids,
we systematically study various parameters such as the choice of statistical
ensemble, presence of external pressure and boundary conditions. We show that
special care needs to be taken for an accurate application of our results to
actual experiments, where the analyzed area is embedded within a larger system,
to which it is mechanically coupled. Apart from the smooth, affine strain
fields, the coarse-graining procedure also gives rise to a noise field made up
of non-affine displacements. Several properties of this noise field may be
rationalized for the harmonic solid using a simple "cell model" calculation.
Furthermore the scaling behavior of the probability distribution of the noise
field is studied and a master curve is obtained.
