Let G be a connected reductive algebraic group and let G'=[G,G] be its
derived subgroup. Let (G,V) be a multiplicity free representation with a one
dimensional quotient (see definition below). We prove that the algebra
D(V)^{G'} of G'-invariant differential operators with polynomial coefficients
on V, is a quotient of a so-called Smith algebra over its center. Over C this
class of algebras was introduced by S.P. Smith as a class of algebras similar
to the enveloping algebra U(sl(2)) of sl(2). Our result generalizes the case of
the Weil representation, where the associative algebra generated by Q(x) and
Q(?) (Q being a non degenerate quadratic form on V) is a quotient of U(sl(2))
Other structure results are obtained when (G,V) is a regular prehomogeneous
vector space of commutative parabolic type.
