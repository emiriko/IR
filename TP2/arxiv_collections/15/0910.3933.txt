The precise form of the multi-Regge asymptotics of the two-loop six-point MHV
amplitude in N = 4 Super-Yang-Mills theory has been a subject of recent
controversy. In this paper we utilize the amplitude/Wilson loop correspondence
to obtain precise numerical results for the imaginary part of these
asymptotics. The region of phase-space that we consider is interesting because
it allowed Bartels, Lipatov, and Sabio Vera to determine that the two-loop
six-point MHV amplitude is not fixed by the BDS ansatz. They proceeded by
working in the framework of a high energy effective action, thus side-stepping
the need for an arduous two-loop calculation. Our numerical results are
consistent with the predictions of Bartels, Lipatov, and Sabio Vera for the
leading-log asymptotics.
