This review is based on lectures on flavor physics given at TASI 2008. First
I summarize our present knowledge on the fundamental parameters of the flavor
sector. Then I discuss various scenarios going beyond the standard model which
attempt to explain aspects of the "flavor puzzle". Relating quark masses and
mixing angles via flavor symmetry is explored. Explaining the mass hierarchy
via the Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism is reviewed and illustrated. Grand
unification ideas are pursued to seek a pattern in the observed masses and
mixings of quarks and leptons. Generating light fermion masses as radiative
corrections is explained and illustrated. The popular solutions to the strong
CP problem are summarized. Finally, specific processes in B meson system where
significant new flavor contributions can arise are discussed.
