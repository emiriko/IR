We obtain an analytic expression for the full distribution of conductance for
a strongly disordered three dimensional conductor within a perturbative
approach based on the transfer-matrix formulation. Our results confirm
numerical evidence that the log-normal limit of the distribution is not reached
even in the deeply insulating regime. We show that the variance of the
logarithm of the conductance scales as a fractional power of the mean, while
the skewness changes sign as one approaches the Anderson metal-insulator
transition from the deeply insulating limit, all described as a function of a
single parameter. The approach suggests a possible single parameter description
of the Anderson transition that takes into account the full nontrivial
distribution of conductance.
