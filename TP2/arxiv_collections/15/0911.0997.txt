We review the basic notions of compactification in the presence of a
background flux. In extra-dimentional models with more than five dimensions,
Scherk and Schwarz boundary conditions have to satisfy 't Hooft consistency
conditions. Different vacuum configurations can be obtained, depending whether
trivial or non-trivial 't Hooft flux is considered. The presence of the
"magnetic" background flux provide, in addition, a mechanism for producing
four-dimensional chiral fermions. Particularizing to the six-dimensional case,
we calculate the one-loop effective potential for a U(N) gauge theory on M4 x
T2. We firstly review the well known results of the trivial 't Hooft flux case,
where one-loop contributions produce the usual Hosotani dynamical symmetry
breaking. Finally we applied our result for describing, for the first time, the
one-loop contributions in the non-trivial 't Hooft flux case.
