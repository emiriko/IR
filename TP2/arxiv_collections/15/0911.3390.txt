We have investigated the evolution of a pair of interacting planets embedded
in a gaseous disc, considering the possibility of the resonant capture of a
Super-Earth by a Jupiter mass gas giant. First, we have examined the situation
where the Super-Earth is on the internal orbit and the gas giant on the
external one. It has been found that the terrestrial planet is scattered from
the disc or the gas giant captures the Super-Earth into an interior 3:2 or 4:3
mean-motion resonance. The stability of the latter configurations depends on
the initial planet positions and on eccentricity evolution. The behaviour of
the system is different if the Super-Earth is the external planet. We have
found that instead of being captured in the mean-motion resonance, the
terrestrial planet is trapped at the outer edge of the gap opened by the gas
giant. This effect prevents the occurrence of the first order mean-motion
commensurability. These results are particularly interesting in light of recent
exoplanet discoveries and provide predictions of what will become
observationally testable in the near future.
