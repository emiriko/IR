We develop a theory of residues for arithmetic surfaces, establish the
reciprocity law around a point, and use the residue maps to explicitly
construct the dualizing sheaf of the surface. These are generalisations of
known results for surfaces over a perfect field. In an appendix, explicit local
ramification theory is used to recover the fact that in the case of a local
complete intersection the dualizing and canonical sheaves coincide.
