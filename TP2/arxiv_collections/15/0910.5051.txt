We explore the potential for the direct detection of light fermionic dark
matter in neutrino detectors. We consider the possible observation of the
process $\bar{f} p \to e^+ n$, where $f$ is a dark matter fermion, in a
model-independent manner. All operators of dimension six or lower which can
contribute to this process are listed, and we place constraints on these
operators from decays of $f$ which contain $\gamma$ rays or electrons. One
operator is found which is sufficiently weakly constrained that it could give
observable interactions in neutrino detectors. We find that Super-Kamiokande
can probe the new physics scale for this operator up to $O(100{TeV})$.
