The Young Stellar Object (YSO) W33A is one of the best known examples of a
massive star still in the process of forming. Here we present Gemini North
ALTAIR/NIFS laser-guide star adaptive-optics assisted K-band integral-field
spectroscopy of W33A and its inner reflection nebula. In our data we make the
first detections of a rotationally-flattened outer envelope and fast bi-polar
jet of a massive YSO at near-infrared wavelengths. The predominant spectral
features observed are Br-gamma, H_2, and a combination of emission and
absorption from CO gas. We perform a 3-D spectro-astrometric analysis of the
line emission, the first study of its kind. We find that the object's Br-gamma
emission reveals evidence for a fast bi-polar jet on sub-milliarcsecond scales,
which is aligned with the larger-scale outflow. The hybrid CO features can be
explained as a combination of hot CO emission arising in a disk close to the
central star, while cold CO absorption originates in the cooler outer envelope.
Kinematic analysis of these features reveals that both structures are rotating,
and consistent with being aligned perpendicularly to both the ionised jet and
the large-scale outflow. Assuming Keplerian rotation, we find that the
circumstellar disk orbits a central mass of >10Msun, while the outer envelope
encloses a mass of ~15Msun. Our results suggest a scenario of a central star
accreting material from a circumstellar disk at the centre of a cool extended
rotating torus, while driving a fast bi-polar wind. These results therefore
provide strong supporting evidence for the hypothesis that the formation
mechanism for high-mass stars is qualitatively similar to that of low-mass
stars.
