Based on ab-initio calculations we identify possible scenarios for the Kondo
effect due to Co ad-atoms on graphene. General symmetry arguments show that for
magnetic atoms in high-symmetry positions, the Kondo effect in graphene is
controlled not only by the spin but also by the orbital degree of freedom. For
a Co atom absorbed on top of a carbon atom, the Kondo effect is quenched by
spin-orbit coupling below an energy scale of $\sim 15$\,K. For Co with spin
$S=1/2$ located in the center of a hexagon, an SU(4) Kondo model describes the
entanglement of orbital moment and spin at higher energies, while below \sim
60$\,meV spin-orbit coupling leads to a more conventional SU(2) Kondo effect.
The interplay of the orbital Co physics and the peculiar band-structure of
graphene is directly accessible in Fourier transform tunneling spectroscopy or
in the gate-voltage dependence of the Kondo temperature displaying a very
strong, characteristic particle-hole asymmetry.
