In this article, we investigate the contribution of the higher-twist Feynman
diagrams to the large-$p_T$ inclusive single meson production cross section in
photon-photon collisions and present the general formulas for the higher-twist
differential cross sections in case of the running coupling and frozen coupling
approaches. The structure of infrared renormalon singularities of the
higher-twist subprocess cross section and the resummed expression (the Borel
sum) for it are found. We compared the resummed higher-twist cross sections
with the ones obtained in the framework of the frozen coupling approach and
leading-twist cross section. We obtain, that ratio
$R=(\Sigma_{M^{+}}^{HT})^{res}$ / $(\Sigma_{M^{+}}^{HT})^{0}$, for all values
of the transverse momentum $p_{T}$ of the meson identically equivalent to ratio
$r$=($\Delta_{M}^{HT})^{res}$ / $(\Delta_{M}^{HT})^{0}$. It is shown that the
resummed result depends on the choice of the meson wave functions used in
calculation. Phenomenological effects of the obtained results are discussed.
