A noteworthy feature of the S-matrix which has been proposed for AdS4/CFT3 is
that the scattering of an A-particle ("soliton") with a B-particle
("antisoliton") is reflectionless. We argue, following Zamolodchikov, that the
absence of reflection is a result of the existence of certain local conserved
charges which act differently on the two types of particles.
