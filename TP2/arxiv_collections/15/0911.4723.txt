The study of chemical abundances in stars with planets is an important
ingredient for the models of formation and evolution of planetary systems. In
order to determine accurate abundances, it is crucial to have a reliable set of
atmospheric parameters. In this work, we describe the homogeneous determination
of effective temperatures, surface gravities and iron abundances for a large
sample of stars with planets as well as a control sample of stars without giant
planets. Our results indicate that the metallicity distribution of the stars
with planets is more metal rich by ~ 0.13 dex than the control sample stars.
