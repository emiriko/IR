We present an analysis of low energy CP violating observables in the Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). We focus on the predictions of CP
violation in b -> s transitions in the framework of a flavor blind MSSM, where
the CKM matrix remains the only source of flavor violation, but additional CP
violating phases are introduced in the soft SUSY breaking sector. We find large
and strongly correlated effects in Delta F = 0 observables like the electric
dipole moments (EDMs) of the electron and the neutron, as well as in Delta F =
1 observables like the time dependent CP asymmetries in B -> phi K_s and B ->
eta' K_s, the direct CP asymmetry in b -> s gamma and in several CP asymmetries
in B -> K* mu+ mu-. On the other hand, observables that are only sensitive to
CP violation in Delta F = 2 transitions, in particular the B_s mixing phase,
are found to be SM like in this framework. We stress that only in presence of
additional sources of flavor violation, sizeable New Physics effects to CP
violation in meson mixing can occur.
