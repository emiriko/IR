Symmetry-breaking magnetization dynamics of a spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate
(BEC) due to the dipole-dipole interaction are investigated using the
mean-field and Bogoliubov theories. When a magnetic field is applied along the
symmetry axis of a pancake-shaped BEC in the m = 0 hyperfine sublevel,
transverse magnetization develops breaking the chiral or axial symmetry. A
variety of magnetization patterns are formed depending on the strength of the
applied magnetic field. The proposed phenomena can be observed in 87Rb and 23Na
condensates.
