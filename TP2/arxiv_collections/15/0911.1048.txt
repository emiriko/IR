The sociological domain is different from the psychological one insofar as
meaning can be communicated at the supra-individual level (Schutz, 1932;
Luhmann, 1984). The computation of anticipatory systems enables us to
distinguish between these domains in terms of weakly and strongly anticipatory
systems with a structural coupling between them (Maturana, 1978). Anticipatory
systems have been defined as systems which entertain models of themselves
(Rosen, 1985). The model provides meaning to the modeled system from the
perspective of hindsight, that is, by advancing along the time axis towards
possible future states. Strongly anticipatory systems construct their own
future states (Dubois, 1998a and b). The dynamics of weak and strong
anticipations can be simulated as incursion and hyper-incursion, respectively.
Hyper-incursion generates "horizons of meaning" (Husserl, 1929) among which
choices have to be made by incursive agency.
