In the present work, we investigate the formation of Stokes profiles and
spectro-polarimetric diagnostics in an active region plage near the limb. We
use 3-D radiation-MHD simulations with unipolar fields of an average strength
of 400 G, which is largely concentrated in flux tubes in which the field
reaches typical kilo-Gauss values. We generate synthetic Stokes spectra by
radiative transfer calculations, then we degrade the simulated Stokes signal to
account for observational conditions. The synthetic data treated in this manner
are compared with and found to roughly reproduce spectro-polarimetric
high-resolution observations at Mu=0.39 obtained by the SOUP instrument with
the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope at the beginning of 2006.
