Scattering of light by the photonic clusters made of small particles is
studied with the help of the quasiperiodicity condition and the local
perturbation method. The analytical expression for the field scattered by the
cluster is presented and the conditions of resonance scattering are found. The
conditions of the zero scattering by the cluster are also found.
