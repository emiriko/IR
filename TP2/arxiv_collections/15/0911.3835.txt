We discuss prospects of building hybrid quantum devices involving elements of
atomic and molecular physics, quantum optics and solid state elements with the
attempt to combine advantages of the respective systems in compatible
experimental setups. In particular, we summarize our recent work on quantum
hybrid devices and briefly discuss recent ideas for quantum networks. These
include interfacing of molecular quantum memory with circuit QED, and using
nanomechanical elements strongly coupled to qubits represented by electronic
spins, as well as single atoms or atomic ensembles.
