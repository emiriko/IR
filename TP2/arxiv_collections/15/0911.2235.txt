A generic process has been developed to grow nearly defect free arrays of
(heterostructured) InP and GaP nanowires. Soft nanoimprint lithography has been
used to pattern gold particle arrays on full 2 inch substrates. After lift-off
organic residues remain on the surface, which induce the growth of additional
undesired nanowires. We show that cleaning of the samples before growth with
piranha solution in combination with a thermal anneal at 550 C for InP and 700
C for GaP results in uniform nanowire arrays with 1% variation in nanowire
length, and without undesired extra nanowires. Our chemical cleaning procedure
is applicable to other lithographic techniques such as e-beam lithography, and
therefore represents a generic process.
