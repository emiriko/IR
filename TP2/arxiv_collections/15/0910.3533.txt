The squashed and stretched 7-dimensional internal metric preserving U(1) x
U(1) x U(1)_R symmetry possesses an Einstein-Kahler 2-fold which is a base
manifold of 5-dimensional Sasaki-Einstein L^{p, q, r} space. The r(transverse
to the domain wall)-dependence of the two 4-dimensional supergravity fields,
that play the role of geometric parameters for squashing and stretching, makes
the 11-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell equations consistent not only at the two
critical points but also along the whole N=2 supersymmetric RG flow connecting
them. The Ricci tensor of the solution has common feature with the previous
three 11-dimensional solutions. The 4-forms preserve only U(1)_R symmetry for
other generic parameters of the metric. We find an exact solution to the
11-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell equations corresponding to the lift of the
4-dimensional supersymmetric RG flow.
