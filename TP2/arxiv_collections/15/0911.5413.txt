Suppose we have three independent copies of a regular diffusion on $[0,1]$
with absorbing boundaries. Of these diffusions, either at least two are
absorbed at the upper boundary or at least two at the lower boundary. In this
way, they determine a majority decision between 0 and 1. We show that the
strategy that always runs the diffusion whose value is currently between the
other two reveals the majority decision whilst minimizing the total time spent
running the processes.
