We discuss the interplay between LHC signatures and the mechanism by which
dark matter is generated in the early universe in supersymmetric theories. The
LHC signatures of two of the major mechanisms for such generation of dark
matter which are known to be the Stau Coannihilation (Stau-Co) region and
annihilation on the Hyperbolic Branch (HB) are exhibited in detail. By
analyzing the various LHC signatures, including multi leptons, hadronic jets,
b-tagging, and missing transverse momentum, one can discriminate between the
Stau-Co region and the HB region for the mSUGRA model. Interestingly, there are
some regions of the parameter space which are beyond the current and near
future reach of the dark matter direct detection experiments but will be
accessible at the LHC, and vise versa.
