A double-exchange mechanism for the emergence of ferromagnetism in cubic
uranium compounds is proposed on the basis of a $j$-$j$ coupling scheme. The
idea is {\it orbital-dependent duality} of $5f$ electrons concerning itinerant
$\Gamma_8^-$ and localized $\Gamma_7^-$ states in the cubic structure. Since
orbital degree of freedom is still active in the ferromagnetic phase,
orbital-related quantum critical phenomenon is expected to appear. In fact,
odd-parity p-wave pairing compatible with ferromagnetism is found in the
vicinity of an orbital ordered phase. Furthermore, even-parity d-wave pairing
with significant odd-frequency components is obtained. A possibility to observe
such exotic superconductivity in manganites is also discussed briefly.
