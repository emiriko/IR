Demographic noise has profound effects on evolutionary and population
dynamics, as well as on chemical reaction systems and models of epidemiology.
Such noise is intrinsic and due to the discreteness of the dynamics in finite
populations. We here show that similar noise-sustained trajectories arise in
game dynamical learning, where the stochasticity has a different origin: agents
sample a finite number of moves of their opponents in-between adaptation
events. The limit of infinite batches results in deterministic modified
replicator equations, whereas finite sampling leads to a stochastic dynamics.
The characteristics of these fluctuations can be computed analytically using
methods from statistical physics, and such noise can affect the attractors
significantly, leading to noise-sustained cycling or removing periodic orbits
of the standard replicator dynamics.
