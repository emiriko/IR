Arthur [1,2] provided a model to explain the circumstances that lead to
technological lock-in into a specific trajectory. We contribute substantially
to this area of research by investigating the circumstances under which
technological development may break-out of a trajectory. We argue that for this
to happen, a third selection mechanism--beyond those of the market and of
technology--needs to upset the lock-in. We model the interaction, or mutual
shaping among three selection mechanisms, and thus this paper also allows for a
better understanding of when a technology will lock-in into a trajectory, when
a technology may break-out of a lock-in, and when competing technologies may
co-exist in a balance. As a system is conceptualized to gain a (third) degree
of freedom, the possibility of bifurcation is introduced into the model. The
equations, in which interactions between competition and selection mechanisms
can be modeled, allow one to specify conditions for lock-in, competitive
balance, and break-out.
