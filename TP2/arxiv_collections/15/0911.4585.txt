We present an ab initio study of the HeH$^+$ molecule. Using the quantum
chemistry package MOLPRO and a large adapted basis set, we have calculated the
adiabatic potential energy curves of the first 20 $^1 \Sigma^+$, 19
$^3\Sigma^+$, 12 $^1\Pi$, 9 $^3\Pi$, 4 $^1\Delta$ and 2 $^3\Delta$ electronic
states of the ion in CASSCF and CI approaches. The results are compared with
previous works. The radial and rotational non-adiabatic coupling matrix
elements as well as the dipole moments are also calculated. The asymptotic
behaviour of the potential energy curves and of the various couplings between
the states is also studied. Using the radial couplings, the diabatic
representation is defined and we present an example of our diabatization
procedure on the $^1\Sigma^+$ states.
