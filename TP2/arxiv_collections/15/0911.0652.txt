Just as physicists strive to develop a TOE (theory of everything), which
explains and unifies the physical laws of the universe, the life-scientist
wishes to uncover the TOE as it relates to cellular systems. This can only be
achieved with a quantitative platform that can comprehensively deduce and
relate protein structure, functional, and evolution of genomes and proteomes in
a comparative fashion. Were this perfected, proper analyses would start to
uncover the underlying physical laws governing the emergent behavior of
biological systems and the evolutionary pressures responsible for functional
innovation. In the near term, such methodology would allow the vast quantities
of uncharacterized (e.g. metagenomic samples) primary amino acid sequences to
be rapidly decoded. Analogous to natural products found in the Amazon, genomes
of living organisms contain large numbers of proteins that would prove useful
as new therapeutics for human health, energy sources, and/or waste management
solutions if they could be identified and characterized. We previously
theorized that phylogenetic profiles could provide a quantitative platform for
obtaining unified measures of structure, function, and evolution (SF&E)(1). In
the present manuscript, we present data that support this theory and
demonstrates how refinements of our analysis algorithms improve the performance
of phylogenetic profiles for deriving structural/functional relationships.
