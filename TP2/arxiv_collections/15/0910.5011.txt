We analyze the perturbative series expansion of vacuum expectation values
(vevs) for Wilson loop operators in Chern-Simons (CS) gauge theory in the
temporal gauge $A_{0}=0$. Following J. Labastida and E. P\'erez we introduce
the notion of the kernels of knot polynomial invariants - the (non-invariant)
vevs of the Wilson loops, arising from CS theory in the temporal gauge. A
method for exact calculation of the kernels of knot polynomial invariants is
presented.
