The total entropy production of a trajectory can be split into an adiabatic
and a non-adiabatic contribution, deriving respectively from the breaking of
detailed balance via nonequilibrium boundary conditions or by external driving.
We show that each of them, the total, the adiabatic and the non-adiabatic
trajectory entropy, separately satisfies a detailed fluctuation theorem.
