The composition factors and their multiplicities are determined for
generalised Verma modules over the orthosymplectic Lie superalgebra osp(k|2).
The results enable us to obtain explicit formulae for the formal characters and
dimensions of the finite-dimensional irreducible modules. Applying these
results, we also compute the first and second cohomology groups of the Lie
superalgebra with coefficients in finite-dimensional Kac modules and
irreducible modules.
