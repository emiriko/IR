The idea of the preferred frame as a remedy for difficulties of the
relativistic quantum mechanics in description of the non-local quantum
phenomena was undertaken by such physicists as J. S. Bell and D. Bohm. The
possibility of the existence of preferred frame was also seriously treated by
P. A. M. Dirac. In this paper, we propose an Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-type
experiment for testing the possible existence of a quantum preferred frame. Our
analysis suggests that to verify whether a preferred frame of reference in the
quantum world exists it is enough to perform an EPR type experiment with pair
of observers staying in the same inertial frame and with use of the massive EPR
pair of spin one-half or spin one particles.
