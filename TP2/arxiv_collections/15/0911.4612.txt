We report interesting observations in 1.2 MeV Ar8+ ion irradiated ZnO which,
to the best of our knowledge, have not been published earlier and will be
useful for the scientific community engaged in research on ZnO. Irradiation
with the initial fluence 1 X 10^15 ions/cm^2 changes the colour of the sample
from white to orange while the highest irradiation fluence makes it dark
reddish brown that appears as black. Such changes in colour can be correlated
with the oxygen vacancy type defects. No significant change in the grain size
of the irradiated samples, as revealed from the x-ray diffraction (XRD) line
width broadening, has been observed. Increase of surface roughness due to
sputtering is clearly visible in scanning electron micrographs (SEM) with
highest fluence of irradiation. Room temperature Photoluminescence (PL)
spectrum of the unirradiated sample shows intense ultra-violet (UV) emission (~
3.27 eV) and less prominent defect level emissions (2-3 eV). The overall
emission is largely quenched due to initial irradiation fluence. But with
increasing fluence UV emission is enhanced along with prominent defect level
emissions. Remarkably, the resistivity of the irradiated sample with highest
fluence is reduced by four orders of magnitude compared to that of the
unirradiated sample. This indicates increase of donor concentration as well as
their mobility due to irradiation. Oxygen vacancies are deep donors in ZnO, but
surely they influence the stability of the shallow donors (presumably zinc
interstitial related) and vice versa. This is in conformity with recent
theoretical calculations.
