We present a catalogue of Molecular Hydrogen emission-line Objects (MHOs) in
outflows from young stars, most of which are embedded. All objects are
identified in the near-infrared lines of molecular hydrogen, all reside in the
Milky Way, and all are associated with jets or molecular outflows from young
stars. Objects in both low and high-mass star forming regions are included.
This catalogue complements the existing database of Herbig-Haro objects;
indeed, for completeness, HH objects that are detected in H2 emission are
included in the MHO catalogue.
