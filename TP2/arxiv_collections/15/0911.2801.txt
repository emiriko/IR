In this paper, we give a general framework for the Boltzmann generation of
colored objects belonging to combinatorial constructible classes. We propose an
intuitive notion called profiled objects which allows the sampling of
size-colored objects (and also of k-colored objects) although the corresponding
class cannot be described by an analytic ordinary generating function.
