Investigating the interaction of electrons in a superconductor by means of a
method of solitary waves of Korteweg - de Vries, we refute the claim of absence
of "Cooper pairs" in a superconductor. We also indicate that the nondissipative
transfer of energy in the superconductor is possible only with the help of a
pair of electrons.
