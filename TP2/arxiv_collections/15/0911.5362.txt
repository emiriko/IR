Heavy-light meson system is investigated using the relativistic heavy quark
action on the 2+1 dynamical flavor PACS-CS configurations at the lattice
spacing $a^{-1}=2.2$ GeV and the spatial extent L=3 fm. Dynamical up-down and
strange quark masses as well as the valence charm quark mass are set around
their physical values. We measure the charm-$ud$ and charm-strange meson masses
and decay constants. Our results are consistent with the experimental values
except the hyperfine splitting of the charm-strange meson. We also estimate the
CKM matrix elements in the second row.
