This has much in common with traditional work in statistics and machine
learning. However, there are important new issues which arise because of the
sheer size of the data. One of the important problem in data mining is the
Classification-rule learning which involves finding rules that partition given
data into predefined classes. In the data mining domain where millions of
records and a large number of attributes are involved, the execution time of
existing algorithms can become prohibitive, particularly in interactive
applications.
