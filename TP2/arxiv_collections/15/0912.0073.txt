An analytic Bethe ansatz is carried out related to the Lie superalgebra
osp(1|2s). We present an eigenvalue formula of a transfer matrix in dressed
vacuum form (DVF) labeled by a Young (super) diagram. Remarkable duality among
DVFs is found. A complete set of transfer matrix functional relations
(T-system) is proposed as a reduction of a Hirota-Miwa equation. We also derive
a thermodynamic Bethe ansatz (TBA) equation from this T-system and the quantum
transfer matrix method. This TBA equation is identical to the one from the
string hypothesis.
