The construction (by Kapranov) of the space of infinitesimal paths on a
manifold is extended to include higher dimensional infinitesimal objects,
encoding contractions of infinitesimal loops. This full infinitesimal groupoid
is shown to have the algebra of polyvector fields as its non-linear cohomology.
