Most simulations of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) to date either focus on the
interplanetary propagation of a giant plasma "blob" without paying too much
attention to its origin and to the formation process or they focus on the
complex evolution of the coronal magnetic field due to (sub-)photospheric
motions which result in an eruption. Here, we present global simulations of
CMEs where coronal motions are used to produce a realistic evolution of the
coronal magnetic field and cause an eruption. We focus on active region 10069,
which produced a number of eruptions in late August 2002, including the August
24, 2002 CME - a fast (~2000 km/s) eruption originating from W81-, as well as a
slower eruption on August 22, 2002 (originating from W62). Using a
three-dimensional magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulation of these ejections with
the Space Weather Modeling Framework (SWMF), we show how a realistic initiation
mechanism enables us to study the deflection of the CME in the corona and in
the heliosphere. Reconnection of the erupting magnetic field with that of
neighboring streamers and active regions modify the solar connectivity of the
field lines connecting to Earth and change the expected solar energetic
particle fluxes. Comparing the results at 1 AU of our simulations with in situ
observations by the ACE spacecraft, we propose an alternate solar origin for
the shock wave observed at L1 on August 26.
