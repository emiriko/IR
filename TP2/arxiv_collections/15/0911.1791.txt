We present results from the first systematic search for outlying HII regions,
as part of a sample of 96 emission-line point sources (referred to as ELdots -
emission-line dots) derived from the NOAO Survey for Ionization in Neutral Gas
Galaxies (SINGG). Our automated ELdot-finder searches SINGG narrow-band and
continuum images for high equivalent width point sources outside the optical
radius of the target galaxy (> 2 X r25 in the R-band). Follow-up longslit
spectroscopy and deep GALEX images (exposure time > 1000 s) distinguish
outlying HII regions from background galaxies whose strong emission lines
([OIII], Hbeta or [OII]) have been redshifted into the SINGG bandpass. We find
that these deep GALEX images can serve as a substitute for spectroscopic
follow-up because outlying HII regions separate cleanly from background
galaxies in color-color space. We identify seven SINGG systems with outlying
massive star formation that span a large range in Halpha luminosities
corresponding to a few O stars in the most nearby cases, and unresolved dwarf
satellite companion galaxies in the most distant cases. Six of these seven
systems feature galaxies with nearby companions or interacting galaxies.
Furthermore, our results indicate that some outlying HII regions are linked to
the extended-UV disks discovered by GALEX, representing emission from the most
massive O stars among a more abundant population of lower mass (or older) star
clusters. The overall frequency of outlying HII regions in this sample of
gas-rich galaxies is 8 - 11% when we correct for background emission-line
galaxy contamination (~75% of ELdots).
