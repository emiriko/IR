A more sums than differences (MSTD) set is a finite subset S of the integers
such |S+S| > |S-S|. We show that the probability that a uniform random subset
of {0, 1, ..., n} is an MSTD set approaches some limit rho > 4.28 x 10^{-4}.
This improves the previous result of Martin and O'Bryant that there is a lower
limit of at least 2 x 10^{-7}. Monte Carlo experiments suggest that rho \approx
4.5 \x 10^{-4}. We present a deterministic algorithm that can compute rho up to
arbitrary precision. We also describe the structure of a random MSTD subset S
of {0, 1, ..., n}. We formalize the intuition that fringe elements are most
significant, while middle elements are nearly unrestricted. For instance, the
probability that any ``middle'' element is in S approaches 1/2 as n ->
infinity, confirming a conjecture of Miller, Orosz, and Scheinerman. In
general, our results work for any specification on the number of missing sums
and the number of missing differences of S, with MSTD sets being a special
case.
