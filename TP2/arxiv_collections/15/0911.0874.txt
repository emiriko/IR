Two-player zero-sum repeated games are well understood. Computing the value
of such a game is straightforward. Additionally, if the payoffs are dependent
on a random state of the game known to one, both, or neither of the players,
the resulting value of the game has been analyzed under the framework of
Bayesian games. This investigation considers the optimal performance in a game
when a helper is transmitting state information to one of the players.
  Encoding information for an adversarial setting (game) requires a different
result than rate-distortion theory provides. Game theory has accentuated the
importance of randomization (mixed strategy), which does not find a significant
role in most communication modems and source coding codecs. Higher rates of
communication, used in the right way, allow the message to include the
necessary random component useful in games.
