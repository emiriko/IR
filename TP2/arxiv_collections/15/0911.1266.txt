The rebellious voter model, introduced by Sturm and Swart (2008), is a
variation of the standard, one-dimensional voter model, in which types that are
locally in the minority have an advantage. It is related, both through duality
and through the evolution of its interfaces, to a system of branching
annihilating random walks that is believed to belong to the
`parity-conservation' universality class. This paper presents numerical data
for the rebellious voter model and for a closely related one-sided version of
the model. Both models appear to exhibit a phase transition between
noncoexistence and coexistence as the advantage for minority types is
increased. For the one-sided model (but not for the original, two-sided
rebellious voter model), it appears that the critical point is exactly a half
and two important functions of the process are given by simple, explicit
formulas, a fact for which we have no explanation.
