We consider the influence of the electron spin on the nonlinear propagation
of whistler waves. For this purpose a recently developed electron two-fluid
model, where the spin up- and down populations are treated as different fluids,
is adapted to the electron MHD regime. We then derive a nonlinear Schrodinger
equation for whistler waves, and compare the coefficients of nonlinearity with
and without spin effects. The relative importance of spin effects depend on the
plasma density and temperature as well as the external magnetic field strength
and the wave frequency. The significance of our results to various plasmas are
discussed.
