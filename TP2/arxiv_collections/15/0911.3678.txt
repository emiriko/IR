$M(B)$-curves were experimentally investigated. Fishtail-effect (FE) was
observed in MG YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ and
YBa$_2$(Cu$_{1-x}$Ag$_x$)$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ (at $x \approx$ 0.02) crystals in a
wide temperature range 0.4 $<T/T_c<$ 0.8 at the orientation of magnetic field
$\textbf{H}\parallel c$. It was obtained that the influence of bulk pinning on
FE is more effective at low temperatures while surface barriers dominates at
high temperatures. The value $H_{max}$ for Ag-doped crystals is larger than for
a pure one that due to the presence of additional pinning centers, above all on
silver atoms.
