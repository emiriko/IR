It is well-known that in bulk, the solution of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes
equations is the same whether or not the Hartree-Fock term is included. Here
the Hartree-Fock potential is position independent and, so, gives the same
contribution to both the single-electron energies and the Fermi level (the
chemical potential). Thus, the single-electron energies measured from the Fermi
level (they control the solution) stay the same. It is not the case for
nanostructured superconductors, where quantum confinement breaks the
translational symmetry and results in a position dependent Hartree-Fock
potential. In this case its contribution to the single-electron energies
depends on the relevant quantum numbers. We numerically solved the
Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations with the Hartree-Fock term for a clean
superconducting nanocylinder and found a shift of the curve representing the
thickness-dependent oscillations of the critical superconducting temperature to
larger diameters.
