This paper focuses on methodological approaches for characterising the
specific topics within a technological field based on scientific literature
data. We introduce a diachronic clustering analysis approach and some
bibliometric indicators. The results are visualised with the software-tool
Stanalyst [1]. We are applying our methods to the field "Molecular Biology".
This field has grown a great deal in the last decade.
