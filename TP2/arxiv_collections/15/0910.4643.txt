We present optical ESO time-series and UV archival (FUSE, HST, IUE)
spectroscopy of the H-rich central star of He 2-138. Our study targets the
central star wind in a very young planetary nebula, and explores physical
conditions that may provide clues to the nature of the preceding post-AGB
super-wind phases of the star. We provide evidence for a dense, slowly
accelerating outflow that is variable on time-scales of hours. Line-synthesis
modelling (SEI and CMFGEN) of low and high ionization UV and optical lines is
interpreted in terms of an asymmetric, two-component outflow, where high-speed
high-ionization gas forms mostly in the polar region. Slower, low ionization
material is then confined primarily to a cooler equatorial component of the
outflow. A dichotomy is also evident at photospheric levels. We also document
temporal changes in the weak photospheric lines of He 2-138, with tentative
evidence for a 0.36-day modulation in blue-to-red migrating features in the
absorption lines. These structures may betray 'wave-leakage' of prograde
non-radial pulsations of the central star. These multi-waveband results on the
aspherical outflow of He 2-138 are discussed in the context of current interest
in understanding the origin of axi- and point-symmetric planetary nebulae.
