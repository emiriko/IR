We analyze the five-dimensional AdS gravity coupled to a gauge field and a
charged scalar field. Under a Scherk-Schwarz compactification, we show that the
system undergoes a superconductor/insulator transition at zero temperature in
2+1 dimensions as we change the chemical potential. By taking into account a
confinement/deconfinement transition, the phase diagram turns out to have a
rich structure. We will observe that it has a similarity with the RVB
(resonating valence bond) approach to high-Tc superconductors via an emergent
gauge symmetry.
