X ray clusters are conventionally divided into two classes: "cool core" (CC)
and "non cool core" (NCC) objects, on the basis of the observational properties
of their central regions. Recent results have shown that the cluster population
is bimodal (Cavagnolo et al. 2009). We want to understand whether the observed
distribution of clusters is due to a primordial division into two distinct
classes rather than to differences in how these systems evolve across cosmic
time. We systematically search the ICM of NCC clusters in a subsample of the
B55 flux limited sample of clusters for regions which have some characteristics
typical of cool cores, namely low entropy gas and high metal abundance We find
that most NCC clusters in our sample host regions reminiscent of CC, i. e.
characterized by relative low entropy gas (albeit not as low as in CC systems)
and a metal abundance excess. We have dubbed these structures "cool core
remnants", since we interpret them as what remains of a cool core after a
heating event (AGN giant outbursts in a few cases and more commonly mergers).
We infer that most NCC clusters have undergone a cool core phase during their
life. The fact that most cool core remnants are found in dynamically active
objects provides strong support to scenarios where cluster core properties are
not fixed "ab initio" but evolve across cosmic time.
