Coherent diffraction imaging (CDI) on Bragg reflections is a promising
technique for the study of three-dimensional (3D) composition and strain fields
in nanostructures, which can be recovered directly from the coherent
diffraction data recorded on single objects. In this article we report results
obtained for single homogeneous and heterogeneous nanowires with a diameter
smaller than 100 nm, for which we used CDI to retrieve information about
deformation and faults existing in these wires. The article also discusses the
influence of stacking faults, which can create artefacts during the
reconstruction of the nanowire shape and deformation.
