Non-mesonic transition of Lambda(1405) N to YN is investigated as one of the
essential processes for the non-mesonic absorption of Kbar in nuclei. Using
one-meson exchange model in the calculation of the transition, we find that the
non-mesonic transition ratio Gamma_{Lambda N} / Gamma_{Sigma N} depends
strongly on the ratio of the Lambda(1405) (Lambda^*) couplings to Kbar N and pi
Sigma. Especially a larger Lambda^*-Kbar N coupling leads to enhancement of the
transition to Lambda N. Using the chiral unitary model for the description of
the Lambda^*, we obtain Gamma_{Lambda N} / Gamma_{Sigma^{0} N} is approximately
1.2 which is almost independent of the nucleon density, and find the total
non-mesonic decay width of the Lambda^* in uniform nuclear matter to be 22 MeV
at the normal density.
