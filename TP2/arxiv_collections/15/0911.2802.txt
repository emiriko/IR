This paper is devoted to the random generation of particular colored
necklaces for which the number of beads of a given color is constrained (these
necklaces are called v-balanced). We propose an efficient sampler (its expected
time complexity is linear) which satisfies the Boltzmann model principle
introduced by Duchon, Flajolet, Louchard and Schaeffer. Our main motivation is
to show that the absence of a decomposable specification can be circumvented by
mixing the Boltzmann samplers with other types of samplers.
