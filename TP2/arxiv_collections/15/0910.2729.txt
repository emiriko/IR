We report on the experimental observation of vortex formation and production
of tangled vortex distribution in an atomic BEC of Rb-87 atoms submitted to an
external oscillatory perturbation. The oscillatory perturbations start by
exciting quadrupolar and scissors modes of the condensate. Then regular
vortices are observed finally evolving to a vortex tangle configuration. The
vortex tangle is a signature of the presence of a turbulent regime in the
cloud. We also show that this turbulent cloud has suppression of the aspect
ratio inversion typically observed in quantum degenerate bosonic gases during
free expansion.
