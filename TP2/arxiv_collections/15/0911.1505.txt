While graphene is a semi-metal, recently synthesized hydrogenated graphene
called graphane, turns out to be an insulator. We have probed the metal
insulator Transition in graphene-graphane system within the framework of
density functional theory. By analysing the evolutionary trends in the
electronic structure for fifteen different hydrogen concentrations on graphene,
we unravel some novel features of this transition. As hydrogen coverage
increases the semi-metal turns first into a metal, then transforms into an
insulator. The metallic phase is spatially inhomogeneous in the sense, it
contains the islands of insulating regions formed by hydrogenated carbon atoms
and the metallic channels formed by contagious naked carbon atoms.
