After a brief introduction to Probability Bracket Notation (PBN), indicator
operator and conditional density operator (CDO), we investigate probability
spaces associated with various quantum systems: system with one observable
(discrete or continuous), system with two commutative observables (independent
or dependent) and a system of indistinguishable non-interacting many-particles.
In each case, we derive unified expressions of conditional expectation (CE),
conditional probability (CP), and absolute probability (AP): they have the same
format for discrete or continuous spectrum; they are defined in both Hilbert
space (using Dirac notation) and probability space (using PBN); and they may be
useful to deal with CE of non-commutative observables.
