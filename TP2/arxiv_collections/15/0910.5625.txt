The decay of dark matter is predicted by many theoretical models and can
produce observable contributions to the cosmic-ray fluxes. I shortly discuss
the interpretation of the positron and electron excess as observed by PAMELA
and Fermi LAT in terms of decaying dark matter, and I point out the
implications for the Fermi LAT observations of the gamma-ray flux with emphasis
on its dipole-like anisotropy.
