We solve in random-phase approximation the anisotropic Heisenberg model,
including nearest and next-nearest neighbour interactions by calculating all
Green's functions and pair correlation functions in a cumulant decoupling
scheme. The general exposition is pedagogic in tone and is intended to be
accessible to any graduate student or physicist who is not an expert in the
field.
