We report on the first observation of a novel type of superconducting
proximity network using a superconductor-normal metal bilayer. Little-Parks
oscillation measurements show that the superconducting current flows through a
path enclosed by the edge rather than by the center of the Pb/Au wire in the
network. Furthermore, several peaks were observed in a power spectrum analysis.
We observed that the sequence of these peaks and that of the monolayer network
were connected by the power function, which is a factor of the line width,
S_{B_n} = \alpha^{n-2}S_{A_n}. This suggests that even in a proximity network
vortices are arranged in a way identical to a monolayer network.
