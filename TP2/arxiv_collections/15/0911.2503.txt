A test case, using a similar methodology and experimental set-up than
previous test case TC5-Level 1 is presented in this paper. An inductively
coupled plasma torch, working at atmospheric pressure, is used to create N2-CH4
Titan-like plasma (98%N2 - 2%CH4). The operating frequency and power are 64 MHz
and 3 kW respectively. This kind of apparatus allows obtaining plasma in
chemical and quasi-thermal equilibrium The spectral measurements cover the
[300-800] nm range and are performed inside the induction coil. Each
interesting spectrum is calibrated and compared to the line-by-line spectral
code SPARTAN used for the simulation of the radiative emission of entry-type
plasma. Finally, a discussion is proposed about the nucleation phenomenon which
is occurred in the ICP torch with the N2-CH4 plasma. Preliminary studies show
the synthesis of nanostructured carbon on the quartz tube.
