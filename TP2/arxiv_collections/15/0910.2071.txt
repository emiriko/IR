We examine decays of a spin-1 bottomonium into a pair of light scalar Dark
Matter (DM) particles, assuming that Dark Matter is produced due to exchange of
heavy degrees of freedom. We perform a model-independent analysis and derive
formulae for the branching ratios of these decays. We confront our calculation
results with the experimental data. We show that Dark Matter production in
Upsilon decays may lead to constraints on parameters of the models containing a
light spin-0 DM particle.
