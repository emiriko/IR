We present a comprehensive investigation of light meson physics using
maximally twisted mass fermions for two mass-degenerate quark flavours. By
employing four values of the lattice spacing, spatial lattice extents ranging
from 2.0 fm to 2.5 fm and pseudo scalar masses in the range 280 MeV to 650 MeV
we control the major systematic effects of our calculation. This enables us to
confront our data with chiral perturbation theory and extract low energy
constants of the effective chiral Lagrangian and derived quantities, such as
the light quark mass, with high precision.
