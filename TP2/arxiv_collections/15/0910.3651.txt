We discuss the prospect of extracting the values of the mixing parameters
$\delta$ and $\theta_{13}$ through the detection of cosmic neutrinos in the
planned and forthcoming neutrino telescopes. We take the ratio of the
muon-track to shower-like events, R, as the realistic quantity that can be
measured in the neutrino telescopes. We take into account several sources of
uncertainties that enter the analysis. We then examine to what extent the
deviation of the initial flavor composition from w_e:w_\mu:w_\tau=1:2:0 can be
tested.
