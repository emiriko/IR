We analyse the entanglement of the antisymmetric state in dimension d x d and
present two main results. First, we show that the amount of secrecy that can be
extracted from the state is low, more precisely, the distillable key is bounded
by O(1/d). Second, we show that the state is highly entangled in the sense that
a large number of ebits are needed in order to create the state: entanglement
cost is larger than a constant, independent of d. The second result is shown to
imply that the regularised relative entropy with respect to separable states is
also lower bounded by a constant. Finally, we note that the regularised
relative entropy of entanglement is asymptotically continuous in the state.
Elementary and advanced facts from the representation theory of the unitary
group, including the concept of plethysm, play a central role in the proofs of
the main results.
