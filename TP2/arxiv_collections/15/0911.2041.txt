Quantum transport properties through single polycyclic hydrocarbon molecules
attached to two metallic electrodes are studied by the use of Green's function
technique. A parametric approach based on the tight-binding model is introduced
to investigate the electronic transport through such molecular bridge systems.
The transport properties are discussed in the aspects of (a)
molecule-to-electrode coupling strength and (b) quantum interference effect.
