We associate to a filtration of a graded linear series of a big line bundle a
concave function on the Okounkov body whose law with respect to Lebesgue's
measure describes the asymptotic distribution of the jumps of the filtration.
As a consequence we obtain a Fujita-type approximation theorem in this general
filtered setting. We then specialize these results to filtrations by minima in
the usual context of Arakelov geometry, thereby obtaining in a simple way a
natural construction of an arithmetic Okounkov body, the existence of the
arithmetic volume as a limit and the arithmetic Fujita approximation theorem
for adelically normed graded linear series. We also obtain by a variant of this
construction a short proof of the existence of the sectional capacity.
