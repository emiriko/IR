Single semiconductor quantum dots have been widely studied within devices
that can apply an electric field. In the most common system, the low energy
offset between the InGaAs quantum dot and the surrounding GaAs material limits
the magnitude of field that can be applied to tens of kVcm^-1, before carriers
tunnel out of the dot. The Stark shift experienced by the emission line is
typically 1 meV. We report that by embedding the quantum dots in a quantum well
heterostructure the vertical field that can be applied is increased by over an
order of magnitude whilst preserving the narrow linewidths, high internal
quantum efficiencies and familiar emission spectra. Individual dots can then be
continuously tuned to the same energy allowing for two-photon interference
between remote, independent, quantum dots.
