It is shown that correlation function of the mean wind velocity generated by
a turbulent thermal convection (Rayleigh number $Ra \sim 10^{11}$) exhibits
exponential decay with a very long correlation time, while corresponding
largest Lyapunov exponent is certainly positive. These results together with
the reconstructed phase portrait indicate presence of chaotic component in the
examined mean wind. Telegraph approximation is also used to study relative
contribution of the chaotic and stochastic components to the mean wind
fluctuations and an equilibrium between these components has been studied in
detail.
