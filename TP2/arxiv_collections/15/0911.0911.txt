We study the effect of electron-electron interaction on transport through a
tunnel-coupled single-channel ring. We find that the conductance as a function
of magnetic flux shows a series of interaction-induced resonances that survive
thermal averaging. The period of the series is given by the interaction
strength $\alpha$. The physics behind this behavior is the blocking of the
tunneling current by the circular current. The main mechanism of dephasing is
due to circular-current fluctuations. The dephasing rate is proportional to the
tunneling rate and does not depend on $\alpha$.
