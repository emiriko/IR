We investigate the magnetic dipole coupling between a metallic surface and an
atom in a thermal state, ground state and excited hyperine state. This
interaction results in a repulsive correction and - unlike the electrical
dipole contribution - depends sensitively on the Ohmic dissipation in the
material.
