MiniBooNE reports the first absolute cross sections for neutral current
single \pi^0 production on CH_2 induced by neutrino and antineutrino
interactions measured from the largest sets of NC \pi^0 events collected to
date. The principal result consists of differential cross sections measured as
functions of \pi^0 momentum and \pi^0 angle averaged over the neutrino flux at
MiniBooNE. We find total cross sections of
(4.76+/-0.05_{stat}+/-0.76_{sys})*10^{-40} cm^2/nucleon at a mean energy of
<E_\nu>=808 MeV and (1.48+/-0.05_{stat}+/-0.23_{sys})*10^{-40} cm^2/nucleon at
a mean energy of <E_\nu>=664 MeV for \nu_\mu and \bar\nu_\mu induced
production, respectively. In addition, we have included measurements of the
neutrino and antineutrino total cross sections for incoherent exclusive NC
1\pi^0 production corrected for the effects of final state interactions to
compare to prior results.
