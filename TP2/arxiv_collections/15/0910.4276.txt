For any even $n$ qubits we establish four SLOCC equations and construct four
SLOCC polynomials (not complete) of degree $2^{n/2}$, which can be exploited
for SLOCC classification (not complete) of any even $n$ qubits. In light of the
SLOCC equations, we propose several different genuine entangled states of even
$n$ qubits and show that they are inequivalent to the $|GHZ>$, $|W>$, or
$|l,n>$ (the symmetric Dicke states with $l$ excitations) under SLOCC via the
vanishing or not of the polynomials. The absolute values of the polynomials can
be considered as entanglement measures.
