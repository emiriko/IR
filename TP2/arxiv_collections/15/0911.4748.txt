We explore theoretically the optomechanical interaction between a light field
and a mechanical mode of ultracold fermionic atoms inside a Fabry-P\'{e}rot
cavity. The low-lying phonon mode of the fermionic ensemble is a collective
density oscillation associated with particle-hole excitations, and is
mathematically analogous to the momentum side-mode excitations of a bosonic
condensate. The mechanical motion of the fermionic particle-hole system behaves
hence as a ``moving mirror.'' We derive an effective system Hamiltonian that
has the form of generic optomechanical systems. We also discuss the
experimental consequences the optomechanical coupling in optical bistability
and in the noise spectrum of the system.
