Differential and integral energy spectra of cosmic ray muons in the energy
range from several TeV to ~ 1 PeV obtained by means of the analysis of multiple
interactions of muons (pair meter technique) in the Baksan underground
scintillation telescope (BUST) are presented. The results are compared with
preceding BUST data on muon energy spectrum based on electromagnetic cascade
shower measurements and depth-intensity curve analysis, with calculations for
different muon spectrum models, and also with data of other experiments.
