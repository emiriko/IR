ANTARES is a submarine neutrino telescope deployed in the Mediterranean Sea,
at a depth of about 2500 m. It consists of a three-dimensional array of
photomultiplier tubes that can detect the Cherenkov light induced by charged
particles produced in the interactions of neutrinos with the surrounding
medium. Down-going muons produced in atmospheric showers are a physical
background to the neutrino detection, and are being studied. In this paper the
measurement of the Depth Intensity Relation (DIR) of atmospheric muon flux is
presented. The data collected in June and July 2007, when the ANTARES detector
was in its 5-line configuration, are used in the analysis. The corresponding
livetime is $724 h$. A deconvolution method based on a Bayesian approach was
developed, which takes into account detector and reconstruction inefficiencies.
Comparison with other experimental results and Monte Carlo expectations are
presented and discussed.
