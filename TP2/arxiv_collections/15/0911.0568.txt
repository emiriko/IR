Beyond the deep IR, the analysis of ghost and gluon propagators still keeps
very interesting non-perturbative information. The Taylor-scheme coupling can
be computed and applied to obtain the $\Lambda_{\rm QCD}$ parameter from Landau
gauge lattice simulations. Furthermore, a dimension-two gluon condensate, that
can be understood in the instanton liquid model, plays an important role in the
game.
