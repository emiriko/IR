The solid-liquid interface free energy \gamma sl is a key parameter
controlling nucleation and growth during solidification and other phenomena.
There are intrinsic difficulties in obtaining accurate experimental values, and
the previous approaches to compute \gamma sl with atomistic simulations are
computationally demanding. We propose a new approach, which is to obtain \gamma
sl from a free energy map of the phase transition reconstructed by
metadynamics. We apply this to the benchmark case of a Lennard-Jones potential
and the results confirm the most reliable data obtained previously. We
demonstrate several advantages of our new approach: it is simple to implement,
robust and free of hysteresis problems, it allows a rigorous and unbiased
estimate of the statistical uncertainty and it returns a good estimate of of
the thermodynamic limit with system sizes of a just a few hundred atoms. It is
therefore attractive for using with more realistic and specific models of
interatomic forces.
