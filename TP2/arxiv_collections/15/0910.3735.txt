This paper presents a detailed kinematic and chemical analysis of 16 members
of the Kapteyn moving group. The group does not appear to be chemically
homogenous. However, the kinematics and the chemical abundance patterns seen in
14 of the stars in this group are similar to those observed in the well-studied
cluster, Omega Centauri. Some members of this moving group may be remnants of
the tidal debris of Omega Cen, left in the Galactic disk during the merger
event which deposited Omega Cen into the Milky Way.
