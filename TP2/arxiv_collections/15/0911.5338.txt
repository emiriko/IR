We recall the many obstacles which seemed, long ago, to prevent supersymmetry
from possibly being a fundamental symmetry of Nature. We also present their
solutions, leading to the construction of the supersymmetric extensions of the
Standard Model. Finally we discuss briefly the early experimental searches for
Supersymmetry.
