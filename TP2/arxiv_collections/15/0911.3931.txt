We study dimensional properties of visible parts of fractal percolation in
the plane. Provided that the dimension of the fractal percolation is at least
1, we show that, conditioned on non-extinction, almost surely all visible parts
from lines are 1-dimensional. Furthermore, almost all of them have positive and
finite Hausdorff measure. We also verify analogous results for visible parts
from points. These results are motivated by an open problem on the dimensions
of visible parts.
