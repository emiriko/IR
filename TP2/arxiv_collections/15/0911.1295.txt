One of the earliest cryptographic applications of quantum information was to
create quantum digital cash that could not be counterfeited. In this paper, we
describe a new type of quantum money: quantum coins, where all coins of the
same denomination are represented by identical quantum states. We state
desirable security properties such as anonymity and unforgeability and propose
two candidate quantum coin schemes: one using black box operations, and another
using blind quantum computation.
