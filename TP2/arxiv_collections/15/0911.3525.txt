Using first principles density functional calculations, together with exact
diagonalization of Fe-Mo Hamiltonian constructed in a first principles Wannier
function basis, we studied the electronic structure of La doped double
perovskite compound Sr$_2$FeMoO$_6$. Our calculation show stabilization of
kinetic energy driven antiferromagnetic phase for La rich compounds, in
agreement with the results obtained on the basis of previous model
calculations.
