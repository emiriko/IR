In presence of matter the possibility of flavor oscillation of massless
neutrino is explored. A comparison between vacuum oscillation and the matter
induced oscillation of massless neutrinos is carried out to examine whether the
flavor transition is possible in the framework of standard model if there is
background matter. The Stodolsky type of equation describing the neutrino
oscillation phenomenon as the motion of a spherical pendulum in flavor space is
deduced. That pendular model is studied with zero vacuum oscillation frequency
implying the zero neutrino mass evolved in the framework of standard model, but
non-zero frequency arising due to the MSW effect. The implication of the
non-zero term present in the Stodolsky equation at zero vacuum frequency is
addressed properly.
