We propose a scheme for the deterministic coherent manipulation of two atomic
qutrits, trapped in separate cavities coupled through a short optical fibre or
optical resonator. We study such a system in the regime of dispersive
atom-field interactions, where the dynamics of atoms, cavities and fibre
operates through virtual population of both the atomic excited states and
photonic states in the cavities and fibre. We show that the resulting effective
dynamics allows for the creation of robust qutrit entanglement, and thoroughly
investigate the influence of imperfections and dissipation, due to atomic
spontaneous emission and photon leakage, on the entanglement of the two qutrits
state.
