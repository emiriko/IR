This paper develops a method for estimating parameters of a vector
autoregression (VAR) observed in white noise. The estimation method assumes the
noise variance matrix is known and does not require any iterative process. This
study provides consistent estimators and shows the asymptotic distribution of
the parameters required for conducting tests of Granger causality. Methods in
the existing statistical literature cannot be used for testing Granger
causality, since under the null hypothesis the model becomes unidentifiable.
Measurement error effects on parameter estimates were evaluated by using
computational simulations. The results show that the proposed approach produces
empirical false positive rates close to the adopted nominal level (even for
small samples) and has a good performance around the null hypothesis. The
applicability and usefulness of the proposed approach are illustrated using a
functional magnetic resonance imaging dataset.
