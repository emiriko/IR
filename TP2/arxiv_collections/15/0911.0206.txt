We calculate the radiative decay widths, two-photon ($\gamma\gamma$) and one
photon-one vector meson ($V\gamma$), of the dynamically generated resonances
from vector meson-vector meson interaction in a unitary approach based on the
hidden-gauge Lagrangians. In the present paper we consider the following
dynamically generated resonances: $f_0(1370)$, $f_0(1710)$, $f_2(1270)$,
$f_2'(1525)$, $K^*_2(1430)$, two strangeness=0 and isospin=1 states, and two
strangeness=1 and isospin=1/2 states. For the $f_0(1370)$ and $f_2(1270)$ we
reproduce the previous results for the two-photon decay widths and further
calculate their one photon-one vector decay widths. For the $f_0(1710)$ and
$f_2'(1525)$ the calculated two-photon decay widths are found to be consistent
with data. The $\rho^0\gamma$, $\omega\gamma$ and $\phi\gamma$ decay widths of
the $f_0(1370)$, $f_2(1270)$, $f_0(1710)$, $f'_2(1525)$ are compared with the
results predicted by other approaches. The $K^{*+}\gamma$ and $K^{*0}\gamma$
decay rates of the $K^*_2(1430)$ are also calculated and compared with the
results obtained in the framework of the covariant oscillator quark model. The
results for the two states with strangeness=0, isospin=1 and two states with
strangeness=1, isospin=1/2 are predictions that need to be tested by future
experiments.
