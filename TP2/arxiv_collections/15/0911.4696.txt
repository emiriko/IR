We use the wounded nucleon model to study the forward-backward multiplicity
fluctuations measured by the PHOBOS Collaboration in Au+Au collisions at
sqrt(s_NN)=200 GeV. The enhancement of forward-backward fluctuations in Au+Au
collisions with respect to the elementary p+p interactions is in this model
explained by the asymmetric shape of the pseudorapidity density of produced
particles from a single wounded nucleon and the fluctuations of the number of
wounded nucleons in the colliding nuclei. The wounded nucleon model describes
these experimental data better than the HIJING, AMPT or UrQMD models do.
