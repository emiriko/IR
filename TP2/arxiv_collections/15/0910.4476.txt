In a recent paper \cite{chak} Chakraborty et al have put forward a
perturbative formulation for solving the 2 dimensional homogeneous Helmholtz
equation with the Dirichlet condition on a supercircular boundary. In this note
a single parameter (supercircular exponent or exponent) semi-empirical formula,
giving the eigenspectrum, is presented for the same problem. The same formula
now is also applicable for the Neumann type boundary condition. The formula is
put to test by comparing the obtained eigenvalues for several low lying states
with their corresponding numerical estimates. It is seen that the formula gives
results with a remarkable accuracy for a wide range of the supercircular
exponent.
