We have analyzed, for the first time, the time cumulant of magnitudes of an
aftershock sequence since the mainshock. This comes out to be a remarkable
straight line whose slope is characteristic of the fault zone. This will
provide an useful tool in understanding the temporal distribution of
aftershocks after a specific mainshock.
