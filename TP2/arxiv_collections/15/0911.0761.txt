We report on lasing in rolled-up microtube resonators. Time-resolved studies
on these semiconductor lasers containing GaAs quantum wells as optical gain
material reveal particularly fast turn-on-times and short pulse emissions above
the threshold. We observe a strong red-shift of the laser mode during the pulse
emission which is compared to the time evolution of the charge-carrier density
calculated by rate equations.
