We have determined the non-perturbative O(a)-improvement coefficient c_sw for
four flavors of Wilson quarks with the plaquette gauge action in a range of
beta >= 5. The data are fitted with several Pade approximation formulae to get
an impression of the stability. A small extrapolation below beta=5 seems
acceptable.
