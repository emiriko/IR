The spectrum of two-dimensional (2D) plasma waves in graphene has been
recently studied in the Dirac fermion model. We take into account the whole
dispersion relation for graphene electrons in the tight binding approximation
and the local field effects in the electrodynamic response. Near the
wavevectors close to the corners of the hexagon-shaped Brillouin zone we found
new low-frequency 2D plasmon modes with a linear spectrum. These "inter-valley"
plasmon modes are related to the transitions between the two nearest Dirac
cones.
