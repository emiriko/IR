We introduce a novel technique designed to look for signatures of new physics
in vector boson fusion processes at the TeV scale. This functions by measuring
the polarization of the vector bosons to determine the relative longitudinal to
transverse production. In studying this ratio we can directly probe the high
energy E^2-growth of longitudinal vector boson scattering amplitudes
characteristic of models with non-Standard Model (SM) interactions. We will
focus on studying models parameterized by an effective Lagrangian that include
a light Higgs with non-SM couplings arising from TeV scale new physics
associated with the electroweak symmetry breaking, although our technique can
be used in more general scenarios. We will show that this technique is stable
against the large uncertainties that can result from variations in the
factorization scale, improving upon previous studies that measure cross section
alone.
