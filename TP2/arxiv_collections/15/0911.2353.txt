The recursive relation for the 1-point conformal block on a torus is derived
and used to prove the identities between conformal blocks recently conjectured
by R. Poghossian. As an illustration of the efficiency of the recurrence method
the modular invariance of the 1-point Liouville correlation function is
numerically analyzed.
