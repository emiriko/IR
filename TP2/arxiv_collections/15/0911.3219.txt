We present a brief review of recent attempts to construct effective theories
to describe the breaking of the electroweak symmetry in extensions of the
Standard Model with new strongly interacting dynamics around the TeV scale.
Particular attention is devoted to the analogies of Higgsless models with
Chiral Perturbation Theory (the low-energy limit of QCD).
