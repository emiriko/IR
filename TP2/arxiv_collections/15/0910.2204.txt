We have been able to resolve two long-standing issues that are central to the
theory of high Tc superconductivity: (1) How is the physics of the doped region
connected to that of the Mott insulator? (2) What is the origin of the
two-dimensionality of the normal state? Specifically, based on the t-J model,
we derive a renormalized Hamiltonian to describe the properties of underdoped
cuprates. The theory is constrained to agree with the behavior at half filling,
which is well described by the bosonic RVB state of Arovas and Auerbach. Moving
holes are assumed to destroy long-range magnetic order, which leads to a gap in
the spinon spectrum. The presence of the spin gap allows us to derive a
constrained Hamiltonian which describes sublattice-preserving hopping by
renormalized holons and holon pairs, accompanied by spinon singlet backflows.
Below the singlet condensation, i.e, the psudogap (as distinct from the spin
gap), temperature T*, holons form a spinless Fermi liquid without an observable
small Fermi surface. Above T* holons are localized, giving rise to a (gauge)
insulator, which we identify with the strange metal phase. Holon pair hopping
leads to a robust d-wave superconductor, its symmetry determined primarily by
the symmetry of the RVB state at half filling. The predictions of the theory
are shown to be consistent with the results of nmr, tunneling and transport
experiments. Remarkably, the existence of the spin gap provides a natural
explanation for the two-dimensionality of the normal state. The marked
asymmetry between hole-doped and electron-doped cuprates is also easily
explained.
