We give a new proof of the representation of implied volatility as a
time-average of weighted expectations of local or stochastic volatility. With
this proof we clarify the question of existence of 'forward implied variance'
in the original derivation of Gatheral, who introduced this representation in
his book 'The Volatility Surface'.
