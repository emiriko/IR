I present recent work on gravitational waves (GWs) from a generic Standard
Model-like effective potential for the electroweak phase transition. We derive
a semi-analytic expression for the approximate tunneling temperature, and
analytic and approximate expressions for the two GW parameters $\alpha$ and
$\beta$. A quick summary of our analysis and general results, as well as a list
of some specific models which easily fit into this framework, are presented.
The work presented here has been done in collaboration with Stefano Profumo
(arXiv:0911.0687).
