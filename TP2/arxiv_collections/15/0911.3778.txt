Gas and star velocity dispersions have been derived for eight circumnuclear
star-forming regions (CNSFRs) and the nucleus of the spiral galaxy NGC3310
using high resolution spectroscopy in the blue and far red. Stellar velocity
dispersions have been obtained from the CaII triplet in the near-IR, using
cross-correlation techniques, while gas velocity dispersions have been measured
by Gaussian fits to the Hb 4861A and [OIII]5007A emission lines.
  The CNSFRs stellar velocity dispersions range from 31 to 73 km/s. These
values, together with the sizes measured on archival HST images, yield upper
limits to the dynamical masses for the individual star clusters between 1.8 and
7.1 x 10$^6$ M$_\odot$, for the whole CNSFR between 2 x 10$^7$ and 1.4 x 10$^8$
M$_\odot$, and 5.3 x 10$^7$ M$_\odot$ for the nucleus inside the inner 14.2 pc.
The masses of the ionizing stellar population responsible for the HII region
gaseous emission have been derived from their published Ha luminosities and are
found to be between 8.7 x 10$^5$ and 2.1 x 10$^6$ M$_\odot$ for the
star-forming regions, and 2.1 x 10$^5$ M$_\odot$ for the galaxy nucleus; they
therefore constitute between 1 and 7 per cent of the total dynamical mass.
  The ionized gas kinematics is complex; two different kinematical components
seem to be present as evidenced by different line widths and Doppler shifts.
