We construct a fully self-consistent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov theory that
describes a spinless Fermi gas with long-range interaction. We apply this
theory to a system of uniform dipolar fermionic polar molecules, which has
attracted much attention recently, due to rapid experimental progress in
achieving such systems. By calculating the anisotropic superfluid order
parameter, and the critical temperature $T_{c}$, we show that, "hign $T_c$"
superfluid can be achieved with a quite modest value of interaction strength
for polar molecules. In addition, we also show that the presence of the Fock
exchange interaction enhances superfluid pairing.
