The production of jets is studied in deep-inelastic e+p scattering at low
negative four momentum transfer squared 5<Q^2<100 GeV^2 and at inelasticity
0.2<y<0.7 using data recorded by the H1 detector at HERA in the years 1999 and
2000, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 43.5 pb^-1. Inclusive jet,
2-jet and 3-jet cross sections as well as the ratio of 3-jet to 2-jet cross
sections are measured as a function of Q^2 and jet transverse momentum. The
2-jet cross section is also measured as a function of the proton momentum
fraction xi. The measurements are well described by perturbative quantum
chromodynamics at next-to-leading order corrected for hadronisation effects and
are subsequently used to extract the strong coupling alpha_s.
