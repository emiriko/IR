We propose that there is no analogue of the Breitenlohner-Freedman stability
bound on the mass of a scalar field in the context of the nonrelativistic
AdS/CFT correspondence. Our treatment is based on an equivalence between the
field equation of a complex scalar in the AdS/CFT correspondence and the
one-dimensional Schroedinger equation with an inverse square potential. We
compute the two-point boundary correlation function for m^2<m_{BF}^2 and
discuss its relation to renormalization group limit cycles and the Efimov
effect in quantum mechanics. The equivalence also helps to elucidate
holographic renormalization group flows and calculations in the global
coordinates for Schroedinger spacetime.
