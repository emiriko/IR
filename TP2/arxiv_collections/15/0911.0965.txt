The model of an open Fermi-system is used for studying the interplay of
intrinsic chaos and irreversible decay into open continuum channels. Two
versions of the model are characterized by one-body chaos coming from disorder
or by many-body chaos due to the inter-particle interactions. The continuum
coupling is described by the effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. Our main
interest is in specific correlations of cross sections for various channels in
dependence on the coupling strength and degree of internal chaos. The results
are generic and refer to common features of various mesoscopic objects
including conductance fluctuations and resonance nuclear reactions.
