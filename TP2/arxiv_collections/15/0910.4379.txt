The production of two b-quark pairs is a prominent background for Higgs and
New Physics searches in various extensions of the Standard Model. We present
here the next-to-leading order QCD corrections to the quark induced subprocess
using the GOLEM approach for the virtual corrections. We show that our result
considerably improves the prediction and conclude that the inclusion of
next-to-leading order effects is indispensable for reliable studies of four
b-quark observables in hadronic collisions.
