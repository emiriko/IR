The channeling of the recoiling nucleus in crystalline detectors after a WIMP
collision would produce a larger scintillation or ionization signal in direct
detection experiments than otherwise expected. I present estimates of the
importance of this effect for the total direct detection rate and the daily
modulation of the signal using analytic models produced in the 1960's and 70's
to describe the effects of channeling and blocking in crystals.
