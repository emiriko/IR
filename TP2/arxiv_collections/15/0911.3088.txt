We explore the effect of random permanent cross-links on a system of directed
polymers confined between two planes with their end-points free to slide on
them. We treat the cross-links as quenched disorder and we use a
semimicroscopic replica field theory to study the structure and elasticity of
this system. Upon increasing the cross-link density, we get a continuous
gelation transition signaled by the emergence of a finite in-plane localization
length. The distribution of localization length turns out to depend on the
height along the preferred direction of the directed polymers. The gelation
transition also gives rise to a finite in-plane shear modulus which we
calculate and turns out to be universal, i.e., independent of the energy and
length scales of the polymers and the cross-links. Using a symmetry argument,
we show that cross-links of negligible extent along the preferred axis of the
directed polymers do not cause any renormalization to the tilt modulus of the
uncross-linked system.
