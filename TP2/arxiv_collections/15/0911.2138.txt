We apply chiral quark model with momentum dependent quark mass to two kinds
of non-perturbative objects. These are: photon Distribution Amplitudes which we
calculate up to twist-4 in tensor, vector and axial channels and pion-photon
Transition Distribution Amplitudes together with related form factors. Where
possible we compare our results with experimental data.
