We consider an exactly solvable model for production of fermions in the
Friedman flat universe with a scale factor linearly growing with time. Exact
solution expressed through the special functions admit an analytical
calculation of the number density of created particles. We also discuss in
general the role of the phenomenon of the cosmological particle production in
the history of universe.
