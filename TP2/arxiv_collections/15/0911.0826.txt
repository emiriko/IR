At very low temperature, a quasi-one-dimensional ensemble of atoms with
attractive interactions tend to form a bright soliton. When exposed to a
sufficiently weak external potential, the shape of the soliton is not modified,
but its external motion is affected. We develop in detail the Bogoliubov
approach for the problem, treating, in a non-perturbative way, the motion of
the center of mass of the soliton. Quantization of this motion allows us to
discuss its long time properties. In particular, in the presence of a
disordered potential, the quantum motion of the center of mass of a bright
soliton may exhibit Anderson localization, on a localization length which may
be much larger than the soliton size and could be observed experimentally.
