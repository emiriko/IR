In this paper, we consider Bianchi type III and Kantowski-Sachs spacetimes
and discuss the behavior of time-varying constants $G$ and $\Lambda$ by using
two symmetric techniques, namely, kinematic self-similarity and matter
collineation. In the kinematic self-similarity technique, we investigate the
behavior of the first and the second kinds. In the matter collineation
technique, we consider usual, modified, and completely modified matter
collineation equations while studying the behavior of these constants. Further,
we reduce the results for dust, radiation, and stiff fluids. We find that
$\Lambda$ is a decreasing time function while $G$ is an increasing time
function. This corresponds to the earlier results available in the literature
for other spacetimes. Further, we find that the deceleration parameter attains
a negative value, which shows that the expansion of the universe is
accelerating.
