We present a detailed study of the quantum dissipative dynamics of a charged
particle in a magnetic field. Our focus of attention is the effect of
dissipation on the low- and high-temperature behavior of the specific heat at
constant volume. After providing a brief overview of two distinct approaches to
the statistical mechanics of dissipative quantum systems, viz., the ensemble
approach of Gibbs and the quantum Brownian motion approach due to Einstein, we
present exact analyses of the specific heat. While the low-temperature
expressions for the specific heat, based on the two approaches, are in
conformity with power-law temperature-dependence, predicted by the third law of
thermodynamics, and the high-temperature expressions are in agreement with the
classical equipartition theorem, there are surprising differences between the
dependencies of the specific heat on different parameters in the theory, when
calculations are done from these two distinct methods. In particular, we find
puzzling influences of boundary-confinement and the bath-induced spectral
cutoff frequency. Further, when it comes to the issue of approach to
equilibrium, based on the Einstein method, the way the asymptotic limit (time
going to infinity) is taken, seems to assume significance.
