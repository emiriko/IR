Starting from the Pauli Hamiltonian operator, we derive a scalar quantum
kinetic equations for spin-1/2 systems. Here the regular Wigner two-state
matrix is replaced by a scalar distribution function in extended phase space.
Apart from being a formulation of principal interest, such scalar quantum
kinetic equation makes the comparison to classical kinetic theory
straightforward, and lends itself naturally to currently available numerical
Vlasov and Boltzmann schemes. Moreover, while the quasi-distribution is a
Wigner function in regular phase space, it is given by a Q-function in spin
space. As such, nonlinear and dynamical quantum plasma problems are readily
handled. Moreover, the issue of gauge invariance is treated. Applications (e.g.
ultra-dense laser compressed targets and their diagnostics), possible
extensions, and future improvements of the presented quantum statistical model
are discussed.
