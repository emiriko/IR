We prove the local Gross-Prasad conjecture for tempered representations of
special orthogonal groups. Roughly speaking, the conjecture says that, if sigma
is an irreducible representation of SO(n) and rho is an irreducible
representation of SO(n-1), rho appears as quotient of the restriction of sigma
to SO(n-1) with a multiplicity m(sigma,rho) that can be computed in terms of
epsilon-factors. Our proof uses results of a previous papers which computes
m(sigma,rho) and the epsilon-factors by integral formulas.
