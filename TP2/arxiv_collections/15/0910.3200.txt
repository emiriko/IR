Quantum cosmology offers a unique stage to address questions of time related
to its underlying (and perhaps truly quantum dynamical) meaning as well as its
origin. Some of these issues can be analyzed with a general scheme of quantum
cosmology, others are best seen in loop quantum cosmology. The latter's status
is still incomplete, and so no full scenario has yet emerged. Nevertheless,
using properties that have a potential of pervading more complicated and
realistic models, a vague picture shall be sketched here. It suggests the
possibility of deriving a beginning within a beginningless theory, by applying
cosmic forgetfulness to an early history of the universe.
