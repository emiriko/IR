We suggest that a weak isotriplet composite scalar possessing an unbroken
U(1) global symmetry naturally arises in technicolor models leading to an
interesting type of dark matter candidate: the iTIMP. We propose explicit
models of the iTIMP, study earth based constraints and suggest possible
collider signals.
