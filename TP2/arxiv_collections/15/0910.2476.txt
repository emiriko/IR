The electronic distribution functions of two Coulomb coupled chiral edge
states forming a quasi-1D system with broken translation invariance are found
using the equation of motion approach. We find that relaxation and thereby
energy exchange between the two edge states is determined by the shot noise of
the edge states generated at a quantum point contact (QPC). In close vicinity
to the QPC, we derive analytic expressions for the distribution functions. We
further give an iterative procedure with which we can compute numerically the
distribution functions arbitrarily far away from the QPC. Our results are
compared with recent experiments of Le Sueur et al..
