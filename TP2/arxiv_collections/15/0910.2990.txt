We present new near-IR H2, CO J=2-1, and CO J = 3-2 observations to study
outflows in the massive star forming region IRAS 05358+3543. The
Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope H2 images and James Clerk Maxwell Telescope CO
data cubes of the IRAS 05358 region reveal several new outflows, most of which
emerge from the dense cluster of sub-mm cores associated with the Sh 2-233IR NE
cluster to the northeast of IRAS 05358. We used Apache Point Observatory (APO)
JHK spectra to determine line of sight velocities of the outflowing material.
Analysis of archival VLA cm continuum data and previously published VLBI
observations reveal a massive star binary as a probable source of one or two of
the outflows. We have identified probable sources for 6 outflows and candidate
counterflows for 7 out of a total of 11 seen to be originating from the IRAS
05358 clusters. We classify the clumps within Sh 2-233IR NE as an early
protocluster and Sh 2-233IR SW as a young cluster, and conclude that the
outflow energy injection rate approximately matches the turbulent decay rate in
Sh 2-233IR NE.
