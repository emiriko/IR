The use of inelastic x-ray scattering (IXS) to investigate phonons and phonon
dispersion in crystals opens the field of phonon spectroscopy, allowing
measurements on tiny samples: micrograms of material, or single crystals ~10 to
100 micron diameter are sufficient. Here we review the technique as it is
practiced at BL35XU of SPring-8, in Hyogo prefecture. An introduction is
provided that is aimed at potential IXS users, highlighting the unique and
advantageous aspects of the technique. Present work, including several example
experiments, and future directions are discussed.
