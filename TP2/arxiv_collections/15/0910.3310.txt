We present a search for supersymmetry (SUSY) in the fully hadronic final
state with the CMS detector at the LHC.
  This final state contains at least two jets and a significant transverse
energy imbalance due to neutralinos escaping detection. The background to
all-hadronic signature arise from QCD multijet production, ttbar and
electroweak boson+jet production. These background can be estimated by
utilizing a data-driven approach using events thus enabling a possible
discovery of SUSY in the early physics data. In addition to the generic search,
we also present an analysis which utilizes a new quantity, alpha_T, constructed
exclusively from the transverse energies of the jets to effectively eliminate
the QCD background.
