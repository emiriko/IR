In this note we discuss the vacuum alignment in supersymmetric models with
spontaneously broken flavour symmetries in the presence of soft supersymmetry
(SUSY) breaking terms. We show that the inclusion of soft SUSY breaking terms
can give rise to non-vanishing vacuum expectation values (VEVs) for the
auxiliary components of the flavon fields. These non-zero VEVs can have an
important impact on the phenomenology of this class of models, since they can
induce an additional flavour violating contribution to the sfermion soft mass
matrix of right-left (RL) type. We carry out an explicit computation in a class
of SUSY A4 models predicting tri-bimaximal mixing in the lepton sector. The
flavour symmetry breaking sector is described in terms of flavon and driving
supermultiplets. We find non-vanishing VEVs for the auxiliary components of the
flavon fields and for the scalar components of the driving fields which are of
order m_{SUSY} x <phi> and m_{SUSY}, respectively. Thereby, m_{SUSY} is the
generic soft SUSY breaking scale which is expected to be around 1 TeV and <phi>
is the VEV of scalar components of the flavon fields. Another effect of these
VEVs can be the generation of a mu term.
