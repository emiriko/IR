In this series of papers we shall carry out a reconsideration of the
thermodynamical behavior of the called HMF model, a paradigmatic ferromagnetic
toy model exhibiting many features of the real long-range interacting systems.
This first work is devoted to perform the microcanonical description of this
model system: the calculation of microcanonical entropy and some fundamental
thermodynamic observables, the distribution and correlation functions, as well
as the analysis of the thermodynamical stability and the relevant thermodynamic
limit.
