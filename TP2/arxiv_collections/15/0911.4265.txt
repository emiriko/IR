We prove a systolic inequality for the phi-relative 1-systole of a
phi-essential 2-complex, where phi is a homomorphism from the fundamental group
of the complex, to a finitely presented group G. Indeed we show that
universally for any phi-essential Riemannian 2-complex, and any G, the area of
X is bounded below by 1/8 of sys(X,phi)^2. Combining our results with a method
of Larry Guth, we obtain new quantitative results for certain 3-manifolds: in
particular for Sigma the Poincare homology sphere, we have sys(Sigma)^3 < 24
vol(Sigma).
