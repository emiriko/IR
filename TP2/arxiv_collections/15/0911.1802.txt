Let k be a complete discrete valuation field of equal characteristic p>0.
Using the tools of p-adic differential modules, we define refined Artin and
Swan conductors for a representation of the absolute Galois group $G_k$ with
finite local monodromy; this leads to a description of the subquotients of the
ramification filtration on $G_k$. We prove that our definition of the refined
Swan conductors coincide with that is given by Saito, which uses etale
cohomology. We also study its relation with the toroidal variation of the Swan
conductors.
