We observed with the VLA, PdBI, and SMA the centimeter and millimeter
continuum, N2H+(1-0), and CO(2-1) emission associated with a dusty cloud
harboring a nascent cluster with intermediate-mass protostars. At centimeter
wavelengths we found a strong source, tracing a UCHII region, at the eastern
edge of the dusty cloud, with a shell-like structure, and with the
near-infrared counterpart falling in the center of the shell. This is
presumably the most massive source of the forming cluster. About 15'' to the
west of the UCHII region and well embedded in the dusty cloud, we detected a
strong millimeter source, MM1, associated with centimeter and near-infrared
emission. MM1 seems to be driving a prominent high-velocity CO bipolar outflow,
and is embedded in a ridge of dense gas traced by N2H+. We estimated that MM1
is an intermediate-mass source in the Class 0/I phase. About 15'' to the south
of MM1, and still more deeply embedded in the dusty cloud, we detected a
compact millimeter source, MM2, with neither centimeter nor near-infrared
emission, but with water maser emission. MM2 is associated with a clump of
N2H+, whose kinematics reveal a clear velocity gradient and additionally we
found signposts of infall motions. MM2, being deeply embedded within the dusty
cloud, with an associated water maser but no hints of CO outflow emission, is
an intriguing object, presumably of intermediate mass. In conclusion, the UCHII
region is found at the border of a dusty cloud which is currently undergoing
active star formation. Two intermediate-mass protostars in the dusty cloud seem
to have formed after the UCHII region and have different properties related to
the outflow phenomenon.
