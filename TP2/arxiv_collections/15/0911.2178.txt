We re-analyze the published data on the Y(4630) --> Lambda_c Lambdabar_c and
the Y(4660) --> psi(2S) pi pi with a consistent Ansatz and we find that the two
observations are likely to be due to the same state Y_B with M_{Y_B} = 4660.7
+- 8.7 MeV and Gamma_{Y_B} = 61 +- 23 MeV. Under this hypothesis and
reanalizing also the e+e- --> J/psi pi pi gamma_ISR spectrum we extract B(Y_B
--> Lambda_c Lambdabar_c) / B(Y_B --> psi(2S) pi pi) = 25 +- 7, B(Y_B --> J/psi
pi pi) / B(Y_B --> psi(2S) pi pi) < 0.46 @ 90% C.L., B(Y(4350) --> J/psi pi pi)
/ B(Y(4350) --> psi(2S) pi pi) < 3.4 x 10^-3 @ 90% C.L. and B(Y_B --> psi(2S)
sigma) / B (Y_B --> psi(2S) f_0)=2.0 +- 0.3. These conclusions strongly support
the hypothesis of Y_B being the first observation of a charmed baryonium
constituted by four quarks. From the analysis of the mass spectrum and the
decay properties we show that Y(4350) and Y_B are respectively consistent with
the ground state and first radial excitation of the L=1 state.
