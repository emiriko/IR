Graphane is a two-dimensional system consisting of a single layer of fully
saturated (sp$^3$ hybridization) carbon atoms. In an ideal graphane structure
C-H bonds exhibit an alternating pattern (up and down with relation to the
plane defined by the carbon atoms). In this work we have investigated using
\textit{ab initio} and reactive molecular dynamics simulations the role of H
frustration (breaking the H atoms up and down alternating pattern) in
graphane-like structures. Our results show that significant percentage of
uncorrelated H frustrated domains are formed in the early stages of the
hydrogenation process leading to membrane shrinkage and extensive membrane
corrugations. These results also suggest that large domains of perfect
graphane-like structures are unlikely to be formed, H frustrated domains are
always present.
