In this review, I present our current state of knowledge regarding both
Classical Nova and Recurrent Nova systems. Two particular objects (V1974 Cyg
and RS Oph) are chosen to illustrate the range of phenomena that may be
associated with their outbursts. The wider importance of nova research is
emphasised and some of the most pressing unsolved problems are summarised.
