A systematic study of low energy nuclear structure at normal deformation is
carried out using the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov theory extended by the Generator
Coordinate Method and mapped onto a 5-dimensional collective quadrupole
Hamiltonian. Results obtained with the Gogny D1S interaction are presented from
dripline to dripline for even-even nuclei with proton numbers Z=10 to Z=110 and
neutron numbers N less than 200. The properties calculated for the ground
states are their charge radii, 2-particle separation energies, correlation
energies, and the intrinsic quadrupole shape parameters. For the excited
spectroscopy, the observables calculated are the excitation energies and
quadrupole as well as monopole transition matrix elements. We examine in this
work the yrast levels up to J=6, the lowest excited 0^+ states, and the two
next yrare 2^+ states. The theory is applicable to more than 90% of the nuclei
which have tabulated measurements. The data set of the calculated properties of
1712 even-even nuclei, including spectroscopic properties for 1693 of them, are
provided in CEA website and EPAPS repository with this article \cite{epaps}.
