We study the ratio between the fermion-fermion scattering length and the
dimer-dimer scattering length for systems of nonrelativistic fermions, using
the same functional renormalisation technique as previously applied to
fermionic matter. We find a strong dependence on the cutoff function used in
the renormalisation flow for a two-body truncation of the action. Adding a
simple three-body term substantially reduces this dependence.
