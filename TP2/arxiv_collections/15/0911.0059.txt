The framework of a warped extra dimension with the Standard Model (SM) fields
propagating in it is a very well-motivated extension of the SM since it can
address both the Planck-weak and flavor hierarchy problems of the SM. Within
this framework, solution to the little hierarchy problem motivates extending
the SM electroweak (EW) 5D gauge symmetry in such a way that its breakdown to
the SM delivers the SM Higgs boson. We study signals at the large hadron
collider (LHC) for the extra EW (called coset) gauge bosons, a fundamental
ingredient of this framework. The coset gauge bosons, due to their unique EW
gauge quantum numbers [doublets of SU(2)_L], do not couple at leading order to
two SM particles. We find that, using the associated production of the charged
coset gauge bosons via their coupling to SM bottom quark and a (light) KK top
quark, the LHC can have a 3\sigma reach of \sim 2 (2.6) TeV for the coset gauge
boson masses with \sim 100 (1000) fb^{-1} luminosity. Since current theoretical
framework(s) suggest an {\em indirect} lower limit on coset gauge boson masses
of >3 TeV, luminosity or energy upgrade of LHC is likely to be crucial in
observing these states.
