We calculate radiative lifetimes of collective electronic excitations of
atoms in an infinite one dimensional lattice. The translational symmetry along
the lattice restricts the photon wave vector component parallel to the lattice
to the exciton wave number and thus the possible emission directions. The
resulting radiation damping rate and emission pattern of the exciton strongly
deviates from independent atom. For some wave numbers and polarizations the
excitons superradiantly decay very fast, while other excitons show zero
radiation damping rate and form propagating meta-stable excitations. Such
states could be directly coupled via tailored evanescent fields from a nearby
fiber.
