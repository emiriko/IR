We compute the branching ratios for mu-> e gamma, tau-> mu gamma and tau -> e
gamma in a supersymmetric model invariant under the flavour symmetry group A4 X
Z3 X U(1)_{FN}, in which near tri-bimaximal lepton mixing is naturally
predicted. At leading order in the small symmetry breaking parameter u, which
is of the same order as the reactor mixing angle theta_{13}, we find that the
branching ratios generically scale as u^2. Applying the current bound on the
branching ratio of mu -> e gamma shows that small values of u or tan(beta) are
preferred in the model for mass parameters m_{SUSY} and m_{1/2} smaller than
1000 GeV. The bound expected from the on-going MEG experiment will provide a
severe constraint on the parameter space of the model either enforcing u approx
0.01 and small tan(beta) or m_{SUSY} and m_{1/2} above 1000 GeV. In the special
case of universal soft supersymmetry breaking terms in the flavon sector a
cancellation takes place in the amplitudes and the branching ratios scale as
u^4, allowing for smaller slepton masses. The branching ratios for tau -> mu
gamma and tau -> e gamma are predicted to be of the same order as the one for
mu -> e gamma, which precludes the possibility of observing these tau decays in
the near future.
