We examine the role of magnetic dipoles in single and coupled pairs of
metallic split-ring resonators by numerically computing their magnitude and
examining their relative contributions to the scattering cross section. We
demonstrate that magnetic dipoles can strongly influence the scattering cross
section along particular directions. It is also found that the magnetic dipole
parallel to the incident magnetic field and/or high-order multipoles may play a
significant role in the linear response of coupled split-ring resonators.
