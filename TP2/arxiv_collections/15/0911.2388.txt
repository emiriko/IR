Third political parties are influential in shaping American politics. In this
work we study the spread of a third party ideology in a voting population where
we assume that party members/activists are more influential in recruiting new
third party voters than non-member third party voters. The study uses an
epidemiological metaphor to develop a theoretical model with nonlinear ordinary
differential equations as applied to a case study, the Green Party. Considering
long-term behavior, we identify three threshold parameters in our model that
describe the different possible scenarios for the political party and its
spread. We also apply the model to the study of the Green Party's growth using
voting and registration data in six states and the District of Columbia to
identify and explain trends over the past decade. Our system produces a
backward bifurcation that helps identify conditions under which a sufficiently
dedicated activist core can enable a third party to thrive, under conditions
which would not normally allow it to arise. Our results explain the critical
role activists play in sustaining grassroots movements under adverse
conditions.
