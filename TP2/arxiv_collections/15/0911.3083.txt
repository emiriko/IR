The validity of various bootstrapping methods has been proved for the sample
mean of strongly mixing data. But in many applications, there appear nonlinear
statistics of processes that are not strongly mixing. We investigate the
nonoverlapping block bootstrap sequences which are near epoch dependent on
strong mixing or absolutely regular processes. This includes ARMA and
GARCH-processes as well as data from chaotic dynamical systems. We establish
the strong consistency of the bootstrap distribution estimator not only for the
sample mean, but also for U-statistics, which include examples as Gini's mean
difference or the chi^2-test statistic.
