We show that for families of measures on Euclidean space which satisfy an
ergodic-theoretic form of "self-similarity" under the operation of re-scaling,
the dimension of linear images of the measure behaves in a semi-continuous way.
We apply this to prove the following conjecture of Furstenberg: Let m,n be
integers which are not powers of the same integer, and let X,Y be closed
subsets of the unit interval which are invariant, respectively, under times-m
mod 1 and times-n mod 1. Then, for any non-zero t:
dim(X+tY)=min{1,dim(X)+dim(Y)}. A similar result holds for invariant measures,
and gives a simple proof of the Rudolph-Johnson theorem. Our methods also apply
to many other classes of conformal fractals and measures. As another
application, we extend and unify Results of Peres, Shmerkin and Nazarov, and of
Moreira, concerning projections of products self-similar measures and Gibbs
measures on regular Cantor sets. We show that under natural irreducibility
assumptions on the maps in the IFS, the image measure has the maximal possible
dimension under any linear projection other than the coordinate projections. We
also present applications to Bernoulli convolutions and to the images of
fractal measures under differentiable maps.
