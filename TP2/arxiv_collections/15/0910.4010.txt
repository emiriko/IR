We report on the observation of inertial-ballistic transport in nanoscale
cross junctions fabricated from epitaxial graphene grown on SiC(0001).
Ballistic transport is indicated by a negative bend resistance of R12,43 ~ 170
ohm which is measured in a non-local, four-terminal configuration at 4.2 K and
which vanishes as the temperature is increased above 80 K.
