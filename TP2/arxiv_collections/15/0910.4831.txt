In a strongly pumped non-degenerate traveling-wave OPA, we produce two-color
squeezed vacuum with up to millions of photons per pulse. Our approach to
registering this macroscopic quantum state is direct detection of a large
number of transverse and longitudinal modes, which is achieved by making the
detection time and area much larger than the coherence time and area,
respectively. Using this approach, we obtain a record value of twin-beam
squeezing for direct detection of bright squeezed vacuum. This makes direct
detection of macroscopic squeezed vacuum a practical tool for quantum
information applications.
