According to several authors, gravity might be a long-wavelength phenomenon
emerging in some 'hydrodynamic limit' from the same physical, flat-space vacuum
viewed as a form of superfluid medium. In this framework, light might propagate
in an effective acoustic geometry and exhibit a tiny anisotropy that could be
measurable in the present ether-drift experiments. By accepting this view of
the vacuum, one should also consider the possibility of sizeable random
fluctuations of the signal that reflect the stochastic nature of the underlying
`quantum ether' and could be erroneously interpreted as instrumental noise. To
test the present interpretation, we have extracted the mean amplitude of the
signal from various experiments with different systematics, operating both at
room temperature and in the cryogenic regime. They all give the same consistent
value < A > = O (10^{-15}) which is precisely the magnitude expected in an
emergent-gravity approach, for an apparatus placed on the Earth's surface.
Since physical implications could be substantial, it would be important to
obtain more direct checks from the instantaneous raw data and, possibly, with
new experimental set-ups operating in gravity-free environments.
