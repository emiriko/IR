We introduce a coarse-grained rigid nucleotide model of DNA that reproduces
the basic thermodynamics of short strands: duplex hybridization,
single-stranded stacking and hairpin formation, and also captures the essential
structural properties of DNA: the helical pitch, persistence length and
torsional stiffness of double-stranded molecules, as well as the comparative
flexibility of unstacked single strands. We apply the model to calculate the
detailed free-energy landscape of one full cycle of DNA 'tweezers', a simple
machine driven by hybridization and strand displacement.
