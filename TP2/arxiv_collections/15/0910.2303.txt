We provide a dual gravity description of a supersymmetric heavy nucleus,
following the idea of our previous paper arXiv:0809.3141. The supersymmetric
nucleus consists of a merginal bound state of $A$ baryons distributed over a
ball in 3 dimensions. In the gauge/string duality, the baryon in N=4 super
Yang-Mills (SYM) theory corresponds to a D5-brane wrapping S^5 of the AdS_5 x
S^5 spacetime, so the nucleus corresponds to a collection of $A$ D5-branes. We
take a large $A$ and a near horizon limits of a back-reacted geometry generated
by the wrapped $A$ D5-branes, where we find a gap in the supergravity
fluctuation spectrum. This spectrum is a gravity dual of giant resonances of
heavy nuclei, in the supersymmetric toy example of QCD.
