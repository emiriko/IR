(Abridged.) The accretion-induced collapse (AIC) of a white dwarf (WD) may
lead to the formation of a protoneutron star and a collapse-driven supernova
explosion. This process represents a path alternative to thermonuclear
disruption of accreting white dwarfs in Type Ia supernovae. Neutrino and
gravitational-wave (GW) observations may provide crucial information necessary
to reveal a potential AIC. Motivated by the need for systematic predictions of
the GW signature of AIC, we present results from an extensive set of
general-relativistic AIC simulations using a microphysical finite-temperature
equation of state and an approximate treatment of deleptonization during
collapse. Investigating a set of 114 progenitor models in rotational
equilibrium, with a wide range of rotational configurations, temperatures and
central densities, we extend previous Newtonian studies and find that the GW
signal has a generic shape akin to what is known as a "Type III" signal in the
literature. We discuss the detectability of the emitted GWs, showing that the
signal-to-noise ratio for current or next-generation interferometer detectors
could be high enough to detect such events in our Galaxy. Some of our AIC
models form massive quasi-Keplerian accretion disks after bounce. In rapidly
differentially rotating models, the disk mass can be as large as ~0.8-Msun.
Slowly and/or uniformly rotating models produce much smaller disks. Finally, we
find that the postbounce cores of rapidly spinning white dwarfs can reach
sufficiently rapid rotation to develop a nonaxisymmetric rotational
instability.
