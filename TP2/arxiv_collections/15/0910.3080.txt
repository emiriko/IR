An explicit Bargmann symmetry constraint is computed and its associated
binary nonlinearization of Lax pairs is carried out for the super Dirac
systems. Under the obtained symmetry constraint, the n-th flow of the super
Dirac hierarchy is decomposed into two super finite-dimensional integrable
Hamiltonian systems, defined over the supersymmetry manifold $R^{4N|2N}$ with
the corresponding dynamical variables $x$ and $t_n$. The integrals of motion
required for Liouville integrability are explicitly given.
