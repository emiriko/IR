A new accelerating cosmology driven only by baryons plus cold dark matter
(CDM) is proposed in the framework of general relativity. In this model the
present accelerating stage of the Universe is powered by the negative pressure
describing the gravitationally-induced particle production of cold dark matter
particles. This kind of scenario has only one free parameter and the
differential equation governing the evolution of the scale factor is exactly
the same of the $\Lambda$CDM model. For a spatially flat Universe, as predicted
by inflation ($\Omega_{dm}+\Omega_{baryon}=1$), it is found that the
effectively observed matter density parameter is $\Omega_{meff} = 1- \alpha$,
where $\alpha$ is the constant parameter specifying the CDM particle creation
rate. The supernovae test based on the Union data (2008) requires $\alpha\sim
0.71$ so that $\Omega_{meff} \sim 0.29$ as independently derived from weak
gravitational lensing, the large scale structure and other complementary
observations.
