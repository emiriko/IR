We present a numerical study of the random Blume-Capel model in three
dimension. The phase diagram is characterized by spin-glass/paramagnet phase
transitions both of first and second order in the thermodynamic sense.
Numerical simulations are performed using the Exchange-Monte Carlo algorithm,
providing clear evidence for inverse freezing. The main features at criticality
and in the phase coexistence region are investigated. We are not privy to other
  3D short-range systems with quenched disorder undergoing inverse freezing.
