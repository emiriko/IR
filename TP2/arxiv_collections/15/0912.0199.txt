We present the calculations of the complete next-to-leading order(NLO) QCD
corrections to the inclusive total cross sections for the Kaluza-Klein(KK)
graviton and photon associated production process $pp \to \gamma G_{KK} + X$ in
the large extra dimensions(LED) model at the LHC. We show that the NLO QCD
corrections in general enhance the total cross sections and reduce the
dependence of the total cross sections on the factorization and renormalization
scales. When jet veto is considered, the NLO corrections reduce the total cross
sections. We also calculate some important differential cross sections for this
process at NLO: the missing transverse momentum distribution, the transverse
momentum distribution and the pseudorapidity distribution of photon.
