We discuss several techniques for the evaluation of the generalised Lyapunov
exponents which characterise the growth of products of random matrices in the
large-deviation regime. A Monte Carlo algorithm that performs importance
sampling using a simple random resampling step is proposed as a general-purpose
numerical method which is both efficient and easy to implement. Alternative
techniques complementing this method are presented. These include the
computation of the generalised Lyapunov exponents by solving numerically an
eigenvalue problem, and some asymptotic results corresponding to high-order
moments of the matrix products. Taken together, the techniques discussed in
this paper provide a suite of methods which should prove useful for the
evaluation of the generalised Lyapunov exponents in a broad range of
applications. Their usefulness is demonstrated on particular products of random
matrices arising in the study of scalar mixing by complex fluid flows.
