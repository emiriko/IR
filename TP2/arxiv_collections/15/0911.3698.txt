A goal of the emerging field of quantum control is to develop methods for
quantum technologies to function robustly in the presence of noise. Central
issues are the fundamental limitations on the available information about
quantum systems and the disturbance they suffer in the process of measurement.
In the context of a simple quantum control scenario--the stabilization of
non-orthogonal states of a qubit against dephasing--we experimentally explore
the use of weak measurements in feedback control. We find that, despite the
intrinsic difficultly of implementing them, weak measurements allow us to
control the qubit better in practice than is even theoretically possible
without them. Our work shows that these more general quantum measurements can
play an important role for feedback control of quantum systems.
