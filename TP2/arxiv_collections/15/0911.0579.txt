The angular momentum operators for a system of two spin-zero
indistinguishable particles are constructed, using Isham's Canonical Group
Quantization method. This mathematically rigorous method provides a hint at the
correct definition of (total) angular momentum operators, for arbitrary spin,
in a system of indistinguishable particles. The connection with other
configuration space approaches to spin-statistics is discussed, as well as the
relevance of the obtained results in view of a possible alternative proof of
the spin-statistics theorem.
