We study the string instanton wrapping a non-trivial two-cycle in CP(3) of
the type IIA string theory compactified on AdS_4 x CP(3) superspace and find
that it has twelve fermionic zero modes associated with 1/2 of the
supersymmetry of the background thus manifesting that this classical instanton
configuration is 1/2 BPS
