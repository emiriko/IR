Light-cone gauge NSR string theory in noncritical dimensions should
correspond to a string theory with a nonstandard longitudinal part.
Supersymmetrizing the bosonic case [arXiv:0909.4675], we formulate a
superconformal worldsheet theory for the longitudinal variables X^{\pm},
\psi^{\pm}. We show that with the transverse variables and the ghosts combined,
it is possible to construct a nilpotent BRST charge.
