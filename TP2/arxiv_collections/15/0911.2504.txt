The 1964 theorem of John Bell shows that no model that reproduces the
predictions of quantum mechanics can simultaneously satisfy the assumptions of
locality and determinism. On the other hand, the assumptions of \emph{signal
locality} plus \emph{predictability} are also sufficient to derive Bell
inequalities. This simple theorem, previously noted but published only
relatively recently by Masanes, Acin and Gisin, has fundamental implications
not entirely appreciated. Firstly, nothing can be concluded about the
ontological assumptions of locality or determinism independently of each other
-- it is possible to reproduce quantum mechanics with deterministic models that
violate locality as well as indeterministic models that satisfy locality. On
the other hand, the operational assumption of signal locality is an empirically
testable (and well-tested) consequence of relativity. Thus Bell inequality
violations imply that we can trust that some events are fundamentally
\emph{unpredictable}, even if we cannot trust that they are indeterministic.
This result grounds the quantum-mechanical prohibition of arbitrarily accurate
predictions on the assumption of no superluminal signalling, regardless of any
postulates of quantum mechanics. It also sheds a new light on an early stage of
the historical debate between Einstein and Bohr.
