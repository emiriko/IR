We present a successful description of the medium modification of light and
heavy flavor jets within a perturbative QCD (pQCD) based approach. Only the
couplings involving hard partons are assumed to be weak. The effect of the
medium on a hard parton, per unit time, is encoded in terms of three
non-perturbative, related transport coefficients which describe the transverse
momentum squared gained, the elastic energy loss and diffusion in elastic
energy transfer. A fit of the centrality dependence of the suppression and the
azimuthal anisotropy of leading hadrons tends to favor somewhat larger
transport coefficients for heavy quarks. Imposing additional constraints based
on leading order (LO) Hard Thermal Loop (HTL) effective theory, leads to a
worsening of the fit.
