We define generalized currents associated with immersions of abstract
oriented solenoids with a transversal measure. We realize geometrically the
full real homology of a compact manifold with these generalized currents, and
more precisely with immersions of minimal uniquely ergodic solenoids. This
makes precise and geometric De Rham's realization of the real homology by only
using a restricted geometric subclass of currents.
