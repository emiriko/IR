What is the impact of obstacles on the graphs of connections between stations
in Mobile Ad hoc Networks? In order to answer, at least partially, this
question, the first step is to define both an environment with obstacles and a
mobility model for the stations in such an environment. The present paper
focuses on a new way of considering the mobility within environments with
obstacles, while keeping the core ideas of the well-known Random WayPoint
mobility model (a.k.a RWP). Based on a mesh-partitioning of the space, we
propose a new model called RSP-O-G for which we compute the spatial
distribution of stations and analyse how the presence of obstacles impacts this
distribution compared to the distribution when no obstacles are present.
Coupled with a simple model of radio propagation, and according to the density
of stations in the environment, we study the mean degree of the connection
graphs corresponding to such mobile ad hoc networks.
