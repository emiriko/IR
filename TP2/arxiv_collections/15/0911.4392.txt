The paper discusses the problem of the orientation of galaxies in groups in
the Local Supercluster (LSC). The existence of the preferred orientation of
galaxy group is shown. We found that the orientation of galaxy groups in the
Local Supercluster in the scale till about 20 Mpc is strongly correlated with
the distribution of neighbouring groups. The line joining the two brightest
galaxies is in alignment with both the group major axes and the direction
toward the centre of the LSC, i.e. Virgo cluster. These correlations suggest
that two brightest galaxies were formed in filaments of matter directed towards
the protosupercluster centre. Afterwards, the hierarchical clustering leads to
aggregation of galaxies around these two galaxies. Our results are in agreement
with the predictions of numerical simulations.
