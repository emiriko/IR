One of the outstanding puzzles of theoretical physics is whether quantum
information indeed gets lost in the case of Black Hole (BH) evaporation or
accretion. Let us recall that Quantum Mechanics (QM) demands an upper limit on
the acceleration of a test particle. On the other hand, it is pointed out here
that, if a Schwarzschild BH would exist, the acceleration of the test particle
would blow up at the event horizon in violation of QM. Thus the concept of an
exact BH is in contradiction of QM and quantum gravity (QG). It is also
reminded that the mass of a BH actually appears as an INTEGRATION CONSTANT of
Einstein equations. And it has been shown that the value of this integration
constant is actually zero. Thus even classically, there cannot be finite mass
BHs though zero mass BH is allowed. It has been further shown that during
continued gravitational collapse, radiation emanating from the contracting
object gets trapped within it by the runaway gravitational field. As a
consequence, the contracting body attains a quasi-static state where outward
trapped radiation pressure gets balanced by inward gravitational pull and the
ideal classical BH state is never formed in a finite proper time. In other
words, continued gravitational collapse results in an "Eternally Collapsing
Object" which is a ball of hot plasma and which is asymptotically approaching
the true BH state with M=0 after radiating away its entire mass energy. And if
we include QM, this contraction must halt at a radius suggested by highest QM
acceleration. In any case no EH is ever formed and in reality, there is no
quantum information paradox.
