It is shown that the equilibrium configurations of two spherical masses
carrying charges of opposite sign that are present in Bonnor's approximate
model for two charged particles and also in the exact double-Reissner-Nordstrom
solution are formed due to the additional electric field of the repulsive
character induced in the black-hole constituent by its overcharged partner. A
three-parameter family of such configurations is pointed out.
