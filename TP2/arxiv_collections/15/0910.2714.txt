Current stellar population models have arguably the largest uncertainties in
the near-IR wavelength range, partly due to a lack of large and well calibrated
empirical spectral libraries. In this paper we present a project, which aim it
is to provide the first library of luminosity weighted integrated near-IR
spectra of globular clusters to be used to test the current stellar population
models and serve as calibrators for the future ones. Our pilot study presents
spatially integrated K-band spectra of three old (>10 Gyr) and metal poor
([Fe/H]~-1.4), and three intermediate age (1-2 Gyr) and more metal rich
([Fe/H]~-0.4) globular clusters in the LMC. We measured the line strengths of
the Na I, Ca I and 12CO(2-0) absorption features. The Na I index decreases with
the increasing age and decreasing metallicity of the clusters. The Dco index,
used to measure the 12CO(2-0) line strength, is significantly reduced by the
presence of carbon-rich TP-AGB stars in the globular clusters with age ~1 Gyr.
This is in contradiction with the predictions of the stellar population models
of Maraston (2005). We find that this disagreement is due to the different CO
absorption strength of carbon-rich Milky Way TP-AGB stars used in the models
and the LMC carbon stars in our sample. For globular clusters with age >2 Gyr
we find Dco index measurements consistent with the model predictions.
