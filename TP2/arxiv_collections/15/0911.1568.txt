We carry out a thorough analysis with the GEVP method to obtain ground-state
and first-excited-state masses and decay constants of bottom-strange
(pseudo-scalar and vector) mesons. This computation is done for quenched,
nonperturbatively renormalized HQET, including order $1/m_b$ terms. The
continuum limit is obtained using three lattice spacings and two static
actions.
