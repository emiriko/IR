We present a variational formulation for the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ)
equation that leads to a thermodynamic-like potential for the KPZ as well as
for other related kinetic equations. For the KPZ case, with the knowledge of
such a potential we prove some global shift invariance properties previously
conjectured by other authors. We also show a few results about the form of the
stationary probability distribution function for arbitrary dimensions. The
procedure used for KPZ was extended in order to derive more general forms of
such a functional leading to other nonlinear kinetic equations, as well as
cases with density dependent surface tension.
