We study a series-coupled double quantum dot in the Kondo regime modeled by
the two-impurity Anderson model and find a new conduction-band mediated
superexchange interaction that competes with Kondo physics in the strong
Coulomb interaction limit. Our numerical renormalization group results,
complemented with the higher-order Rayleigh-Schr\"odinger perturbation theory,
show that the novel exchange mechanism leads to clear experimental consequences
that can be checked in transport measurements through double quantum dots.
