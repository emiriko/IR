We examine various generalizations, e.g. exactly solvable, quasi-exactly
solvable and non-Hermitian variants, of a quantum nonlinear oscillator. For all
these cases, the same mass function has been used and it has also been shown
that the new exactly solvable potentials possess shape invariance symmetry. The
solutions are obtained in terms of classical orthogonal polynomials.
