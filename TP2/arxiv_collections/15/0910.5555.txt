We consider the generalized gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking (GMSB)
models with the messenger fields which do not form the complete multiplets of
SU(5) GUT symmetry. Such a situation may happen in the anomalous U(1) GUT
scenario because the mass spectrum of the superheavy particle does not respect
SU(5) GUT symmetry, although the success of the gauge coupling unification can
be explained. In this paper, we assume that one pair of the messenger fields
gives the dominant contribution, and the LHC signature for the two possible
messengers, X + \bar{X} and Q + \bar{Q}, are examined. We investigate the
possibility to measure the deviation from the usual GUT relation of the gaugino
masses which is one of the most important features of these scenarios.
