The Stochastic Calculus of Looping Sequences is suitable to describe the
evolution of microbiological systems, taking into account the speed of the
described activities. We propose a type system for this calculus that models
how the presence of positive and negative catalysers can modify these speeds.
We claim that types are the right abstraction in order to represent the
interaction between elements without specifying exactly the element positions.
Our claim is supported through an example modelling the lactose operon.
