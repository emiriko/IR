We present the results of the physical point simulation in 2+1 flavor lattice
QCD with the nonperturbatively $O(a)$-improved Wilson quark action and the
Iwasaki gauge action at $\beta=1.9$ on a
  $32^3 \times 64$ lattice. The physical quark masses together with the lattice
spacing is determined with $m_\pi$, $m_K$ and $m_\Omega$ as physical inputs.
There are two key algorithmic ingredients to make possible the direct
simulation at the physical point: One is the mass-preconditioned
domain-decomposed HMC algorithm to reduce the computational cost. The other is
the reweighting technique to adjust the hopping parameters exactly to the
physical point. The physics results include the hadron spectrum, the quark
masses and the pseudoscalar meson decay constants. The renormalization factors
are nonperturbatively evaluated with the Schr{\"o}dinger functional method. The
results are compared with the previous ones obtained by the chiral
extrapolation method.
