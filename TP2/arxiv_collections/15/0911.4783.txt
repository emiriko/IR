We present an analysis of the decay process ${\bar B} \to {\bar K}_2(1430)
\ell^+ \ell^-$, where this process has all the features of the related and well
investigated process ${\bar B} \to {\bar K}^*(890) \ell^+ \ell^-$, with
theoretically comparable branching ratios. The differential decay rate as well
as the forward-backward asymmetry are worked out, where the sensitivity of
these to possible right-handed couplings for the related $b \to s$ radiative
decay are also investigated.
