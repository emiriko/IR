Interpretations of indirect searches for dark matter (DM) require theoretical
predictions for the annihilation or decay rates of DM into stable particles of
the standard model. These predictions include usually only final states
accessible as lowest order tree-level processes, with electromagnetic
bremsstrahlung and the loop-suppressed two gamma-ray line as exceptions. We
show that this restriction may lead to severely biased results for DM tailored
to produce only leptons in final states and with mass in the TeV range. For
such models, unavoidable electroweak bremsstrahlung of Z and W-bosons has a
significant influence both on the branching ratio and the spectral shape of the
final state particles. We work out the consequences for two situations:
Firstly, the idealized case where DM annihilates at tree level with 100%
branching ratio into neutrinos. For a given cross section, this leads
eventually to "minimal yields" of photons, electrons, positrons and
antiprotons. Secondly, the case where the only allowed two-body final states
are electrons. The latter case is typical of models aimed at fitting cosmic ray
e^- and e^+ data. We find that the multimessenger signatures of such models can
be significantly modified with respect to results presented in the literature.
