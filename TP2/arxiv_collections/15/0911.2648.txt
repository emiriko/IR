We present a neutron scattering investigation of Ce1-xYxAl3 as a function of
chemical pressure, which induces a transition from heavy-fermion behavior in
CeAl3 (TK=5 K) to a mixed-valence state at x=0.5 (TK=150 K). The crossover can
be modeled accurately on an absolute intensity scale by an increase in the k-f
hybridization, Vkf, within the Anderson impurity model. Surprisingly, the
principal effect of the increasing Vkf is not to broaden the low-energy
components of the dynamic magnetic susceptibility but to transfer spectral
weight to high energy.
