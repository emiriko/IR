Extreme multiplicity studies at 50 GeV in pp interactions are discussed.
Preliminary multiplicity distributions at U-70 (IHEP, Protvino) energy have
been obtained for more than 20 charged particles. A new elaborated algorithm
for the track reconstruction in a drift tube tracker and magnetic spectrometer,
has been checked . The collective behavior of secondary particles is manifested
in these interactions in the extreme multiplicity region. For the first time
the ring events in pp interactions have been observed in this region. A
possibility of detecting the Bose-Einstein condensation detection is discussed.
