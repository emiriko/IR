The rotationally-covariant renormalization group equations of motion for the
density wave amplitudes in the phase field crystal model are shown to follow
from a dynamical equation driven by an effective free energy density that we
derive. We show that this free energy can be written purely as a function of
the strain tensor and thence derive the corresponding equations governing the
nonlinear elastic response.
