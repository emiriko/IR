Pseudo-Newtonian gravitational potential introduced in spherically symmetric
black-hole spacetimes with a repulsive cosmological constant is tested for
equilibrium toroidal configurations of barotropic perfect fluid orbiting the
black holes. Shapes and potential depths are determined for the marginally
stable barotropic tori with uniform distribution of specific angular momentum,
using both the pseudo-Newtonian and fully relativistic approach. For the
adiabatic (isoentropic) perfect fluid, temperature profiles, mass-density and
pressure profiles and total masses of pseudo-Newtonian and relativistic tori
are compared providing important information on the relevance of the test-disc
approximation in both the approaches. It is shown that the pseudo-Newtonian
approach can be precise enough and useful for the modelling of accretion discs
in the Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetimes with the cosmological parameter
y=Lambda M^(2)/3 < 10^(-6). For astrophysically relevant black holes with
y<10^(-25), this statement is tested and shown to be precise in few percent for
both accretion and excretion tori and for the marginally bound, i.e., maximally
extended tori allowing simultaneous inflow to the black hole and outflow to the
outer space.
