We study the entanglement preservation of two qubits locally interacting with
their reservoirs. We show that the existence of a bound state of the qubit and
its reservoir and the non-Markovian effect are two essential ingredients and
their interplay plays a crucial role in preserving the entanglement in the
steady state. When the non-Markovian effect is neglected, the entanglement
sudden death (ESD) is reproduced. On the other hand, when the non-Markovian is
significantly strong but the bound state is absent, the phenomenon of the ESD
and its revival is recovered. Our formulation presents a unified picture about
the entanglement preservation and provides a clear clue on how to preserve the
entanglement in quantum information processing.
