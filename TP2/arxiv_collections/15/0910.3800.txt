The classical tests of general relativity (perihelion precession, deflection
of light, and the radar echo delay) are considered for several spherically
symmetric static vacuum solutions in brane world models. Generally, the
spherically symmetric vacuum solutions of the brane gravitational field
equations have properties quite distinct as compared to the standard black hole
solutions of general relativity. As a first step a general formalism that
facilitates the analysis of general relativistic Solar System tests for any
given spherically symmetric metric is developed. It is shown that the existing
observational Solar System data on the perihelion shift of Mercury, on the
light bending around the Sun (obtained using long-baseline radio
interferometry), and ranging to Mars using the Viking lander, constrain the
numerical values of the parameters of the specific models.
