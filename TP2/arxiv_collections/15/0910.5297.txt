A general property of the relation between the dynamics of the reduced purity
and correlations is investigated in quantum mechanical systems. We show that a
non-zero time-derivative of the reduced purity of a system implies the
existence of non-zero correlations with its environment under any unbounded
Hamiltonians with finite variance. This shows the role of local dynamical
information on the correlations, as well as the role of correlations in the
mechanism of purity change.
