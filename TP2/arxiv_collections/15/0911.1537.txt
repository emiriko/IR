We investigate macroscopic tunneling from an elongated quasi 1-d trap,
forming a 'cigar shaped' BEC. Using recently developed formalism we get the
leading analytical approximation for the right hand side of the potential wall,
i.e. outside the trap, and a formalism based on Wigner functions, for the left
side of the potential wall, i.e. inside the BEC. We then present accomplished
results of numerical calculations, which show a 'blip' in the particle density
traveling with an asymptotic shock velocity, as resulted from previous works on
a dot-like trap, but with significant differences from the latter. Inside the
BEC a pattern of a traveling dispersive shock wave is revealed. In the
attractive case, we find trains of bright solitons frozen near the boundary.
