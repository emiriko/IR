We have used magneto-photoluminescence measurements to establish that
InP/GaAs quantum dots have a type-II (staggered) band alignment. The average
excitonic Bohr radius and the binding energy are estimated to be 15nm and 1.5
meV respectively. When compared to bulk InP, the excitonic binding is weaker
due to the repulsive (type-II) potential at the hetero-interface. The
measurements are extended to over almost six orders of magnitude of laser
excitation powers and to magnetic fields of up to 50 tesla. It is shown that
the excitation power can be used to tune the average hole occupancy of the
quantum dots, and hence the strength of the electron-hole binding. The
diamagnetic shift coefficient is observed to drastically reduce as the quantum
dot ensemble makes a gradual transition from a regime where the emission is
from (hydrogen-like) two-particle excitonic states to a regime where the
emission from (helium-like) four-particle biexcitonic states also become
significant.
