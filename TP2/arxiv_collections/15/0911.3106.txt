In the present work we investigate a new statistical ensemble, which seems
logical to be entitled the open one, for the case of a one-component system of
ordinary particles. Its peculiarity is in complementing the consideration of a
system with the inclusion of a certain surrounding area. The calculations
indicate the necessity of taking into account the surface that delimits a given
system even in the case when the latter is a part of a uniform medium and is
not singled out one way or another.
  The surface tension coefficient behaves unlike two-phase systems in
equilibrium and depends on two variables - pressure as well as temperature -
and belongs to the boundary separating a hard solid from a fluid. As for the
mathematical mechanism ensuring the fulfillment of thermodynamic relations, the
emphasis is shifted from operating with series, like in the grand canonical
ensemble, towards employing the recurrence relations of a new class of
functions that incorporate Boltzmann and Ursell factors as their extreme cases
and towards utilizing generating functions.
  The second topic of discussion that the present article deals with is the
consideration of the surface tension and adsorption observed at the boundary of
a solid body and a liquid or gas carried out on the basis of the analysis of
the classical system found in a field of force of general type. The surface
terms are calculated with the aid of field functions and the correlation
functions of an unperturbed volume phase and behave somewhat vaguely;
particularly, as a function of activity, they may start with a linear or
quadratic term.
