A new entanglement measure, which is called D-concurrence, is proposed. Then
the upper and lower bounds for D-concurrence are obtained and the relationship
between D-concurrence and the usual concurrence of Wootters was established. In
addition, comparing with the usual concurrence, D-concurrence has some special
merits.
