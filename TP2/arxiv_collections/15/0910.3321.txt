We propose a method for encoding iterators (and recursion operators in
general) using interaction nets (INs). There are two main applications for
this: the method can be used to obtain a visual nota- tion for functional
programs; and it can be used to extend the existing translations of the
lambda-calculus into INs to languages with recursive types.
