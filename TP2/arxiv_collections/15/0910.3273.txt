Oppositely charged drops have long been assumed to experience an attractive
force that favors their coalescence. In this fluid dynamics video we
demonstrate the existence of a critical field strength above which oppositely
charged drops do not coalesce. We observe that appropriately positioned and
oppositely charged drops migrate towards one another in an applied electric
field; but whereas the drops coalesce as expected at low field strengths, they
are repelled from one another after contact at higher field strengths.
Qualitatively, the drops appear to `bounce' off one another. We directly image
the transient formation of a meniscus bridge between the bouncing drops.
