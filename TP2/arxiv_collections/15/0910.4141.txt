The recent observational evidence for the current cosmic acceleration have
stimulated renewed interest in alternative cosmologies, such as scenarios with
interaction in the dark sector (dark matter and dark energy). In general, such
models contain an unknown negative-pressure dark component coupled with the
pressureless dark matter and/or with the baryons that results in an evolution
for the Universe rather different from the one predicted by the standard
$\Lambda$CDM model. In this work we test the observational viability of such
scenarios by using the most recent galaxy cluster gas mass fraction versus
redshift data (42 X-ray luminous, dynamically relaxed galaxy clusters spanning
the redshift range 0.063 < z < 1.063) (Allen et al. 2008) to place bounds on
the parameter $\epsilon$ that characterizes the dark matter/dark energy
coupling. The resulting are consistent with, and typically as constraining as,
those derived from other cosmological data. Although a time-independent
cosmological constant ($\Lambda$CDM model) is a good fit to these galaxy
cluster data, an interacting dark energy component cannot yet be ruled out.
