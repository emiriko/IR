CCD photometric observations of the Algol-type eclipsing binary X Tri have
been obtained. The light curves are analyzed with the Wilson-Devinney (WD) code
and new geometric and photometric elements are derived. A new O-C analysis of
the system, based on the most reliable timings of minima found in the
literature, is presented and apparent period changes are discussed with respect
to possible and multiple Light-Time Effect (LITE) in the system. Moreover, the
results for the existence of additional bodies around the eclipsing pair,
derived from the period study, are compared with those for extra luminosity,
derived from the light curve analysis.
