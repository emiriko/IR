Several experiments engaging kaon beams have been carried out to study the
existence of deeply bound kaonic state. We proposed an alternative method,
which exploits a p+p reaction at 3.5GeV incoming energy to search for the most
elementary of the kaonic states: ppK-. This experiment is planned with the FOPI
spectrometer at GSI and a silicon-based trigger system has been developed to
increase the detection capability of the existing system for the reaction of
interest. Several tests have been performed under realistic beam conditions to
test the feasibility of the measurement and the proof of principle of the
trigger system. The positive results of such measurements are shown in this
contribution together with the expected rates extracted from simulations.
