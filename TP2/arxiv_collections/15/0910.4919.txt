We study the transport properties of a hybrid nanostructure composed of a
ferromagnet, two quantum dots, and a superconductor connected in series. By
using the non-equilibrium Green's function approach, we have calculated the
electric current, the differential conductance and the transmittance for
energies within the superconductor gap. In this regime, the mechanism of charge
transmission is the Andreev reflection, which allows for a control of the
current through the ferromagnet polarization. We have also included interdot
and intradot interactions, and have analyzed their influence through a mean
field approximation. In the presence of interactions, Coulomb blockade tend to
localized the electrons at the double-dot system, leading to an asymmetric
pattern for the density of states at the dots, and thus reducing the
transmission probability through the device. In particular, for non-zero
polarization, the intradot interaction splits the spin degeneracy, reducing the
maximum value of the current due to different spin-up and spin-down densities
of states. Negative differential conductance (NDC) appears for some regions of
the voltage bias, as a result of the interplay of the Andreev scattering with
electronic correlations. By applying a gate voltage at the dots, one can tune
the effect, changing the voltage region where this novel phenomenon appears.
This mechanism to control the current may be of importance in technological
applications.
