The wide-band Suzaku spectra of the black hole binary GX 339-4, acquired in
2007 February during the Very High state, were reanalyzed. Effects of event
pileup (significant within ~ 3' of the image center) and telemetry saturation
of the XIS data were carefully considered. The source was detected up to ~ 300$
keV, with an unabsorbed 0.5--200 keV luminosity of ~3.8 10^{38} erg/s at 8 kpc.
The spectrum can be approximated by a power-law of photon index 2.7, with a
mild soft excess and a hard X-ray hump. When using the XIS data outside 2' of
the image center, the Fe-K line appeared extremely broad, suggesting a high
black hole spin as already reported by Miller et al. (2008) based on the Suzaku
data and other CCD data. When the XIS data accumulation is further limited to
>3' to avoid event pileup, the Fe-K profile becomes narrower, and there appears
a marginally better solution that suggests the inner disk radius to be 5-14
times the gravitational radius (1-sigma), though a maximally spinning black
hole is still allowed by the data at the 90% confidence level. Consistently,
the optically-thick accretion disk is inferred to be truncated at a radius 5-32
times the gravitational radius. Thus, the Suzaku data allow an alternative
explanation without invoking a rapidly spinning black hole. This inference is
further supported by the disk radius measured previously in the High/Soft
state.
