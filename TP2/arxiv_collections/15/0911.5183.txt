We use magnetic long range order as a tool to probe the Cooper pair wave
function in the iron arsenide superconductors. We show theoretically that
antiferromagnetism and superconductivity can coexist in these materials only if
Cooper pairs form an unconventional, sign-changing state. The observation of
coexistence in Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_{x}$)$_{2}$As$_{2}$ then demonstrates
unconventional pairing in this material. The detailed agreement between theory
and neutron diffraction experiments, in particular for the unusual behavior of
the magnetic order below $T_{c}$, demonstrates the robustness of our
conclusions. Our findings strongly suggest that superconductivity is
unconventional in all members of the iron arsenide family.
