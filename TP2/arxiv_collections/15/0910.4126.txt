The electron-phonon coupling in potassium-doped graphene on Ir(111) is
studied via the renormalization of the pi* band near the Fermi level, using
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. The renormalization is found to be
fairly weak and almost isotropic, with a mass enhancement parameter of lambda=
0.28(6) for both the K-M and the K-G direction. These results are found to
agree well with recent first principles calculations.
