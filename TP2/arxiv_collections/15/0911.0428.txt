In Method Engineering (ME) science, the key issue is the consideration of
information system development methods as fragments. Numerous ME approaches
have produced several definitions of method parts. Different in nature, these
fragments have nevertheless some common disadvantages: lack of implementation
tools, insufficient standardization effort, and so on. On the whole, the
observed drawbacks are related to the shortage of usage orientation. We have
proceeded to an in-depth analysis of existing method fragments within a
comparison framework in order to identify their drawbacks. We suggest
overcoming them by an improvement of the ?method service? concept. In this
paper, the method service is defined through the service paradigm applied to a
specific method fragment ? chunk. A discussion on the possibility to develop a
unique representation of method fragment completes our contribution.
