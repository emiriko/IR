The general method to obtain solutions of the Maxwellian equations from
scalar representatives is developed and applied to the diffraction of
electromagnetic waves. Kirchhoff's integral is modified to provide explicit
expressions for these representatives. The respective integrals are then
evaluated using the method of stationary phase in two dimensions. Hitherto
unknown formulae for the polarization appear as well as for imaging by
diffraction. Ready-to-use formulae describing Fresnel diffraction behind a
round stop are presented.
