We argue that already the first year run at the LHC with 3.5 TeV proton beams
will provide a quick and effective way to test the dynamics of the color
dipole-gluon interactions and the small x behavior of the gluon density in
proton from study of the vector meson photoproduction in ultraperipheral
proton-proton collisions.
