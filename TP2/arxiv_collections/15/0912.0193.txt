We identify the pattern of microscopic dynamical relaxation for a two
dimensional glass forming liquid. On short timescales, bursts of irreversible
particle motion, called cage jumps, aggregate into clusters. On larger time
scales, clusters aggregate both spatially and temporally into avalanches. This
propagation of mobility, or dynamic facilitation, takes place along the soft
regions of the systems, which have been identified by computing
isoconfigurational Debye-Waller maps. Our results characterize the way in which
dynamical heterogeneity evolves in moderately supercooled liquids and reveal
that it is astonishingly similar to the one found for dense glassy granular
media.
