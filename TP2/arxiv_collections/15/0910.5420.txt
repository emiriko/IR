The fractured Boer-Mulders functions describe an inriguing class of
polarization effects for the production of baryons in the target fragmentation
region of deep-inelastic processes. These functions characterize transverse
momentum asymmetries related to the spin orientation for different flavors of
axial vector diquarks in an unpolarized ensemble of protons just as the
familiar Boer-Mulders functions characterize transverse momentum asymmetries
connected to the spin orientation of quarks in unpolarized targets. The
asymmetries of the fractured Boer-Mulders effect originating in the proton
distribution function can be separated kinematically, both in SIDIS and in the
Drell-Yan process from the asymmetries of the polarizing fracture functions
generated during the soft color rearrangement of the fragmentation process. The
experimental requirements for this separation are presented in this article and
it is shown that the fractured Boer-Mulders effect should change sign between
Drell-Yan and SIDIS while the polarizing fracture functions remain the same.
Simple isospin arguments indicate the two polarization mechanisms should give
significantly different results for the production of polarized lambdas and
sigmas.
