This paper presents the study and the realization of a hybrid 60 GHz wireless
communications system. As the 60 GHz radio link operates only in a single-room
configuration, an additional Radio over Fibre (RoF) link is used to ensure the
communications in all the rooms of a residential environment. A single carrier
architecture is adopted. The system uses low complexity baseband processing
modules. A byte/frame synchronization technique is designed to provide a high
value of the preamble detection probability and a very small value of the false
alarm probability. Conventional RS (255, 239) encoder and decoder are used to
correct errors in the transmission channel. Results of Bit Error Rate (BER)
measurements are presented for various antennas configurations.
