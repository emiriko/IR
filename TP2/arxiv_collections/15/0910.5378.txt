We report on a detailed analysis of the superconducting properties of
boron-doped silicon films grown along the 001 direction by Gas Immersion Laser
Doping. The doping concentration cB has been varied up to approx. 10 at.% by
increasing the number of laser shots to 500. No superconductivity could be
observed down to 40mK for doping level below 2.5 at.%. The critical temperature
Tc then increased steeply to reach 0.6K for cB = 8 at%. No hysteresis was found
for the transitions in magnetic field, which is characteristic of a type II
superconductor. The corresponding upper critical field Hc2(0) was on the order
of 1000 G, much smaller than the value previously reported by Bustarret et al.
