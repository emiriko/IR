We study state space equations within the white noise space setting. A
commutative ring of power series in a countable number of variables plays an
important role. Transfer functions are rational functions with coefficients in
this commutative ring, and are characterized in a number of ways. A major
feature in our approach is the observation that key characteristics of a
linear, time invariant, stochastic system are determined by the corresponding
characteristics associated with the deterministic part of the system, namely
its average behavior.
