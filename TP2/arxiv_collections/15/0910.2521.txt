We establish faithfulness of braid group actions generated by twists along an
ADE configuration of $2$-spherical objects in a derived category. Our major
tool is the Garside structure on braid groups of type ADE. This faithfulness
result provides the missing ingredient in Bridgeland's description of a space
of stability conditions associated to a Kleinian singularity.
