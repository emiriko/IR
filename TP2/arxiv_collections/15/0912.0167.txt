Lattice simulations of hadronic structure are now reaching a level where they
are able to not only complement, but also provide guidance to current and
forthcoming experimental programmes at, e.g. Jefferson Lab, COMPASS/CERN and
FAIR/GSI. By considering new simulations at low quark masses and on large
volumes, we review the recent progress that has been made in this exciting area
by the QCDSF/UKQCD collaboration. In particular, results obtained close to the
physical point for several quantities, including electromagnetic form factors
and moments of ordinary parton distribution functions, show some indication of
approaching their phenomenological values.
