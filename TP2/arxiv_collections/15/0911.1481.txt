We present analysis of both the short-term optical and long-term
multiwavelength variability of CTA 102. In 2004, this object was observed in an
intense optical flaring state. Extensive R-band microvariability observations
were carried out during this high state. In 2005, we obtained several weeks of
contemporaneous radio, optical, and X-ray observations of CTA 102. These
observations recorded distinct flaring activity in all three wavebands.
Subsequent analysis revealed that this object may appear redder when in a
brighter optical state, and that the X-ray, optical, and radio activity do not
appear to be correlated. The shape of the observed spectral energy
distributions suggests that both synchrotron-related and external inverse
Compton processes may contribute to the X-ray emission. Our results are also
compared with other results on this object and archival microvariability
observations. It appears that more rapid, dramatic microvariability events
occur when CTA 102 is in an elevated optical flux state.
