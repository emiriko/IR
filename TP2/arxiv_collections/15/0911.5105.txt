The stability of isotropic cosmological solutions for two-field models in the
Bianchi I metric is considered. We prove that the sufficient conditions for the
Lyapunov stability in the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric provide the
stability with respect to anisotropic perturbations in the Bianchi I metric and
with respect to the cold dark matter energy density fluctuations. Sufficient
conditions for the Lyapunov stability of the isotropic fixed points of the
system of the Einstein equations have been found. We use the superpotential
method to construct stable kink-type solutions and obtain sufficient conditions
on the superpotential for the Lyapunov stability of the corresponding exact
solutions. We analyze the stability of isotropic kink-type solutions for string
field theory inspired cosmological models.
