Crossed Andreev reflection (CAR) in metallic nanostructures, a possible basis
for solid-state electron entangler devices, is usually investigated by
detecting non-local voltages in multi-terminal superconductor/normal metal
devices. This task is difficult because other subgap processes may mask the
effects of CAR. One of these processes is the generation of charge imbalance
(CI) and the diffusion of non-equilibrium quasi-particles in the
superconductor. Here we demonstrate a characteristic dependence of non-local CI
on a magnetic field applied parallel to the superconducting wire, which can be
understood by a generalization of the standard description of CI to non-local
experiments. These results can be used to distinguish CAR and CI and to extract
CI relaxation times in superconducting nanostructures. In addition, we
investigate the dependence of non-local CI on the resistance of the injector
and detector contacts and demonstrate a quantitative agreement with a recent
theory using only material and junction characteristics extracted from separate
direct measurements.
