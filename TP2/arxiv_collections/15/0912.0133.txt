We study the autoresonant solution of Duffing's equation in the presence of
dissipation. This solution is proved to be an attracting set. We evaluate the
maximal amplitude of the autoresonant solution and the time of transition from
autoresonant growth of the amplitude to the mode of fast oscillations.
Analytical results are illustrated by numerical simulations.
