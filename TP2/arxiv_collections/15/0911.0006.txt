Letter of intent describing SiD (Silicon Detector) for consideration by the
International Linear Collider IDAG panel. This detector concept is founded on
the use of silicon detectors for vertexing, tracking, and electromagnetic
calorimetry. The detector has been cost-optimized as a general-purpose detector
for a 500 GeV electron-positron linear collider.
