Context. In this paper we present the first system test in which we
demonstrate the concept of using an array of Distributed Read Out Imaging
Devices (DROIDs) for optical photon detection. Aims. After the successful S-Cam
3 detector the next step in the development of a cryogenic optical photon
counting imaging spectrometer under the S-Cam project is to increase the field
of view using DROIDs. With this modification the field of view of the camera
has been increased by a factor of 5 in area, while keeping the number of
readout channels the same. Methods. The test has been performed using the
flexible S-Cam 3 system and exchanging the 10x12 Superconducting Tunnel
Junction array for a 3x20 DROID array. The extra data reduction needed with
DROIDs is performed offline. Results. We show that, although the responsivity
(number of tunnelled quasiparticles per unit of absorbed photon energy, e- /eV)
of the current array is too low for direct astronomical applications, the
imaging quality is already good enough for pattern detection, and will improve
further with increasing responsivity. Conclusions. The obtained knowledge can
be used to optimise the system for the use of DROIDs.
