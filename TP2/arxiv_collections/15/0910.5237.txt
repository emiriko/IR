Branching fractions and CP-violating asymmetries of charmless $\bar B_s\to
PP, VP, VV$ decays (P and V denoting pseudoscalar and vector mesons,
respectively) are re-examined in the framework of QCD factorization (QCDF). We
take into account subleading power corrections to the penguin annihilation
topology and to color-suppressed tree amplitudes that are crucial for resolving
the CP puzzles and rate deficit problems with penguin-dominated two-body decays
and color-suppressed tree-dominated $\pi^0\pi^0$ and $\rho^0\pi^0$ modes in the
$B_{u,d}$ sector. Many of the $B_s\to h_1h_2$ decays can be related to $B_d\to
h_1h_2$ ones via U-spin or SU(3) symmetry. Some useful model-independent
relations can be derived and tested. Mixing-induced CP asymmetries for many of
the penguin-dominated decays are predicted to be very small in the standard
model. They are sensitive to New Physics and offer rich possibilities of new
discoveries. Measurements of direct CP-violating asymmetries can be used to
discriminate QCDF from other competing approaches such as pQCD and
soft-collinear effective theory.
