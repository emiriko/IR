We discuss the tremendous progress that has been towards an understanding of
how the spin of the proton is distributed on its quark and gluon constituents.
This is a problem that began in earnest twenty years ago with the discovery of
the proton ``spin crisis'' by the European Muon Collaboration. The discoveries
prompted by that original work have given us unprecedented insight into the
amount of spin carried by polarized gluons and the orbital angular momentum of
the quarks.
