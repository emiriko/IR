We study the conductance spectrum of graphene quantum dots, both single and
multiple cases. The single electron tunneling phenomenon is investigated and
the periodicity, amplitude and line shape of the Coulomb blockade oscillations
at low temperatures are obtained. Further, we discuss the transport behavior
when multiple dots are assembled in array and find a phase transition of
conductance spectra from individual Coulomb blockade to collective Coulomb
blockade.
