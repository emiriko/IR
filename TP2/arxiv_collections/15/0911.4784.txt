The quasiclassical theory of superconductivity provides the most successful
description of diffusive heterostructures comprising superconducting elements,
namely, the Usadel equations for isotropic Green's functions. Since the
quasiclassical and isotropic approximations break down close to interfaces, the
Usadel equations have to be supplemented with boundary conditions for isotropic
Green's functions (BCIGF), which are not derivable within the quasiclassical
description. For a long time, the BCIGF were available only for spin-degenerate
tunnel contacts, which posed a serious limitation on the applicability of the
Usadel description to modern structures containing ferromagnetic elements. In
this article, we close this gap and derive spin-dependent BCIGF for a contact
encompassing superconducting and ferromagnetic correlations. This finally
justifies several simplified versions of the spin-dependent BCIGF, which have
been used in the literature so far. In the general case, our BCIGF are valid as
soon as the quasiclassical isotropic approximation can be performed. However,
their use require the knowledge of the full scattering matrix of the contact,
an information usually not available for realistic interfaces. In the case of a
weakly polarized tunnel interface, the BCIGF can be expressed in terms of a few
parameters, i.e. the tunnel conductance of the interface and five
conductance-like parameters accounting for the spin-dependence of the interface
scattering amplitudes. In the case of a contact with a ferromagnetic insulator,
it is possible to find explicit BCIGF also for stronger polarizations. The
BCIGF derived in this article are sufficienly general to describe a variety of
physical situations and may serve as a basis for modelling realistic
nanostructures.
