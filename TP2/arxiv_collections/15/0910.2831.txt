We propose a dark matter model in which the dark sector is gauged under a new
SU(2) group. The dark sector consists of SU(2) dark gauge fields, two triplet
dark Higgs fields, and two dark fermion doublets (dark matter candidates in
this model). The dark sector interacts with the SM sector through kinetic and
mass mixing operators. The model explains both PAMELA and Fermi LAT data very
well and also satisfies constraints from both the DM relic density and Standard
Model precision observables. The phenomenology of the model at the LHC is also
explored.
