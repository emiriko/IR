Strongly correlated fermions in a crystal or in an optical lattice in the
presence of binary alloy disorder are investigated. We employ the statistical
dynamical mean-field theory, which incorporates both, local fluctuations due to
disorder and local correlations due to interaction, to solve the
Anderson-Hubbard model. Localization due to disorder is studied by means of the
probability distribution function of the local density of states. We obtain a
complete paramagnetic ground state phase diagram consisting of disordered
correlated metal, Anderson-Mott insulator, and band insulator.
