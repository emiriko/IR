The charged lepton flavour violating (LFV) radiative decays, $\mu\to
e+\gamma$, $\tau\to \mu+\gamma$ and $\tau\to e +\gamma$ are investigated in a
class of supersymmetric $A_4$ models with three heavy right-handed (RH)
Majorana neutrinos, in which the lepton (neutrino) mixing is predicted to
leading order (LO) to be tri-bimaximal. The light neutrino masses are generated
via the type I see-saw mechanism. The analysis is done within the framework of
the minimal supergravity (mSUGRA) scenario, which provides flavour universal
boundary conditions at the scale of grand unification $M_X \approx 2 \times
10^{16}$ GeV. Detailed predictions for the rates of the three LFV decays are
obtained in two explicit realisations of the $A_4$ models due to Altarelli and
Feruglio and Altarelli and Meloni, respectively.
