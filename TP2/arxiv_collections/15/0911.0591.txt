Based on a recent communication by the present authors the question of energy
dissipation in magneto hydrodynamical waves in an inflating background in
general relativity is examined. It is found that the expanding background
introduces a sort of dragging force on the propagating wave such that unlike
the Newtonnian case energy gets dissipated as it progresses. This loss in
energy having no special relativistic analogue is, however, not mechanical in
nature as in elastic wave. It is also found that the energy loss is model
dependent and also depends on the number of dimensions.
