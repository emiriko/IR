We study the plastic yielding of disordered media using the perfectly plastic
random fuse model. The yield surfaces are shown to be different from those
obtained minimizing the sum of the local yield thresholds, i.e. the so-called
minimum 'energy' surfaces. As a result, the global yield stress is lower than
expected from naive optimization and the difference persists as the sample size
increases. At variance with minimum energy surfaces, height-height fluctuations
of yield surfaces exhibit multiscaling. We provide a theoretical argument that
explains how this behavior arises from the very different nature of the
optimization problem in both cases.
