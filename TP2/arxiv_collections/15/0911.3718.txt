One of the possible types of n-th order ghost imaging is experimentally
performed using multi-photon (higher-order) intensity correlations of
pseudothermal light. It is shown that although increasing the order of
intensity correlations leads to the growth of ghost imaging visibility, it at
the same time reduces the signal-to-noise ratio. Therefore, ghost imaging with
thermal light is optimal in the second order in the intensity.
