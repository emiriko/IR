Under a thin lens and paraxial approximation, the phase transformation
function of a lens was simulated on a Liquid Crystal (LC) based Spatial Light
Modulator (SLM). The properties of an array of such lenses simulated on
transmitting type and reflecting type SLMs were investigated and the limits of
its operation in wavefront sensing applications are discussed.
