Wireless relaying is one of the promising solutions to overcome the channel
impairments and provide high data rate coverage that appears for beyond 3G
mobile communications. In this paper we present an end to end BER performance
analysis of dual hop wireless communication systems equipped with multiple
decode and forward relays over the Rayleigh fading channel with relay
selection. We select the best relay based on end to end channel conditions. We
apply orthogonal space time block coding (OSTBC) at source, and also present
how the multiple antennas at the source terminal affects the end to end BER
performance. This intermediate relay technique will cover long distance where
destination is out of reach from source.
