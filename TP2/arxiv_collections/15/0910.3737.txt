We report measurements of magnetoresistance in single-layer graphene as a
function of gate voltage (carrier density) at 250 mK. By examining signatures
of weak localization (WL) and universal conductance fluctuations (UCF), we find
a consistent picture of phase coherence loss due to electron-electron
interactions. The gate-dependence of the elastic scattering terms suggests that
the effect of trigonal warping, i.e., the non-linearity of the dispersion
curves, may be strong at high carrier densities, while intra-valley scattering
may dominate close to the Dirac point. In addition, a decrease in UCF amplitude
with decreasing carrier density can be explained by a corresponding loss of
phase coherence.
