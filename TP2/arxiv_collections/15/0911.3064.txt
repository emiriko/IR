On 2009 January 22 numerous strong bursts were detected from the anomalous
X-ray pulsar 1E 1547.0-5408. Swift/XRT and XMM-Newton/EPIC observations carried
out in the following two weeks led to the discovery of three X-ray rings
centered on this source. The ring radii increased with time following the
expansion law expected for a short impulse of X-rays scattered by three dust
clouds. Assuming different models for the dust composition and grain size
distribution, we fit the intensity decay of each ring as a function of time at
different energies, obtaining tight constrains on the distance of the X-ray
source. Although the distance strongly depends on the adopted dust model, we
find that some models are incompatible with our X-ray data, restricting to 4-8
kpc the range of possible distances for 1E 1547.0-5408. The best-fitting dust
model provides a source distance of 3.91 +/- 0.07 kpc, which is compatible with
the proposed association with the supernova remnant G 327.24-0.13, and implies
distances of 2.2 kpc, 2.6 kpc and 3.4 kpc for the dust clouds, in good
agreement with the dust distribution inferred by CO line observations towards
1E 1547.0-5408. However, dust distances in agreement with CO data are also
obtained for a set of similarly well-fitting models that imply a source
distance of about 5 kpc. A distance of about 4-5 kpc is also favored by the
fact that these dust models are already known to provide good fits to the
dust-scattering halos of bright X-ray binaries.
