We use the Dominant Reaction Pathway (DRP) approach to study the dynamics of
the folding of a beta-hairpin, within a model which accounts for both native
and non-native interactions. We compare the most probable folding pathways
calculated with the DRP method with those obtained directly from molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations. We find that the two approaches give completely
consistent results. We investigate the effects of the non-native hydrophobic
interactions on the folding dynamics found them to be small.
