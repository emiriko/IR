We use high-speed x-ray imaging to reveal how a small (~10cm) desert dwelling
lizard, the sandfish (Scincus scincus), swims within a granular medium [1]. On
the surface, the lizard uses a standard diagonal gait, but once below the
surface, the organism no longer uses limbs for propulsion. Instead it
propagates a large amplitude single period sinusoidal traveling wave down its
body and tail to propel itself at speeds up to ~1.5 body-length/sec. Motivated
by these experiments we study a numerical model of the sandfish as it swims
within a validated soft sphere Molecular Dynamics granular media simulation. We
use this model as a tool to understand dynamics like flow fields and forces
generated as the animal swims within the granular media.
