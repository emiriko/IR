This series of introductory lectures consists of two parts. In the first
part, I rapidly review the basic notions of quantum physics and many primitives
of quantum information (i.e. notions that one must be somehow familiar with in
the field, like cloning, teleportation, state estimation...). The second part
is devoted to a detailed introduction to the topic of quantum correlations,
covering the evidence for failure of alternative theories, some aspects of the
formalism of no-signaling probability distributions and some hints towards some
current research topics in the field.
