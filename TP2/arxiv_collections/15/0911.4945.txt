We present a new, close relation between column densities of OH and CH
molecules based on 16 translucent sightlines (six of them new) and confirm the
theoretical oscillator strengths of the OH A--X transitions at 3078 and 3082
\AA (0.00105, 0.000648) and CH B--X transitions at 3886 and 3890 \AA, (0.00320,
0.00210), respectively. We also report no difference between observed and
previously modelled abundances of the OH molecule.
