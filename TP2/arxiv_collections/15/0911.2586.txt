Invariant pT spectra and rapidity densities covering a large rapidity
range(-0.1 < y < 3.5) are presented for $\pi^{\pm}$ and $K^{\pm}$ mesons from
central Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 62.4 GeV. The mid-rapidity yields
of meson particles relative to their anti-particles are found to be close to
unity ($\pi^-/\pi^+ \sim 1$, $K^-/K^+ \sim 0.85$) while the anti-proton to
proton ratio is $\bar{p}/p \sim 0.49$. The rapidity dependence of the
$\pi^-/\pi^+$ ratio is consistent with a small increase towards forward
rapidities while the $K^-/K^+$ and $\bar{p}/p$ ratios show a steep decrease to
$\sim$ 0.3 for kaons and 0.022 for protons at $y\sim 3$. It is observed that
the kaon production relative to its own anti-particle as well as to pion
production in wide rapidity and energy ranges shows an apparent universal
behavior consistent with the baryo-chemical potential, as deduced from the
$\bar{p}/p$ ratio, being the driving parameter.
