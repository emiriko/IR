Positivity constraints on the LECs of $\cO(p^6)$ $\chi$PT lagrangian are
discussed. We demonstrate that the constraints are automatically satisfied
inside the Mandelstam triangle for $\pi\pi$ scatterings, when $N_C$ is large.
Numerical tests are made in the $N_C=3$ case, and it is found that these
constraints are also well respected.
