QPACE is a novel parallel computer which has been developed to be primarily
used for lattice QCD simulations. The compute power is provided by the IBM
PowerXCell 8i processor, an enhanced version of the Cell processor that is used
in the Playstation 3. The QPACE nodes are interconnected by a custom,
application optimized 3-dimensional torus network implemented on an FPGA. To
achieve the very high packaging density of 26 TFlops per rack a new water
cooling concept has been developed and successfully realized. In this paper we
give an overview of the architecture and highlight some important technical
details of the system. Furthermore, we provide initial performance results and
report on the installation of 8 QPACE racks providing an aggregate peak
performance of 200 TFlops.
