We present 25 arcsecond resolution radio images of five Lynds Dark Nebulae
(L675, L944, L1103, L1111 & L1246) at 16 GHz made with the Arcminute
Microkelvin Imager (AMI) Large Array. These objects were previously observed
with the AMI Small Array to have an excess of emission at microwave frequencies
relative to lower frequency radio data. In L675 we find a flat spectrum compact
radio counterpart to the 850 micron emission seen with SCUBA and suggest that
it is cm-wave emission from a previously unknown deeply embedded young
protostar. In the case of L1246 the cm-wave emission is spatially correlated
with 8 micron emission seen with Spitzer. Since the MIR emission is present
only in Spitzer band 4 we suggest that it arises from a population of PAH
molecules, which also give rise to the cm-wave emission through spinning dust
emission.
