The Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope reveals a diffuse inverse Compton signal
in the inner Galaxy with a similar spatial morphology to the microwave haze
observed by WMAP, supporting the synchrotron interpretation of the microwave
signal. Using spatial templates, we regress out pi0 gammas, as well as IC and
bremsstrahlung components associated with known soft-synchrotron counterparts.
We find a significant gamma-ray excess towards the Galactic center with a
spectrum that is significantly harder than other sky components and is most
consistent with IC from a hard population of electrons. The morphology and
spectrum are consistent with it being the IC counterpart to the electrons which
generate the microwave haze seen at WMAP frequencies. In addition, the implied
electron spectrum is hard; electrons accelerated in supernova shocks in the
disk which then diffuse a few kpc to the haze region would have a softer
spectrum. We describe the full sky Fermi maps used in this analysis and make
them available for download.
