We shall here consider extended theories of gravitation in the metric-affine
formalism with matter coupled directly to the connection. A sufficiently
general procedure will be exhibited to solve the resulting field equation
associated to the connection. As special cases one has the no-coupling case
(which is standard in f(R) literature) as well as the cases already analyzed in
ref.[1].
