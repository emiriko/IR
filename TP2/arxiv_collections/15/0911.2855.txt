Underground laboratories host two kind of experiments at the frontier of our
knowledge in Particle Physics, Astrophysics and Cosmology: the direct detection
of the Dark Matter of the Universe and the search for the Neutrinoless Double
Beta Decay of the nuclei. Both experimental quests pose great technical
challenges which are being addressed in different ways by an important number
of groups. Here a updated review of the efforts being done to detect Dark
Matter particles is presented, emphasizing latest achievements.
