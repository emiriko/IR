We present particulate simulation results for translational and rotational
friction components of a shish-kebab model of a colloidal rod with aspect ratio
(length over diameter) $L/D = 10$ in the presence of a planar hard wall.
Hydrodynamic interactions between rod and wall cause an overall enhancement of
the friction tensor components. We find that the friction enhancements to
reasonable approximation scale inversely linear with the closest distance $d$
between the rod surface and the wall, for $d$ in the range between $D/8$ and
$L$. The dependence of the wall-induced friction on the angle $\theta$ between
the long axis of the rod and the normal to the wall is studied and fitted with
simple polynomials in $\cos \theta$.
