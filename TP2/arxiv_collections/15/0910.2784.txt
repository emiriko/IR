Using both perturbation theory in the Euclidean formalism as well as the
non-perturbative Fujikawa's method, we verify that the chiral anomaly equation
remains unaffected in continuum QCD in the presence of nonzero chemical
potential, \mu. We extend our considerations to lattice fermions with exact
chiral symmetry and discuss the consequences for the recent Bloch-Wettig
proposal for the Dirac operator at finite chemical potential. We propose a new
simpler method of incorporating \mu.
