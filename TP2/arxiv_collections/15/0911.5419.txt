Kaluza-Klein (KK) black hole solutions in the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB)
gravity in $D$ dimensions obtained in the current series of the works by Maeda,
Dadhich and Molina are examined. Interpreting their solutions, the authors
claim that the mass/matter is created by the extra dimensions. To support this
claim, one needs to show that such objects have classically defined masses. We
calculate the mass and mass flux for 3D KK black holes in 6D EGB gravity whose
properties are sufficiently physically interesting. Superpotentials for
arbitrary types of perturbations on arbitrary curved backgrounds, recently
obtained by the author, are used, and acceptable mass and mass flux are
obtained. A possibility of considering the KK created matter as dark matter in
the Universe is discussed.
