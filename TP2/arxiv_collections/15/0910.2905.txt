We complete our high-accuracy studies of the lattice ghost propagator in
Landau gauge in Numerical Stochastic Perturbation Theory up to three loops. We
present a systematic strategy which allows to extract with sufficient precision
the non-logarithmic parts of logarithmically divergent quantities as a function
of the propagator momentum squared in the infinite-volume and $a\to 0$ limits.
We find accurate coincidence with the one-loop result for the ghost self-energy
known from standard Lattice Perturbation Theory and improve our previous
estimate for the two-loop constant contribution to the ghost self-energy in
Landau gauge. Our results for the perturbative ghost propagator are compared
with Monte Carlo measurements of the ghost propagator performed by the Berlin
Humboldt university group which has used the exponential relation between
potentials and gauge links.
