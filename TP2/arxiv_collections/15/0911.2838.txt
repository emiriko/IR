The statefinder diagnosic is a useful method for distinguishing different
dark energy models. In this paper, we investigate the new agegraphic dark
energy model with interaction between dark energy and matter component by using
statefinder parameter pair $\{r, s\}$ and study its cosmological evolution. We
plot the trajectories of the new agegraphic dark energy model for different
interaction cases in the statefinder plane. As a result, the influence of the
interaction on the evolution of the universe is shown in the statefinder
diagrams.
