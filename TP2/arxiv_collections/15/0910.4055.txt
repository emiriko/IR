We investigate the time evolution of the density of kinks in the spin-1/2
quantum Ising spin chain after a sudden quench in the transverse field
strength, and find that it relaxes to a value which depends on the initial and
the final values of the transverse field, with an oscillating power-law decay.
We provide analytical estimates of the long-time behavior and of the asymptotic
value reached after complete relaxation, and discuss the role of quantum
criticality in the quench dynamics. We show that, for a dynamics at the
critical point, the residual density of kinks after the quench can be described
by equilibrium statistical mechanics at a finite temperature dictated by the
energy of the state after the quench. On the other hand, outside of criticality
it does not exhibit thermalization.
