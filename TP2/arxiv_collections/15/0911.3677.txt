We analyze the left-right asymmetry in the semi-inclusive deep inelastic
scattering (SIDIS) process without introducing any weighting functions. With
the current theoretical understanding, we find that the Sivers effect plays a
key role in our analysis. We use the latest parametrization of the Sivers and
fragmentation functions to reanalyze the $\pi^\pm$ production process and find
that the results are sensitive to the parametrization. We also extend our
calculation on the $K^{\pm}$ production, which can help us know more about the
Sivers distribution of the sea quarks and the unfavored fragmentation
processes. HERMES kinematics with a proton target, COMPASS kinematics with a
proton, deuteron, and neutron target (the information on the neutron target can
be effectively extracted from the $^3$He target), and JLab kinematics (both 6
GeV and 12 GeV) with a proton and neutron target are considered in our paper.
