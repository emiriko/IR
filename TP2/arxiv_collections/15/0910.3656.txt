We examine current numerical relativity computations of gravitational waves,
which typically determine the asymptotic waves at infinity by extrapolation
from finite (small) radii. Using simulations of a black hole binary with
accurate wave extraction at $r=1000M$, we show that extrapolations from the
near-zone are self-consistent in approximating measurements at this radius,
although with a somewhat reduced accuracy. We verify that $\psi_4$ is the
dominant asymptotic contribution to the gravitational energy (as required by
the peeling theorem) but point out that gauge effects may complicate the
interpretation of the other Weyl components.
