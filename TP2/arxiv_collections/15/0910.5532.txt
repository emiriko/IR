We present an update of the light meson spectrum with $N_f$=2+1 overlap
fermions on a $16^3\times 48$ lattice at five different up and down quark
masses and two strange quark masses. Based on our experience with the previous
simulation with $N_f=2$, we carry out the chiral extrapolation with the
prediction of the chiral perturbation theory at the next-to-next-to leading
order. We also check the consistency of our analysis by using alternative
chiral extrapolation with a reduced theory in which the strange quark mass is
integrated out.
