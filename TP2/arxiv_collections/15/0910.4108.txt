The broad Balmer emission-line profiles resulting from the reprocessing of
UV/X-ray radiation from a warped accretion disc induced by the
Bardeen-Petterson effect are studied. We adopt a thin warped disc geometry and
a central ring-like illuminating source in our model. We compute the
steady-state shape of the warped disc numerically, and then use it in the
calculation of the line profile. We find that, from the outer radius to the
inner radius of the disc, the warp is twisted by an angle of $\sim\pi$ before
being flattened efficiently into the equatorial plane. The profiles obtained
depend weakly on the illuminating source radius in the range from $3r_{g}$ to
$10r_g$, but depend strongly on this radius when it approaches the marginally
stable orbit of an extreme Kerr black hole. Double- or triplet-peaked line
profiles are present in most cases when the illuminating source radius is low.
The triplet-peaked line profiles observed from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey may
be a {"}signature" of a warped disc.
