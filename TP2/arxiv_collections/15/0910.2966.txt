We present the latest preliminary results of the MILC collaboration's
analysis of the light pseudoscalar meson sector. The analysis includes data
from new ensembles with smaller lattice spacings, smaller light quark masses
and lighter-than-physical strange quark masses. Both SU(2) and SU(3) chiral
fits, including NNLO chiral logarithms, are shown. We give results for decay
constants, quark masses, Gasser-Leutwyler low energy constants, and condensates
in the two- and three-flavor chiral limits.
