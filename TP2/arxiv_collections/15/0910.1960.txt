When a space in which Christoffel symbols of the second kind are symmetrical
in lower indices exists, it makes for a supplement to the standard procedure
when a 2D surface is normally induced from the geometry of the surrounding 3D
space in which the surface is embedded. There it appears appropriate to use a
scheme for straightforward permutation of indices of Gkij, when such a space
would make this transformation possible, so as to obtain the components of the
2D Riemann-Christoffel tensor (here expressed in geodetic coordinates for an
ellipsoid of revolution, of use in geophysics). By applying my scheme I find
the corresponding indices in 2D and 3D supplement-spaces, and I compute
components of the Riemann-Christoffel tensor. By operating over the elements of
the projections alone, the all-known value of 1/MN for the Gaussian curvature
on an ellipsoid of revolution is obtained. To further validate my scheme, I
show that in such a 3D space the tangent vector to a PHI-curve for LAM=const1
would be parallel to a tangent vector to a PHI-curve for LAM=const2 on the
surface of an ellipsoid of revolution. Surfaces parameterized by Gauss surface
normal coordinates, such as the Earth, now can have the Riemann-Christopher
curvature tensor computed in a straightforward fashion for the topographic
surface hel(PHIel, LAMel) of the Earth, given Christoffel symbols for such a
representation in terms of orthonormal functions on the ellipsoid of
revolution.
