We investigate the chiral magnetic effect (CME) under a strong magnetic field
B = B_0 x_3 at low temperature T < T^chi_c. For this purpose, we employ the
instanton vacuum configuration with the finite instanton-number fluctuation
Delta, which relates to the nontrivial topological charge Q_t. We compute the
vacuum expectation values of the local chiral density <rho_chi>, chiral charge
density <n_chi> and induced electromagnetic current <j_mu>, which signal the
CME, as functions of T and B_0. We observed that the longitudinal EM current is
much larger than the transverse one, |j_perp/j_parallel| ~ Q_t, and the <n_chi>
equals to the |<j_{3,4}>|. It also turns out that the CME becomes insensitive
to the magnetic field as T increases, according to the decreasing instanton,
i.e. tunneling effect. Within our framework, the instanton contribution to the
CME becomes almost negligible beyond T~300 MeV.
