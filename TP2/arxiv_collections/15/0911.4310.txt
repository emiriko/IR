Given an experimental set-up and a fixed number of measurements, how should
one take data in order to optimally reconstruct the state of a quantum system?
The problem of optimal experiment design (OED) for quantum state tomography was
first broached by Kosut et al. [arXiv:quant-ph/0411093v1]. Here we provide
efficient numerical algorithms for finding the optimal design, and analytic
results for the case of 'minimal tomography'. We also introduce the average
OED, which is independent of the state to be reconstructed, and the optimal
design for tomography (ODT), which minimizes tomographic bias. We find that
these two designs are generally similar. Monte-Carlo simulations confirm the
utility of our results for qubits. Finally, we adapt our approach to deal with
constrained techniques such as maximum likelihood estimation. We find that
these are less amenable to optimization than cruder reconstruction methods,
such as linear inversion.
