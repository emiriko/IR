We review the caloron correspondence between $G$-bundles on $M \times S^1$
and $\Omega G$-bundles on $M$, where $\Omega G$ is the space of smooth loops in
the compact Lie group $G$. We use the caloron correspondence to define
characteristic classes for $\Omega G$-bundles, called string classes, by
transgression of characteristic classes of $G$-bundles. These generalise the
string class of Killingback to higher dimensional cohomology.
