We estimate sensitivity coefficients to variation of the fine-structure
constant alpha and electron-to-proton mass ratio mu for microwave Lambda-type
transitions in CH molecule and for inversion-rotational transitions in partly
deuterated ammonia NH2D. Sensitivity coefficients for these systems are large
and strongly depend on the quantum numbers of the transition. This can be used
for the search for possible variation of alpha and mu.
