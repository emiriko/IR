The microscopic center-of-mass (c.m.) correction energies for nuclei ranging
from Oxygen to Calcium are systematically calculated by both spherical and
axially deformed relativistic mean-field (RMF) models with the effective
interaction PK1. The microscopic c.m. correction energies strongly depend on
the isospin as well as deformation and deviate from the phenomenological ones.
The deformation effect is discussed in detail by comparing the deformed with
the spherical RMF calculation. It is found that the direct and exchange terms
of the c.m. correction energies are strongly correlated with the density
distribution of nuclei and are suppressed in the deformed case.
