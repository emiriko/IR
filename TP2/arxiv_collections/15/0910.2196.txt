The pondermotive potential in the X-ray Raman compression can generate an
electron band gap which suppresses the Landau damping. The regime is identified
where a Langmuir wave can be driven without damping in the stimulated Raman
compression. It is shown that the partial wave breaking and the frequency
detuning due to the trapped particles would be greatly reduced.
