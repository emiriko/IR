From sand piles to electrons in metals, one of the greatest challenges in
modern physics is to understand the behavior of an ensemble of strongly
interacting particles. A class of quantum many-body systems such as neutron
matter and cold Fermi gases share the same universal thermodynamic properties
when interactions reach the maximum effective value allowed by quantum
mechanics, the so-called unitary limit [1,2]. It is then possible to simulate
some astrophysical phenomena inside the highly controlled environment of an
atomic physics laboratory. Previous work on the thermodynamics of a
two-component Fermi gas led to thermodynamic quantities averaged over the trap
[3-5], making it difficult to compare with many-body theories developed for
uniform gases. Here we develop a general method that provides for the first
time the equation of state of a uniform gas, as well as a detailed comparison
with existing theories [6,14]. The precision of our equation of state leads to
new physical insights on the unitary gas. For the unpolarized gas, we prove
that the low-temperature thermodynamics of the strongly interacting normal
phase is well described by Fermi liquid theory and we localize the superfluid
transition. For a spin-polarized system, our equation of state at zero
temperature has a 2% accuracy and it extends the work of [15] on the phase
diagram to a new regime of precision. We show in particular that, despite
strong correlations, the normal phase behaves as a mixture of two ideal gases:
a Fermi gas of bare majority atoms and a non-interacting gas of dressed
quasi-particles, the fermionic polarons [10,16-18].
