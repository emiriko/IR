We analyze effects of squeezing upon superpositions of coherent states (SCSs)
and entangled coherent states (ECSs) for Bell-inequality tests. We find that
external squeezing can always increase the degrees of Bell violations, if the
squeezing direction is properly chosen, for the case of photon parity
measurements. On the other hand, when photon on/off measurements are used, the
squeezing operation can enhance the degree of Bell violations only for moderate
values of amplitudes and squeezing. We point out that a significant improvement
is required over currently available squeezed SCSs in order to directly
demonstrate a Bell-inequality violation in a real experiment.
