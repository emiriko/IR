The Transit Timing Variation (TTV) method relies on monitoring changes in
timing of transits of known exoplanets. Non-transiting planets in the system
can be inferred from TTVs by their gravitational interaction with the
transiting planet. The TTV method is sensitive to low-mass planets that cannot
be detected by other means. Here we describe a fast algorithm that can be used
to determine the mass and orbit of the non-transiting planets from the TTV
data. We apply our code, ttvim.f, to a wide variety of planetary systems to
test the uniqueness of the TTV inversion problem and its dependence on the
precision of TTV observations. We find that planetary parameters, including the
mass and mutual orbital inclination of planets, can be determined from the TTV
datasets that should become available in near future. Unlike the radial
velocity technique, the TTV method can therefore be used to characterize the
inclination distribution of multi-planet systems.
