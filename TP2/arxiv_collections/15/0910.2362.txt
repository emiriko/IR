Magnetically confined plasmas are often subject to relaxation oscillations
accompanied by large transport events. This is particularly the case for the
high confinement regime of tokamaks where these events are termed edge
localized modes (ELMs). They result in the temporary breakdown of the high
confinement and lead to high power loads on plasma facing components. Present
theories of ELM generation rely on a combined effect of edge currents and the
edge pressure gradient exceeding critical values which result in intermediate
mode number ($n \cong 10-15$) structures (\emph{filaments}) localized in the
perpendicular plane and extended along the field line. It is shown here by
detailed localized measurements of the three components of the magnetic field
perturbation carried by an individual type I ELM filament that these filaments
carry a substantial current. The observations provide essential information for
the understanding of ELM dynamics.
