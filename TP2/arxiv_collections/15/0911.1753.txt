We propose an extension of the hypothesis of Minimal Flavour Violation (MFV)
to general multi-Higgs Models without the assumption of Natural Flavour
Conservation in the Higgs sector. We study in detail under what conditions the
neutral Higgs couplings are only functions of $V_{CKM}$ and propose a MFV
expansion for the neutral Higgs couplings to fermions.
