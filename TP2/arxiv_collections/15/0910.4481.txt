We compute the one-loop amplitude for a Higgs boson, a quark-antiquark pair
and a pair of gluons of negative helicity, i.e. for the next-to-maximally
helicity violating (NMHV) case, A(H, qbar-, q+, g-, g-). The calculation is
performed using an effective Lagrangian which is valid in the limit of very
large top quark mass. As a result of this paper all amplitudes for the
transition of a Higgs boson into 4 partons are now known analytically at
one-loop order.
