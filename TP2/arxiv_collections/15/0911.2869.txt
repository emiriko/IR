In this work we analyse the possibility of constraining the QCD dynamics at
high energies studying the heavy quark photoproduction at LHC in coherent
interactions. The rapidity distribution and total cross section for charm and
bottom production are estimated using three different phenomenological
saturation models which successfully describe the HERA data. Our results
indicate that the experimental study of the inclusive heavy quark
photoproduction can be very useful to discriminate between the classical and
quantum versions of the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) formalism.
