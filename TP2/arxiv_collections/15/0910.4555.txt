We consider some questions about formal languages that arise when inverses of
letters, words and languages are defined. The reduced representation of a
language over the free monoid is its unique equivalent representation in the
free group. We show that the class of regular languages is closed under taking
the reduced representation, while the class of context-free languages is not.
We also give an upper bound on the state complexity of the reduced
representation of a regular language, and prove upper and lower bounds on the
length of the shortest reducible string in a regular language. Finally we show
that the set of all words which are equivalent to the words in a regular
language can be nonregular, and that regular languages are not closed under
taking a generalized form of the reduced representation.
