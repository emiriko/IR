We present results on the scalar strangeness and charm contents of the
nucleon and of the disconnected contributions to the nucleon spin. These are
obtained on two flavour non-perturbatively improved Sheikholeslami-Wilson
configurations at a pseudoscalar mass of 290 MeV. We quote f_{T_s} =
m_s<N|ss|N>/m_N< = 0.070(22) as our preliminary value for the strange quark
fraction of the nucleon mass and a modified minimal subtraction scheme value
Delta s = -0.015(10), with as yet unknown systematics, for the strangeness
contribution to the spin.
