We calculate the amplitude of the de Broglie gravitational waves using the
standard Einstein General Relativity. We find that these waves disappear in the
limit $\hbar \to 0$ and when their source has a large mass and volume. From the
experimental point of view, the knowledge of the amplitude allows to estimate
the magnitude of the effect of the wave on a sphere of test particles. We
propose also to measure a very special shift angle that does not change with
time.
