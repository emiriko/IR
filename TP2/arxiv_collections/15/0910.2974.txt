The one dimensional quantum walk of anyonic systems is presented. The anyonic
walker performs braiding operations with stationary anyons of the same type
ordered canonically on the line of the walk. Abelian as well as non-Abelian
anyons are studied and it is shown that they have very different properties.
Abelian anyonic walks demonstrate the expected quadratic quantum speedup.
Non-Abelian anyonic walks are much more subtle. The exponential increase of the
system's Hilbert space and the particular statistical evolution of non-Abelian
anyons give a variety of new behaviors. The position distribution of the walker
is related to Jones polynomials, topological invariants of the links created by
the anyonic world-lines during the walk. Several examples such as the SU(2)
level k and the quantum double models are considered that provide insight to
the rich diffusion properties of anyons.
