We prove that the deformation space AH(M) of marked hyperbolic 3-manifolds
homotopy equivalent to a fixed compact 3-manifold M with incompressible
boundary is locally connected at minimally parabolic points. Moreover, spaces
of Kleinian surface groups are locally connected at quasiconformally rigid
points. Similar results are obtained for deformation spaces of acylindrical
3-manifolds and Bers slices.
