An antiferro-magnetic (AF) low moment solution, 0.4 $\mu_\mathrm{B}$/Fe, is
found in the case of LaOFeAs for an intermediately strong Coulomb interaction
$U$ of 2.5--3.0 eV. This solution is stabilized over a large moment solution
due to the gain in exchange energy in the formation of large multipoles of the
spin magnetization density. The multipoles are of rank four and can be
understand as a kind of spin-orbital ordering. Parallels can be drawn to the
stabilization of the AF order in e.g. CaCuO$_2$.
