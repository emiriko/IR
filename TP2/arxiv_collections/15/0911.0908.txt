Motivated by the recent detection of stochastically excited modes in the
massive star V1449 Aql (Belkacem et al., 2009b), already known to be a $\beta$
Cephei, we theoretically investigate the driving by turbulent convection. By
using a full non-adiabatic computation of the damping rates, together with a
computation of the energy injection rates, we provide an estimate of the
amplitudes of modes excited by both the convective region induced by the iron
opacity bump and the convective core. Despite uncertainties in the dynamical
properties of such convective regions, we demonstrate that both are able to
efficiently excite $p$ modes above the CoRoT observational threshold and the
solar amplitudes. In addition, we emphasise the potential asteroseismic
diagnostics provided by each convective region, which we hope will help to
identify the one responsible for solar-like oscillations, and to give
constraints on this convective zone. A forthcoming work will be dedicated to an
extended investigation of the likelihood of solar-like oscillations across the
Hertzsprung-Russell diagram.
