We report the discovery of four very bright, strongly-lensed galaxies found
via systematic searches for arcs in Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 5 and
6. These were followed-up with spectroscopy and imaging data from the
Astrophysical Research Consortium 3.5m telescope at Apache Point Observatory
and found to have redshift $z>2.0$. With isophotal magnitudes $r = 19.2 - 20.4$
and $3\arcsec$-diameter magnitudes $r = 20.0 - 20.6$, these systems are some of
the brightest and highest surface brightness lensed galaxies known in this
redshift range. In addition to the magnitudes and redshifts, we present
estimates of the Einstein radii, which range from $5.0 \arcsec$ to $12.7
\arcsec$, and use those to derive the enclosed masses of the lensing galaxies.
