Motivated by the phenomenological scenario of the chiral magnetic effect that
can be possibly found in high-energy heavy ion collisions, we study the role of
very intense magnetic fields and strong CP violation in the phase structure of
strong interactions and, more specifically, their influence on the nature of
the chiral transition. Direct implications for the dynamics of phase conversion
and its time scales are briefly discussed. Our results can also be relevant in
the case of the early universe.
