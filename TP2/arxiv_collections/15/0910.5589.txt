Extended vector meson dominance model, that allows to describe the
electromagnetic form factors of nucleons obeying the asymptotic quark counting
rule prescriptions and contains the minimal number of free parameters, is
presented. We get a reasonable fit of form factors over experimentally
available space-like region of momentum transfer and get also reasonable
results in the time-like region.
