The first parts of the thesis recalls the main features of the large MACRO
experiment at the underground Gran Sasso Laboratory. It then describes the
atmospheric muons measured by the experiment and the selection criteria to
obtain and analyze a large sample of cosmic muons. The time series of MACRO
muons was analyzed with two complementary approaches: search for the occurrence
of bursts of muon events and search for periodicities in the muon time
distribution. The Scan Statistics method was used in the first case and the
Lomb-Scargle spectral analysis in the second case. The two techniques complete
early analyses performed with "folding" methods. It is confirmed that the
seasonal variation is the dominant periodic variation, and one also confirms
the solar diurnal and sidereal modulations. A separate study concerns the
analysis of the energy losses of the hypothetical Nuclearites in different
materials and detectors; their importance for the searches performed by the
MACRO and the SLIM experiments is discussed.
