We have studied the sensitivity of the ATLAS detector for supersymmetric
neutralino signals in the $Z\gamma +\notE_{T}$ final state in a GMSB model in
which the Higgsino-like neutralino is NLSP. This study considers the reaction
of $pp \ra \tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1} \tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1} \ra Z(\ra
\ell^{+}\ell^{-})\gamma \tilde{G}\tilde{G}$, where $\ell = \mu/e$, at a center
of mass energy of $\sqrt{s}$=10 \TeV using fully simulated ATLAS Monte Carlo
events both for the signal and background. Based on the GMSB Model Line E
predictions, we expect that, for an integrated luminosity of less then 3
fb$^{-1}$, ATLAS could detect the GMSB signal from the Higgsino-like neutralino
that has a mass of 134.7 \GeV in the $Z\gamma +\notE_{T}$ final state with a
significance of 5$\sigma$, assuming 20% systematic uncertainty.
