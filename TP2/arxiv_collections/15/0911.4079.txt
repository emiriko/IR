Boozer addressed the role of magnetic helicity in dynamos [Phys Fluids
\textbf{B},(1993)]. He pointed out that the magnetic helicity conservation
implies that the dynamo action is more easily attainable if the electric
potential varies over the surface of the dynamo. This provided us with
motivation to investigate dynamos in Riemannian curved surfaces [Phys Plasmas
\textbf{14}, (2007);\textbf{15} (2008)]. Thiffeault and Boozer [Phys Plasmas
(2003)] discussed the onset of dissipation in kinematic dynamos. When curvature
is constant and negative, a simple simple laminar dynamo solution is obtained
on the flow topology of a Poincare disk, whose Gauss curvature is $K=-1$. By
considering a laminar plasma dynamo [Wang et al, Phys Plasmas (2002)] the
electric current helicity ${\lambda}\approx{2.34m^{-1}}$ for a Reynolds
magnetic number of $Rm\approx{210}$ and a growth rate of magnetic field
$|{\gamma}|\approx{0.022}$. Negative constant curvature non-compact
$\textbf{H}^{2}$, has also been used in one-component electron 2D plasma by
Fantoni and Tellez (Stat Phys, (2008)). Chicone et al (CMP (1997)) showed fast
dynamos can be supported in compact $\textbf{H}^{2}$. PACS: 47.65.Md. Key-word:
