During autumn 2008, the Silicon Strip Tracker was operated with the full CMS
experiment in a comprehensive test, in the presence of the 3.8 T magnetic field
produced by the CMS superconducting solenoid. Cosmic ray muons were detected in
the muon chambers and used to trigger the readout of all CMS sub-detectors.
About 15 million events with a muon in the tracker were collected. The
efficiency of hit and track reconstruction were measured to be higher than 99%
and consistent with expectations from Monte Carlo simulation. This article
details the commissioning and performance of the Silicon Strip Tracker with
cosmic ray muons.
