We analyze a system consisting of two spatially separated quantum objects,
here modeled as two pseudo-spins, coupled with a mesoscopic environment modeled
as a bosonic bath. We show that by engineering either the dispersion of the
spin boson coupling or the environment dimensionality or both one can in
principle tailor the spatial dependence of the induced entanglement on the
spatial separation between the two spins. In particular we consider one, two
and three dimensional reservoirs and we find that while for a two or three
dimensional reservoir the induced entanglement shows an inverse power law
dependence on the spin separation, the induced entanglement becomes separation
independent for a one dimensional reservoir.
