We determine the statistics of the local tube width in F-actin solutions,
beyond the usually reported mean value. Our experimental observations are
explained by a segment fluid theory based on the binary collision approximation
(BCA). In this systematic generalization of the standard mean-field approach
effective polymer segments interact via a potential representing the
topological constraints. The analytically predicted universal tube width
distribution with a stretched tail is in good agreement with the data.
