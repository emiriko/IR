Results from new HI synthesis observations of the nearby blue compact dwarf
galaxy, NGC 2915, carried out on the Australian Telescope Compact Array are
presented. High resolution HI moment maps for the galaxy reveal complex HI
distributions and kinematics. The presence of large non-circular velocity
components within the gas at inner radii is revealed. The central gas dynamics
are consistent with the simple scenario in which winds from high-mass stars are
expelling the gas outwards from the centre of the galaxy. A model in which the
central region is treated as a rotating, expanding gas torus is able to
reproduce the inner HI morphology and kinematics of NGC 2915. We also find
intriguing evidence for a gas infall event which, if confirmed, would be the
first such evidence for a low-mass system.
