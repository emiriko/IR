A theory is developed for the paired even-denominator fractional quantum Hall
states in the lowest Landau level. We show that electrons bind to quantized
vortices to form composite fermions, interacting through an exact instantaneous
interaction that favors chiral p-wave pairing. Two canonically dual pairing gap
functions are related by the bosonic Laughlin wavefunction (Jastraw factor) due
to the correlation holes. We find that the ground state is the Moore-Read
pfaffian in the long wavelength limit for weak Coulomb interactions, a new
pfaffian of an oscillatory pairing function for intermediate interactions, and
a Read-Rezayi composite Fermi liquid beyond a critical interaction strength.
Our findings are consistent with recent experimental observations of the 1/2
and 1/4 fractional quantum Hall effects in asymmetric wide quantum wells.
