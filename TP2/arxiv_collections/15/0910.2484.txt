The Spectrograph for Photometric Imaging with Numeric Reconstruction (SPINR)
sounding rocket experiment was launched on 2000 August 4 to record
far-ultraviolet (912-1450 A) spectral and spatial information for the giant
reflection nebula in the Upper Scorpius region. The data were divided into
three arbitrary bandpasses (912-1029 A, 1030-1200 A, and 1235-1450 A) for which
stellar and nebular flux levels were derived. These flux measurements were used
to constrain a radiative transfer model and to determine the dust albedo for
the Upper Scorpius region. The resulting albedos were 0.28+/-0.07 for the
912-1029 A bandpass, 0.33+/-0.07 for the 1030-1200 A bandpass, and 0.77+/-0.13
for the 1235-1450 A bandpass.
