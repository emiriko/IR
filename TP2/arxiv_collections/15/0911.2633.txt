The paper deals with quantum pulse position modulation (PPM), both in the
absence (pure states) and in the presence (mixed states) of thermal noise,
using the Glauber representation of coherent laser radiation. The objective is
to find optimal (or suboptimal) measurement operators and to evaluate the
corresponding error probability. For PPM, the correct formulation of quantum
states is given by the tensorial product of m identical Hilbert spaces, where m
is the PPM order. The presence of mixed states, due to thermal noise, generates
an optimization problem involving matrices of huge dimensions, which already
for 4-PPM, are of the order of ten thousand. To overcome this computational
complexity, the currently available methods of quantum detection, which are
based on explicit results, convex linear programming and square root
measurement, are compared to find the computationally less expensive one. In
this paper a fundamental role is played by the geometrically uniform symmetry
of the quantum PPM format. The evaluation of error probability confirms the
vast superiority of the quantum detection over its classical counterpart.
