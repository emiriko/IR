Nonlinear water waves interacting with quasi-one-dimensional, non-uniformly
periodic bed profiles are studied numerically in the deep-water regime with the
help of approximate equations for envelopes of the forward and backward waves.
Spontaneous formation of localized two-dimensional wave structures is observed
in the numerical experiments, which looks essentially as a wave collapse.
