Existing theory and models suggest that a Type I (merger) GRB should have a
larger jet beaming angle than a Type II (collapsar) GRB, but so far no
statistical evidence is available to support this suggestion. In this paper, we
obtain a sample of 37 beaming angles and calculate the probability that this is
true. A correction is also devised to account for the scarcity of Type I GRBs
in our sample. The probability is calculated to be 83% without the correction
and 71% with it.
