We explore the implications of electroweak baryogenesis for future searches
for permanent electric dipole moments in the context of the minimal
supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model (MSSM). From a cosmological
standpoint, we point out that regions of parameter space that over-produce
relic lightest supersymmetric particles can be salvaged only by assuming a
dilution of the particle relic density that makes it compatible with the dark
matter density: this dilution must occur after dark matter freeze-out, which
ordinarily takes place after electroweak baryogenesis, implying the same degree
of dilution for the generated baryon number density as well. We expand on
previous studies on the viable MSSM regions for baryogenesis, exploring for the
first time an orthogonal slice of the relevant parameter space, namely the
(tan\beta, m_A) plane, and the case of non-universal relative gaugino-higgsino
CP violating phases. The main result of our study is that in all cases lower
limits on the size of the electric dipole moments exist, and are typically on
the same order, or above, the expected sensitivity of the next generation of
experimental searches, implying that MSSM electroweak baryogenesis will be soon
conclusively tested.
