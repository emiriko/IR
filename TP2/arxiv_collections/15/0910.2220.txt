Lie antialgebras is a class of supercommutative algebras recently appeared in
symplectic geometry. We define the notion of enveloping algebra of a Lie
antialgebra and study its properties. We show that every Lie antialgebra is
canonically related to a Lie superalgebra and prove that its enveloping algebra
is a quotient of the enveloping algebra of the corresponding Lie superalgebra.
