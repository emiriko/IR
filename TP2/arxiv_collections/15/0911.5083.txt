We propose a minimal mathematical model to explain long-range coordination of
dynamics of multiple cells in epithelial spreading, which may be induced, under
different conditions, by a chemical signal, or mechanical stress, or both. The
model is based on chemo-mechanical interactions including a chemical effect of
stress and concentration-dependent traction. The results, showing kinase
concentration distribution and cell displacement, allow us to reproduce two
activation waves on different time scales observed in the experiment, and
distinguish between distinct dynamical patterns observed under conditions of
injury or unconstraining.
