In this paper, current-induced spin polarization for two-dimensional electron
gas with a general spin-orbit interaction is investigated. For isotropic energy
spectrum, the in-plane current-induced spin polarization is found to be
dependent on the electron density for non-linear spin-orbit interaction and
increases with the increment of sheet density, in contrast to the case for $\bm
k$-linear spin-orbit coupling model. The numerical evaluation is performed for
InAs/InSb heterojunction with spin-orbit coupling of both linear and cubic
spin-orbit coupling types. For $\delta$-type short-range electron-impurity
scattering, it is found that the current-induced spin polarization increases
with increasing the density when cubic spin-orbit couplings are considered.
However, for remote disorders, a rapid enhancement of current-induced spin
polarization is always observed at high electron density, even in the case
without cubic spin-orbit coupling. This result demonstrates the
collision-related feature of current-induced spin polarization. The effects of
different high order spin-orbit couplings on spin polarization can be
comparable.
