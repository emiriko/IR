We search for stars with proper motions in a set of deep Subaru images,
covering about 0.48 square degrees to a depth of $i' \simeq 26$, taken over a
span of five and a half years. We follow the methods described in
\citet{Richmond2009} to reduce and analyze this dataset. We present a sample of
69 stars with motions of high significance, and discuss briefly the populations
from which they are likely drawn. Based on photometry and motions alone, we
expect that 14 of the candidates may be white dwarfs. Our candidate with the
largest proper motion is surprisingly faint and likely to prove interesting:
its colors and motions suggest that it might be an M dwarf moving at over 500
km/sec or an L dwarf in the halo.
