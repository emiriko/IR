The computational complexity of time-dependent perturbation theory is
well-known to be largely combinatorial whatever the chosen expansion method and
family of parameters (combinatorial sequences, Goldstone and other Feynman-type
diagrams...). We show that a very efficient perturbative expansion, both for
theoretical and numerical purposes, can be obtained through an original
parametrization by trees and generalized iterated integrals. We emphasize above
all the simplicity and naturality of the new approach that links perturbation
theory with classical and recent results in enumerative and algebraic
combinatorics. These tools are applied to the adiabatic approximation and the
effective Hamiltonian. We prove perturbatively and non-perturbatively the
convergence of Morita's generalization of the Gell-Mann and Low wavefunction.
We show that summing all the terms associated to the same tree leads to an
utter simplification where the sum is simpler than any of its terms. Finally,
we recover the time-independent equation for the wave operator and we give an
explicit non-recursive expression for the term corresponding to an arbitrary
tree.
