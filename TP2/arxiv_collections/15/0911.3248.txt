The lower bound of the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio is examined
using an exact representation of the ratio through the density of states. It is
shown that the lower bound in a generic physical system is not universal, its
value is determined by the entropy density. Some examples of physical systems
are discussed in the paper where one can expect violation of the conformal
1/4pi value.
