Monte Carlo renormalization group methods were designed to study the phase
structure and critical behavior of statistical systems. They are well suited to
determine the running coupling and to investigate the properties of fixed
points of gauge-fermion models, including the existence of conformal infrared
fixed points in many-fermion systems. I discuss the implementation of the
2-lattice matching method and present results for SU(3) gauge theories with
N_f=0,12 and 16 fundamental fermion flavors.
