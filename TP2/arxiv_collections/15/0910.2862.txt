A negative bubble, coined antibubble, is composed by a thin air shell that is
immersed in a soapy mixture. A large vortex is generated in the liquid using a
mixer. An antibubble is then created close to the surface. The antibubble is
fastly attracted by the vortex. It rotates arount the core and comes closer and
closer. When the stress is large enough, the vortex deforms the antibubble that
winds around the eye vortex. The antibubble looks like a spiral. Under some
conditions, the antibubble splits into several antibubbles that are ejected out
of the eye vortex while the largest part is still trapped the vortex. This
latter is elongated and is absorbed to the bottom of the tank before popping.
