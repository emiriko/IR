We report a moderate-depth (70 ksec), contiguous 0.7 sq.deg, Chandra survey,
in the Lockman Hole Field of the Spitzer/SWIRE Legacy Survey coincident with a
completed, ultra-deep VLA survey with deep optical and near-infrared imaging
in-hand. The primary motivation is to distinguish starburst galaxies and AGN,
including the significant, highly obscured (log N_H >23) subset. Chandra has
detected 775 X-ray sources to a limiting broad band (0.3-8 keV) flux ~4E-16
erg/cm^2/s. We present the X-ray catalog, fluxes, hardness ratios and
multi-wavelength fluxes. The log N vs. log S agrees with those of previous
surveys covering similar flux ranges. The Chandra and Spitzer flux limits are
well matched: 771 (99%) of the X-ray sources have IR or optical counterparts,
and 333 have MIPS 24 um detections. There are 4 optical-only X-ray sources and
4 with no visible optical/IR counterpart. The very deep (~2.7 uJy rms) VLA data
yields 251 (> 4 sigma) radio counterparts, 44% of the X-ray sources in the
field. We confirm that the tendency for lower X-ray flux sources to be harder
is primarily due to absorption. As expected, there is no correlation between
observed IR and X-ray flux. Optically bright, Type 1 and red AGN lie in
distinct regions of the IR vs X-ray flux plots, demonstrating the wide range of
SEDs in this sample and providing the potential for classification/source
selection. The classical definition of radio-loudness, R_L, is not effective at
selecting strong radio sources for red and relatively optically faint AGN.
Using the 24 um to radio flux ratio (q_24) results in the usual ~10% radio-loud
AGN (13 of 147).
