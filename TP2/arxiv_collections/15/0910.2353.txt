We present the results of simulations of shadows cast by a zone plate
telescope which may have one to four pairs of zone plates. From the shadows we
reconstruct the images under various circumstances. We discuss physical basis
of the resolution of the telescope and demonstrate this by our simulations. We
allow the source to be at a finite distance (diverging beam) as well as at an
infinite distance (parallel beam) and show that the resolution is worsened when
the source is nearby. By reconstructing the zone plates in a way that both the
zone plates subtend the same solid angles at the source, we obtain back high
resolution even for sources at a finite distance. We present simulated results
for the observation of the galactic center and show that the sources of varying
intensities may be reconstructed with accuracy. Results of these simulations
would be of immense use in interpreting the X-ray images from recently launched
CORONAS-PHOTON satellite.
