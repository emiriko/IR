There are many recent results from searches for fundamental new physics using
the TeVatron, the SLAC b-factory and HERA. This talk quickly reviewed searches
for pair-produced stop, for gauge-mediated SUSY breaking, for Higgs bosons in
the MSSM and NMSSM models, for leptoquarks, and v-hadrons. There is a SUSY
model which accommodates the recent astrophysical experimental results that
suggest that dark matter annihilation is occurring in the center of our galaxy,
and a relevant experimental result. Finally, model-independent searches at D0,
CDF, and H1 are discussed.
