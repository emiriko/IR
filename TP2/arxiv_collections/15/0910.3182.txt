We present a search for core-collapse supernovae in the Milky Way galaxy,
using the MiniBooNE neutrino detector. No evidence is found for core-collapse
supernovae occurring in our Galaxy in the period from December 14, 2004 to July
31, 2008, corresponding to 98% live-time for collection. We set a limit on the
core-collapse supernova rate out to a distance of 13.5 kpc to be less than 0.69
supernovae per year at 90% CL.
