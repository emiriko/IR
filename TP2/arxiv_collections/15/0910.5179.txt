In this paper we investigate the statistical behavior of an annealed
continuous damage model. For different model variations we study distributions
of times to failure and compare these results with the classical case of
metastable nucleation in statistical mechanics. We show that our model has a
tuning parameter which significantly determines the model behavior. Depending
on the values of this tuning parameter, our model exhibits statistical behavior
either similar to nucleation of systems in statistical mechanics or an
absolutely different type of behavior intrinsic only for systems with damage.
This lets us investigate the possible similarities and differences between
damage phenomena and classical phenomena of nucleation in statistical
mechanics.
