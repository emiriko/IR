Recent re-evaluations of the Standard Model (SM) contribution to ${\mathcal
Br(b\to s\gamma)$ hint at a positive correction from new physics. Since a
charged Higgs boson exchange always gives a positive contribution to this
branching ratio, the constraint points to the possibility of a relatively light
charged Higgs. It is found that under the HFAG constraints and with
re-evaluated SM results large cancellations between the charged Higgs and the
chargino contributions in supersymmetric models occur. Such cancellations then
correlate the charged Higgs and the chargino masses often implying both are
light. Inclusion of the more recent evaluation of $g_{\mu}-2$ is also
considered. The combined constraints imply the existence of several light
sparticles. Signatures arising from these light sparticles are investigated and
the analysis indicates the possibility of their early discovery at the LHC in a
significant part of the parameter space. We also show that for certain
restricted regions of the parameter space, such as for very large $\tan\beta$
under the $1\sigma$ HFAG constraints, the signatures from Higgs production
supersede those from sparticle production and may become the primary signatures
for the discovery of supersymmetry.
