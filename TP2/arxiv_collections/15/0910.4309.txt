As an example for the interplay of structure, dynamics, and phase behavior of
macromolecular systems, this article focuses on the problem of bottle-brush
polymers with either rigid or flexible backbones. On a polymer with chain
length $N_b$, side-chains with chain length $N$ are endgrafted with grafting
density $\sigma$. Due to the multitude of characteristic length scales and the
size of these polymers (typically these cylindrical macromolecules contain of
the order of 10000 effective monomeric units) understanding of the structure is
a challenge for experiment. But due to excessively large relaxation times
(particularly under poor solvent conditions) such macromolecules also are a
challenge for simulation studies. Simulation strategies to deal with this
challenge, both using Monte Carlo and Molecular Dynamics Methods, will be
briefly discussed, and typical results will be used to illustrate the insight
that can be gained.
