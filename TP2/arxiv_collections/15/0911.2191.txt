The extraction of the light hadron spectrum from a first-principle Quantum
Chromodynamics approach is a profound application for lattice simulations of
Quantum Chromodynamics.
  This review will cover recent lattice results for the masses and decay
constants of the light hadrons. In particular, the applicability of different
approaches for the extrapolation towards the physical point will be discussed.
