A digitalized temperature map is recovered from the first light sky survey
image published by the Planck team, from which an angular power spectrum is
derived. The amplitudes of the low multipoles measured from the preliminary
Planck power spectrum are significantly lower than that reported by the WMAP
team. Possible systematical effects are far from enough to explain the observed
low-l differences.
