We present a theoretical investigation of coherent anti-Stokes Raman
scattering (CARS) that is modulated by periodically depleting the ground state
population through Rabi oscillations driven by an additional control laser. We
find that such a process generates optical sidebands in the CARS spectrum and
that the frequency of the sidebands depends on the intensity of the control
laser light field. We show that analyzing the sideband frequency upon scanning
the beams across the sample allows one to spatially resolve emitter positions
where a spatial resolution of 65 nm, which is well below the diffraction-limit,
can be obtained.
