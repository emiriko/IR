In this paper we extend our previous work regarding the role of the Fourier
transformation in bulk to boundary mappings to include the BTZ black hole. We
follow standard procedures for modifying Fourier Transformations to accommodate
quotient spaces and arrive at a bulk to boundary mapping in a black hole
background. We show that this mapping is consistent with known results and
lends a new insight into the AdS/CFT duality. We find that the micro-states
corresponding to the entropy of a bulk scalar field are the Fourier
coefficients on the boundary, which transform under the principal series
representation of $SL(2,R)$. Building upon this we present a toy model to
analyze the implications of this for the origin of black hole entropy. We find
that the black hole micro-states live on the boundary and correspond to the
possible emission modes of the black hole
