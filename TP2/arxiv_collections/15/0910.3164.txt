We formulate a new algorithm for obtaining the effective continuum threshold
in vacuum-to-bound-state correlators - the basic objects for the calculation of
hadron form factors in the method of light-cone sum rules in QCD. The effective
continuum threshold is one of the key ingredients of the method which to a
large extent determines the value of the form factor extracted from the
relevant correlator. In a quantum-mechanical potential model, where the exact
form factor is known, the application of our algorithm is shown to lead to a
dramatic increase of the accuracy of the extracted form factor compared to the
standard procedures adopted in the method of sum rules in QCD. Moreover, the
application of our algorithm considerably enlarges the range of the momentum
transfer where the form factor may be extracted from the correlator.
