New study confirms conclusions made in [M. Eselevich, and V. Eselevich,
2008]; according to it, there is a disturbed region expended along the CME
propagation direction in front of a coronal mass ejection whose velocity $u$ is
lower than the critical $u_C$ relative to the surrounding coronal plasma. The
time difference brightness (plasma density) in the disturbed region smoothly
decreases to larger distances in front of CME. A shock wave forms at u higher
than $u_C$ in the front part of the disturbed region manifested as a
discontinuity in radial distributions of the difference brightness.
