We discuss the properties of an analytical solution for waves in radiating
fluids, with a view towards its implementation as a quantitative test of
radiation hydrodynamics codes. A homogeneous radiating fluid in local
thermodynamic equilibrium is periodically driven at the boundary of a
one-dimensional domain, and the solution describes the propagation of the waves
thus excited. Two modes are excited for a given driving frequency, generally
referred to as a radiative acoustic wave and a radiative diffusion wave. While
the analytical solution is well known, several features are highlighted here
that require care during its numerical implementation. We compare the solution
in a wide range of parameter space to a numerical integration with a Lagrangian
radiation hydrodynamics code. Our most significant observation is that
flux-limited diffusion does not preserve causality for waves on a homogeneous
background.
