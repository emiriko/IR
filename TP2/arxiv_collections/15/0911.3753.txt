There exists a range of different models for estimating and simulating credit
risk transitions to optimally manage credit risk portfolios and products. In
this chapter we present a Coupled Markov Chain approach to model rating
transitions and thereby default probabilities of companies. As the likelihood
of the model turns out to be a non-convex function of the parameters to be
estimated, we apply heuristics to find the ML estimators. To this extent, we
outline the model and its likelihood function, and present both a Particle
Swarm Optimization algorithm, as well as an Evolutionary Optimization algorithm
to maximize the likelihood function. Numerical results are shown which suggest
a further application of evolutionary optimization techniques for credit risk
management.
