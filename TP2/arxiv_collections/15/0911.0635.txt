The quantum capacitor with discrete charge is modeled by a Hamiltonian
containing an inductive intrinsic term (tunnel effect between plates). The
spectrum is obtained using a double Hilbert space. Fluctuations in the
charge-anticharge pairs (zero total charge) give rise to an elementary
attraction which is compared to the Casimir force. In this case, the
field-fluctuations force could be also interpreted as charge-fluctuations
force.
