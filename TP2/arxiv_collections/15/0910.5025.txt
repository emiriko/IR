The most X-ray luminous cluster known, RXJ1347-1145 (z=0.45), has been the
object of extensive study across the electromagnetic spectrum. We have imaged
the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect (SZE) at 90 GHz (3.3 mm) in RXJ1347-1145 at 10"
resolution with the 64-pixel MUSTANG bolometer array on the Green Bank
Telescope (GBT), confirming a previously reported strong, localized enhancement
of the SZE 20" to the South-East of the center of X-ray emission. This
enhancement of the SZE has been interpreted as shock-heated (> 20 keV) gas
caused by an ongoing major (low mass-ratio) merger event. Our data support this
interpretation. We also detect a pronounced asymmetry in the projected cluster
pressure profile, with the pressure just east of the cluster core ~1.6 times
higher than just to the west. This is the highest resolution image of the SZE
made to date.
