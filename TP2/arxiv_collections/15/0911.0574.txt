We determine the extreme points of the convex set of covariant phase
observables. Such extremals describe the best phase parameter measurements of
laser light - the best in the sense that they are free from classical
randomness due to fluctuations in the measuring procedure. We also characterize
extreme fuzzy rotated quadratures.
