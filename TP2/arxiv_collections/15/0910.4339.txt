With the ever-growing number of exoplanets detected, the issue of
characterization is becoming more and more relevant. Direct imaging is
certainly the most efficient but the most challenging tool to probe the
atmosphere of exoplanets and hence in turns determine the physical properties
and refine models of exoplanets. A number of instruments optimized for
exoplanets imaging are now operating or planned for the short and long term
both on the ground and in space. This paper reviews these instruments and their
characteristics/capabilities. Conclusions are drawn on the spectral
characterization point of view.
