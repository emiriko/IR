We investigate the potential of SUSY flat directions (FDs). Large FD vacuum
expectation values (VEVs) can delay thermalisation and solve the gravitino
problem - if FDs decay perturbatively. This depends on how many and which
directions get the VEVs. Recently the decay of the FDs have been studied with
the VEVs as input. Here we look at how the VEVs come about -- statistically and
analytically.
