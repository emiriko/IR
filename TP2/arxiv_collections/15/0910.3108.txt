The ultraviolet and rapidity divergences of transverse-momentum dependent
parton distribution functions with lightlike and transverse gauge links is
studied, also incorporating a soft eikonal factor. We find that in the
light-cone gauge with $q^-$-independent pole prescriptions extra divergences
appear which amount, at one-loop, to a cusp-like anomalous dimension. We show
that such contributions are absent when the Mandelstam-Leibbrandt prescription
is used. In the first case, the soft factor cancels the anomalous-dimension
defect, while in the second case its ultraviolet-divergent part reduces to
unity.
