We present an investigation of game-like simulations for physics teaching. We
report on the effectiveness of the interactive simulation "Real Time
Relativity" for learning special relativity. We argue that the simulation not
only enhances traditional learning, but also enables new types of learning that
challenge the traditional curriculum. The lessons drawn from this work are
being applied to the development of a simulation for enhancing the learning of
quantum mechanics.
