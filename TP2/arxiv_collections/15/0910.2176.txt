At the LHC, the production cross sections of W/Z bosons are tens to hundreds
of nanobarns. The production mechanism of these processes is well established
in the Standard Model and these processes can be used as "standard candles" to
help commission the CMS detector for physics. Leptonic decays of W/Z bosons are
expected to have very high trigger efficiency and signal to background ratio.
Therefore they are ideal channels to study the properties of W/Z bosons in
detail, such as cross sections and charge asymmetry. In this paper early CMS
results on inclusive W/Z production at 10 TeV center-of-mass energy are
discussed.
