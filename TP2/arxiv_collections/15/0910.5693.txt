Dynamics of neutral modes for fractional quantum Hall states is investigated
for a quantum point contact geometry in the weak-backscattering regime. The
effective field theory introduced by Fradkin-Lopez for edge states in the Jain
sequence is generalized to the case of propagating neutral modes. The dominant
tunnelling processes are identified also in the presence of non-universal
phenomena induced by interactions. The crossover regime in the backscattering
current between tunnelling of single-quasiparticles and of agglomerates of
p-quasiparticles is analysed. We demonstrate that higher order cumulants of the
backscattering current fluctuations are a unique resource to study
quantitatively the competition between different carrier charges. We find that
propagating neutral modes are a necessary ingredient in order to explain this
crossover phenomena.
