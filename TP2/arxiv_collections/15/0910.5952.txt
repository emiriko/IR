This paper presents a streaming (sequential) protocol for universal
entanglement concentration at the Shannon bound. Alice and Bob begin with N
identical (but unknown) two-qubit pure states, each containing E ebits of
entanglement. They each run a reversible algorithm on their qubits, and end up
with Y perfect EPR pairs, where Y = NE +- O(\sqrt N). Our protocol is
streaming, so the N input systems are fed in one at a time, and perfect EPR
pairs start popping out almost immediately. It matches the optimal block
protocol exactly at each stage, so the average yield after n inputs is <Y> = nE
- O(log n). So, somewhat surprisingly, there is no tradeoff between yield and
lag -- our protocol optimizes both. In contrast, the optimal N-qubit block
protocol achieves the same yield, but since no EPR pairs are produced until the
entire input block is read, its lag is O(N). Finally, our algorithm runs in
O(log N) space, so a lot of entanglement can be efficiently concentrated using
a very small (e.g., current or near-future technology) quantum processor. Along
the way, we find an optimal streaming protocol for extracting randomness from
classical i.i.d. sources and a more space-efficient implementation of the Schur
transform.
