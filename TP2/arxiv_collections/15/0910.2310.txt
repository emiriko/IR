We present an abundance analysis of the star Cernis 52 in whose spectrum we
recently reported the napthalene cation in absorption at 6707.4 {\AA}. This
star is on a line of sight to the Perseus molecular complex. The analysis of
high-resolution spectra using a chi^2-minimization procedure and a grid of
synthetic spectra provides the stellar parameters and the abundances of O, Mg,
Si, S, Ca, and Fe. The stellar parameters of this star are found to be T_{eff}
= 8350 +- 200 K, logg= 4.2 +- 0.4 dex. We derived a metallicity of [Fe/H] =
-0.01 +- 0.15. These stellar parameters are consistent with a star of $\sim 2$
\Msun in a pre-main-sequence evolutionary stage. The stellar spectrum is
significantly veiled in the spectral range 5150-6730 {\AA} up to almost 55 per
cent of the total flux at 5150 {\AA} and decreasing towards longer wavelengths.
Using Johnson-Cousins and 2MASS photometric data, we determine a distance to
Cernis 52 of 231$^{+135}_{-85}$ pc considering the error bars of the stellar
parameters. This determination places the star at a similar distance to the
young cluster IC 348. This together with its radial velocity, v_r=13.7+-1 km/s,
its proper motion and probable young age support Cernis 52 as a likely member
of IC 348. We determine a rotational velocity of v\sin i=65 +- 5 km/s for this
star. We confirm that the stellar resonance line of \ion{Li}{1} at 6707.8 {\AA}
is unable to fit the broad feature at 6707.4 {\AA}. This feature should have a
interstellar origin and could possibly form in the dark cloud L1470 surrounding
all the cluster IC 348 at about the same distance.
