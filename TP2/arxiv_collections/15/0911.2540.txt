On the basis of the spin-polarized density functional theory calculations, we
demonstrate that partially-open carbon nanotubes (CNTs) observed in recent
experiments have rich electronic and magnetic properties which depend on the
degree of the opening. A partially-open armchair CNT is converted from a metal
to a semiconductor, and then to a spin-polarized semiconductor by increasing
the length of the opening on the wall. Spin-polarized states become
increasingly more stable than nonmagnetic states as the length of the opening
is further increased. In addition, external electric fields or chemical
modifications are usable to control the electronic and magnetic properties of
the system. We show that half-metallicity may be achieved and the spin current
may be controlled by external electric fields or by asymmetric
functionalization of the edges of the opening. Our findings suggest that
partially-open CNTs may offer unique opportunities for the future development
of nanoscale electronics and spintronics.
