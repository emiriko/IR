In this review we discuss interrelations between classical Hitchin integrable
systems, monodromy preserving equations and topological field theories coming
from N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories developed by Gukov, Kapustin and
Witten. In particular, we define systems related to bundles with nontrivial
characteristic classes and discuss relations of the characteristic classes with
monopole configurations in the Yang-Mills theory.
