Penetration process and an instability on a liquid jet impinging to a stream
of the same fluid in a channel is focused. The jet penetrated into the stream
is wrapped by entrained air, and coalesces with the stream when the air sheath
around the jet collapses. We introduce instability arisen on the jet and the
vigorous effect of the entrained-air sheath on the dynamic behavior of the jet
in this fluid dynamics video.
