The magnetic structures which endow TbMnO$_3$ with its multiferroic
properties have been reassessed on the basis of a comprehensive soft x-ray
resonant scattering (XRS) study. The selectivity of XRS facilitated separation
of the various contributions (Mn $L_2$ edge, Mn 3d moments; Tb M$_4$ edge, Tb
4f moments), while its variation with azimuth provided information on the
moment direction of distinct Fourier components. When the data are combined
with a detailed group theory analysis, a new picture emerges of the
ferroelectric transition at 28 K. Instead of being driven by the transition
from a collinear to a non-collinear magnetic structure, as has previously been
supposed, it is shown to occur between two non-collinear structures.
