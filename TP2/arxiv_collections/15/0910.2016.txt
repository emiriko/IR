The two-body break up of the deuteron is studied at high $Q^2$ kinematics,
with main motivation to probe the deuteron at small internucleon distances.
Such studies are associated with the probing of high momentum component of the
deuteron wave function. For this, two main theoretical issues have been
addressed such as electromagnetic interaction of the virtual photon with the
bound nucleon and the strong interaction of produced baryons in the final state
of the break-up reaction. Within virtual nucleon approximation we developed a
new prescription to account for the bound nucleon effects in electromagnetic
interaction. The final state interaction at high $Q^2$ kinematics is calculated
within generalized eikonal approximation (GEA). We studied the uncertainties
involved in the calculation and performed comparisons with the first
experimental data on deuteron electrodisintegration at large $Q^2$. We
demonstrate that the experimental data confirm GEA's early prediction that the
rescattering is maximal at $\sim 70^0$ of recoil nucleon production relative to
the momentum of the virtual photon. Comparisons also show that the forward
recoil nucleon angles are best suited for studies of the electromagnetic
interaction of bound nucleons and the high momentum structure of the deuteron.
Backward recoil angle kinematics show sizable effects due to the
$\Delta$-isobar contribution. The latter indicates the importance of further
development of GEA to account for the inelastic transitions in the intermediate
state of the electrodisintegration reactions.
