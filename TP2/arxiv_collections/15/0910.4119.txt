We review different aspects of subaqueous sediment transport. We discuss the
static threshold and its dependency with longitudinal and transverse slopes, as
well as cohesion. We describe the different regimes of transport: erosion and
momentum limited bed load, and suspended load. In all these cases, we derive
the expressions of the saturation flux $q_{\rm sat}$ and the saturation length
$L_{\rm sat}$ and discuss their dependencies.
