This document describes the BM25 and BM25F implementation using the Lucene
Java Framework. Both models have stood out at TREC by their performance and are
considered as state-of-the-art in the IR community. BM25 is applied to
retrieval on plain text documents, that is for documents that do not contain
fields, while BM25F is applied to documents with structure.
