Helical edge states exist in the mixed spin-singlet and spin-triplet phase of
a noncentrosymmetric (NCS) superconductor. In this article we have considered a
planar ferromagnetic metal/NCS superconductor tunnel junction and have studied
the effect of these helical edge states which manifests itself through the
charge and spin tunneling conductance across the junction. We have shown the
behavior of conductances for the entire range of variation of $\gamma =
\Delta_-/\Delta_+$ where $\Delta_\pm$ are the order parameters in the positive
and negative helicity bands of the NCS superconductor.There exists a
competition between the Rashba parameter $\alpha$ and the exchange energy
$E_{ex}$ which is crucial for determining the variation of the conductance with
the applied bias voltage across the junction. We have found a nonzero spin
current across the junction which appears due to the exchange energy in the
Ferromagnet and modulates with the bias voltage. It also changes its profile
when the strength of the exchange energy is varied.
