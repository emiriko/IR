We derive a compact, semi-algebraic expression for the cold quark matter
equation of state (EoS) in a covariant model that exhibits coincident
deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoring transitions in-medium. Along the
way we obtain algebraic expressions for: the number- and scalar-density
distributions in both the confining Nambu and deconfined Wigner phases; and the
vacuum-pressure difference between these phases, which defines a bag constant.
The confining interaction materially alters the distribution functions from
those of a Fermi gas and consequently has a significant impact on the model's
thermodynamic properties, which is apparent in the EoS.
