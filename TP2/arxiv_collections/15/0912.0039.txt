We present the results of a search for galaxy clusters in Subaru-XMM Deep
  Field. We reach a depth for a total cluster flux in the 0.5-2 keV band of
2x10^{-15} ergs cm^{-2} s^{-1} over one of the widest XMM-Newton contiguous
raster surveys, covering an area of 1.3 square degrees. Cluster candidates are
identified through a wavelet detection of extended X-ray emission. The red
sequence technique allows us to identify 57 cluster candidates. We report on
the progress with the cluster spectroscopic follow-up and derive their
properties based on the X-ray luminosity and cluster scaling relations. In
addition, 3 sources are identified as X-ray counterparts of radio lobes, and in
3 further sources, X-ray counterpart of radio lobes provides a significant
fraction of the total flux of the source. In the area covered by NIR data, our
identification success rate achieves 86%. We detect a number of radio galaxies
within our groups and for a luminosity-limited sample of radio galaxies we
compute halo occupation statistics using a marked cluster mass function. We
compare the cluster detection statistics in the SXDF with the predictions of
concordance cosmology and current knowledge of the X-ray cluster properties,
concluding that a reduction of concordance sigma_8 value by 5% is required in
order to match the prediction of the model and the data. This conclusion still
needs verification through the completion of cluster follow-up.
