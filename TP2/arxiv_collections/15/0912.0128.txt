To simplify a number of considerations in the weak field approximation,
including the determination of the response of interferometric gravitational
wave detectors, the "transverse traceless" (TT) gauge is often used. While the
identification of the corresponding gauge invariant part of the metric
perturbations in the pure vacuum case is obvious, it is not widely known that
the determination and the use of the TT part is much more complicated and, in
turn, much less rewarding when sources are involved. It is shown here that
likewise the transverse part of the electric current in the Coulomb gauge
within Maxwell's theory the sources of the TT gauge part of the metric
perturbations become non-local. This, in practice, invokes the necessity of the
use of more adequate projection operators then the ones applied, e.g, in the
weak field limit, and in many post-Newtonian considerations. It is also pointed
out that, whenever nonlinear effects are taken into account, some of the
conclusions concerning the response of interferometric gravitational wave
detectors may be influenced. In particular, attention is called on the
possibility that gravitational radiation may produce an isotropic change of the
spatial geometry.
