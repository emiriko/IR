We suggest the model with the gauge group $ ... \otimes SU(6) \otimes
SU(5)\otimes SU(4) \otimes SU(3) \otimes SU(2) \otimes U(1)$. This group is the
infinite continuation of the gauge group $SU(4) \otimes SU(3) \otimes SU(2)
\otimes U(1)$ of Farhi - Susskind model. The constructed model contains
fermions from the fundamental representations of any SU(N) subgroups of the
gauge group. In the construction of the model we use essentially the
requirement that it posseses an additional discrete symmetry $\cal Z$ that is
the continuation of the $Z_6$ symmetry of the Standard Model. It has been found
that there exists such a choice of the hypercharges of the fermions that the
chiral anomaly is absent while the symmetry $\cal Z$ is preserved.
