At the LHC associated top quark and Higgs boson production with a Higgs decay
to bottom quarks has long been a heavily disputed search channel. Recently, it
has been found to not be viable. We show how it can be observed by tagging
massive Higgs and top jets. For this purpose we construct boosted top and Higgs
taggers for Standard Model processes in a complex QCD environment.
