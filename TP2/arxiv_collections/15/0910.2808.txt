We investigate the effects of the generalized uncertainty principle on the
inflationary dynamics of the early universe in both standard and braneworld
viewpoint. We choose the Randall-Sundrum II model as our underlying braneworld
scenario. We find that the quantum gravitational effects lead to a spectral
index which is not scale invariant. Also, the amplitude of density fluctuations
is reduced by increasing the strength of quantum gravitational corrections.
However, the tensor-to-scalar ratio increases by incorporation of these quantum
gravity effects. We outline possible manifestations of these quantum gravity
effects in the recent and future observations.
