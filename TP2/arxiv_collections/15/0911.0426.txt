No terrestrial planet formation simulation completed to date has considered
the detailed chemical composition of the planets produced. While many have
considered possible water contents and late veneer compositions, none have
examined the bulk elemental abundances of the planets produced as an important
check of formation models. Here we report on the first study of this type. Bulk
elemental abundances based on disk equilibrium studies have been determined for
the simulated terrestrial planets of O'Brien et al. (2006). These abundances
are in excellent agreement with observed planetary values, indicating that the
models of O'Brien et al. (2006) are successfully producing planets comparable
to those of the Solar System in terms of both their dynamical and chemical
properties. Significant amounts of water are accreted in the present
simulations, implying that the terrestrial planets form "wet" and do not need
significant water delivery from other sources. Under the assumption of
equilibrium controlled chemistry, the biogenic species N and C still need to be
delivered to the Earth as they are not accreted in significant proportions
during the formation process. Negligible solar photospheric pollution is
produced by the planetary formation process. Assuming similar levels of
pollution in other planetary systems, this in turn implies that the high
metallicity trend observed in extrasolar planetary systems is in fact
primordial.
