Recently Horava proposed a renormalizable gravity theory with higher
derivatives by abandoning the Lorenz invariance in UV. Here, I study the Horava
model at $\lambda=1/3$, where an anisotropic Weyl symmetry exists in the UV
limit, in addition to the foliation-preserving diffeomorphism. By considering
linear perturbations around Minkowski vacuum, I show that the scalar graviton
mode is completely disappeared and only the usual tensor graviton modes remain
in the physical spectrum. The existence of the UV conformal symmetry is unique
to the theory with the detailed balance and it is quite probable that
$\lambda=1/3$ be the UV fixed point. This situation is analogous to
$\lambda=1$, which is Lorentz invariant in the IR limit and is believed to be
the IR fixed point.
