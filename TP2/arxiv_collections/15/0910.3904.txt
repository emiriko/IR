The kaons decays to the pairs of charged and neutral pions are considered in
the framework of the non-relativistic quantum mechanics. The general
expressions for the decay amplitudes to the two different channels accounting
for the strong interaction between pions are obtained. The developed approach
allows one to estimate the contribution of terms of any order in strong
interaction and correctly takes into account the electromagnetic interaction
between the pions in the final state.
