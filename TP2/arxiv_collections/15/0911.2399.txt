In a combined investigation of the $B\to K^{(*)}\ell^+\ell^-$ decays,
constraints on the related couplings in family non-universal $Z^{\prime}$
models are derived. We find that within the allowed parameter space, the
recently observed forward-backward asymmetry in the $B\to K^*\ell^+\ell^-$
decay can be explained, by flipping the signs of the Wilson coefficients
$C_9^{\rm eff}$ and $C_{10}$. With the obtained constraints, we also calculate
the branching ratio of the $B_s\to\mu^+\mu^-$ decay. The upper bound of our
prediction is near the upper bound given by CDF Collaboration recently.
