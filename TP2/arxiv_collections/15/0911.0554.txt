First spectroscopic and new photometric observations of the eclipsing binary
FM Leo are presented. The main aims were to determine orbital and stellar
parameters of two components and their evolutionary stage. First spectroscopic
observations of the system were obtained with DDO and PST spectrographs. The
results of the orbital solution from radial velocity curves are combined with
those derived from the light-curve analysis (ASAS-3 photometry and
supplementary observations of eclipses with 1 m and 0.35 m telescopes) to
derive orbital and stellar parameters. JKTEBOP, Wilson-Devinney binary
modelling codes and a two-dimensional cross-correlation (TODCOR) method were
applied for the analysis. We find the masses to be M_1 = 1.318 $\pm$ 0.007 and
M_2 = 1.287 $\pm$ 0.007 M_sun, the radii to be R_1 = 1.648 $\pm$ 0.043 and R_2
= 1.511 $\pm$ 0.049 R_sun for primary and secondary stars, respectively. The
evolutionary stage of the system is briefly discussed by comparing physical
parameters with current stellar evolution models. We find the components are
located at the main sequence, with an age of about 3 Gyr.
