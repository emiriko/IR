$LiHo_xY_{1-x}F_4$ is an insulating system where the magnetic Ho$^{3+}$ ions
have an Ising character, and interact mainly through magnetic dipolar fields.
We used the muon spin relaxation technique to study the nature of the ground
state for samples with x=0.25, 0.12, 0.08, 0.045 and 0.018. In contrast with
some previous works, we have not found any signature of canonical spin glass
behavior down to $\approx$15mK. Instead, below $\approx$300mK we observed
dynamic magnetism characterized by a single correlation time with a temperature
independent fluctuation rate. We observed that this low temperature fluctuation
rate increases with x up to 0.08, above which it levels off. The 300mK energy
scale corresponds to the Ho3+ hyperfine interaction strength, suggesting that
the hyperfine interaction may be intimately involved with the spin dynamics in
this system.
