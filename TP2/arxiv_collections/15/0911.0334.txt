We present a self-contained introduction to the classical theory of spacetime
and fields. This exposition is based on the most general principles: the
principle of general covariance (relativity) and the principle of least action.
The order of the exposition is: 1. Spacetime (principle of general covariance
and tensors, affine connection, curvature, metric, tetrad and spin connection,
Lorentz group, spinors); 2. Fields (principle of least action, action for
gravitational field, matter, symmetries and conservation laws, gravitational
field equations, spinor fields, electromagnetic field, action for particles).
In this order, a particle is a special case of a field existing in spacetime,
and classical mechanics can be derived from field theory.
