We study the dynamics of covariances in a chain of harmonic oscillators with
conservative noise in contact with two stochastic Langevin heat baths. The
noise amounts to random collisions between nearest-neighbour oscillators that
exchange their momenta. In a recent paper, [S Lepri et al. J. Phys. A: Math.
Theor. 42 (2009) 025001], we have studied the stationary state of this system
with fixed boundary conditions, finding analytical exact expressions for the
temperature profile and the heat current in the thermodynamic (continuum)
limit. In this paper we extend the analysis to the evolution of the covariance
matrix and to generic boundary conditions. Our main purpose is to construct a
hydrodynamic description of the relaxation to the stationary state, starting
from the exact equations governing the evolution of the correlation matrix. We
identify and adiabatically eliminate the fast variables, arriving at a
continuity equation for the temperature profile T(y,t), complemented by an
ordinary equation that accounts for the evolution in the bulk. Altogether, we
find that the evolution of T(y,t) is the result of fractional diffusion.
