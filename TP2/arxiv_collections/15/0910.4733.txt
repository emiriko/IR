The solar abundances have undergone a major downward revision in the last
decade, reputedly as a result of employing 3D hydrodynamical simulations to
model the inhomogeneous structure of the solar photosphere. The very low oxygen
abundance advocated by Asplund et al. (2004), A(O)=8.66, together with the
downward revision of the carbon and nitrogen abundances, has created serious
problems for solar models to explain the helioseismic measurements. In an
effort to contribute to the dispute we have re-derived photospheric abundances
of several elements independently of previous analysis. We applied a
state-of-the art 3D (CO5BOLD) hydrodynamical simulation of the solar
granulation as well as different 1D model atmospheres for the line by line
spectroscopic abundance determinations. The analysis is based on both standard
disc-centre and disc-integrated spectral atlases; for oxygen we acquired in
addition spectra at different heliocentric angles. The derived abundances are
the result of equivalent width and/or line profile fitting of the available
atomic lines. We discuss the different granulation effects on solar abundances
and compare our results with previous investigations. According to our
investigations hydrodynamical models are important in the solar abundance
determination, but are not responsible for the recent downward revision in the
literature of the solar metallicity.
