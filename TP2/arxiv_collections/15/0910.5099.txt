Protocol narrations are widely used in security as semi-formal notations to
specify conversations between roles. We define a translation from a protocol
narration to the sequences of operations to be performed by each role. Unlike
previous works, we reduce this compilation process to well-known decision
problems in formal protocol analysis. This allows one to define a natural
notion of prudent translation and to reuse many known results from the
literature in order to cover more crypto-primitives. In particular this work is
the first one to show how to compile protocols parameterised by the properties
of the available operations.
