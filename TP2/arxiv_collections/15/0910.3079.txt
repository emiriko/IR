In the paper we analyze the "singular statistics" of pseudointegrable Seba
billiards and show that taking into account growing number of resonances one
observes the transition from "semi-Poissonian"-like statistics to Poissonian.
This observation is in agreement with an argument that a classical particle
does not feel a point perturbation. However, our findings contradict results
reported earlier (P. Seba, Phys. Rev. Lett. 64, 1855 (1990)).
