We present the data on depolarization of polarized neutron beam and second
harmonic of magnetization ($M_2$) for Nd$_{1-x}$Ba$_x$MnO$_3$ ($x$ = 0.23, the
Curie temperature $T_C \approx$ 124 K; $x$ = 0.25, $T_C \approx$ 129 K)
manganites. The depolarization starts to develop below $T$* $\approx$ 147 K $>
T_C$ for both samples, being larger in x = 0.25 compound. This evidences the
arising of a ferromagnetic (F) cluster phase below $T$* and a growth of its
relative volume fraction with increasing doping concentration that agrees with
the previously published results of $M_2$ study. A characteristic size of the F
clusters and their concentration are estimated combining the neutron
depolarization and $M_2$ data for $x$ = 0.25 manganite.
