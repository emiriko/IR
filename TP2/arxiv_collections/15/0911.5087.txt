We report measurements of the thermal emission of the young and massive
planet CoRoT-2b at 4.5 and 8 microns with the Spitzer Infrared Array Camera
(IRAC). Our measured occultation depths are 0.510 +- 0.042 % and 0.41 +- 0.11 %
at 4.5 and 8 microns, respectively. In addition to the CoRoT optical
measurements, these planet/star flux ratios indicate a poor heat distribution
to the night side of the planet and are in better agreement with an atmosphere
free of temperature inversion layer. Still, the presence of such an inversion
is not definitely ruled out by the observations and a larger wavelength
coverage is required to remove the current ambiguity. Our global analysis of
CoRoT, Spitzer and ground-based data confirms the large mass and size of the
planet with slightly revised values (Mp = 3.47 +- 0.22 Mjup, Rp = 1.466 +-
0.044 Rjup). We find a small but significant offset in the timing of the
occultation when compared to a purely circular orbital solution, leading to e
cos(omega) = -0.00291 +- 0.00063 where e is the orbital eccentricity and omega
is the argument of periastron. Constraining the age of the system to be at most
of a few hundreds of Myr and assuming that the non-zero orbital eccentricity is
not due to a third undetected body, we model the coupled orbital-tidal
evolution of the system with various tidal Q values, core sizes and initial
orbital parameters. For log(Q_s') = 5 - 6, our modelling is able to explain the
large radius of CoRoT-2b if log(Q_p') <= 5.5 through a transient tidal
circularization and corresponding planet tidal heating event. Under this model,
the planet will reach its Roche limit within 20 Myr at most.
