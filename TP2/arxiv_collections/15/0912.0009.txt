We argue that the recent groundbreaking discovery by Badenes et al. (2009) of
a nearby (~50 pc) white dwarf-neutron star (or black hole) binary (SDSS
1257+5428) with a merger timescale ~500 Myr implies that such systems are
common; we estimate that there are of order 10^6 in the Galaxy. Although
subject to large uncertainties, the nominal derived merger rate is ~5 x 10^-4
per yr in the Milky Way, just ~3-6 and ~20-40 times less than the Type Ia and
core-collapse supernova (SN) rates, respectively. This implies that the merger
rate is ~0.5-1 x 10^4 per Gpc^3 per yr in the local universe, ~5000-10000 times
more than the observed (beaming-uncorrected) long-duration gamma-ray burst
(GRB) rate. We estimate the lower limit on the rate in the Galaxy to be >2.5 x
10^-5 per yr at 95% confidence. We briefly discuss the implications of this
finding for the census of long- and short-duration GRBs and their progenitors,
the frequency of tight binary companions to Type Ib/c SN progenitors, the
origin of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs), the formation of rapidly
rotating neutron stars and ~2-3 M_sun black holes, the census of faint Ia-like
SNe, as well as for upcoming and current transient surveys (e.g., LOSS, PTF,
LSST), and for high- (LIGO) and low-frequency (LISA) gravitational wave
searches.
