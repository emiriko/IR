We prove the dynamical large deviations for a particle system in which
particles may have different velocities. We assume that we have two infinite
reservoirs of particles at the boundary: this is the so-called boundary driven
process. The dynamics we considered consists of a weakly asymmetric simple
exclusion process with collision among particles having different velocities.
