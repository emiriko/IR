We present a detailed microscopic derivation for a non-Markovian master
equation for a driven two-state system interacting with a general structured
reservoir. The master equation is derived using the time-convolutionless
projection operator technique in the limit of weak coupling between the
two-state quantum system and its environment. We briefly discuss the Markov
approximation, the secular approximation and their validity.
