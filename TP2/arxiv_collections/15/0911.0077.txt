Backward stochastic partial differential equations of parabolic type with
variable coefficients are considered in the whole Euclidean space. Improved
existence and uniqueness results are given in the Sobolev space $H^n$
($=W^n_2$) under weaker assumptions than those used by X. Zhou [Journal of
Functional Analysis 103, 275--293 (1992)]. As an application, a comparison
theorem is obtained.
