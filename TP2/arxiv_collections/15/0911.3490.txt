Applying a sum-over-modes approach to the Casimir interaction between two
plates with finite conductivity, we isolate and study the contributions of
surface plasmons and Foucault (eddy current) modes. We show in particular that
for the TE-polarization eddy currents provide a repulsive force that cancels,
at high temperatures, the Casimir free energy calculated with the plasma model.
