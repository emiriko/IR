We explore a novel transport phenomenon by studying the effect of surface
disorder on electron transport through a finite size conductor with side
coupled metallic electrodes. In the strong disorder regime the current
amplitude increases with the increase of the surface disorder strength, while,
the amplitude decreases in the weak disorder regime. This behavior is
completely opposite to that of bulk disordered system. In this article we also
investigate the effects of the size of the conductor and the transverse
magnetic field on electron transport and see that the transport properties are
significantly influenced by them.
