Optical single-short measurement of the cross-correlation function between
periodic sequences is demonstrated. The sequences are encoded into the
broadband ultrashort phase-shaped pulses which are mixed in the nonlinear
medium with additional amplitude-shaped narrowband pulse. The spectrum of the
resulted four wave mixing signal is measured to provide the cross-correlation
function. The high contrast between the values of cross-correlation and
auto-correlation (the latter includes also the information of the sequence
period) has potential to be employed in the optical implementation of CDMA
communication protocol.
