Confining a quantum particle in a compact subinterval of the real line with
Dirichlet boundary conditions, we identify the connection of the
one-dimensional fractional Schr\"odinger operator with the truncated Toeplitz
matrices. We determine the asymptotic behaviour of the product of eigenvalues
for the $\alpha$-stable symmetric laws by employing the Szeg\"o's strong limit
theorem. The results of the present work can be applied to a recently proposed
model for a particle hopping on a bounded interval in one dimension whose
hopping probability is given a discrete representation of the fractional
Laplacian.
