We define a notion of roundness for finite groups. Roughly speaking, a group
is round if one can order its elements in a cycle in such a way that some
natural summation operators map this cycle into new cycles containing all the
elements of the group. Our main result is that this combinatorial property is
equivalent to nilpotence.
