The hadron-quark phase transition in the interior of compact stars is
investigated, when the transition proceeds through a mixed phase. The hadronic
phase is described in the framework of relativistic mean-field theory, when
also the scalar-isovector delta-meson mean-field is taken into account. The
changes of the parameters of phase transition caused by the presence of
delta-meson field are explored. The results of calculation of structure of the
mixed phase (Glendenning construction) are compared with the results of usual
first-order phase transition (Maxwell construction).
