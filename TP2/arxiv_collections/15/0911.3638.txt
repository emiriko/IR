Purpose: The mismatches between political discourse and military momentum in
the American handling of the Cuban missile crisis are explained by using the
model of the potential autopoiesis of subsystems. Under wartime conditions, the
codes of political and military communications can increasingly be
differentiated. Design/methodology/approach: The model of a further
differentiation between political and military power is developed on the basis
of a detailed description of the Cuban missile crisis. We introduce the concept
of a "semi-dormant autopoiesis" for the difference in the dynamics between
peacetime and wartime conditions. Findings: Several dangerous incidents during
the crisis can be explained by a sociocybernetic model focusing on
communication and control, but not by using an organization-theoretical
approach. The further differentiation of the military as a subsystem became
possible in the course of the twentieth century because of ongoing learning
processes about previous wars.
