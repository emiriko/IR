A brief review of modeling and simulation methods for a study of polymers at
interfaces is provided. When studying truly multiscale problems as provided by
realistic polymer systems, coarse graining is practically unavoidable. In this
process, degrees of freedom on smaller scales are eliminated to the favor of a
model suitable for efficient study of the system behavior on larger length and
time scales. We emphasize the need to distinguish between dynamic and static
properties regarding the model validation. A model which accurately reproduces
static properties may fail completely, when it comes to the dynamic behavior of
the system. Furthermore, we comment on the use of Monte Carlo method in polymer
science as compared to molecular dynamics simulations. Using the latter
approach, we also discuss results of recent computer simulations on the
properties of polymers close to solid substrates. This includes both generic
features (as also observed in the case of simpler molecular models) as well as
polymer specific properties. Predictive power of computer simulations is
highlighted by providing experimental evidence for these observations. Some
important implications of these results for an understanding of mechanical
properties of thin polymer films and coatings are also worked out.
