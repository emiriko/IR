The mechanism by which outflows and plausible jets are driven from black hole
systems, still remains observationally elusive. Notwithstanding, several
observational evidences and deeper theoretical insights reveal that accretion
and outflow/jet are strongly correlated. We model an advective disk-outflow
coupled dynamics, incorporating explicitly the vertical flux. Inter-connecting
dynamics of outflow and accretion essentially upholds the conservation laws. We
investigate the properties of the disk-outflow surface and its strong
dependence on the rotation parameter of the black hole. The energetics of the
disk-outflow strongly depend on the mass, accretion rate and spin of the black
holes. The model clearly shows that the outflow power extracted from the disk
increases strongly with the spin of the black hole, inferring that the power of
the observed astrophysical jets has a proportional correspondence with the spin
of the central object. In case of blazars (BL Lacs and Flat Spectrum Radio
Quasars), most of their emission are believed to be originated from their jets.
It is observed that BL Lacs are relatively low luminous than Flat Spectrum
Radio Quasars (FSRQs). The luminosity might be linked to the power of the jet,
which in turn reflects that the nuclear regions of the BL Lac objects have a
relatively low spinning black hole compared to that in the case of FSRQ. If the
extreme gravity is the source to power strong outflows and jets, then the spin
of the black hole, perhaps, might be the fundamental parameter to account for
the observed astrophysical processes in an accretion powered system.
