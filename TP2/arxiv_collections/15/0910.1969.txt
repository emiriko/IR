A generalized algorithm for multiplication is proposed through recursive
application of the Nikhilam Sutra from Vedic Mathematics, operating in radix -
2 number system environment suitable for digital platforms. Statistical
analysis has been carried out based on the number of recursions profile as a
function of the smaller multiplicand. The proposed algorithm is efficient for
smaller multiplicands as well, unlike most of the asymptotically fast
algorithms. Further, a basic block schematic of Hardware Implementation of our
algorithm is suggested to exploit parallelism and speed up the implementation
of the algorithm in a multiprocessor environment.
