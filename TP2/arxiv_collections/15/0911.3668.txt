A simple model system is introduced for demonstrating how a single photon
source might be used to transduce classical analog information. The theoretical
scheme results in measurements of analog source samples that are (i) quantized
in the sense of analog-to-digital conversion and (ii) corrupted by random noise
that is solely due to the quantum uncertainty in detecting the polarization
state of each photon. This noise is unavoidable if more than one bit per sample
is to be transmitted, and we show how it may be exploited in a manner inspired
by suprathreshold stochastic resonance. The system is analyzed information
theoretically, as it can be modeled as a noisy optical communication channel,
although unlike classical Poisson channels, the detector's photon statistics
are binomial. Previous results on binomial channels are adapted to demonstrate
numerically that the classical information capacity, and thus the accuracy of
the transduction, increases logarithmically with the square root of the number
of photons, N. Although the capacity is shown to be reduced when an additional
detector nonideality is present, the logarithmic increase with N remains.
