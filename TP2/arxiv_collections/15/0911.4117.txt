In this paper, we give a formula for the area of the triangle formed by the
vertices that live on a given polynomial, and we generalize this formula to the
volumes of $n$-simplices with vertices on a polynomial space curve. To prove
these results, we use induction arguments and a well known identity for
complete symmetric polynomials.
