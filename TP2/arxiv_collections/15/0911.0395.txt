We report on the third phase of our study of the neutrino-cooled
hyperaccreting torus around a black hole that powers the jet in Gamma Ray
Bursts. We focus on the influence of the black hole spin on the properties of
the torus. The structure of a stationary torus around the Kerr black hole is
solved numerically. We take into account the detailed treatment of the
microphysics in the nuclear equation of state that includes the neutrino
trapping effect. We find, that in the case of rapidly rotating black holes, the
thermal instability discussed in our previous work is enhanced and develops for
much lower accretion rates. We also find the important role of the energy
transfer from the rotating black hole to the torus, via the magnetic coupling.
