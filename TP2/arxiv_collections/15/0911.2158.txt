Using a survey of wristwatch synchronization from a randomly selected group
of independent volunteers, one can model the system as a Kuramoto-type coupled
oscillator network. Based on the phase data, both the order parameter and an
estimated value of the coupling is derived and the possibilities for similar
research to deduce topology from dynamics are discussed.
