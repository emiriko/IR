We present the first observation of WW+WZ production in the channel with an
identified lepton and two jets in 2.7 fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity
collected with the CDF II detector in $p\bar{p}$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} =
1.96$ TeV. The signal is separated from the large background using matrix
element calculations and is observed with a significance of 5.4$\sigma$. The
WW+WZ production cross section is measured to be $17.7 \pm 3.1$(stat)$\pm
2.4$(sys) pb, in good agreement with standard model predictions. A
complimentary measurement using a fit to the dijet mass is also presented.
