We propose a scheme for testing the weak equivalence principle (Universality
of Free Fall) using an atom-interferometric measurement of the local
differential acceleration between two atomic species with a large mass ratio as
test masses. A apparatus in free fall can be used to track atomic free-fall
trajectories over large distances. We show how the differential acceleration
can be extracted from the interferometric signal using Bayesian statistical
estimation, even in the case of a large mass and laser wavelength difference.
We show that this statistical estimation method does not suffer from
acceleration noise of the platform and does not require repeatable experimental
conditions. We specialize our discussion to a dual potassium/rubidium
interferometer and extend our protocol with other atomic mixtures. Finally, we
discuss the performances of the UFF test developed for the free-fall (0-g)
airplane in the ICE project (\verb"http://www.ice-space.fr")
