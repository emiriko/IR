The CMS silicon tracker, consisting of 1440 silicon pixel and 15148 silicon
strip detector modules, has been aligned using more than three million cosmic
ray charged particles, with additional information from optical surveys. The
positions of the modules were determined with respect to cosmic ray
trajectories to a precision of 3-4 microns RMS in the barrel and 3-14 microns
RMS in the endcap in the most sensitive coordinate. The results have been
validated by several methods, including the laser alignment system, and
compared with predictions obtained from simulation. Correlated systematic
effects have been investigated. The track parameter resolutions obtained with
this alignment are close to the design performance.
