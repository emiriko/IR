We determine doubly heavy baryonic potentials as a function of the distance
between the two static sources, coupled to a light relativistic quark, for
different quantum numbers. We use the variational method to compute the ground
state and the first two excitations. These can be used as an input to
nonrelativistic models or to NRQCD calculations of properties of doubly heavy
baryons. We compare our findings with a factorization model. We employ
all-to-all propagator methods, improved by an additional hopping parameter
expansion and Wuppertal smearing on QCDSF configurations with two sea quark
flavors.
