We report on a recent study of the SU(3)-breaking corrections to the hyperon
vector coupling $f_1(0)$ up to $\mathcal{O}(p^4)$ in covariant baryon chiral
perturbation theory with dynamical octet and decuplet contributions. The
decuplet contributions are taken into account for the first time in a covariant
ChPT study and are found of similar or even larger size than the octet ones. We
predict positive SU(3)-breaking corrections to all the four independent
$f_1(0)$'s (assuming isospin symmetry), which are consistent, within
uncertainties, with the latest results from large $N_c$ fits, chiral quark
models, and quenched lattice QCD calculations. We also discuss briefly the
implications of our results for the extraction of $V_{us}$ from hyperon decay
data.
