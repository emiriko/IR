We numerically investigate the damping of Bloch oscillations in a
one-dimensional lattice potential whose translational symmetry is broken in a
systematic manner, either by making the potential bichromatic or by introducing
scatterers at distinct lattice sites. We find that the damping strongly depends
on the ratio of lattice constants in the bichromatic potential, and that even a
small concentration of scatterers can lead to strong damping. Moreover,
mean-field interactions are able to counteract aperiodicity-induced damping of
Bloch oscillations.
