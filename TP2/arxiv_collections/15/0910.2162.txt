We propose a polarimetric method for measuring the tilt angle of the LC
director at an LC layer interface.The method involves the use of an LC cell
operating in the mode of the total internal reflection of the ordinary wave.
The method is based on measuring the angle of the plane of light incidence on
the cell with the polarization vector of the extraordinary wave passed through
the cell or with the polarization vector of the ordinary wave reflected from
the cell. To calculate the tilt angle, the polarization azimuth of the light
incident on the cell, which induces only the ordinary wave, can be also
used.The method is applicable throughout the whole range of the LC director
tilt angles.
