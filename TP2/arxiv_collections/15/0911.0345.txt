It is a theoretical conjecture that 5/2 fractional quantum Hall state charge
e/4 excitations may obey exotic non-Abelian statistics. In edge state
interference these purported non-Abelian quasiparticles should display period
e/4 Aharonov-Bohm oscillations if the interfering quasiparticle encircles an
even number of localized e/4 charges, but suppression of oscillations if an odd
number is encircled. To test this hypothesis, here we perform swept area
interference measurements at 5/2. We observe an alternating pattern of e/4 and
e/2 period oscillations in resistance. This aperiodic alternation is consistent
with proposed non-Abelian properties: the e/4 oscillations occur for encircling
an even number of localized quasiparticles, e/2 oscillations are expressed when
encircling an odd number. Aperiodic alternation corresponds to the expected
area sweep sampling the localized quasiparticles. Importantly, adding localized
quasiparticles to the encircled area by changing magnetic field induces
interchange of the e/4 and e/2 oscillation periods, specifically consistent
with non-Abelian e/4 quasiparticles.
