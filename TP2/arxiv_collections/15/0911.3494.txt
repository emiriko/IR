The radiation from a charged particle-in-flight from a semi-infinite
laminated medium to vacuum and back,- from vacuum to the laminated medium, has
been investigated. Expressions for the spectral-angular distribution of
radiation energy in vacuum (at large distances from the boundary of laminated
medium) were obtained for both the cases with no limitations on the amplitude
and variation profile of the laminated medium permittivity. The results of
appropriate numerical calculations are presented and possible applications of
the obtained results are discussed.
