In the past the study of reaction-diffusion systems has greatly contributed
to our understanding of the behavior of many-body systems far from equilibrium.
In this paper we aim at characterizing the properties of diffusion limited
reactions both in their steady states and out of stationarity. Many
reaction-diffusion systems have the peculiarity that microscopic reversibility
is broken such that their transient behavior can not be investigated through
the study of most of the observables discussed in the literature. For this
reason we analyze the transient properties of reaction-diffusion systems
through a specific work observable that remains well defined even in the
absence of microscopic reversibility and that obeys an exact detailed
fluctuation relation in cases where detailed balance is fulfilled. We thereby
drive the systems out of their nonequilibrium steady states through
time-dependent reaction rates. Using a numerical exact method and computer
simulations, we analyze fluctuation ratios of the probability distributions
obtained during the forward and reversed processes. We show that the underlying
microscopic dynamics gives rise to peculiarities in the configuration space
trajectories, thereby yielding prominent features in the fluctuation ratios.
