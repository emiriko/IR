In this letter we demonstrate the possibility to determine the temporal and
spectral structure (spectrogram) of a complex light pulse exploiting the
ultrafast switching character of a non-thermal photo-induced phase transition.
As a proof, we use a VO2 multi-film, undergoing an ultrafast insulator-to-metal
phase transition when excited by femtosecond near-infrared laser pulses. The
abrupt variation of the multi-film optical properties, over a broad
infrared/visible frequency range, is exploited to determine, in-situ and in a
simple way, the spectrogram of a supercontinuum pulse produced by a photonic
crystal fiber. The determination of the structure of the pulse is mandatory to
develop new pump-probe experiments with frequency resolution over a broad
spectral range (700-1100 nm).
