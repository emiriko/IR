We propose a model of asymmetric dark matter (DM) where the dark sector is an
identical copy of both forces and matter of the standard model (SM) as in the
mirror universe models discussed in literature. In addition to being connected
by gravity, the SM and DM sectors are also connected at high temperature by a
common set of heavy right-handed Majorana neutrinos via their Yukawa couplings
to leptons and Higgs bosons. The lightest nucleon in the dark (mirror) sector
is a candidate for dark matter. The out of equilibrium decay of right-handed
neutrino produces equal lepton asymmetry in both sectors via resonant
leptogenesis which then get converted to baryonic and dark baryonic matter. The
dark baryon asymmetry due to higher dark nucleon masses leads to higher dark
matter density compared to the familiar baryon density that is observed. The
standard model neutrinos in this case acquire masses from the inverse seesaw
mechanism. A kinetic mixing between the U(1) gauge fields of the two sectors is
introduced to guarantee the success of Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis.
