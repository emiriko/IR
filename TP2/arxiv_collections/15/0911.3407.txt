When two selection environments operate upon each other, mutual shaping in a
co-evolution along a particular trajectory is one possible outcome. When three
selection environments are involved, more complex dynamics can be expected as a
result of interactions involving bi-lateral and tri-lateral relations. Three
selection environments are specified in the Triple Helix model: (1) wealth
generation (industry), (2) novelty production (academia), and (3) public
control (government). Furthermore, this model somewhat reduces the complexity
by using university-industry-government relations for the specification of the
historical conditions of the non-linear dynamics. One can no longer expect a
one-to-one correspondence between institutions and functions; a statistics is
needed for the evaluation of how, for how long, and to what extent
institutional arrangements enhance synergies among different selection
environments. The empirical contributions to this Triple Helix issue point in
the direction of "rich ecologies": the construction of careful balances between
differentiation and integration among the three functions.
