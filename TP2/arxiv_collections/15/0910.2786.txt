We study the dynamics of the thermal momentum distribution function for an
interacting, homogenous Fermi gas on $\Z^3$ in the presence of an external weak
static random potential, where the pair interactions between the fermions are
modeled in dynamical Hartree-Fock theory. We determine the Boltzmann limits
associated to different scaling regimes defined by the size of the random
potential, and the strength of the fermion interactions.
