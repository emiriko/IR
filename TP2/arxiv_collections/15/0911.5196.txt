We demonstrate the capability of AKARI for mapping diffuse far-infrared
emission and achieved reliability of all-sky diffuse map. We have conducted an
all-sky survey for more than 94 % of the whole sky during cold phase of AKARI
observation in 2006 Feb. -- 2007 Aug. The survey in far-infrared waveband
covers 50 um -- 180 um with four bands centered at 65 um, 90 um, 140 um, and
160 um and spatial resolution of 3000 -- 4000 (FWHM).This survey has allowed us
to make a revolutionary improvement compared to the IRAS survey that was
conducted in 1983 in both spatial resolution and sensitivity after more than a
quarter of a century. Additionally, it will provide us the first all-sky survey
data with high-spatial resolution beyond 100 um. Considering its extreme
importance of the AKARI far-infrared diffuse emission map, we are now
investigating carefully the quality of the data for possible release of the
archival data. Critical subjects in making image of diffuse emission from
detected signal are the transient response and long-term stability of the
far-infrared detectors. Quantitative evaluation of these characteristics is the
key to achieve sensitivity comparable to or better than that for point sources
(< 20 -- 95 [MJy/sr]). We describe current activities and progress that are
focused on making high quality all-sky survey images of the diffuse
far-infrared emission.
