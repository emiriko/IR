Using the nuclear symmetry energy that has been recently constrained by the
isospin diffusion data in intermediate-energy heavy ion collisions, we have
studied the transition density and pressure at the inner edge of neutron star
crusts, and they are found to be 0.040 fm$^{-3}$ $\leq \rho_{t}\leq 0.065$
fm$^{-3}$ and 0.01 MeV/fm$^{3}$ $\leq P_{t}\leq 0.26$ MeV/fm$^{3}$,
respectively, in both the dynamical and thermodynamical approaches. We have
also found that the widely used parabolic approximation to the equation of
state of asymmetric nuclear matter gives significantly higher values of
core-crust transition density and pressure, especially for stiff symmetry
energies. With these newly determined transition density and pressure, we have
obtained an improved relation between the mass and radius of neutron stars.
