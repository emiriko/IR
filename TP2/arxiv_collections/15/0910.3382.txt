The study of W or Z boson with accompanying hadronic jets in final states is
of high importance at hadron colliders both to understand Standard Model
processes and to measure background to Beyond Standard Model physics searches.
The presence of one or more jets in the final state increases the complexity
for the reconstruction of leptons and of missing transverse energy. The ATLAS
prospects for the cross section measurement of W/Z + jets events at 14 TeV
center of mass energy and integrated luminosity of 1 fb^{-1} using fully
simulated data are discussed. The statistical and systematic limitations are
discussed in terms of probing perturbative QCD predictions and Monte Carlo
generators.
