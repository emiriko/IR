In this paper we study the one- and two-loop contribution to the free energy
in QED with the Lorentz symmetry breaking introduced via constant CPT-even
Lorentz-breaking parameters at the high temperature limit. We find the impact
of the Lorentz-violating term for the free energy and carry out a numerical
estimation for the Lorentz-breaking parameter.
