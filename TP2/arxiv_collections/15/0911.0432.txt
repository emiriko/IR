In this paper, we study the Modified Leray alpha model with periodic boundary
conditions. We show that when the initial data are infinitely differentiable
then the unique solution are infinitely differentiable in space and time.
Furthermore, this regular solution verifies a sequence of energy inequalities
that is called "ladder inequalities".
