We study a flux qubit in a coplanar waveguide resonator by measuring
transmission through the system. In our system with the flux qubit decoupled
galvanically from the resonator, the intermediate coupling regime is achieved.
In this regime dispersive readout is possible with weak backaction on the
qubit. The detailed theoretical analysis and simulations give a good agreement
with the experimental data and allow to make the qubit characterization.
