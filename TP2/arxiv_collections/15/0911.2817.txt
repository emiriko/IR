We report the experimental observation of discrete breathers in a
one-dimensional diatomic granular crystal composed of compressed elastic beads
that interact via Hertzian contact. We first characterize their effective
linear spectrum both theoretically and experimentally. We then illustrate
theoretically and numerically the modulational instability of the lower edge of
the optical band. This leads to the dynamical formation of long-lived breather
structures, whose families of solutions we compute throughout the linear
spectral gap. Finally, we observe experimentally such localized breathing modes
with quantitative characteristics that agree with our numerical results.
