A premixed flame on a circular porous plug burner can form cellular flames,
which are ordered patterns of concentric rings of brighter, hotter regions
separated by darker, cooler cusps and folds. These ordered states bifurcate to
dynamic states in which the cells move in coordinated motion. Fluid dynamics
videos of representative examples of these states will be presented. Videos of
all the dynamic states of premixed flames can be found at
