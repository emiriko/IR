Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays, UHECR, maybe protons, as most still believe
and claim, or nuclei; in particular lightest nuclei as we advocated recently.
The first (Auger Collaboration) nucleon proposal (2007)[2] foresaw to trace
clearly the UHECR GZK Universe reaching far (up to 100 Mpc)
Super-Galactic-Plane, with little angular dispersion. On the contrary Lightest
Nuclei model (2008)[3], inspired by observed composition and by nearest CenA
clustering (almost a quarter of the AUGER events) explains a modest and narrow
(few Mpc) Universe view, as well as the puzzling Virgo absence: lightest nuclei
offer a fragile (and therefore very nearby) blurred Astronomy. Here we address
to a part of the remaining scattered events in the new up-dated Auger map
(March 2009-ICRC09). We found within rarest clustering the surprising imprint
of a few galactic sources, a partial component of UHECR sources. In particular
we recognize a first trace of Vela, brightest gamma and radio galactic source,
and smeared sources along Galactic Plane and Center. The clustering may imply
additional tails of fragments (by nuclei photo-dissociation) at half energies.
The UHECR light-nuclei fragility and opacity may also reflect into a train of
secondaries as gamma and neutrinos UHE events at tens-hundred PeVs. These UHE
neutrinos might be detectable in a coming future within nearest AUGER and Array
Fluorescence Telescope views,(few km distances) by fast fluorescence flashing
of horizontal up-going tau Air-showers.
