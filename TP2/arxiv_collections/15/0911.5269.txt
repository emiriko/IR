We use computer simulations to study the dynamics of a physical gel at high
densities where gelation and the glass transition interfere. We report and
provide detailed physical understanding of complex relaxation patterns for time
correlation functions which generically decay in a three-step process. For
certain combinations of parameters we find logarithmic decays of the
correlators and subdiffusive particle motion.
