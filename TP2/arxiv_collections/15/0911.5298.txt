Low energy quadrupole excitations of the 84-110Mo nuclei are studied in the
frame of the general Bohr collective model based on the ATDHFB method with the
Skyrme effective interaction. Obtained energies of the 2_1, 4_1, 2_2 and 0_2
levels and B(E2) values for the 2_1 -> 0_g.s transitions are in good agreement
with experimental data.
