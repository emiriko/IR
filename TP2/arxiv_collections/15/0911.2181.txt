Neutron-induced reaction rates, including fission, are calculated in the
temperature range 1.d8 <T (K) < 1.d10 within the framework of the statistical
model for targets with atomic number 83 < Z < 119 (from Po to Uuo) from the
neutron to the proton drip-line. Four sets of rates have been calculated,
utilizing - where possible - consistent nuclear data for neutron separation
energies and fission barriers from Thomas-Fermi (TF), Extended Thomas-Fermi
plus Strutinsky Integral (ETFSI), Finite-Range Droplet Model (FRDM) and
Hartree-Fock-Bogolyubov (HFB) predictions. Tables of calculated values as well
as analytic seven parameter fits in the standard REACLIB format are supplied.
We also discuss the sensitivity of the rates to the input, aiming at a better
understanding of the uncertainties introduced by the nuclear input.
