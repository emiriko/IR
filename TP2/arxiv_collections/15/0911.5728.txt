The Brauer-Manin obstruction is used to explain the failure of the
local-global principle for algebraic varieties. In 1999 Skorobogatov gave the
first example of a variety that does not satisfy the local-global principle
which is not explained by the Brauer-Manin obstruction. He did so by applying
the Brauer-Manin obstruction to \'etale covers of the variety, and thus
defining a finer obstruction. In 2008 Poonen gave the first example of failure
of the local-global principle which cannot be explained for by Skorobogatov's
\'etale-Brauer obstruction. However, Poonen's construction was not accompanied
by a definition of a new finer obstruction. In this paper I shall present a
possible definition for such an obstruction by allowing to apply the
Brauer-Manin obstruction to some ramified covers as well, and show that this
new obstruction can explain Poonen counterexample in the case of a totally
imaginary number field.
