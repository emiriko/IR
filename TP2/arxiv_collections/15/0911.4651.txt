The origin of photodamage of single cells confined in laser tweezers is
determined by comparison of action spectra with these recorded for a
photoinduced response of cell populations. Triplet-singlet transitions in
dissolved oxygen provide a common cause of both phenomena. Such transitions are
forbidden in isolated O2 molecules, but occur in solutions due to the formation
of temporary oxygen-solvent complexes. In dependence on the photon energy
oxygen molecules may be excited alone or in combination with roto-vibrational
excitations in H2O. The photodamage is a consequence of a toxic action produced
by the singlet oxygen 1O2 (1.DELTA.gO2.).
