We grew the single crystal of stoichiometric Tm5Si2.0Ge2.0 using a Bridgeman
method and performed XRD, EDS, magnetization, ac and dc magnetic
susceptibilities, specific heat, electrical resistivity and XPS experiments. It
crystallizes in orthorhombic Sm5Ge4-type structure. The mean valence of Tm ions
in Tm5Si2.0Ge2.0 is almost trivalent. The 4f states is split by the crystalline
electric field. The ground state exhibits the long range antiferromagnetic
order with the ferromagnetically coupled magnetic moments in the ac plane below
8.01 K, while the exited states exhibit the reduction of magnetic moment and
magnetic entropy and -log T-behaviors observed in Kondo materials.
