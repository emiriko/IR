We use our model for the formation and evolution of galaxies within a
two-phase galaxy formation scenario, showing that the high-redshift domain
typically supports the growth of spheroidal systems, whereas at low redshifts
the predominant baryonic growth mechanism is quiescent and may therefore
support the growth of a disc structure. Under this framework we investigate the
evolving galaxy population by comparing key observations at both low and
high-redshifts, finding generally good agreement. By analysing the evolutionary
properties of this model, we are able to recreate several features of the
evolving galaxy population with redshift, naturally reproducing number counts
of massive star-forming galaxies at high redshifts, along with the galaxy
scaling relations, star formation rate density and evolution of the stellar
mass function. Building upon these encouraging agreements, we make model
predictions that can be tested by future observations. In particular, we
present the expected evolution to z=2 of the super-massive black hole mass
function, and we show that the gas fraction in galaxies should decrease with
increasing redshift in a mass, with more and more evolution going to higher and
higher masses. Also, the characteristic transition mass from disc to bulge
dominated system should decrease with increasing redshift.
