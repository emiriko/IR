We present percolation strategies based on multipartite measurements to
propagate entanglement in quantum networks. We consider networks spanned on
regular lattices whose bonds correspond to pure but non-maximally entangled
pairs of qubits, with any quantum operation allowed at the nodes. Despite
significant effort in the past, improvements over naive (classical) percolation
strategies have been found for only few lattices, often with restrictions on
the initial amount of entanglement in the bonds. In contrast, multipartite
entanglement percolation outperform the classical percolation protocols, as
well as all previously known quantum ones, over the entire range of initial
entanglement and for every lattice that we considered.
