On the basis of the zero-temperature grand canonical ensemble generalization
of the energy E[N,N_s,v,B] for fractional particle N and spin N_s numbers, the
energy surface over the (N,N_s) plane is displayed and analyzed in the case of
homogeneous external magnetic fields B(r). The (negative of the)
left/right-side derivatives of the energy with respect to N, N_up, and N_down
give the fixed-N_s, spin-up, and spin-down ionization potentials/electron
affinities, respectively, while the derivative of E[N,N_s,v,B] with respect to
N_s gives the (signed) half excitation energy to a state with N_s increased (or
decreased) by 2. The highest occupied and lowest unoccupied Kohn-Sham
spin-orbital energies are identified as the corresponding spin-up and spin-down
ionization potentials and electron affinities. The excitation energies to the
states with N_s+2, N_s-2, can be obtained as the differences between the lowest
unoccupied and the opposite-spin highest occupied spin-orbital energies, if the
(N,N_s) representation of the Kohn-Sham spin-potentials is used. The cases
where the convexity condition on the energy does not hold are also discussed.
Finally, the discontinuities of the energy derivatives and the Kohn-Sham
potential are analyzed and related.
