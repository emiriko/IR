We discuss phenomenological consequences of requiring the cancellation of
one-loop quadratic divergences in corrections to scalar masses within
Two-Higgs-Doublet Models (2HDM). It is shown that the Inert Doublet Model (IDM)
can not accommodate the requirement of the cancellation. A general 2HDM is also
analyzed taking into account existing experimental constraints. Allowed regions
in the parameter space, permitting the above cancellation, are determined. A
degeneracy between masses of scalar bosons is observed for tanbeta \gsim 40.
The possibility for CP violation in the scalar potential is discussed and
regions of tanbeta-M_{H^\pm} with substantial amount of CP violation are
determined. In order to provide a source for dark matter in a minimal manner, a
scalar gauge singlet is introduced and discussed. The model allows to
ameliorate the little hierarchy problem by lifting the minimal scalar Higgs
boson mass and by suppressing the one-loop quadratic corrections to scalar
masses. The cutoff originating from the naturality arguments is therefore
lifted to \gsim 15 TeV depending on the mass of the lightest scalar.
