If, in a system of identical particles, the one particle state is defined by
the partial trace to one of the component spaces of the total Hilbert space,
then all one particle states are identical. The particles are
indistinguishable. This is often thought to be a typical quantum mechanical
phenomenon. I will show however that an analogous procedure to define particle
states exists in classical mechanics, which results in classical
indistinguishable identical particles. From this analogy it follows that the
indistinguishability of identical particles depends on how we define particle
states. It is not an inevitable result of the symmetry postulate.
  Indeed, if particles are defined by partial traces, consistent use of the
symmetry postulate leads to the conclusion that all identical particles in the
universe are indistinguishable, so that particles can never be pointed at, not
even in the classical limit. This does not correspond to the way the term
particle is actually used in practice. I will argue that a particle should be
defined in such a way that in the classical limit the quantum particle state
becomes the state of a classical particle. This will lead us to a definition of
particles which is in line with the way the term particle is actually used by
physicists.
