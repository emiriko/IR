As part of the WIYN High Image Quality Indiana Irvine (WHIQII) survey, we
present 123 spectra of emission-line galaxies, selected on intermediate
redshift (.4<z<.8) galaxies with blue colors that appear physically compact.
The sample includes 15 true Luminous Compact Blue Galaxies (LCBGs) and an
additional 27 slightly less extreme emission-line systems. These galaxies
represent a highly evolving class that may play an important role in the
decline of star formation since z~1, but their exact nature and evolutionary
pathways remain a mystery. Here, we use emission lines to determine
metallicities and ionization parameters, constraining their intrinsic
properties and state of star formation. Some LCBG metallicities are consistent
with a "bursting dwarf" scenario, while a substantial fraction of others are
not, further confirming that LCBGs are a highly heterogeneous population but
are broadly consistent with the intermediate redshift field. In agreement with
previous studies, we observe overall evolution in the luminosity-metallicity
relation at intermediate redshift. Our sample, and particularly the LCBGs,
occupy a region in the empirical R23-O32 plane that differs from luminous local
galaxies and is more consistent with dwarf Irregulars at the present epoch,
suggesting that cosmic "downsizing" is observable in even the most fundamental
parameters that describe star formation. These properties for our sample are
also generally consistent with lying between local galaxies and those at high
redshift, as expected by this scenario. Surprisingly, our sample exhibits no
detectable correlation between compactness and metallicity, strongly suggesting
that at these epochs of rapid star formation, the morphology of compact
star-forming galaxies is largely transient.
