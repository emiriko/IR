We consider a model of D-term inflation in which the inflaton coincides with
the standard Higgs doublet. Non-renormalizable terms are controlled by a
discrete R-symmetry of the superpotential. We consider radiative corrections to
the scalar potential and find that Higgs inflation in the slow-roll
approximation is viable and consistent with CMB data, although with a rather
large value of the non-renormalizable coupling involved.
