A local turbulence model is developed to study energy cascades in the
heliosheath and outer heliosphere (OH) based on self-consistent two-dimensional
fluid simulations. The model describes a partially ionized magnetofluid OH that
couples a neutral hydrogen fluid with a plasma primarily through
charge-exchange interactions. Charge-exchange interactions are ubiquitous in
warm heliospheric plasma, and the strength of the interaction depends largely
on the relative speed between the plasma and the neutral fluid. Unlike
small-length scale linear collisional dissipation in a single fluid,
charge-exchange processes introduce channels that can be effective on a variety
of length scales that depend on the neutral and plasma densities, temperature,
relative velocities, charge-exchange cross section, and the characteristic
length scales. We find, from scaling arguments and nonlinear coupled fluid
simulations, that charge-exchange interactions modify spectral transfer
associated with large-scale energy-containing eddies. Consequently, the
turbulent cascade rate prolongs spectral transfer among inertial range
turbulent modes. Turbulent spectra associated with the neutral and plasma
fluids are therefore steeper than those predicted by Kolmogorov's
phenomenology. Our work is important in the context of the global heliospheric
interaction, the energization and transport of cosmic rays, gamma-ray bursts,
interstellar density spectra, etc. Furthermore, the plasma-neutral coupling is
crucial in understanding the energy dissipation mechanism in molecular clouds
and star formation processes.
