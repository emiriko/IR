We study the Higgs self couplings of a supersymmetric $E_6$ model that has
two Higgs doublets and two Higgs singlets. The lightest scalar Higgs boson in
the model may be heavier than 112 GeV, at the one-loop level, where the
negative results for the Higgs search at the LEP2 experiments are taken into
account. The contributions from the top and scalar top quark loops are included
in the radiative corrections to the one-loop mass of the lightest scalar Higgs
boson, in the effective potential approximation. The effect of the Higgs self
couplings may be observed in the production of the lightest scalar Higgs bosons
in $e^+e^-$ collisions at the International Linear Collider (ILC) via double
Higgs-strahlung process. For the center of mass energy of 500 GeV with the
integrated luminosity of 500 fb$^{-1}$ and the efficiency of 20 %, we expect
that at least 5 events of the lightest scalar Higgs boson may be produced at
the ILC via double Higgs-strahlung process.
