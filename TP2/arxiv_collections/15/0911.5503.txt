This work aims at a deeper understanding of the mathematical implications of
the economically-sound condition of absence of arbitrages of the first kind in
a financial market. In the spirit of the Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing
(FTAP), it is shown here that absence of arbitrages of the first kind in the
market is equivalent to the existence of a finitely additive probability,
weakly equivalent to the original and only locally countably additive, under
which the discounted wealth processes become "local martingales". The
aforementioned result is then used to obtain an independent proof of the FTAP
of Delbaen and Schachermayer. Finally, an elementary and short treatment of the
previous discussion is presented for the case of continuous-path semimartingale
asset-price processes.
