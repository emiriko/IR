Stellar-mass black holes in the low-hard state may hold clues to jet
formation and basic accretion disk physics, but the nature of the accretion
flow remains uncertain. A standard thin disk can extend close to the innermost
stable circular orbit, but the inner disk may evaporate when the mass accretion
rate is reduced. Blackbody-like continuum emission and dynamically-broadened
iron emission lines provide independent means of probing the radial extent of
the inner disk. Here, we present an X-ray study of eight black holes in the
low-hard state. A thermal disk continuum with a colour temperature consistent
with $L \propto T^{4}$ is clearly detected in all eight sources, down to
$\approx5\times10^{-4}L_{Edd}$. In six sources, disk models exclude a
truncation radius larger than 10rg. Iron-ka fluorescence line emission is
observed in half of the sample, down to luminosities of
$\approx1.5\times10^{-3}L_{Edd}$. Detailed fits to the line profiles exclude a
truncated disk in each case. If strong evidence of truncation is defined as (1)
a non-detection of a broad iron line, {\it and} (2) an inner disk temperature
much cooler than expected from the ${\rm L} \propto {\rm T}^{4}$ relation, none
of the spectra in this sample offer strong evidence of disk truncation. This
suggests that the inner disk may evaporate at or below
$\approx1.5\times10^{-3}L_{Edd}$.
