We present a method to measure the geometric phase defined for three internal
states of a photon (polarizations) using a three-pinhole interferometer. From
the interferogram, we can extract the geometric phase related to the
three-vertex Bargmann invariant as the area of a triangle formed by
interference fringes. Unlike the conventional methods, our method does not
involve the state evolution. Moreover, the phase calibration of the
interferometer and the elimination of the dynamical phase are not required. The
gauge invariance of the geometric phase corresponds to the fact that the area
of the triangle is never changed by the local phase shift in each internal
state.
