We present the results of a multifrequency campaign on the high-redshift (z =
3.1) blazar PKS 0537-286. The source was observed at different epochs from 2006
to 2008 with INTEGRAL and Swift, and nearly simultaneously with ground-based
near-IR/optical telescopes. The SEDs are compatible with a model based on
synchrotron radiation and external inverse Compton scattering. The campaign
gives an insight into the physical environment of the blazar.
