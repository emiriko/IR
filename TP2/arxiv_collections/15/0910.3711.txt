These are notes associated with three lectures given at the 49th Cracow
School of Theoretical physics where a pedagogical explanation of the
Gross-Witten transition, Eguchi-Kawai reduction and continuum reduction were
given, followed by a description of the numerical computation of fermionic
observables in the 't Hooft limit of large N gauge theory.
