In this paper we construct the Wilson short distance operator product
expansion for the gluon, quark and ghost propagators in QCD, including
operators of dimension two and three, namely, A^2, m^2, m A^2, \ovl{\psi} \psi
and m^3. We compute analytically the coefficient functions of these operators
at three loops for all three propagators in the general covariant gauge. Our
results, taken in the Landau gauge, should help to improve the accuracy of
extracting the vacuum expectation values of these operators from lattice
simulation of the QCD propagators.
