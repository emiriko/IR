We discuss the problem of the separation of total correlations in a given
quantum state into entanglement, dissonance, and classical correlations using
the concept of relative entropy as a distance measure of correlations. This
allows us to put all correlations on an equal footing. Entanglement and
dissonance, whose definition is introduced here, jointly belong to what is
known as quantum discord. Our methods are completely applicable for
multipartite systems of arbitrary dimensions. We investigate additivity
relations between different correlations and show that dissonance may be
present in pure multipartite states.
