This paper presents the Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) model to
examine the propagation of a regular and irregular waves. The SPH method is a
grid-less Lagrangian approach which is capable of good accuracy in tracking
large deformations of a free surface. The computations are validated against
the experimental data and a good agreement is observed. The SPH modelling is
shown to provide a promising tool in predicting the transformation of different
waves.
