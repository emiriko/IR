We propose a mechanism for perfect entanglement transport in
anti-ferromagnetic (AFM) quantum spin chain systems with modulated exchange
coupling along the xy plane and in the z direction. We use the principle of
adiabatic quantum pumping process for entanglement transfer in the spin chain
systems. In our proposed mechanism, perfect entanglement transfer can be
achieved over an arbitraly long distance. We explain analytically and
physically why the entanglement hops in alternate sites. We solve this problem
by using the Berry phase analysis and Abelian bosonization methods. We find the
condition for blocking of entanglement transport even in the perfect pumping
condition. We also explain physically why entanglement transfer in AFM chain
out performs the ferromagnetic chain. Our analytical solution interconnects
quantum many body physics and quantum information science.
