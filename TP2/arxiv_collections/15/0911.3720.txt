This paper considers a controlled It\^o-L\'evy process where the information
available to the controller is possibly less than the overall information. All
the system coefficients and the objective performance functional are allowed to
be random, possibly non-Markovian. Malliavin calculus is employed to derive a
maximum principle for the optimal control of such a system where the adjoint
process is explicitly expressed.
