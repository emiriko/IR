We report on the experimental observation of two-dimensional surface solitons
residing at the interface between a homogeneous square lattice and a
superlattice that consists of alternating "deep" and "shallow" waveguides. By
exciting single waveguides in the first row of the superlattice, we show that
solitons centered on deep sites require much lower powers than their respective
counterparts centered on shallow sites. Despite the fact that the average
refractive index of the superlattice waveguides is equal to the refractive
index of the homogeneous lattice, the interface results in clearly asymmetric
output patterns.
