In this comment we point out that the high wavenumber $k^{-3}$ power-law
observed by the PRL, [v. 103, 084501 (2009) by J. Yepez, G. Vahala, L.Vahala
and M. Soe, arXiv:0905.0159] is an artifact stemming from the definition of the
kinetic energy spectra and is thus not directly related to a Kelvin wave
cascade. We also clarify a confusion about the wavenumber intervals on which
Kolmogorov and Kelvin wave cascades are expected to take place.
