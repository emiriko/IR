We show that the entanglement spectrum can be used to define non-local order
in gapless spin systems. We find a gap that fully separates a series of
generic, high `entanglement energy' levels, from a flat band of levels with
specific multiplicities that uniquely define the ground-state, and remains
finite in the thermodynamic limit. We pick the appropriate set of quantum
numbers, and then partition the system in this space. This partition
corresponds to a very non-local real-space cut. Despite the fact that the
Laughlin state is bulk gapped while the antiferromagnetic spin chain state is
bulk gapless, we show that the S=1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet in one
dimension has an entanglement spectrum almost identical to that of the Laughlin
Fractional Quantum Hall state in two dimensions, revealing the similar field
theory of their low-energy edge and bulk excitations respectively.
