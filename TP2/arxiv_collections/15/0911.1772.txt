We propose to describe the time evolution of quasi-stationary fluctuations
near QCD critical point by a system of stochastic
Boltzmann-Langevin-Vlasov-type equations. We derive the equations and study the
system analytically in the linearized regime. Known results for equilibrium
stationary fluctuations as well as the critical scaling of diffusion
coefficient are reproduced. We apply the approach to the long-standing question
of the fate of the critical point fluctuations during the hadronic rescattering
stage of the heavy-ion collision after chemical freezeout. We find that if
conserved particle number fluctuations survive the rescattering, so do, under a
certain additional condition, the fluctuations of non-conserved quantities,
such as mean transverse momentum. We derive a simple analytical formula for the
magnitude of this "memory" effect.
