We investigated with XMCD-PEEM magnetic imaging the magnetization reversal
processes of N\'eel caps inside Bloch walls in self-assembled, micron-sized
Fe(110) dots with flux-closure magnetic state. In most cases the
magnetic-dependent processes are symmetric in field, as expected. However, some
dots show pronounced asymmetric behaviors. Micromagnetic simulations suggest
that the geometrical features (and their asymmetry) of the dots strongly affect
the switching mechanism of the N\'eel caps.
