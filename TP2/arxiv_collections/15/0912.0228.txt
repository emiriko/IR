Hilbert's first problem is of importance in relation to work being done in
computational systems. It is the question of equipollence of natural and real
numbers. By construction equipollence is established for real numbers in open
interval (0, 1) and natural numbers and, from such to all real numbers.
Construction stands in contradiction of the generally accepted diagonal
argument of Cantor. Mathematics being irrefutable, in absence rejection of all
theory of mathematics and logic, the problem exists in acceptance; that itself
arises of more fundamental a problem in science generally. The problem within
Hilbert's problem is of Schopenhauer's, et al, "will and representation" born.
