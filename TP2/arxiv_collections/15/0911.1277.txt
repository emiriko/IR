Cobalt carbide nanoparticles were processed using polyol reduction chemistry
that offers high product yields in a cost effective single-step process.
Particles are shown to be acicular in morphology and typically assembled as
clusters with room temperature coercivities greater than 4 kOe and maximum
energy products greater than 20 KJ/m3. Consisting of Co3C and Co2C phases, the
ratio of phase volume, particle size, and particle morphology all play
important roles in determining permanent magnet properties. Further, the
acicular particle shape provides an enhancement to the coercivity via dipolar
anisotropy energy as well as offering potential for particle alignment in
nanocomposite cores. While Curie temperatures are near 510K at temperatures
approaching 700 K the carbide powders experience an irreversible dissociation
to metallic cobalt and carbon thus limiting operational temperatures to near
room temperature.
