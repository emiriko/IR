We show that the mathematical meaning of working in characteristic one is
directly connected to the fields of idempotent analysis and tropical algebraic
geometry and we relate this idea to the notion of the absolute point. After
introducing the notion of "perfect" semi-ring of characteristic one, we explain
how to adapt the construction of the Witt ring in positive characteristic to
the limit case of characteristic one. This construction unveils an interesting
connection with entropy and thermodynamics, while shedding a new light on the
classical Witt construction itself. We simplify our earlier construction of the
geometric realization of an F_1-scheme and extend our earlier computations of
the zeta function to cover the case of F_1-schemes with torsion. Then, we show
that the study of the additive structures on monoids provides a natural map
from monoids to sets which comes close to fulfill the requirements for the
hypothetical curve compactifying Spec Z over the absolute point. Finally, we
test the computation of the zeta function on elliptic curves over the rational
numbers.
