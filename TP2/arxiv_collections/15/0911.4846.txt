In the fluorescence light of a single atom, the probability for emission of a
photon with certain polarization depends on the polarization of the photon
emitted immediately before it. Here correlations of such kind are investigated
with a single trapped calcium ion by means of second order correlation
functions. A theoretical model is developed and fitted to the experimental
data, which show 91% probability for the emission of polarization-correlated
photon pairs within 24 ns.
