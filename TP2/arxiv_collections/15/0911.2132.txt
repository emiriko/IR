We consider a class of phase space measures, which naturally arise in the
Bohmian interpretation of quantum mechanics (when written in a Lagrangian
form). We study the so-called classical limit of these Bohmian measures, in
dependence on the scale of oscillations and concentrations of the sequence of
wave functions under consideration. The obtained results are consequently
compared to those derived via semi-classical Wigner measures. To this end, we
shall also give a connection to the, by now classical, theory of Young measures
and prove several new results on Wigner measures themselves. We believe that
our analysis sheds new light on the classical limit of Bohmian quantum
mechanics and gives further insight on oscillation and concentration effects of
semi-classical wave functions.
