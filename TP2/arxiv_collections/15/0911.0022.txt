Since the quark-gluon plasma, which is unstable due to anisotropic momentum
distribution, evolves fast in time, plasma's characteristics have to be studied
as initial value problems. The chromodynamic fluctuations and the momentum
broadening of a fast parton traversing the plasma are discussed here. The two
quantities are shown to exponentially grow in time.
