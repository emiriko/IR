Several old and recent classes of picture grammars, that variously extend
context-free string grammars in two dimensions, are based on rules that rewrite
arrays of pixels. Such grammars can be unified and extended using a tiling
based approach, whereby the right part of a rule is formalized by means of a
finite set of permitted tiles. We focus on a simple type of tiling,named
regional, and define the corresponding regional tile grammars. They include
both Siromoney's (or Matz's) Kolam grammars and their generalization by Prusa,
as well as Drewes's grid grammars. Regionally defined pictures can be
recognized with polynomial-time complexity by an algorithm extending the CKY
one for strings. Regional tile grammars and languages are strictly included
into our previous tile grammars and languages, and are incomparable with
Giammarresi-Restivo tiling systems (or Wang systems).
