We have built a reliable and robust system that takes as input an
astronomical image, and returns as output the pointing, scale, and orientation
of that image (the astrometric calibration or WCS information). The system
requires no first guess, and works with the information in the image pixels
alone; that is, the problem is a generalization of the "lost in space" problem
in which nothing--not even the image scale--is known. After robust source
detection is performed in the input image, asterisms (sets of four or five
stars) are geometrically hashed and compared to pre-indexed hashes to generate
hypotheses about the astrometric calibration. A hypothesis is only accepted as
true if it passes a Bayesian decision theory test against a background
hypothesis. With indices built from the USNO-B Catalog and designed for
uniformity of coverage and redundancy, the success rate is 99.9% for
contemporary near-ultraviolet and visual imaging survey data, with no false
positives. The failure rate is consistent with the incompleteness of the USNO-B
Catalog; augmentation with indices built from the 2MASS Catalog brings the
completeness to 100% with no false positives. We are using this system to
generate consistent and standards-compliant meta-data for digital and digitized
imaging from plate repositories, automated observatories, individual scientific
investigators, and hobbyists. This is the first step in a program of making it
possible to trust calibration meta-data for astronomical data of arbitrary
provenance.
