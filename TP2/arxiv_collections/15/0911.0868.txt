The charmed-strange meson spectrum is calculated with the overlap valence
fermions on 2+1 flavor domain wall dynamical configurations for $32^3\times 64$
lattices with a spatial size of 2.7 fm. Both charm and strange quark
propagators are calculated with the overlap fermion action. The calculated
scalar meson at 2304(22) MeV and axial-vector meson at 2546(27) MeV are in good
agreement with the experimental masses of $D{s0}^*$(2317) and $D_{s1}$(2536).
