This paper investigates the question whether a realistic black hole can be in
principal similar to a star, having a large but finite redshift at its horizon.
If matter spreads throughout the interior of a supermassive black hole with
mass $M\sim10^9M_\odot$, it has an average density comparable to air and it may
arise from a Bose-Einstein condensate of densely packed H-atoms. Within the
Relativistic Theory of Gravitation with a positive cosmological constant, a
bosonic quantum field describing H atoms is coupled to the curvature scalar
with dimensionless coupling $\xi$. In the Bose-Einstein condensed groundstate
an exact, self-consistent solution for the metric occurs for a certain large
value of $\xi$, quadratic in the black hole mass. It is put forward that $\xi$
is set by proper choice of the background metric as a first step of a
renormalization approach, while otherwise the non-linearities are small. The
black hole has a hair, the binding energy. Fluctuations about the ground state
are considered.
