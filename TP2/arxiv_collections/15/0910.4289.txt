A nonrelativistic approach to quantum gravity is studied. At least for weak
gravitational fields it should be a valid approximation. Such an approach can
be used to point out problems and prospects inherent in a more exact theory of
quantum gravity, yet to be discovered. Nonrelativistic quantum gravity, e.g.,
shows promise for prohibiting black holes altogether (which would eliminate
singularities and also solve the black hole information paradox), gives
gravitational radiation even in the spherically symmetric case, and supports
non-locality (quantum entanglement). Its predictions should also be testable at
length scales well above the "Planck scale", by high-precision experiments
feasible with existing technology.
