Modern high-throughput gene perturbation screens are key technologies at the
forefront of genetic research. Combined with rich phenotypic descriptors they
enable researchers to observe detailed cellular reactions to experimental
perturbations on a genome-wide scale. This review surveys the current
state-of-the-art in analyzing perturbation screens from a network point of
view. We describe approaches to make the step from the parts list to the wiring
diagram by using phenotypes for network inference and integrating them with
complementary data sources. The first part of the review describes methods to
analyze one- or low-dimensional phenotypes like viability or reporter activity;
the second part concentrates on high-dimensional phenotypes showing global
changes in cell morphology, transcriptome or proteome.
