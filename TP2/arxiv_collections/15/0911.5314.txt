AC susceptibility measurements have been carried out on superconducting
LaO1-xFxFeAs for x=0.07 and 0.14 under He-gas pressures to about 0.8 GPa. Not
only do the measured values of dTc/dP differ substantially from those obtained
in previous studies using other pressure media, but the Tc(P) dependences
observed depend on the detailed pressure/temperature history of the sample. A
sizeable sensitivity of Tc(P) to shear stresses provides a possible
explanation.
