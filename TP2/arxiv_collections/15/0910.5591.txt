Precise calibration of kilometer-scale interferometric gravitational wave
detectors is crucial for source localization and waveform reconstruction. A
technique that uses the radiation pressure of a power-modulated auxiliary laser
to induce calibrated displacements of one of the ~10 kg arm cavity mirrors, a
so-called photon calibrator, has been demonstrated previously and has recently
been implemented on the LIGO detectors. In this article, we discuss the
inherent precision and accuracy of the LIGO photon calibrators and several
improvements that have been developed to reduce the estimated voice coil
actuator calibration uncertainties to less than 2 percent (1-sigma). These
improvements include accounting for rotation-induced apparent length variations
caused by interferometer and photon calibrator beam centering offsets, absolute
laser power measurement using temperature-controlled InGaAs photodetectors
mounted on integrating spheres and calibrated by NIST, minimizing errors
induced by localized elastic deformation of the mirror surface by using a
two-beam configuration with the photon calibrator beams symmetrically displaced
about the center of the optic, and simultaneously actuating the test mass with
voice coil actuators and the photon calibrator to minimize fluctuations caused
by the changing interferometer response. The photon calibrator is able to
operate in the most sensitive interferometer configuration, and is expected to
become a primary calibration method for future gravitational wave searches.
