We study the response of a granular system at rest to an instantaneous input
of energy in a localised region. We present scaling arguments that show that,
in $d$ dimensions, the radius of the resulting disturbance increases with time
$t$ as $t^{\alpha}$, and the energy decreases as $t^{-\alpha d}$, where the
exponent $\alpha=1/(d+1)$ is independent of the coefficient of restitution. We
support our arguments with an exact calculation in one dimension and event
driven molecular dynamic simulations of hard sphere particles in two and three
dimensions.
