Deriving the motion of a compact mass or charge can be complicated by the
presence of large self-fields. Simplifications are known to arise when these
fields are split into two parts in the so-called Detweiler-Whiting
decomposition. One component satisfies vacuum field equations, while the other
does not. The force and torque exerted by the (often ignored) inhomogeneous
"S-type" portion is analyzed here for extended scalar charges in curved
spacetimes. If the geometry is sufficiently smooth, it is found to introduce
effective shifts in all multipole moments of the body's stress-energy tensor.
This greatly expands the validity of statements that the homogeneous R field
determines the self-force and self-torque up to renormalization effects. The
forces and torques exerted by the S field directly measure the degree to which
a spacetime fails to admit Killing vectors inside the body. A number of
mathematical results related to the use of generalized Killing fields are
therefore derived, and may be of wider interest. As an example of their
application, the effective shift in the quadrupole moment of a charge's
stress-energy tensor is explicitly computed to lowest nontrivial order.
