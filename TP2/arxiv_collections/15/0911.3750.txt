One of the challenges of adiabatic control theory is the proper inclusion of
the effects of dissipation. Here, we study the adiabatic dynamics of an open
two-level quantum system deriving a generalized master equation to consistently
account for the combined action of the driving and dissipation. We demonstrate
that in the zero temperature limit the ground state dynamics is not affected by
environment. As an example, we apply our theory to Cooper pair pumping which
demonstrates the robustness of ground state adiabatic evolution.
