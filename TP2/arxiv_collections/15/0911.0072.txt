Superconducting nanodrop model is constructed on the basis of the assumption
of equality of the free energy functional gradient term to zero due to the
order parameter value constancy in the superconducting nanodrop volume. In the
investigation, we have defined the superconducting nanodrop thermodynamical
characteristics: partition function, the magnitudes of the jumps in entropy and
specific heat at the second order phase transition, total energy, energy
fluctuation, specific heat, free energy, and entropy.
