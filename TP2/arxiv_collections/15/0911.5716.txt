Over the past 15 years, our knowledge of the interior of the Sun has
tremendously progressed by the use of helioseismic measurements. However, to go
further in our understanding of the solar core, we need to measure gravity (g)
modes. Thanks to the high quality of the Doppler-velocity signal measured by
GOLF/SoHO, it has been possible to unveil the signature of the asymptotic
properties of the solar g modes, thus obtaining a hint of the rotation rate in
the core. However, the quest for the detection of individual g modes is not yet
over. In this work, we apply the latest theoretical developments to guide our
research using GOLF velocity time series. In contrary to what was thought till
now, we are maybe starting to identify individual low-frequency g modes...
