An overview of selected topical problems on modelling oscillation properties
in solar-like stars is presented. High-quality oscillation data from both
space-borne intensity observations and ground-based spectroscopic measurements
provide first tests of the still-ill-understood, superficial layers in distant
stars. Emphasis will be given to modelling the pulsation dynamics of the
stellar surface layers, the stochastic excitation processes and the associated
dynamics of the turbulent fluxes of heat and momentum.
