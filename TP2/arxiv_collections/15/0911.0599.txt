In a certain sense riemannian geometry can be thought of as geometry built up
from the finslerian properties of point particles. The generalization of this
to where the geometry is built up from the finslerian properties of string and
membranes is investigated. Solely classical arguments suggest a physical
interpretation in which microscopic strings are directly related to macroscopic
geometry; alternatively the resulting geometry can be interpretated as that
describing microsopic spacetime.
