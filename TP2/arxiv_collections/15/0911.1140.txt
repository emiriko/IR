The electronic energy spectrum of graphene electron subjected to a
homogeneous magnetic field in the presence of a charged Coulomb impurity is
studied analytically within two-dimensional Dirac-Weyl picture by using
variational approach. The variational scheme we used is just based on utilizing
the exact eigenstates of two-dimensional Dirac fermion in the presence of a
uniform magnetic field as a basis for determining analytical energy eigenvalues
in the presence of an attractive/repulsive charged Coulomb impurity. This
approach allows us to determine under which conditions bound state solutions
can or can not exist in gapped graphene in the presence of magnetic field. In
addition, the effects of uniform magnetic field on the boundaries of
subcritical Coulomb impurity region in the massless limit are also analyzed.
Our analytical results show that the critical impurity strength decreases with
increasing gap/mass parameter, and also that it increases with increasing
magnetic field strength. In the massless limit, we investigate that the
critical Coulomb coupling strength is independent of magnetic field, and its
upper value for the ground-state energy is 0.752.
