In the Type II superstring the 4-point function for massless NS-NS bosons at
one-loop is well known [1][14]. The overall constant factor in this amplitude
is very important because it needs to satisfy the unitarity and S-duality
conditions [14]. This coefficient has not been computed in the pure spinor
formalism due to the difficulty to solve the integrals on the pure spinors
space. In this paper we compute it by using the non-minimal pure spinor
formalism and we will show that the answer is in perfect agreement with the one
given in [14].
