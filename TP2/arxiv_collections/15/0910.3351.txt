The classical Floquet theory deals with Floquet-Bloch solutions of periodic
PDEs (see e.g., P. Kuchment. Floquet Theory for Partial Differential Equations.
Basel: Birkhauser, 1993). Peter Kuchment developed as well a discrete version
of this theory for difference vector equations on lattices, including the
Floquet theory on infinite periodic graphs. Here we propose a variation on this
theory for matrix convolution operators acting on vector functions on lattices
with values in a field of positive characteristic.
