The production of bound kaon-nucleon-states (kaonic-cluster) in the reaction
$p+p\to [ppK^{-}] + K^{+}$ should be investigated in a dedicated measurement at
the FOPI detector system at the SIS-accelerator of GSI, by looking for the
decay $ppK^{-} \to p + \Lambda \to p + p + \pi^{-}$. To select the final
states, the detector system Si$\Lambda$ViO has been build up as a trigger for
$\Lambda$-Hyperons. This detector consists of two layers of segmented
silicon-strip-detectors, which are able to measure online the particle
multiplicity. These two layers are arranged such, that most of the
$\Lambda$-Hyperons will decay between them. The trigger signal is generated by
comparing online the hit multiplicity on the two layers.
