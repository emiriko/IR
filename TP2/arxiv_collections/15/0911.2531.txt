We study the dynamics of the solid to liquid transition for a model material
made of elastic particles immersed in a viscous fluid. The interaction between
particle surfaces includes their viscous lubrication, a sharp repulsion when
they get closer than a tuned steric length and their elastic deflection induced
by those two forces. We use Soft Dynamics to simulate the dynamics of this
material when it experiences a step increase in the shear stress and a constant
normal stress. We observe a long creep phase before a substantial flow
eventually establishes. We find that the typical creep time relies on an
internal relaxation process, namely the separation of two particles driven by
the applied stress and resisted by the viscous friction. This mechanism should
be relevant for granular pastes, living cells, emulsions and wet foams.
