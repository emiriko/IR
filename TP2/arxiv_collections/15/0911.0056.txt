It is argued that a typical many body energy eigenstate has a well defined
thermodynamic entropy and that individual eigenstates possess thermodynamic
characteristics analogous to those of generic isolated systems. We examine
large systems with eigenstate energies equivalent to finite temperatures. When
quasi-static evolution of a system is adiabatic (in the quantum mechanical
sense), two coupled subsystems can transfer heat from one subsystem to another
yet remain in an energy eigenstate. To explicitly construct the entropy from
the wave function, degrees of freedom are divided into two unequal parts. It is
argued that the entanglement entropy between these two subsystems is the
thermodynamic entropy per degree of freedom for the smaller subsystem. This is
done by tracing over the larger subsystem to obtain a density matrix, and
calculating the diagonal and off-diagonal contributions to the entanglement
entropy.
