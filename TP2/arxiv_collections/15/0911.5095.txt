Models with large extra dimensions predict the existence of Kaluza-Klein
graviton resonances. We compute the next-to-leading order QCD corrections to
graviton plus jet hadro-production, which is an important channel for graviton
searches at the Tevatron and the LHC. The QCD corrections are sizable and lead
to a significant reduction of the scale dependence. We present numerical
results for cross sections and distributions, and discuss the uncertainty from
parton distribution functions and the ultraviolet sensitivity of the
theoretical prediction.
