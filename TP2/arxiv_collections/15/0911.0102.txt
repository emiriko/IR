We investigate claims according to which the X-ray selection of AGN is not as
efficient compared to that based on [OIII] selection because of the effects of
X-ray absorption.We construct the predicted X-ray luminosity function both for
all Seyferts as well as separately for Seyfert-1 and Seyfert-2 type galaxies,
by combining the optical AGN [OIII] luminosity functions derived in SDSS with
the corresponding L_X-L_[OIII] relations. These relations are derived from
XMM-Newton observations of all Seyfert galaxies in the Palomar spectroscopic
sample of nearby galaxies after correction for X-ray absorption and optical
reddening. We compare the predicted X-ray luminosity functions with those
actually observed in the local Universe by HEAO-1, RXTE as well as INTEGRAL.
The last luminosity function is derived in the 17-60 keV region and thus is not
affected by absorption even in the case of Compton-thick sources. In the common
luminosity regions, the optically and X-ray selected Seyfert galaxies show
reasonable agreement. We thus find no evidence that the [OIII] selection
provides a more robust tracer of powerful AGN compared to the X-ray. Still, the
optical selection probes less luminous Seyferts compared to the current X-ray
surveys. These low luminosity levels, are populated by a large number of X-ray
unobscured Seyfert-2 galaxies.
