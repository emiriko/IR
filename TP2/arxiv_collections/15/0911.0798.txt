The ensemble of all star clusters in a galaxy constitutes its star cluster
system. In this review, the focus of the discussion is on the ability of star
clusters, particularly the systems of old massive globular clusters (GCSs), to
mark the early evolutionary history of galaxies. I review current themes and
key findings in GCS research, and highlight some of the outstanding questions
that are emerging from recent work.
