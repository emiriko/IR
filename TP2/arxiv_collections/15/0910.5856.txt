The matter effects for solar neutrino oscillations are studied in a general
scheme with an arbitrary number of sterile neutrinos, without any constraint on
the mixing, assuming only a realistic hierarchy of neutrino squared-mass
differences in which the smallest squared-mass difference is effective in solar
neutrino oscillations. The validity of the analytic results are illustrated
with a numerical solution of the evolution equation in three examples of the
possible mixing matrix in the simplest case of four-neutrino mixing.
