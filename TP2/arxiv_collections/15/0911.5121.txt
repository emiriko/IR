In Permalloy submicron triangles, configurational anisotropy - a higher-order
form of shape anisotropy - yields three equivalent easy axes, imposed by the
structures' symmetry order. Supported by micromagnetic simulations, an
experimental method was devised to evaluate the nanostructure dimensions for
which a Stoner-Wohlfarth type of reversal could be used to describe this
particular magnetic anisotropy. In this regime, a straightforward procedure
using an in-plane rotating field allowed us to quantify experimentally the
six-fold anisotropy fields for triangles of different thicknesses and sizes.
