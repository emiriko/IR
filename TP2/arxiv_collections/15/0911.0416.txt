We present three-dimensional simulations on a new mechanism for the
detonation of a sub-Chandrasekhar CO white dwarf in a dynamically unstable
system where the secondary is either a pure He white dwarf or a He/CO hybrid.
For dynamically unstable systems where the accretion stream directly impacts
the surface of the primary, the final tens of orbits can have mass accretion
rates that range from $10^{-5}$ to $10^{-3} M_{\odot}$ s$^{-1}$, leading to the
rapid accumulation of helium on the surface of the primary. After $\sim
10^{-2}$ $M_{\odot}$ of helium has been accreted, the ram pressure of the hot
helium torus can deflect the accretion stream such that the stream no longer
directly impacts the surface. The velocity difference between the stream and
the torus produces shearing which seeds large-scale Kelvin-Helmholtz
instabilities along the interface between the two regions. These instabilities
eventually grow into dense knots of material that periodically strike the
surface of the primary, adiabatically compressing the underlying helium torus.
If the temperature of the compressed material is raised above a critical
temperature, the timescale for triple-$\alpha$ reactions becomes comparable to
the dynamical timescale, leading to the detonation of the primary's helium
envelope. This detonation drives shockwaves into the primary which tend to
concentrate at one or more focal points within the primary's CO core. If a
relatively small amount of mass is raised above a critical temperature and
density at these focal points, the CO core may itself be detonated.
