We present potential detections of H-band scattered light emission around
four young star, selected from a total sample of 45 young stars observed with
the CIAO coronagraph of the Subaru telescope. Two CTTS, CI Tau and DI Cep, and
two WTTS, LkCa 14 and RXJ 0338.3+1020 were detected. In all four cases, the
extended emission is within the area of the residual PSF halo, and is revealed
only through careful data reduction. We compare the observed extended emission
with simulations of the scattered light emission, to evaluate the plausibility
and nature of the detected emission.
