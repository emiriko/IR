Idea markets are contexts where ideas compete for attention and people to
embrace them. They are near ubiquitous in the form of religions, political
parties, securities markets and the blogosphere to name a few. Most idea
markets are also communities where members alternate between being idea
consumers and producers. They are thus centers for collaborative knowledge
creation. Recent research extols the value of diverse perspectives among the
members of such groups, however these groups tend to form based on commonality
of idea preference, a basis that is thought to limit diversity. This study
investigates whether ideal levels of cognitive diversity can emerge in such
groups. It finds that general popularity among idea markets draws together
people with diverse perspectives, causing ideal levels of cognitive diversity
to emerge.
