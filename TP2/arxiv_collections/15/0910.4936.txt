We consider a scenario with an additional scalar standard model singlet
$\phi_S$, living in a single extra dimension of the RS1 background. The zero
mode of this scalar which is localized in the extra dimension is a dark matter
candidate and the annihilation cross section is strongly sensitive to its
localization parameter. As a second scenario, we assume that the standard model
Higgs field is accessible to the fifth flat extra dimension. At first we take
the additional standard model singlet scalar field as accessible to the sixth
extra dimension and its zero mode is a possible dark matter candidate. Second,
we consider that the new standard model singlet, the dark matter candidate,
lives in four dimensions. In both choices the KK modes of the standard model
Higgs field play an observable role for the large values of the
compactification radius $R$ and the effective coupling \lambda_{S} is of the
order of 10^{-2}-10^{-1} (10^{-6}) far from (near to) the resonant
annihilation.
