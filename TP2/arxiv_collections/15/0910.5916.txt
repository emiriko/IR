To solve the many-boson Schr\"odinger equation we utilize the
Multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree method for bosons (MCTDHB). To be
able to attack larger systems and/or to propagate the solution for longer
times, we implement a parallel version of the MCTDHB method thereby realizing
the recently proposed [Streltsov {\it et al.} arXiv:0910.2577v1] novel idea how
to construct efficiently the result of the action of the Hamiltonian on a
bosonic state vector. We study the real-space dynamics of repulsive bosonic
systems made of N=12, 51 and 3003 bosons in triple-well periodic potentials.
The ground state of this system is three-fold fragmented. By suddenly strongly
distorting the trap potential, the system performs complex many-body quantum
dynamics. At long times it reveals a tendency to an oscillatory behavior around
a threefold fragmented state. These oscillations are strongly suppressed and
damped by quantum depletions. In spite of the richness of the observed
dynamics, the three time-adaptive orbitals of MCTDHB(M=3) are capable to
describe the many-boson quantum dynamics of the system for short and
intermediate times. For longer times, however, more self-consistent
time-adaptive orbitals are needed to correctly describe the non-equilibrium
many-body physics. The convergence of the MCTDHB($M$) method with the number
$M$ of self-consistent time-dependent orbitals used is demonstrated.
