Measurements of small-scale turbulent fluctuations in the solar wind find a
non-zero right-handed magnetic helicity. This has been interpreted as evidence
for ion cyclotron damping. However, theoretical and empirical evidence suggests
that the majority of the energy in solar wind turbulence resides in low
frequency anisotropic kinetic Alfven wave fluctuations that are not subject to
ion cyclotron damping. We demonstrate that a dissipation range comprised of
kinetic Alfven waves also produces a net right-handed fluctuating magnetic
helicity signature consistent with observations. Thus, the observed magnetic
helicity signature does not necessarily imply that ion cyclotron damping is
energetically important in the solar wind.
