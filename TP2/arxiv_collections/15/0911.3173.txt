  We give a general simple definition of JSJ decompositions by means of a
universal maximality property. The JSJ decomposition should not be viewed as a
tree (which is not uniquely defined) but as a canonical deformation space of
trees. We prove that JSJ decompositions of finitely presented groups always
exist, without any assumption on edge groups. Many examples are given.
