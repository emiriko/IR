Social order does not exist as a stable phenomenon, but can be considered as
"an order of reproduced expectations." When anticipations operate upon one
another, they can generate a non-linear dynamics which processes meaning.
Although specific meanings can be stabilized, for example in social
institutions, all meaning arises from a global horizon of possible meanings.
Using Luhmann's (1984) social systems theory and Rosen's (1985) theory of
anticipatory systems, I submit algorithms for modeling the non-linear dynamics
of meaning in social systems. First, a self-referential system can use a model
of itself for the anticipation. Under the condition of functional
differentiation, the social system can be expected to entertain a set of
models; each model can also contain a model of the other models. Two
anticipatory mechanisms are then possible: a transversal one between the
models, and a longitudinal one providing the system with a variety of meanings.
A system containing two anticipatory mechanisms can become hyper-incursive.
Without making decisions, however, a hyper-incursive system would be overloaded
with uncertainty. Under this pressure, informed decisions tend to replace the
"natural preferences" of agents and a knowledge-based order can increasingly be
shaped.
