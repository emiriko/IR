Utilizing the Higgs Effective Theory, including dimension eight operators, in
conjuction with spinor-helicity and unitarity methods, I present analytic
expressions for the virtual corrections for $gg\to Hg$ and $q\overline{q}\to
Hg$ amplitudes at order $\alpha_s^2/m_t^3$. These contributions become enhanced
as the invariant final state mass increases.
