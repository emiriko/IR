Comet 133P/Elst-Pizarro is the first-known and currently best-characterised
member of the main-belt comets, a recently-identified class of objects that
exhibit cometary activity but which are dynamically indistinguishable from
main-belt asteroids. We report here on the results of a multi-year monitoring
campaign from 2003 to 2008, and present observations of the return of activity
in 2007. We find a pattern of activity consistent with the seasonal activity
modulation hypothesis proposed by Hsieh et al. (2004, AJ, 127, 2997).
Additionally, recomputation of phase function parameters using data in which
133P was inactive yields new IAU parameters of H_R=15.49+/-0.05 mag and
G_R=0.04+/-0.05, and linear parameters of m_R(1,1,0)=15.80+/-0.05 mag and
Beta=0.041+/-0.005 mag/deg. Comparison between predicted magnitudes using these
new parameters and the comet's actual brightnesses during its 2002 and 2007
active periods reveals the presence of unresolved coma during both episodes, on
the order of ~0.20 of the nucleus cross-section in 2002 and ~0.25 in 2007.
Multifilter observations during 133P's 2007 active outburst yield mean nucleus
colours of B-V=0.65+/-0.03 mag, V-R=0.36+/-0.01 mag, and R-I=0.32+/-0.01 mag,
with no indication of significant rotational variation, and similar colours for
the trail. Finally, while 133P's trail appears shorter and weaker in 2007 than
in 2002, other measures of activity strength such as dust velocity and coma
contamination of nucleus photometry are found to remain approximately constant.
We attribute changes in trail strength to the timing of observations and
projection effects, thus finding no evidence of any substantial decrease in
activity strength between 2002 and 2007.
