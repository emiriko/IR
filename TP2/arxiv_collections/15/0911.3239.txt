Hawking radiation from the black hole in Horava-Lifshitz gravity is discussed
by a reformulation of the tunneling method given in \cite{Banerjee:2008sn}.
Using a density matrix technique the radiation spectrum is derived which is
identical to that of a perfect black body. The temperature obtained here is
proportional to the surface gravity of the black hole as occurs in usual
Einstein gravity. The entropy is also derived by using the first law of black
hole thermodynamics. Finally, the spectrum of entropy/area is obtained. The
latter result is also discussed from the viewpoint of quasi-normal modes. Both
methods lead to an equispaced entropy spectrum, although the value of the
spacing is not the same. On the other hand, since the entropy is not
proportional to the horizon area of the black hole, the area spectrum is not
equidistant, a finding which also holds for the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory.
