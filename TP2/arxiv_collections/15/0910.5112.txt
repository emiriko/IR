The emergence of districts in nanotechnology represents a new pattern of
scientific development. The factors affecting their growth are analysed to
understand the drivers of economic development. By analyzing the top 200
nano-districts, Nanotrendchart sheds light on the clusterization process:
academic production is seen to be highly concentrated, with fifteen districts
representing over half of published articles; Asian districts are clearly
growing significantly faster than those elsewhere; and district growth in the
domain of engineering and physics is more rapid than in other disciplines.
Scientific diversity, actors diversity as well as the degree of openness of the
cluster influence their evolution. Highly specialised clusters witness lower
growth rates
