We consider canonical fibrations and algebraic geometric structures on
homogeneous CR manifolds, in connection with the notion of CR algebra. We give
applications to the classifications of left invariant CR structures on
semisimple Lie groups and of CR-symmetric structures on complete flag
varieties.
