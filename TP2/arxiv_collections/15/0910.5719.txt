White dwarf-neutron star binaries generate detectable gravitational
radiation. We construct Newtonian equilibrium models of corotational white
dwarf-neutron star (WDNS) binaries in circular orbit and find that these models
terminate at the Roche limit. At this point the binary will undergo either
stable mass transfer (SMT) and evolve on a secular time scale, or unstable mass
transfer (UMT), which results in the tidal disruption of the WD. The path a
given binary will follow depends primarily on its mass ratio. We analyze the
fate of known WDNS binaries and use population synthesis results to estimate
the number of LISA-resolved galactic binaries that will undergo either SMT or
UMT. We model the quasistationary SMT epoch by solving a set of simple ordinary
differential equations and compute the corresponding gravitational waveforms.
Finally, we discuss in general terms the possible fate of binaries that undergo
UMT and construct approximate Newtonian equilibrium configurations of merged
WDNS remnants. We use these configurations to assess plausible outcomes of our
future, fully relativistic simulations of these systems. If sufficient WD
debris lands on the NS, the remnant may collapse, whereby the gravitational
waves from the inspiral, merger, and collapse phases will sweep from LISA
through LIGO frequency bands. If the debris forms a disk about the NS, it may
fragment and form planets.
