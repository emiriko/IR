We study the impact of a fossil magnetic field on the physical quantities
which describe the structure of a young Sun of 500 Myr. We consider for the
first time a non force-free field composed of a mixture of poloidal and
toroidal magnetic fields and we propose a specific configuration to illustrate
our purpose. In the present paper, we estimate the relative role of the
different terms which appear in the modified stellar structure equations. We
note that the Lorentz tension plays a non negligible role in addition to the
magnetic pressure. This is interesting because most of the previous stellar
evolution codes ignored that term and the geometry of the field. The solar
structure perturbations are, as already known, small and consequently we have
been able to estimate each term semi-analytically. We develop a general
treatment to calculate the global modification of the structure and of the
energetic balance. We estimate also the gravitational multipolar moments
associated with the presence of a fossil large-scale magnetic field in
radiative zone. The values given for the young Sun help the future
implementation in stellar evolution codes. This work can be repeated for any
other field configuration and prepares the achievement of a solar MHD model
where we will follow the transport of such field on secular timescales and the
associated transport of momentum and chemicals. The described method will be
applied at the present Sun and the results will be compared with the coming
balloon or space measurements.
