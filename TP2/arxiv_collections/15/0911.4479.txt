We have undertaken a Parkes ammonia spectral line study, in the lowest two
inversion transitions, of southern massive star formation regions, including
young massive candidate protostars, with the aim of characterising the earliest
stages of massive star formation. 138 sources from the submillimetre continuum
emission studies of Hill et al., were found to have robust (1,1) detections,
including two sources with two velocity components, and 102 in the (2,2)
transition.
  We determine the ammonia line properties of the sources: linewidth, flux
density, kinetic temperature, NH$_3$ column density and opacity, and revisit
our SED modelling procedure to derive the mass for 52 of the sources. By
combining the continuum emission information with ammonia observations we
substantially constrain the physical properties of the high-mass clumps. There
is clear complementarity between ammonia and continuum observations for
derivations of physical parameters.
  The MM-only class, identified in the continuum studies of Hill et al.,
display smaller sizes, mass and velocity dispersion and/or turbulence than
star-forming clumps, suggesting a quiescent prestellar stage and/or the
formation of less massive stars.
