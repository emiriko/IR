We investigate the physical meaning of the prominent blue shifts of Ne VIII,
which is observed to be associated with quiet-Sun network junctions (boundary
intersections), through data analyses combining force-free-field extrapolations
with EUV spectroscopic observations. For a middle-latitude region, we
reconstruct the magnetic funnel structure in a sub-region showing faint
emission in EIT-Fe 195. This funnel appears to consist of several smaller
funnels that originate from network lanes, expand with height and finally merge
into a single wide open-field region. However, the large blue shifts of Ne VIII
are generally not associated with open fields, but seem to be associated with
the legs of closed magnetic loops. Moreover, in most cases significant upflows
are found in both of the funnel-shaped loop legs. These quasi-steady upflows
are regarded as signatures of mass supply to the coronal loops rather than the
solar wind. Our observational result also reveals that in many cases the
upflows in the upper transition region (TR) and the downflows in the middle TR
are not fully cospatial. Based on these new observational results, we suggest
different TR structures in coronal holes and in the quiet Sun.
