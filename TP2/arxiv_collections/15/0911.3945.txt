With increasing complexity of tourism business models and tasks, there is a
clear need of the next generation e-Tourism infrastructure to support flexible
automation, integration, computation, storage, and collaboration. Currently
several enabling technologies such as semantic Web, Web service, agent and grid
computing have been applied in the different e-Tourism applications, however
there is no a unified framework to be able to integrate all of them. So this
paper presents a promising e-Tourism framework based on emerging semantic grid,
in which a number of key design issues are discussed including architecture,
ontologies structure, semantic reconciliation, service and resource discovery,
role based authorization and intelligent agent. The paper finally provides the
implementation of the framework.
