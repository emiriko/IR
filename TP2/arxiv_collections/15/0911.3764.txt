A well known problem with EOP prediction is that a prediction strategy proved
to be the best for some testing period and prediction length may not remain as
such for other period of time. In this paper we consider possible strategies to
combine EOP predictions made using different analysis technique to obtain a
final prediction with the best accuracy corresponding to the least prediction
error between input predictions. This approach can be used to improve the
short-term real-time EOP forecast.
