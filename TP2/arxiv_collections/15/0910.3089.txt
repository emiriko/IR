Decays of ground state $B_{c}$-meson $B_{c}\to J/\psi+n\pi$ are considered.
Using existing parametrizations for $B_{c}\to J/\psi$ form-factors and
$W^{*}\to n\pi$ spectral functions we calculate branching fractions and
transferred momentum distributions of $B_{c}\to J/\psi+n\pi$ decays for
$n=1,2,3,4$. Inclusive decays $B_{c}\to J/\psi+\bar{u}d$ and polarization
asymmetries of final charmonium are also investigated. Presented in our article
results can be used to study form-factors of $B_{c}\to J/\psi$ transitions,
$\pi$-meson system spectral functions and give the opportunity to check the
factorization theorem.
