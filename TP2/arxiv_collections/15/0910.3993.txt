We theoretically discuss the magnetic-field-angle dependence of the
zero-energy density of states (ZEDOS) in superconductors. Point-node and
line-node superconducting gaps on spherical and cylindrical Fermi surfaces are
considered. The Doppler-shift (DS) method and the Kramer-Pesch approximation
(KPA) are used to calculate the ZEDOS. Numerical results show that consequences
of the DS method are corrected by the KPA.
