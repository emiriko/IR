The first quantitative evaluation of the quality of corporate firewall
configurations appeared in 2004, based on Check Point FireWall-1 rule-sets. In
general that survey indicated that corporate firewalls were often enforcing
poorly written rule-sets, containing many mistakes.
  The goal of this work is to revisit the first survey. The current study is
much larger. Moreover, for the first time, the study includes configurations
from two major vendors. The study also introduce a novel "Firewall Complexity"
(FC) measure, that applies to both types of firewalls.
  The findings of the current study indeed validate the 2004 study's main
observations: firewalls are (still) poorly configured, and a rule-set's
complexity is (still) positively correlated with the number of detected risk
items. Thus we can conclude that, for well-configured firewalls, ``small is
(still) beautiful''. However, unlike the 2004 study, we see no significant
indication that later software versions have fewer errors (for both vendors).
