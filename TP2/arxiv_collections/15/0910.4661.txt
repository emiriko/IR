We study spatiotemporal regularities of electoral results and turnout rates
for each municipality (or polling station) concerning French elections between
1992 and 2007. We try to account for the data using models based on a simple
imitation of agents in the vicinity. We also propose a model of an experiment
that shows how choices are modified by knowing the choices of others agents.
