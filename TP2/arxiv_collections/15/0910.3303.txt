It is made the attempt to explain why there exists a division between
internal symmetries referring to quantum numbers and external symmetries
referring to space-time within the description of relativistic quantum field
theories. It is hold the attitude that the symmetries of quantum theory are the
origin of both sorts of symmetries in nature. Since all quantum states can be
represented as a tensor product of two dimensional quantum objects, called ur
objects, which can be interpreted as quantum bits of information, described by
spinors reflecting already the symmetry properties of space-time, it seems to
be possible to justify such an attitude. According to this, space-time
symmetries can be considered as a consequence of a representation of quantum
states by quantum bits. Internal symmetries are assumed to refer to relations
of such fundamental objects, which are contained within the state of one single
particle, with respect to each other. In this sense the existence of space-time
symmetries, the existence of internal symmetries and their division could
obtain a derivation from quantum theory interpreted as a theory of information.
