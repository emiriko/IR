We compare extensive simulations of QCD with 8 and 12 flavors of degenerate
quarks, using the DBW2 gauge action, naive staggered fermions, and the rational
hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm. A variety of values of the coupling constant,
quark mass, and lattice size have been used. Our data suggests that, as the
bare coupling is decreased, a rapid cross-over, which dramatically changes the
lattice scale, exists with both 8 and 12 flavors. The scale change across this
cross-over is much larger with 12 flavors than it is with 8 flavors. All of the
observables we have measured, in both the zero and finite temperature systems,
are consistent with a chiral symmetry breaking phase for the zero temperature
theory on the weak coupling side of the rapid cross-over.
