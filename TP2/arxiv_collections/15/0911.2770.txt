Extreme-scale alignment of quasar optical polarization vectors at
cosmological scales ($z\le 2$) is also characterized by the rotation of mean
position angle $\chi$ with $\Delta \chi \approx 30^{\circ}$ per 1 Gpc. For
observing interval of $z$ the total rotation angle acquires the value $\sim
90^{\circ}$. We suggest the possible explanation of the half of this rotation
as a consequence of physical transformation of initially vertical magnetic
field ${\bf B}_{\|}$, directed along the normal ${\bf N}$ to the surface of
accretion disk, into the horizontal (perpendicular to ${\bf N}$) one. We found
asymptotical analytical expressions for axially averaged polarization degree
$p$ and mean position angle $\chi$ for various types of magnetized accretion
disks. We found also that during the evolution can be realized the case
$B_{\bot}\approx B_{\|}$ where position angle $\chi$ rotates from $45^{\circ}$
to zero. This rotation may occur during fairly great cosmological time
(corresponding to $\Delta z\sim 1-2$). The part of rotation $\sim \Delta \chi
\approx 45^{\circ}$ can be explained by a mechanism of alignment of
polarization vectors, say distribution of the part of quasars as a spiral in
the cosmic space with slow variation of rotation axis of corresponding
accretion disks. Both mechanisms are mutually related one with another.
