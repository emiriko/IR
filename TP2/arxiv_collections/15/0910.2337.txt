Accretion of dark energy onto black holes will take place when dark energy is
not a cosmological constant. It has been proposed that the time evolution of
the mass of the black holes in binary systems due to dark energy accretion
could be detectable by gravitational radiation. This would make it possible to
use observations of black hole binaries to measure local dark energy
properties, e.g., to determine the sign of 1+w where w is the dark energy
equation of state. In this Letter we show that such measurements are unfeasible
due to the low accretion rates.
