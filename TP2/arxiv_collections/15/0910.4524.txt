In this thesis we discuss some topics about topology and superstring
backgrounds with D-branes. We start with a mathematical review about
generalized homology and cohomology theories and the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral
sequence, in order to provide an explicit link between such a spectral sequence
and the Gysin map. Then we review the basic facts about line bundles and gerbes
with connection. In the second part of the thesis we apply the previous
material to study the geometry of type II superstring backgrounds. We first
present the cohomological discussion about D-brane charges in analogy with
classical electromagnetism, then we use the geometry of gerbes to discuss the
nature of the A-field and the B-field as follows from the Freed-Witten anomaly,
finally we discuss the K-theoretical approaches to classify D-brane charges. In
the last part we discuss some topics about spinors and pinors, with particular
attention to non-orientable manifolds.
