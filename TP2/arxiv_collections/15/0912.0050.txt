Ultracold dysprosium gases, with a magnetic moment ten times that of alkali
atoms and equal only to terbium as the most magnetic atom, are expected to
exhibit a multitude of fascinating collisional dynamics and quantum dipolar
phases, including quantum liquid crystal physics. We report the first laser
cooling and trapping of half a billion Dy atoms using a repumper-free
magneto-optical trap (MOT) and continuously loaded magnetic confinement, and we
characterize the trap recycling dynamics for bosonic and fermionic isotopes.
The first inelastic collision measurements in the few partial wave, 100 uK to 1
mK, regime are made in a system possessing a submerged open electronic f-shell.
In addition, we observe unusual stripes of intra-MOT <10 uK sub-Doppler cooled
atoms.
