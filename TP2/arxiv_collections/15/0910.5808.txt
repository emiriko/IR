A random phase property establishing a link between quasi-one-dimensional
random Schroedinger operators and full random matrix theory is advocated.
Briefly summarized it states that the random transfer matrices placed into a
normal system of coordinates act on the isotropic frames and lead to a Markov
process with a unique invariant measure which is of geometric nature. On the
elliptic part of the transfer matrices, this measure is invariant under the
full hermitian symplectic group of the universality class under study. While
the random phase property can up to now only be proved in special models or in
a restricted sense, we provide strong numerical evidence that it holds in the
Anderson model of localization. A main outcome of the random phase property is
a perturbative calculation of the Lyapunov exponents which shows that the
Lyapunov spectrum is equidistant and that the localization lengths for large
systems in the unitary, orthogonal and symplectic ensemble differ by a factor 2
each. In an Anderson-Ando model on a tubular geometry with magnetic field and
spin-orbit coupling, the normal system of coordinates is calculated and this is
used to derive explicit energy dependent formulas for the Lyapunov spectrum.
