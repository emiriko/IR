The strong decay properties of the newly observed states $D_{sJ}(3040)$,
$D_{sJ}(2860)$ and $D_{sJ}(2710)$ are studied in a constituent quark model with
quark-meson effective Lagrangians. We find that the $D_{sJ}(3040)$ could be
identified as the low mass physical state $|2{P_1}>_L$ ($J^P=1^+$) from the
$D_{s}(2^1P_1)$-$D_{s}(2^3P_1)$ mixing. The $D_{sJ}(2710)$ is likely to be the
low-mass mixed state $|(SD)>_L$ via the $1^3D_1$-$2^3S_1$ mixing. In our model,
the $D_{sJ}(2860)$ cannot be assigned to any single state with a narrow width
and compatible partial widths to $DK$ and $D^*K$. Thus, we investigate a
two-state scenario as proposed in the literature. In our model, one resonance
is likely to be the $1^3D_3$ ($J^P=3^-$), which mainly decays into $DK$. The
other resonance seems to be the $|1{D_2}'>_H$, i.e. the high-mass state in the
$1^1D_2$-$1^3D_2$ mixing with $J^P=2^-$, of which the $D^*K$ channel is its key
decay mode. We also discuss implications arising from these assignments and
give predictions for their partner states such as $|(SD)'>_H$, $|2{P'_1}>_H$,
$2^3P_0$ and $2^3P_2$, which could be helpful for the search for these new
states in future experiment.
