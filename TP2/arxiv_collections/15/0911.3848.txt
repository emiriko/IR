We study the finite temperature behavior of light scalar and pseudoscalar
meson properties in the context of a three-flavor nonlocal chiral quark model.
The model includes mixing with active strangeness degrees of freedom, and takes
care of the effect of gauge interactions by coupling the quarks with the
Polyakov loop. We analyze the chiral restoration and deconfinement transitions,
as well as the temperature dependence of meson masses, mixing angles and decay
constants. The critical temperature is found to be T_c = 202 MeV, in better
agreement with lattice results than the value recently obtained in the local
SU(3) PNJL model. It is seen that above T_c pseudoscalar meson masses get
increased, becoming degenerate with the masses of their chiral partners. The
temperatures at which this matching occurs depend on the strange quark
composition of the corresponding mesons. The topological susceptibility shows a
sharp decrease after the chiral transition, signalling the vanishing of the
U(1)_A anomaly for large temperatures.
