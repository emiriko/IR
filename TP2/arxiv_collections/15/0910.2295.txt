We review latest experimental results on the Bs mixing and lifetime
difference measurements at CDF. We report on the latest beta_s and dGamma_s
results from Bs->J/psi phi. We also discuss flavor specific dGamma_s
measurements, including information from hadronic channels, Bs->DsDs and
Bs->KK. We describe the new flavor tagging methodology and its calibration
using the Bs oscillations.
