At high energies, elastic hadronic cross sections are believed to be
dominated by vacuum exchange. In leading order of the leading $1/N_c$ expansion
this exchange process has been identified as the BFKL {\em Pomeron} or its
strong AdS dual the closed string graviton \cite{Brower:2006ea}. However
difference of particle anti-particle cross sections are given by a so-called
{\em Odderon} carrying C = -1 quantum numbers identified in weak coupling with
odd numbers of exchanged gluons. Here we show that the dual description
associates this with the Neveu-Schwartz ($B_{\mu\nu}$) sector of closed string
theory. We also discuss the extension of the strong coupling treatment to
central diffractive Higgs production at LHC.
