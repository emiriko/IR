We study interfaces between graphene and graphane. If the interface is
oriented along a zigzag direction, edge states are found which exhibit a strong
amplification of effects related to the spin-orbit interaction. The enhanced
spin splitting of the edge states allows a conversion between valley
polarization and spin polarization at temperatures near one Kelvin. We show
that these edge states give rise to quantum spin and/or valley Hall effects.
