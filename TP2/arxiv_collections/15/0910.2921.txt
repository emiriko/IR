We discuss the status of our ongoing efforts to improve on our calculation of
the $D_s$ decay constant. We show preliminary results on the ratio of the charm
to the strange quark mass. We also present preliminary results for
spectroscopy, decay constants and bottom quark mass obtained by performing
calculations with highly improved staggered quarks at masses above the c mass
and close to the b mass.
