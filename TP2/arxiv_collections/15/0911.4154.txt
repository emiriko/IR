The discovery of Main Belt Comets (MBCs) has raised many questions regarding
the origin and activation mechanism of these objects. Results of a study of the
dynamics of these bodies suggest that MBCs were formed in-situ as the remnants
of the break-up of large icy asteroids. Simulations show that similar to the
asteroids in the main belt, MBCs with orbital eccentricities smaller than 0.2
and inclinations lower than 25 degrees have stable orbits implying that many
MBCs with initially larger eccentricities and inclinations might have been
scattered to other regions of the asteroid belt. Among scattered MBCs,
approximately 20 percent reach the region of terrestrial planets where they
might have contributed to the accumulation of water on Earth. Simulations also
show that collisions among MBCs and small objects could have played an
important role in triggering the cometary activity of these bodies. Such
collisions might have exposed sub-surface water ice which sublimated and
created thin atmospheres and tails around MBCs. This paper discusses the
results of numerical studies of the dynamics of MBCs and their implications for
the origin of these objects. The results of a large numerical modeling of the
collisions of m-sized bodies with km-sized asteroids in the outer part of the
asteroid belt are also presented and the viability of the collision-triggering
activation scenario is discussed.
