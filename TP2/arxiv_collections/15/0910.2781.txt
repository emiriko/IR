The impact of stout-link smearing in lattice fermion actions is examined
through the consideration of the mass and renormalization functions of the
overlap quark propagator over a variety of smeared configurations. Up to six
sweeps of stout-link smearing are investigated. For heavy quark masses, the
quark propagator is strongly affected by the smearing procedure. For moderate
masses, the effect appears to be negligible. A small effect is seen for light
quark masses, where dynamical mass generation is suppressed through the
smearing procedure.
