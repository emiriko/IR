We present new long-baseline spectro-interferometric observations of the
HerbigAe star HD163296 obtained in the H and K bands with the AMBER instrument
at VLTI. The observations cover a range of spatial resolutions between 3 and 12
milli-arcseconds, with a spectral resolution of ~30. With a total of 1481
visibilities and 432 closure phases, they result in the best (u,v) coverage
achieved on a young star so far. The circumstellar material is resolved at the
sub-AU spatial scale and closure phase measurements indicate a small but
significant deviation from point-symmetry. We discuss the results assuming that
the near-infrared excess in HD163296 is dominated by the emission of a
circumstellar disk. A successful fit to the spectral energy distribution,
near-infrared visibilities and closure phases is found with a model where a
dominant contribution to the H and K band emissions arises from an optically
thin, smooth and point-symmetric region extending from about 0.1 to 0.45 AU. At
the latter distance from the star, silicates condense, the disk becomes
optically thick and develops a puffed-up rim, whose skewed emission can account
for the non-zero closure phases. We discuss the nature of the inner disk
emission and tentatively rule out dense molecular gas as well as optically thin
atomic or ionized gas as its possible origin. We propose instead that the inner
emission traces the presence of very refractory grains in a partially cleared
region, extending at least to 0.5 AU. If so, we may be observing the disk of
HD163296 just before it reaches the transition disk phase. However, we note
that the nature of the refractory grains or even the possibility for any grain
to survive at the very high temperatures we require (~2100-2300 K at 0.1 AU
from the star) is unclear and should be investigated further.
