The main objective of the research is to introduce a biologically inspired
execution framework for workflow systems under threat due to some intrusion
attack. Usually vulnerable systems need to be stop and put into wait state,
hence to insure the data security and privacy while being recovered. This
research ensures the availability of services and data to the end user by
keeping the data security, privacy and integrity intact. To achieve the
specified goals, the behavior of chameleons and concept of hibernation has been
considered in combination. Hence the workflow systems become more robust using
biologically inspired methods and remain available to the business consumers
safely even in a vulnerable state.
