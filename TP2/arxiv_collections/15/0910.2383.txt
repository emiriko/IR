Reported observations in H-alpha, Ca II H and K or or other chromospheric
lines of coronal rain trace back to the days of the Skylab mission. Offering a
high contrast in intensity with respect to the background (either bright in
emission if observed at the limb, or dark in absorption if observed on disk)
these cool blobs are often observed falling down from high coronal heights
above active regions. A physical explanation for this spectacular phenomenon
has been put forward thanks to numerical simulations of loops with footpoint
concentrated heating, a heating scenario in which cool condensations naturally
form in the corona. This effect has been termed 'catastrophic cooling' and is
the predominant explanation for coronal rain. In this work we further
investigate the link between this phenomenon and the heating mechanisms acting
in the corona. We start by analyzing observations of coronal rain at the limb
in the Ca II H line performed by the SOT instrument on board of the Hinode
satellite. We then compare the observations with 1.5-dimensional MHD
simulations of loops being heated by small-scale discrete events concentrated
towards the footpoints (that could come, for instance, from magnetic
reconnection events), and by Alfven waves generated at the photosphere. It is
found that if a loop is heated predominantly from Alfven waves coronal rain is
inhibited due to the characteristic uniform heating they produce. Hence coronal
rain may not only point to the spatial distribution of the heating in coronal
loops but also to the agent of the heating itself. We thus propose coronal rain
as a marker for coronal heating mechanisms.
