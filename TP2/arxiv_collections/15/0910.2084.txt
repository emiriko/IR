We present a framework for analyzing luminescence regulation during quorum
sensing in the bioluminescent bacterium \emph{Vibrio harveyi}. Using a
simplified model for signal transduction in the quorum sensing pathway, we
identify key dimensionless parameters that control the system's response. These
parameters are estimated using experimental data on luminescence phenotypes for
different mutant strains. The corresponding model predictions are consistent
with results from other experiments which did not serve as inputs for
determining model parameters. Furthermore, the proposed framework leads to
novel testable predictions for luminescence phenotypes and for responses of the
network to different perturbations.
