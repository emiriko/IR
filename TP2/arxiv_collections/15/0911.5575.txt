Charge Coupled Devices (CCDs) have been successfully used in several high
energy physics experiments over the past two decades. Their high spatial
resolution and thin sensitive layers make them an excellent tool for studying
short-lived particles. The Linear Collider Flavour Identification (LCFI)
Collaboration has been developing Column-Parallel CCDs for the vertex detector
of a future Linear Collider which can be read out many times faster than
standard CCDs. The most recent studies are of devices designed to reduce both
the CCD's intergate capacitance and the clock voltages necessary to drive it. A
comparative study of measured Charge Transfer Inefficiency values between our
previous and new results for a range of operating temperatures is presented.
