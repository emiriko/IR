Some aspects of weak sufficiency of quantum statistics are investigated. In
particular, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a
weakly sufficient statistic for a given family of vector states, investigate
the problem of its minimality, and find the relation between weak sufficiency
and other notions of sufficiency employed so far.
