Context: Turbulent deflagrations of Chandrasekhar mass White Dwarfs are
commonly used to model Type Ia Supernova explosions. In this context, rapid
rotation of the progenitor star is plausible but has so far been neglected.
Aims: The aim of this work is to explore the influence of rapid rotation on the
deflagration scenario. Methods: We use three dimensional hydrodynamical
simulations to model turbulent deflagrations ignited within a variety of
rapidly rotating CO WDs obeying rotation laws suggested by accretion studies.
Results: We find that rotation has a significant impact on the explosion. The
flame develops a strong anisotropy with a preferred direction towards the
stellar poles, leaving great amounts of unburnt matter along the equatorial
plane. Conclusions: The large amount of unburnt matter is contrary to observed
spectral features of SNe Ia. Thus, rapid rotation of the progenitor star and
the deflagration scenario are incompatible in order to explain SNe Ia.
