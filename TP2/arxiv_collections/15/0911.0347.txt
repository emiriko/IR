We derive out a complete series expression of Hamiltonian eigenvalues without
any approximation and cut in the general quantum systems based on Wang's formal
framework \cite{wang1}. In particular, we then propose a calculating approach
of eigenvalues of arbitrary Hamiltonian via solving an algebra equation
satisfied by a kernal function, which involves the contributions from all order
perturbations. In order to verify the validity of our expressions and reveal
the power of our approach, we calculate the ground state energy of a quartic
anharmonic oscillator and have obtained good enough results comparing with the
known one.
