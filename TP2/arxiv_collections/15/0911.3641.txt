From its inception, a large part of the motivation for Cognitive Science has
been the need for an interdisciplinary journal for the study of minds and
intelligent systems. One threat to the interdisciplinarity of Cognitive
Science, both the field and journal, is that it may become, or already be, too
dominated by psychologists. In 2005, psychology was a keyword for 51% of
submissions, followed distantly by linguistics (17%), artificial intelligence
(13%), neuroscience (10%), computer science (9%), and philosophy (8%). The
Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) gathers data not only on how
individual articles cite one another, but also on macroscopic citation patterns
among journals. Journals or sets of journals can be considered as proxies for
fields. As fields become established, they often create journals. By studying
the patterns of citations among journals that cite and are cited by Cognitive
Science, we can better: 1) appreciate the scholarly ecology surrounding the
journal and the journals role within this ecology, 2) establish competitor and
alternate journals, and 3) determine the natural clustering of fields related
to cognitive science.
