We investigate the quantum versions of a one-dimensional random walk, whose
corresponding Markov Chain is of order 2. This corresponds to the walk having a
memory of up to two previous steps. We derive the amplitudes and probabilities
for these walks, and point out how they differ from both classical random
walks, and quantum walks without memory.
