The development of cosmic ray air showers can be influenced by atmospheric
electric fields. Under fair weather conditions these fields are small, but the
strong fields inside thunderstorms can have a significant effect on the
electromagnetic component of a shower. Understanding this effect is
particularly important for radio detection of air showers, since the radio
emission is produced by the shower electrons and positrons. We perform Monte
Carlo simulations to calculate the effects of different electric field
configurations on the shower development. We find that the electric field
becomes important for values of the order of 1 kV/cm. Not only can the energy
distribution of electrons and positrons change significantly for such field
strengths, it is also possible that runaway electron breakdown occurs at high
altitudes, which is an important effect in lightning initiation.
