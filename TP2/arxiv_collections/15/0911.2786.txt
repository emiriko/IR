This talk briefly explains how the breaking of a Lorentz-invariant
description of nature at tiny space-time intervals might affect the
non-Gaussian character of the primordial fluctuations left by inflation. For
example, a model that contains irrelevant operators that only preserve the
spatial symmetries along constant-time surfaces can generate a larger
non-Gaussian component in the pattern of primordial fluctuations than is
ordinarily predicted by inflation. This property can be useful for constraining
models that allow some Lorentz violation at short distances, beyond the
constraints possible from the power spectrum alone.
