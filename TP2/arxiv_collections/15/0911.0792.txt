I discuss the chemical evolution of star clusters, with emphasis on old
globular clusters, in relation to their formation histories. Globular clusters
clearly formed in a complex fashion, under markedly different conditions from
any younger clusters presently known. Those special conditions must be linked
to the early formation epoch of the Galaxy and must not have occurred since.
While a link to the formation of globular clusters in dwarf galaxies has been
suggested, present-day dwarf galaxies are not representative of the
gravitational potential wells within which the globular clusters formed.
Instead, a formation deep within the proto-Galaxy or within dark-matter
minihaloes might be favoured. Not all globular clusters may have formed and
evolved similarly. In particular, we may need to distinguish Galactic halo from
Galactic bulge clusters.
