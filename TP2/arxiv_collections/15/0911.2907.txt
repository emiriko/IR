We provide a recursive description of the signatures realizable on the
standard basis by a holographic algorithm. The description allows us to prove
tight bounds on the size of planar matchgates and efficiently test for standard
signatures. Over finite fields, it allows us to count the number of n-bit
standard signatures and calculate their expected sparsity.
