The propagation of pressure fronts (impact solutions) in 1D chains of atoms
coupled by anharmonic potentials between nearest neighbor and submitted to
damping forces preserving uniform motion, is investigated. Travelling fronts
between two regions at different uniform pressures are found numerically and
well approximate analytically. It is proven that there are three analytical
relations between the impact velocity, the compression, the front velocity and
the energy dissipation which only depend on the coupling potential and are
\textit{independent} of the damping. Such travelling front solutions cannot
exist without damping.
