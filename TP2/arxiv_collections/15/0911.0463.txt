This report summarizes the present knowledge on discharges in micropattern
and small gap gaseous detectors and the physical mechanisms involved. These
include the space-charge (Raether's) limit, rate-induced breakdown, cathode
excitation effect and electron emission from the cathodes in the form of jets,
inter-GEM breakdown in multistep configurations and finally surface streamers.
