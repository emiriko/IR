We prove that, for any real $\lambda$, the system $-\Delta u +\lambda u =
u^3-\beta uv^2$, $ -\Delta v+\lambda v =v^3-\beta vu^2$, $ u,v\in
H^1_0(\Omega),$ where $\Omega$ is a bounded smooth domain of $R^3$, admits a
bounded family of positive solutions $(u_{\beta}, v_{\beta})$ as $\beta \to
+\infty$. An upper bound on the number of nodal sets of the weak limits of
difference $u_{\beta}-v_{\beta}$ is also provided. Moreover, for any
sufficiently large fixed value of $\beta >0$ the system admits infinitely many
positive solutions.
