On the base of the distinction between covariant and contravariant metric
tensor components, a new (multivariable) cubic algebraic equation for
reparametrization invariance of the gravitational Lagrangian has been derived
and parametrized with complicated non - elliptic functions, depending on the
(elliptic) Weierstrass function and its derivative. This is different from
standard algebraic geometry, where only two-dimensional cubic equations are
parametrized with elliptic functions and not multivariable ones.
  Physical applications of the approach have been considered in reference to
theories with extra dimensions. The s.c. "length function" l(x) has been
introduced and found as a solution of quasilinear differential equations in
partial derivatives for two different cases of "compactification + rescaling"
and "rescaling + compactification". New physically important relations
(inequalities) between the parameters in the action are established, which
cannot be derived in the case $l=1$ of the standard gravitational theory, but
should be fulfilled also for that case.
