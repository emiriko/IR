We demonstrate experimentally an air-slot mode-gap photonic crystal cavity
with quality factor of 15,000 and modal volume of 0.02 cubic wavelengths, based
on the design of an air-slot in a width-modulated line-defect in a photonic
crystal slab. The origin of the high Q air-slot cavity mode is the mode-gap
effect from the slotted photonic crystal waveguide mode with negative
dispersion. The high Q cavities with ultrasmall mode volume are important for
applications such as cavity quantum electrodynamics, nonlinear optics and
optical sensing.
