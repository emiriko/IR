The exciting possibility of direct observation of QCD instantons in heavy-ion
collisions has recently been proposed by Kharzeev. The underlying phenomenon,
known as the chiral magnetic effect, may have been observed recently at RHIC,
and a first principles calculation is needed to confirm and understand the
results. The chiral magnetic effect is thought to be visible in the symmetric
phase, at temperatures above the QCD critical temperature, and in the presence
of an external magnetic field. We report on first 2+1 flavor, domain wall
fermion, QCD+QED dynamical simulations above the critical temperature, in a
fixed topological sector(s), which are used to study the electric charge
separation produced by the effect.
