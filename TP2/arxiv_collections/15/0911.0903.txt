In this paper we are interested in functionals defined on completely
distributive lattices and which are invariant under mappings preserving
{arbitrary} joins and meets. We prove that the class of nondecreasing invariant
functionals coincides with the class of Sugeno integrals associated with
$\{0,1\}$-valued capacities, the so-called term functionals, thus extending
previous results both to the infinitary case as well as to the realm of
completely distributive lattices. Furthermore, we show that, in the case of
functionals over complete chains, the nondecreasing condition is redundant.
Characterizations of the class of Sugeno integrals, as well as its superclass
comprising all polynomial functionals, are provided by showing that the
axiomatizations (given in terms of homogeneity) of their restriction to
finitary functionals still hold over completely distributive lattices. We also
present canonical normal form representations of polynomial functionals on
completely distributive lattices, which appear as the natural extensions to
their finitary counterparts, and as a by-product we obtain an axiomatization of
complete distributivity in the case of bounded lattices.
