We study the chiral condensate $<\bar{\psi} \psi>$ for an SU(3) gauge theory
with $N_f$ massless Dirac fermions in the fundamental representation when $N_f$
is increased from 2 to 6. For $N_f=2$, our lattice simulations of $<\bar{\psi}
\psi >/F^3$, where $F$ is the Nambu-Goldstone-boson decay constant, agree with
the measured QCD value. For $N_f = 6$, this ratio shows significant
enhancement, presaging an even larger enhancement anticipated as $N_f$
increases further, toward the critical value for transition from confinement to
infrared conformality.
