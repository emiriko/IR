The preliminary results of new photometric observations of the $\delta$ Scuti
stars 7 Aql and 8 Aql are reported. 51 hr of $uvby-\beta$ photoelectric
photometric data were obtained over the period June and July 2007 at the San
Pedro M\'artir Observatory, Mexico. Period analyses confirm the three pulsation
modes discovered in 8 Aql in the framework of the STEPHI 2003 multisite
campaign. For the star 7 Aql we were able to detect only the main pulsation
modes. The standard magnitudes of both stars are obtained.
  The frequency, amplitude and phases of the frequency modes in different
filters are presented.
