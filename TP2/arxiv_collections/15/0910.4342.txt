Many cryptographic protocols are intended to coordinate state changes among
principals. Exchange protocols coordinate delivery of new values to the
participants, e.g. additions to the set of values they possess. An exchange
protocol is fair if it ensures that delivery of new values is balanced: If one
participant obtains a new possession via the protocol, then all other
participants will, too. Fair exchange requires progress assumptions, unlike
some other protocol properties. The strand space model is a framework for
design and verification of cryptographic protocols. A strand is a local
behavior of a single principal in a single session of a protocol. A bundle is a
partially ordered global execution built from protocol strands and adversary
activities. The strand space model needs two additions for fair exchange
protocols. First, we regard the state as a multiset of facts, and we allow
strands to cause changes in this state via multiset rewriting. Second, progress
assumptions stipulate that some channels are resilient-and guaranteed to
deliver messages-and some principals are assumed not to stop at certain
critical steps. This method leads to proofs of correctness that cleanly
separate protocol properties, such as authentication and confidentiality, from
invariants governing state evolution. G. Wang's recent fair exchange protocol
illustrates the approach.
