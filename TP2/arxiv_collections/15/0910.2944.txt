We study thermoelectric properties of inhomogeneous nanogranular materials
for weak tunneling conductance between the grains, g_t < 1. We calculate the
thermopower and figure of merit taking into account the shift of the chemical
potential and the asymmetry of the density of states in the vicinity of the
Fermi surface. We show that the weak coupling between the grains leads to a
high thermopower and low thermal conductivity resulting in relatively high
values of the figure of merit on the order of one. We estimate the temperature
at which the figure of merit has its maximum value for two- and
three-dimensional samples. Our results are applicable for many emerging
materials, including artificially self-assembled nanoparticle arrays.
