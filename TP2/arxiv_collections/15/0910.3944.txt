We report the most accurate X-ray position of the X-ray source in the giant
globular cluster G1 in M31 by using the Chandra X-ray Observatory, Hubble Space
Telescope (HST), and Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT). G1 is clearly
detected with Chandra and by cross-registering with HST and CFHT images, we
derive a 1-sigma error radius of 0.15 arcsec, significantly smaller than the
previous measurement by XMM-Newton. We conclude that the X-ray emission of G1
is likely to come from within the core radius of the cluster. We have
considered a number of possibilities for the origin of the X-ray emission but
can rule all but two scenarios out: it could be due to either accretion onto a
central intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH), or an ordinary low-mass X-ray
binary (LMXB). Based on the X-ray luminosity and the Bondi accretion rate, an
IMBH accreting from the cluster gas seems unlikely and we suggest that the
X-rays are due to accretion from a companion. Alternatively, the probability
that a 1.5 solar masses cluster LMXB lies within the 95 per cent X-ray error
circle is about 0.7. Therefore we cannot rule out a single LMXB as the origin
of the X-ray emission. While we cannot distinguish between different models
with current observations, future high-resolution and high-sensitivity radio
imaging observations will reveal whether there is an IMBH at the centre of G1.
