We report the discovery with Fermi/LAT of gamma-ray emission from three
radio-loud narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies: PKS 1502+036 (z=0.409), 1H 0323+342
(z=0.061) and PKS 2004-447 (z=0.24). In addition to PMN J0948+0022 (z=0.585),
the first source of this type to be detected in gamma rays, they may form an
emerging new class of gamma-ray active galactic nuclei (AGN). These findings
can have strong implications on our knowledge about relativistic jets and the
unified model of AGN.
