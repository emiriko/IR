We demonstrate that quantum well states (QWS) of thin Pb films are highly
perturbed within the proximity of intrinsic film defects. Scanning Tunneling
Spectroscopy (STM/STS) measurements indicate that the energy of these states
have a strong distance dependence within 4 nm of the defect with the strongest
energetic fluctuations equaling up to 100 meV. These localized perturbations
show large spatially-dependent asymmetries in the LDOS around the defect site
for each corresponding quantum well state. These energetic fluctuations can be
described by a simple model which accounts for fluctuations in the confinement
potential induced by topographic changes.
