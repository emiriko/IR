Based on recent work on the asymptotic behavior of controlled quantum
Markovian dynamics, we show that any generic quantum state can be stabilized by
devising constructively a simple Lindblad-GKS generator that can achieve global
asymptotic stability at the desired state. The applications of such result is
demonstrated by designing a direct feedback strategy that achieves global
stabilization of a qubit state encoded in a noise-protected subspace.
