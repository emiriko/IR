Laser exposure of suspension of either gold or palladium nanoparticles in
aqueous solutions of UO2Cl2 of natural isotope abundance was experimentally
studied. Picosecond Nd:YAG lasers at peak power from 1011 to 1013 W/cm2 at the
wavelength of 1064 and 355 nm were used as well as a visible-range Cu vapor
laser at peak power of 1010 W/cm2. The composition of colloidal solutions
before and after laser exposure was analyzed using atomic absorption and gamma
spectroscopy between 0.06 and 1 MeV range of photon energy. A real-time
gamma-spectroscopy was used to characterize the kinetics of nuclear reactions
during laser exposure. It was found that laser exposure initiated nuclear
reactions involving both 238U and 235U nuclei via different channels in H2O and
D2O. The influence of saturation of both the liquid and nanoparticles by
gaseous H2 and D2 on the kinetics of nuclear transformations was found.
Possible mechanisms of observed processes are discussed.
