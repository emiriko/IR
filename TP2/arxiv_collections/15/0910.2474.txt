We take prior-to-crash market prices (NASDAQ, Dow Jones Industrial Average)
as a signal, a function of time, we project these discrete values onto a
vertical axis, thus obtaining a Cantordust. We study said cantordust with the
tools of multifractal analysis, obtaining spectra by definition and by
lagrangian coordinates. These spectra have properties that typify the
prior-to-crash market situation. Any of these spectra entail elaborate
processing of the raw signal data. With the unprocessed raw data we obtain an
instability index, also with properties that typify the prior-to-crisis market
situation. Both spectra and the instability index agree in characterizing such
crashes, and in giving an early warning of them.
