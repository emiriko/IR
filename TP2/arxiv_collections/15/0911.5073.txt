Several authors have recently argued that a satisfactory inflationary
scenario can be implemented in the Standard Model (SM) by introducing a strong
non-minimal coupling of the Higgs doublet to gravity. It is shown here that
type I seesaw physics containing right handed neutrinos at intermediate scales
can have a significant impact on the inflationary predictions of these models.
For one such model, values of the scalar spectral index lower than the tree
level prediction of 0.968 are realized for plausible values of the seesaw
parameters and a SM Higgs boson mass close to 130 GeV. A precise measurement of
n_s by PLANCK, as well as measurement of the Higgs boson mass by LHC should
provide stringent tests of this SM based inflationary scenario supplemented by
type I seesaw physics.
