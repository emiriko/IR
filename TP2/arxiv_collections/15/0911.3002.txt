In this paper, the honeycomb Hubbard model in optical lattices is
investigated using O(3) non-linear sigma model. A possible quantum non-magnetic
insulator in a narrow parameter region is found near the metal-insulator
transition. We study the corresponding dynamics of magnetic properties, and
find that the narrow region could be widened by hole doping.
