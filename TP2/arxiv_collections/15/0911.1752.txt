In order to better understand the origin of multiple quantum transitions
observed in superparamagnetic nanoparticles, electron magnetic resonance (EMR)
studies have been performed on iron oxide nanoparticles assembled inside the
anodic alumina membrane. The positions of both the main resonance and
"forbidden" (double-quantum, 2Q) transitions observed at the half-field
demonstrate the characteristic angular dependence with the line shifts
proportional to 3cos2q-1, where q is the angle between the channel axis and
external magnetic field B. This result can be attributed to the interparticle
dipole-dipole interactions within elongated aggregates inside the channels. The
angular dependence of the 2Q intensity is found to be proportional to
sin2qcos2q, that is consistent with the predictions of quantum-mechanical
calculations with the account for the mixing of states by non-secular
inter-particle dipole-dipole interactions. Good agreement is demonstrated
between different kinds of measurements (magnetization curves, line shifts and
2Q intensity), evidencing applicability of the quantum approach to the
magnetization dynamics of superparamagnetic objects.
