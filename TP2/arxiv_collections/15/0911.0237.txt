The effects of non-adiabatic and Coriolis couplings on the bound states of
the He(2 ^3S_1)+He(2 ^3P_j) system, where j=0,1,2, are investigated using the
recently available ab initio short-range $^{1,3,5}\Sigma^+_{g,u}$ and
$^{1,3,5}\Pi_{g,u}$ potentials computed by Deguilhem et al. (J. Phys. B: At.
Mol. Opt. Phys. 42 (2009) 015102). Three sets of calculations have been
undertaken: single-channel, multichannel without Coriolis couplings and full
multichannel with Coriolis couplings. We find that non-adiabatic effects are
negligible for $0^-_u,0^{\pm}_g,1_u,2_g,2_u,3_g$ Hund case (c) sets of levels
in the j=2 asymptote but can be up to 15% for some of the $0^+_u$ and $1_g$
sets of levels where near degeneracies are present in the single-channel
diagonalized potentials. Coriolis couplings are most significant for weakly
bound levels, ranging from 1-5% for total angular momenta J=1,2 and up to 10%
for J=3. Levels near the j=1 and j=0 asymptotes agree closely with previous
multichannel calculations based upon long-range potentials constructed from
retarded resonance dipole and dispersion interactions. Assignment of
theoretical levels to experimental observations using criteria based upon the
short-range character of each level and their coupling to metastable ground
states produces well matched assignments for the majority of observations.
After a 1% increase in the slope of the $^5\Sigma^+_{g,u}$ and $^5\Pi_{g,u}$
input potentials near the classical turning point is applied, improved matching
of previous assignments is obtained and further assignments can be made,
reproducing very closely the number of experimental observations.
