The Oda's Strong Factorization Conjecture states that a proper birational map
between smooth toric varieties can be decomposed as a sequence of smooth toric
blowups followed by a sequence of smooth toric blowdowns. This article
describes an algorithm that conjecturally constructs such a decomposition.
Several reductions and simplifications of the algorithm are presented and some
special cases of the conjecture are proved.
