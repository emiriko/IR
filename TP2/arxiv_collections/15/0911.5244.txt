We present first results from runs performed with Nf=2+1+1 flavours of
dynamical twisted mass fermions at maximal twist: a degenerate light doublet
and a mass split heavy doublet. An overview of the input parameters and tuning
status of our ensembles is given, together with a comparison with results
obtained with Nf=2 flavours. The problem of extracting the mass of the K- and
D-mesons is discussed, and the tuning of the strange and charm quark masses
examined. Finally we compare two methods of extracting the lattice spacings to
check the consistency of our data and we present some first results of ChiPT
fits in the light meson sector.
