In this survey article, we explain a few ideas behind the fermionic projector
approach and summarize recent results which clarify the connection to quantum
field theory. The fermionic projector is introduced, which describes the
physical system by a collection of Dirac states, including the states of the
Dirac sea. Formulating the interaction by an action principle for the fermionic
projector, we obtain a consistent description of interacting quantum fields
which reproduces the results of perturbative quantum field theory. We find a
new mechanism for the generation of boson masses and obtain small corrections
to the field equations which violate causality.
