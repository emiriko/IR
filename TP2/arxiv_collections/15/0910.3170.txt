The influence of thermal pressure fluctuations on the tympanic membrane has
been re- examined as a possible contributing determinant of the threshold of
human hearing over the range of audible frequencies. The early approximate
calculation of Sivian and White [1] is shown to result in higher values of
thermal noise pressure on the tympanium of a model meatus than the result
obtained by directly calculating the noise pressure from thermally excited
resonant ear canal modes.
