We propose a new practical method for evaluating the critical coupling
constant in one-dimensional long-range interacting systems. We assume a
finite-range scaling and define its exponent for the logarithm of the
susceptibility. We find criticality in the form of a zeta function singularity.
As an example, we present results for a long-range Ising model.
