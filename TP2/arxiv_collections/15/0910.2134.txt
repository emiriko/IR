We compare the luminosity function and rate inferred from the GBM long bursts
peak flux distribution with those inferred from the Swift and BATSE peak flux
distribution. We find that the GBM, BATSE and the Swift peak fluxes can be
fitted by the same luminosity function implying the consistency of these three
samples. Using the trigger algorithm of the LAT instrument we derive important
information on the flux at 100 MeV compared to lower energy detected by the
GBM. We find that the simple extension of the synchrotron emission to high
energy cannot justify the low rate of GRBs detected by LAT and for several GRBs
detected by the GBM, the flux at >100 MeV should be suppressed. Two bursts,
GRB090217 and GRB 090202B, detected by LAT have very soft spectra in the GBM
and therefore their high energy emission cannot be due to an extension of the
synchrotron.
