We calculate how the relic density of dark matter particles is altered when
their annihilation is enhanced by the Sommerfeld mechanism due to a Yukawa
interaction between the annihilating particles. Maintaining a dark matter
abundance consistent with current observational bounds requires the
normalization of the s-wave annihilation cross section to be decreased compared
to a model without enhancement. The level of suppression depends on the
specific parameters of the particle model, with the kinetic decoupling
temperature having the most effect. We find that the cross section can be
reduced by as much as an order of magnitude for extreme cases. We also compute
the mu-type distortion of the CMB energy spectrum caused by energy injection
from such Sommerfeld-enhanced annihilation. Our results indicate that in the
vicinity of resonances, associated with bound states, distortions can be large
enough to be excluded by the upper limit |mu|<9.0x10^(-5) found by the
COBE/FIRAS experiment.
