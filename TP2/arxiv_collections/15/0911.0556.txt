We apply the large-deviation method to study trajectories in dissipative
quantum systems. We show that in the long time limit the statistics of quantum
jumps can be understood from thermodynamic arguments by exploiting the analogy
between large-deviation and free-energy functions. This approach is
particularly useful for uncovering properties of rare dissipative trajectories.
We also prove, via an explicit quantum mapping, that rare trajectories of one
system can be realized as typical trajectories of an alternative system.
