Hadronic final states in hadron-hadron collisions are often studied by
clustering final state hadrons into jets, each jet approximately corresponding
to a hard parton. The typical jet size in a high energy hadron collision is
between 0.4 and 1.0 in eta-phi. On the other hand, there may be structures of
interest in an event that are of a different scale to the jet size. For
example, to a first approximation the underlying event is a uniform emission of
radiation spanning the entire detector, colour connection effects between hard
partons may fill the region between a jet and the proton remnant and
hadronisation effects may extend beyond the jets. We consider the possibility
of performing a Fourier decomposition on individual events in order to produce
a power spectrum of the transverse energy radiated at different angular scales.
We attempt to identify correlations in the emission of radiation over distances
ranging from the full detector size to approximately 0.2 in eta-phi. As a
demonstration of this technique we apply it to a comparison of di-jet events
produced with and without a colour connection between the jets.
