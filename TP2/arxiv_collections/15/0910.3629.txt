We report on the development of n-on-p, 3D Double-Side Double Type Column
(3D-DDTC) pixel detectors fabricated at FBK-irst (Trento, Italy) and oriented
to the ATLAS upgrade. The considered fabrication technology is simpler than
that required for full 3D detectors with active edge, but the detector
efficiency and radiation hardness critically depend on the columnar electrode
overlap and should be carefully evaluated. The first assemblies of these
sensors (featuring 2, 3, or 4 columns per pixel) with the ATLAS FEI3 read-out
chip have been tested in laboratory. Selected results from the electrical and
functional characterization with radioactive sources are here discussed.
