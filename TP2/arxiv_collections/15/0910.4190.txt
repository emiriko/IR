We present first results from dynamical Chirally Improved (CI) fermion
simulations for the axial charge $G_A$ of various hadrons. We work with 16^3x32
lattices of spatial extent 2.4 fm and use the variational method with a
suitable basis of Jacobi-smeared interpolators to suppress contaminations from
excited states.
