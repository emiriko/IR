Previous studies of the Na I D interstellar absorption line doublet have
shown that galactic winds occur in most galaxies with high infrared
luminosities. However, in infrared-bright composite systems where a starburst
coexists with an active galactic nucleus (AGN), it is unclear whether the
starburst, the AGN, or both are driving the outflows. The present paper
describes the results from a search for outflows in 35 infrared-faint Seyferts
with 10^9.9 < L_IR/L_sun < 10^11, or, equivalently, star formation rates (SFR)
of ~0.4 -- 9 solar masses per year, to attempt to isolate the source of the
outflow. We find that the outflow detection rates for the infrared-faint
Seyfert 1s (6%) and Seyfert 2s (18%) are lower than previously reported for
infrared-luminous Seyfert 1s (50%) and Seyfert 2s (45%). The outflow kinematics
of infrared-faint and infrared-bright Seyfert 2 galaxies resemble those of
starburst galaxies, while the outflow velocities in Seyfert 1 galaxies are
significantly larger. Taken together, these results suggest that the AGN does
not play a significant role in driving the outflows in most infrared-faint and
infrared-bright systems, except the high-velocity outflows seen in Seyfert 1
galaxies. Another striking result of this study is the high rate of detection
of inflows in infrared-faint galaxies (39% of Seyfert 1s, 35% of Seyfert 2s),
significantly larger than in infrared-luminous Seyferts (15%). This inflow may
be contributing to the feeding of the AGN in these galaxies, and potentially
provides more than enough material to power the observed nuclear activity over
typical AGN lifetimes.
