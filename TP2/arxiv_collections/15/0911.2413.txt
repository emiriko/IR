As discussed in several chapters of this volume, frustration leads to
unconventional (insulating) ground states. On the other hand, doped holes are
known to have profound effects in Mott insulators. Therefore doped frustrated
systems offer the prospect of novel phases with some of the most fascinating,
challenging and exotic behavior. In addition, at commensurate electron fillings
and in the presence of strong (screened) Coulomb repulsion, geometrical
frustration can also manifests itself as an extensive degeneracy of the
classical ground-state manifold providing profound similarities with the field
of quantum frustrated magnetism.
