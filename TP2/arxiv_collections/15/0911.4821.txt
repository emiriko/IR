The M\"obius inversion formula, introduced during the 19th century in number
theory, was generalized to a wide class of monoids called locally finite such
as the free partially commutative, plactic and hypoplactic monoids for
instance. In this contribution are developed and used some topological and
algebraic notions for monoids with zero, similar to ordinary objects such as
the (total) algebra of a monoid, the augmentation ideal or the star operation
on proper series. The main concern is to extend the study of the M\"obius
function to some monoids with zero, i.e., with an absorbing element, in
particular the so-called Rees quotients of locally finite monoids. Some
relations between the M\"obius functions of a monoid and its Rees quotient are
also provided.
