We have precisely measured the Nernst effect in Nd-doped
La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ single crystals with controlling the strength
(stability) of the stripe order. We found that the onset temperature
$T_{onset}$, where the Nernst signal starts increasing, does not change
conspicuously in spite of Nd-doping. At low temperatures, on the other hand,
the absolute value of the Nernst signal is strongly suppressed in accordance
with the strength of the stripe order. These results imply that the fluctuation
of (charge) stripe order enhances the Nernst signal below $T_{onset}$ at high
temperatures, and then the stripe order enhanced by Nd-doping suppresses the
superconducting fluctuation to reduce the Nernst signal at low temperatures. We
also observed an increase of the Nernst signal below the charge order
temperature $T_{ch}$ which is observed in diffraction measurement.
