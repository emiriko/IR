Young stellar systems are known to undergo outbursts, where the star
experiences an increased accretion rate, and the system's luminosity increases
accordingly. The archetype is the FU Orionis (FU Ori) outburst, where the
accretion rate can increase by three orders of magnitude (and the brightness of
the system by five magnitudes). The cause appears to be instability in the
circumstellar disc, but there is currently some debate as to the nature of this
instability (e.g. thermal, gravitational, magneto-rotational). This paper
details high resolution Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations that
were carried out to investigate the influence of stellar encounters on disc
dynamics. Star-star encounters (where the primary has a self-gravitating,
marginally stable protostellar disc) were simulated with various orbital
parameters to investigate the resulting disc structure and dynamics. Crucially,
the simulations include the effects of radiative transfer to realistically
model the resulting thermodynamics. Our results show that the accretion history
and luminosity of the system during the encounter displays many of the features
of outburst phenomena. In particular, the magnitudes and decay times seen are
comparable to those of FU Ori. There are two caveats to this assertion: the
first is that these events are not expected to occur frequently enough to
explain all FU Ori or EX Lupi; the second is that the inner discs of these
simulations are subject to numerical viscosity, which will act to reduce the
accretion rate (although it has less of an effect on the total mass accreted).
In short, these results cannot rule out binary interactions as a potential
source of some FU Ori-esque outbursts.
