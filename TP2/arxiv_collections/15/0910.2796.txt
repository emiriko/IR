The mean free path of neutrino in charged and neutral current reactions is
calculated for inhomogeneous nuclear matter which is expected to appear in the
crust of neutron stars. The relevant cross section depends on Fermi and
Gamow-Teller strength distributions, which are derived from the large-scale
shell model calculations within the self-consistent Skyrme-Hartree-Fock
approach and in a relativistic mean-field model. The inhomogeneous nuclear
matter is described in terms of cubic Wigner-Seitz cells, which allows for a
microscopic description of the structures in the so-called pasta phase of
nuclear configurations and provides a smooth transition to the limit of
homogeneous matter. The influence of pasta phase, its microscopical structure
and geometrical shapes on neutrino propagation is considered.
