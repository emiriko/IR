We discuss an explicit construction of a string dual for the Gaussian matrix
model. Starting from the matrix model and employing Strebel differential
techniques we deduce hints about the structure of the dual string. Next,
following these hints a worldheet theory is constructed. The correlators in
this string theory are assumed to localize on a finite set of points in the
moduli space of Riemann surfaces. To each such point one associates a Feynman
diagram contributing to the correlator in the dual matrix model, and thus
recasts the worldsheet expression as a sum over Feynman diagrams.
