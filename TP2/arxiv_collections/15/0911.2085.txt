We study the properties of strange and charm mesons in hot and dense matter
within a self-consistent coupled-channel approach for the experimental
conditions of density and temperature expected for the CBM experiment at
FAIR/GSI. The in-medium solution at finite temperature accounts for Pauli
blocking effects, mean-field binding of all the baryons involved, and meson
self-energies. We analyze the behaviour in this hot and dense environment of
dynamically-generated baryonic resonances together with the evolution with
density and temperature of the strange and open-charm meson spectral functions.
We test the spectral functions for strange mesons using energy-weighted sum
rules and finally discuss the implications of the properties of charm mesons on
the D_{s0}(2317) and the predicted X(3700) scalar resonances.
