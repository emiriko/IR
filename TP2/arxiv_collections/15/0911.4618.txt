We demonstrate the non-universal behavior of finite size scaling in (1+1)
dimension of a nonlinear discrete growth model involving extended particles in
generalized point of view. In particular, we show the violation of the
universal nature of the scaling function corresponding to the height
fluctuation in (1+1) dimension. The 2nd order moment of the height fluctuation
shows three distinct crossover regions separated by two crossover time scales
namely, tx1 and tx2. Each regime has different scaling property. The overall
scaling behavior is postulated with a new scaling relation represented as the
linear sum of two scaling functions valid for each scaling regime. Besides, we
notice the dependence of the roughness exponents on the finite size of the
system. The roughness exponents corresponding to the rough surface is compared
with the growth rate or the velocity of the surface.
