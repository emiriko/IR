On certain extent the behavior of the Adaptive Optics correction for
Extremely Large Telescope scales with diameter size. But in Ground Layer
Adaptive Optics the combined effect of a Large Field of View and the large
overlap of Guide Stars pupil footprints at high atmospheric altitude introduces
severe changes in the behavior of the correction returning a very different
distribution of the energy going from known 8-10meter to 100m diameters. In
this paper we identify the reasons and the ways of these different behaviors.
