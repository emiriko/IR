We are pursuing a capability to perform time resolved manipulations of single
spins in quantum dot circuits involving more than two quantum dots. In this
paper, we demonstrate full counting statistics as well as averaging techniques
we use to calibrate the tunnel barriers. We make use of this to implement the
Delft protocol for single shot single spin readout in a device designed to form
a triple quantum dot potential. We are able to tune the tunnelling times over
around three orders of magnitude. We obtain a spin relaxation time of 300
microseconds at 10T.
