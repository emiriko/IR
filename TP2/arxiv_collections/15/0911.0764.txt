The aim of this paper is to perform a numerical and analytical study of a
rotating Bose Einstein condensate placed in a harmonic plus Gaussian trap,
following the experiments of \cite{bssd}. The rotational frequency $\Omega$ has
to stay below the trapping frequency of the harmonic potential and we find that
the condensate has an annular shape containing a triangular vortex lattice. As
$\Omega$ approaches $\omega$, the width of the condensate and the circulation
inside the central hole get large. We are able to provide analytical estimates
of the size of the condensate and the circulation both in the lowest Landau
level limit and the Thomas-Fermi limit, providing an analysis that is
consistent with experiment.
