The stability requirements for a noncommutative scalar field coupled to
gravity is investigated through the positive energy theorem. It is shown that
for a noncommutative scalar with a polynomial potential, the stability
conditions are similar to the ones for the commutative case. This result
remains valid even whether the space-time has horizons.
