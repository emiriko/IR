We report results of numerical simulations on the multiple soliton generation
and soliton energy quantization in a soliton fiber ring laser passively
mode-locked by using the nonlinear polarization rotation technique. We found
numerically that the formation of multiple solitons in the laser is caused by a
peak power limiting effect of the laser cavity. It is also the same effect that
suppresses the soliton pulse collapse, an intrinsic feature of solitons
propagating in the gain media, and makes the solitons stable in the laser.
Furthermore, we show that the soliton energy quantization observed in the
lasers is a natural consequence of the gain competition between the multiple
solitons. Enlightened by the numerical result we speculate that the
multi-soliton formation and soliton energy quantization observed in other types
of soliton fiber lasers could have similar mechanism.
