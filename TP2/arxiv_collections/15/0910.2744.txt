Spin relaxation in mesoscopic Ag wires in the diffusive transport regime is
studied via nonlocal spin valve and Hanle effect measurements performed on
permalloy/Ag lateral spin valves. The ratio between momentum and spin
relaxation times is not constant at low temperatures. This can be explained
with the Elliott-Yafet spin relaxation mechanism by considering the momentum
surface relaxation time as being temperature dependent. We present a model to
separately determine spin flip probabilities for phonon, impurity and surface
scattering and find that the spin flip probability is highest for surface
scattering.
