The Ghirlanda-Guerra identities are one of the most mysterious features of
spin glasses. We prove the GG identities in a large class of models that
includes the Edwards-Anderson model, the random field Ising model, and the
Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model in the presence of a random external field.
Previously, the GG identities were rigorously proved only `on average' over a
range of temperatures or under small perturbations.
