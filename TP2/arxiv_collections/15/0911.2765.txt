The Boltzmann-Gibbs probability distributions generated by logarithmically
correlated random potentials provide a simple yet nontrivial example of
disorder-induced multifractal measures. We introduce and discuss two
analytically tractable models for such potentials. The first model uses
multiplicative cascades and is equivalent to statistical mechanics of directed
polymers on disordered trees studied long ago by B. Derrida and H. Spohn.
Second model is the infinite-dimensional version of the problem in Euclidean
space which can be solved by employing the replica trick. In particular, the
latter version allows one to identify the freezing of multifractality exponents
with a mechanism of the replica symmetry breaking (RSB) and to elucidate its
physical meaning. The corresponding 1-step RSB solution turns out to be {\it
marginally stable} everywhere in the low-temperature phase. In the end we put
the model in a more general context by relating to the Gaussian Free Field and
briefly discussing recent developments and extensions. The appendices provide a
detailed exposition of the replica analysis of the model discussed in the
lectures.
