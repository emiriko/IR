Borexino is a solar neutrino experiment running at the Laboratori Nazionali
del Gran Sasso, Italy. The radioactive background levels in the liquid
scintillator target meet or even exceed design goals, opening unanticipated
opportunities. The main results, so far, are the measurement of the $^7$Be
solar neutrino flux (the first ever done) and the measurement of the $^8$B
neutrino flux performed with electron energy threshold of 2.8 MeV. The short
and medium term perspectives are summarized in the conclusions.
