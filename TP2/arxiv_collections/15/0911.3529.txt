Let R be an integral domain and A a cellular algebra. Suppose that A is
equipped with a family of Jucys-Murphy elements which satisfy the separation
condition. Let K be the field of fractions of R. We give a necessary and
sufficient condition under which the center of $A_{K}$ consists of the
symmetric polynomials in Jucys-Murphy elements.
