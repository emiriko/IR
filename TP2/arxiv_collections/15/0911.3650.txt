We report the measurements of depolarization probabilities of polarized
$^3$He in a rectangular acrylic cell with a deuterated tetraphenyl
butadiene-doped deuterated polystyrene coating filled with superfluid $^4$He at
$\sim$330 mk with a magnetic holding field of $\sim$7.3 G. We achieve a wall
depolarization probability of $\sim1.0\times10^{-7}$. Such a surface will find
application in a new experiment searching for the neutron electric dipole
moment and other applications.
