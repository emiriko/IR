Carbon nanotube (CNT) heaters with sub-5 nm diameter induce highly localized
phase change in Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST) chalcogenide. A significant reduction in
resistance of test structures is measured as the GST near the CNT heater
crystallizes. Effective GST heating occurs at currents as low as 25 uA,
significantly lower than in conventional phase change memory with metal
electrodes (0.1-0.5 mA). Atomic force microscopy reveals nucleation sites
associated with phase change in GST around the CNT heater. Finite element
simulations confirm electrical characteristics consistent with the experiments,
and reveal the current and phase distribution in GST.
