A flavor-nonuniversal chiral color model is introduced. It is used for
comparison to the recent data on $\bar{p} p \to \bar{t} t$. We concluded that
the data are consistent with interpretation as an axigluon exchange within
1$\sigma$ and a unique rise and fall behavior is predicated with regard to the
asymmetry $A^t_{FB}$ as a function of $t \bar{t}$ invariant mass, which can
distinguish our model from others before one discovers the axigluon resonance.
Further aspects of the model are discussed.
