The reason for baryon asymmetry in our universe has been a pertinent question
for many years. The holographic principle suggests a charged preon model
underlies the Standard Model of particle physics and any such charged preon
model requires baryon asymmetry. This note estimates the baryon asymmetry
predicted by charged preon models in closed inflationary Friedmann universes.
