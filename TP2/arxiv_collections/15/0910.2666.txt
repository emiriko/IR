We construct the Liouville operator for the SU(2) classical colored Coulomb
plasma (cQGP) for arbitrary values of the Coulomb coupling $\Gamma=V/K$, the
ratio of the mean Coulomb to kinetic energy. We show that its resolvent in the
classical colored phase space obeys a hierarchy of equations. We use a free
streaming approximation to close the hierarchy and derive an integral equation
for the time-dependent structure factor. Its reduction by projection yields
hydrodynamical equations in the long-wavelength limit. We discuss the character
of the hydrodynamical modes at strong coupling. The shear viscosity is shown to
exhibit a minimum at $\Gamma\approx 8$ near the liquid point. This minimum
follows from the cross-over between the single particle collisional regime
which drops as $1/\Gamma^{5/2}$ and the hydrodynamical collisional regime which
rises as $\Gamma^{1/2}$. The self-diffusion constant drops as $1/\Gamma^{3/2}$
irrespective of the regime. We compare our results to molecular dynamics
simulations of the SU(2) colored Coulomb plasma. We also discuss the relevance
of our results for the quantum and strongly coupled quark gluon plasma (sQGP)
