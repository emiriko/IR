Resent results concerning the production of K+, K-, phi, K0 S and lambda
particles in the reaction system Ar+KCl at 1.76 AGeV measured by the HADES
Collaboration are presented. Transverse momentum distributions have been
measured in a large fraction of the phase space. For the first time, at SIS
energies, K+, K- and phi mesons have been measured independently and the slope
parameter for phi mesons could be extracted. A large statistics has been
collected for the produced K0S and lambda in the phase space region around
mid-rapity. The high quality of these data render them very suitable for
comparisons with theoretical models.
