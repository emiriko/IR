The magnetogenesis scenarios triggered by the early variation of the gauge
coupling are critically analyzed. In the absence of sources, it is shown that
the electric and magnetic power spectra can be explicitly computed by means of
electric-magnetic duality transformations. The remnants of a pre-inflationary
expansion and the reheating process break explicitly electric-magnetic duality
by inducing Ohmic currents. The generation of large-scale magnetic field and
the physical distinction between electric and magnetic observables stems, in
this class of models, from the final value reached by the conductivity of the
plasma right after inflation. Specific numerical examples are given. The
physical requirements of viable magnetogenesis scenarios are spelled out.
