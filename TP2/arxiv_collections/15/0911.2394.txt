RbFe2As2 has recently been reported to be a bulk superconductor with Tc = 2.6
K in the undoped state, in contrast to undoped BaFe2As2 with a magnetic ground
state. We present here the results of the first-principles calculations of the
structural, elastic and electronic properties for this newest superconductor
and discuss its behaviour in relation to other related systems.
  Keywords: RbFe2As2, Electronic structure; Elastic constant;
