The anticipated high sensitivity and the science goals of the next generation
X-ray space missions, like the International X-ray Observatory or Simbol-X,
rely on a low instrumental background, which in turn requires optimized
shielding concepts. We present Geant4 based simulation results on the IXO Wide
Field Imager cosmic ray proton induced background in comparison with previous
results obtained for the Simbol-X LED and HED focal plane detectors. Our
results show that an improvement in mean differential background flux compared
to actually operating X-ray observatories may be feasible with detectors based
on DEPFET technology. In addition we present preliminary results concerning the
validation of Geant4 based radioactive decay simulation in space applications
as a part of the Nano5 project.
