The threshold degree of a function f:{0,1}^n->{-1,+1} is the least degree of
a real polynomial p with f(x)=sgn p(x). We prove that the intersection of two
halfspaces on {0,1}^n has threshold degree Omega(n), which matches the trivial
upper bound and completely answers a question due to Klivans (2002). The best
previous lower bound was Omega(sqrt n). Our result shows that the intersection
of two halfspaces on {0,1}^n only admits a trivial 2^{Theta(n)}-time learning
algorithm based on sign-representation by polynomials, unlike the advances
achieved in PAC learning DNF formulas and read-once Boolean formulas. The proof
introduces a new technique of independent interest, based on Fourier analysis
and matrix theory.
