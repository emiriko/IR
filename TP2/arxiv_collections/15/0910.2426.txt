We present results from a multi-month reverberation mapping campaign
undertaken primarily at MDM Observatory with supporting observations from
around the world. We measure broad line region (BLR) radii and black hole
masses for six objects. A velocity-resolved analysis of the H_beta response
shows the presence of diverse kinematic signatures in the BLR.
