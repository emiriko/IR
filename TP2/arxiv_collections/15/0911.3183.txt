The temperature anomalies in the Earth's mantle associated with thermal
convection1 can be inferred from seismic tomography, provided that the elastic
properties of mantle minerals are known as a function of temperature at mantle
pressures. At present, however, such information is difficult to obtain
directly through laboratory experiments. We have therefore taken advantage of
recent advances in computer technology, and have performed finite-temperature
ab initio molecular dynamics simulations of the elastic properties of MgSiO3
perovskite, the major mineral of the lower mantle, at relevant thermodynamic
conditions. When combined with the results from tomographic images of the
mantle, our results indicate that the lower mantle is either significantly
anelastic or compositionally heterogeneous on large scales. We found the
temperature contrast between the coldest and hottest regions of the mantle, at
a given depth, to be about 800K at 1000 km, 1500K at 2000 km, and possibly over
2000K at the core-mantle boundary.
