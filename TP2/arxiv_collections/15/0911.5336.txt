We have studied the afterpulse of a hemispherical photomultiplier tube for an
upcoming reactor neutrino experiment. The timing, the amplitude, and the rate
of the afterpulse for a 10 inch photomultiplier tube were measured with a 400
MHz FADC up to 16 \ms time window after the initial signal generated by an LED
light pulse. The time and amplitude correlation of the afterpulse shows several
distinctive groups. We describe the dependencies of the afterpulse on the
applied high voltage and the amplitude of the main light pulse. The present
data could shed light upon the general mechanism of the afterpulse.
