We define new profiles based on hydropathy properties and point out specific
profiles for regions surrounding splice sites. We built a set T of flanking
regions of genes with 1-3 introns from 21st and 22nd chromosomes. These genes
contained 313 introns and 385 exons and were extracted from GenBank. They were
used in order to define hydropathy profiles. Most human introns, around 99.66%,
are likely to be U2- type introns. They have highly degenerate sequence motifs
and many different sequences can function as U2-type splice sites. Our new
profiles allow to identify regions which have conservative biochemical features
that are essential for recognition by spliceosome. We have also found
differences between hydropathy profiles for U2 or U12-types of introns on sets
of spice sites extracted from SpliceRack database in order to distinguish GT?AG
introns belonging to U2 and U12-types. Indeed, intron type cannot be simply
determined by the dinucleotide termini. We show that there is a similarity of
hydropathy profiles inside intron types. On the one hand, GT?AG and GC?AG
introns belonging to U2-type have resembling hydropathy profiles as well as
AT?AC and GT?AG introns belonging to U12-type. On the other hand, hydropathy
profiles of U2 and U12-types GT?AG introns are completely different. Finally,
we define and compute a pvalue; we compare our profiles with the profiles
provided by a classical method, Pictogram.
