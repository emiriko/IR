We present here the first-principles dynamical CPA (coherent potential
approximation) combined with the tight-binding LMTO LDA+U method towards
quantitative calculations of the electronic structure and magnetism at finite
temperatures in transition metals and compounds. The theory takes into account
the single-site dynamical charge and spin fluctuations using the functional
integral technique as well as an effective medium. Numerical results for Fe,
Co, and Ni show that the theory explains quantitatively the high-temperature
properties such as the effective Bohr magneton numbers and the excitation
spectra in the paramagnetic state, and describes the Curie temperatures
semiquantitatively.
