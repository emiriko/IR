In a recent Letter Ciftci and Cakmak [EPL 87, 60003 (2009)] showed that the
two dimensional random walk in a bounded domain, where walkers which cross the
boundary return to a base curve near origin with deterministic rules, can
produce regular patterns. Our numerical calculations suggest that the
cumulative probability distribution function of the returning walkers along the
base curve is a Devil's staircase, which can be explained from the mapping of
these walks to a non-linear stochastic map. The non-trivial probability
distribution function(PDF) is a universal feature of CCRW characterized by the
fractal dimension d=1.75(0) of the PDF bounding curve.
