We propose a novel distributed algorithm to cluster graphs. The algorithm
recovers the solution obtained from spectral clustering without the need for
expensive eigenvalue/vector computations. We prove that, by propagating waves
through the graph, a local fast Fourier transform yields the local component of
every eigenvector of the Laplacian matrix, thus providing clustering
information. For large graphs, the proposed algorithm is orders of magnitude
faster than random walk based approaches. We prove the equivalence of the
proposed algorithm to spectral clustering and derive convergence rates. We
demonstrate the benefit of using this decentralized clustering algorithm for
community detection in social graphs, accelerating distributed estimation in
sensor networks and efficient computation of distributed multi-agent search
strategies.
