We present a study of student learning through the use of virtual reality. A
software package is used to introduce concepts of special relativity to
students in a game-like environment where users experience the effects of
travelling at near light speeds. From this new perspective, space and time are
significantly different to that experienced in everyday life. The study
explores how students have worked with this environment and how these students
have used this experience in their study of special relativity. A mixed method
approach has been taken to evaluate the outcomes of separate implementations of
the package at two universities. Students found the simulation to be a positive
learning experience and described the subject area as being less abstract after
its use. Also, students were more capable of correctly answering concept
questions relating to special relativity, and a small but measurable
improvement was observed in the final exam.
