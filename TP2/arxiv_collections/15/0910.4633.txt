A general black-branes system under the T-duality transformation will become
another smeared system with different dimensional black branes. We first use
some simple examples to see that both systems have a same value of entropy and
then present a rigorous method to prove this general property. Using the
property we could easily know the entropy of some complex black-brane systems.
