We investigate the properties of a two-orbital Hubbard model with unequal
bandwidths on the square lattice in the framework of the dynamical cluster
approximation (DCA) combined with a continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo (CT
QMC) algorithm. We explore the effect of short-range spatial fluctuations on
the nature of the metal-insulator transition and the possible occurrence of an
orbital-selective Mott transition (OSMT), as a function of cluster size $N_c$.
We observe that for $N_c=2$ no OSMT is present, instead a band insulator state
for both orbitals is stabilized at low temperatures due to the appearance of an
artificial local ordered state. For $N_c=4$ the DCA calculations suggest the
presence of five different phases which originate out of the cooperation and
competition between spatial fluctuations and orbitals of different bandwidths
and a OSMT phase is stabilized. Based on our results, we discuss the nature of
the gap opening.
