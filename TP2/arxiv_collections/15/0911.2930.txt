One-dimensional (1D) Nonlinear Schroedinger Equaation (NLS) provides a good
approximation to attractive Bose-Einshtein condensate (BEC) in a quasi 1D
cigar-shaped optical trap in certain regimes. 1D NLS is an integrable equation
that can be solved through the inverse scattering method. Our observation is
that in many cases the parameters of the BEC correspond to the semiclassical
(zero dispersion) limit of the focusing NLS. Hence, recent results about the
strong asymptotics of the semiclassical limit solutions can be used to describe
some interesting phenomena of the attractive 1D BEC. In general, the
semiclassical limit of the focusing NLS exibits very strong modulation
instability. However, in the case of an analytical initial data, the NLS
evolution does displays some ordered structure, that can describe, for example,
the bright soliton phenomenon. We discuss some general features of the
semiclassical NLS evolution and propose some new observables.
