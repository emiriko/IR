We report our rederivation of the equations of motion for relativistic
compact binaries through the third-and-a-half post-Newtonian (3.5 PN) order
approximation to general relativity using the strong field point particle limit
to describe self-gravitating stars instead of the Dirac delta functional. The
computation is done in harmonic coordinates. Our equations of motion describe
the orbital motion of the binary consisting of spherically symmetric
non-rotating stars. The resulting equations of motion fully agree with the 3.5
PN equations of motion derived in the previous works. We also show that the
locally defined energy of the star has a simple relation with its mass up to
the 3.5 PN order.
