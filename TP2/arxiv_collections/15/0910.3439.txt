We report the first direct observation of muon antineutrinos in the MINOS Far
Detector in the current muon-neutrino dominated beam. The magnetic field of the
detector is utilized to separate muon neutrinos and antineutrinos
event-by-event by identifying the charge sign of the muon created in
charged-current interactions. We present preliminary results on the muon
antineutrino oscillation parameters as well as limit on the fraction of
neutrinos that disappear and reappear as antineutrinos. We also discuss the
prospect of the measurement when the polarity of the magnetic focusing horns
will be reversed to create a dedicated muon antineutrino beam.
