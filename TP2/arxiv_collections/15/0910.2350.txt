This paper presents a survey on quantum control theory and applications from
a control systems perspective. Some of the basic concepts and main developments
(including open-loop control and closed-loop control) in quantum control theory
are reviewed. In the area of open-loop quantum control, the paper surveys the
notion of controllability for quantum systems and presents several control
design strategies including optimal control, Lyapunov-based methodologies,
variable structure control and quantum incoherent control. In the area of
closed-loop quantum control, the paper reviews closed-loop learning control and
several important issues related to quantum feedback control including quantum
filtering, feedback stabilization, LQG control and robust quantum control.
