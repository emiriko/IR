We present a combined mean-field and simulation approach to different models
describing the dynamics of classes formed by elements that can appear,
disappear or copy themselves. These models, related to a paradigm
duplication-innovation model known as Chinese Restaurant Process, are devised
to reproduce the scaling behavior observed in the genome-wide repertoire of
protein domains of all known species. In view of these data, we discuss the
qualitative and quantitative differences of the alternative model formulations,
focusing in particular on the roles of element loss and of the specificity of
empirical domain classes.
