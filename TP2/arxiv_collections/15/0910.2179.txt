The monodromy conjecture states that every pole of the topological (or
related) zeta function induces an eigenvalue of monodromy. This conjecture has
already been studied a lot; however, in full generality it is proven only for
zeta functions associated to a polynomial in two variables.
  In this article we consider zeta functions associated to an ideal. First we
work in arbitrary dimension and obtain a formula (like the one of A'Campo) to
compute the 'Verdier monodromy' eigenvalues associated to an ideal. Afterwards
we prove a generalized monodromy conjecture for arbitrary ideals in two
variables.
