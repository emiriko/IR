We study an analog of the AGT relation in five dimensions. We conjecture that
the instanton partition function of 5D N=1 pure SU(2) gauge theory coincides
with the inner product of the Gaiotto-like state in the deformed Virasoro
algebra. In four dimensional case, a relation between the Gaiotto construction
and the theory of Braverman and Etingof is also discussed.
