In this study, we have considered the three dimensional mixed
ferro-ferrimagnetic ternary alloy model of the type AB$_{p}$C$_{1-p}$ where the
A and X (X=B or C) ions are alternately connected and have different Ising
spins S$^{A}$=3/2, S$^{B}$=1 and S$^{C}$=5/2, respectively. We have
investigated the dependence of the critical and compensation temperatures of
the model on concentration and interaction parameters by using MC simulation
method. We have shown that the behavior of the critical temperature and the
existence of compensation points strongly depend on interaction and
concentration parameters. In particular, we have found that the critical
temperature of the model is independent on concentration of different types of
spins at a special interaction value and the model has one or two compensation
temperature points in a certain range of values of the concentration of the
different spins.
