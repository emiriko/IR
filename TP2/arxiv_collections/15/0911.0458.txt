Scalar multidimensionally consistent quadrilateral lattice equations are
studied. We explore a confluence between the superposition principle for
solutions related by the Backlund transformation, and the method of solving a
Riccati map by exploiting two kn own particular solutions. This leads to an
expression for the N-soliton-type solutions of a generic equation within this
class. As a particular instance we give an explicit N-soliton solution for the
primary model, which is Adler's lattice equation (or Q4).
