I present some new results regarding confinement as it appears in Coulomb
gauge. It is found that: i) a recently proposed Yang-Mills vacuum
wavefunctional in temporal gauge and 2+1 dimensions yields a Coulomb-gauge
ghost propagator and linear Coulomb potential in good agreement with lattice
Monte Carlo results; ii) adding a few constituent gluons to heavy
quark-antiquark states brings the interaction energy much closer to that of the
static quark potential, and suggests the beginnings of gluon-chain formation at
roughly one fermi; iii) a perturbative approach to Faddeev-Popov eigenvalues
indicates that the zero eigenvalue at the Gribov horizon may occur either at,
or away from, p=0, depending on the gauge choice and spacetime dimension. This
last result may be relevant to the qualitatively different infrared behavior of
the ghost propagator in Coulomb and Landau gauges.
