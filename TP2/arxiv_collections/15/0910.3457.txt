Highly-perfect platelet single crystals of Tl_2Ba_2CuO_{6+d} (Tl-2201) were
grown by a self-flux technique. A novel encapsulation scheme allowed the
precursors to react prior to the sealing required to contain volatile thallium
oxides, and permitted the removal of melt at the conclusion of growth,
reproducibly producing high yields of clean crystals. The crystals were
annealed under well-controlled oxygen partial pressures, then characterised.
They have sharp superconducting transitions, narrow X-ray rocking curves and a
low 4% substitution of thallium by copper, all evidence of their high
perfection and homogeneity. The crystals are orthorhombic at most dopings, and
a previously unreported commensurate superlattice distortion is observed.
