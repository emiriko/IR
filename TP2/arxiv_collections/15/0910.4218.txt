The electroweak gauge symmetry is allowed to be spontaneously broken by the
strongly interacting vector-like gauge dynamics. When the gauge coupling of a
theory runs slowly in a wide range of energy scale, the theory is extremely
interesting. This may open up the possibility that the origin of all masses may
be traced back to the gauge theory. We use the SF method to determine the scale
dependence of the gauge coupling of 10-flavor QCD. Preliminary results are
reported.
