The recently discovered planetary system HD45364 which consists of a Jupiter
and Saturn mass planet is very likely in a 3:2 mean motion resonance. The
standard scenario to form planetary commensurabilities is convergent migration
of two planets embedded in a protoplanetary disc. When the planets are
initially separated by a period ratio larger than two, convergent migration
will most likely lead to a very stable 2:1 resonance for moderate migration
rates. To avoid this fate, formation of the planets close enough to prevent
this resonance may be proposed. However, such a simultaneous formation of the
planets within a small annulus, seems to be very unlikely.
  Rapid type III migration of the outer planet crossing the 2:1 resonance is
one possible way around this problem. In this paper, we investigate this idea
in detail. We present an estimate for the required convergent migration rate
and confirm this with N-body and hydrodynamical simulations. If the dynamical
history of the planetary system had a phase of rapid inward migration that
forms a resonant configuration, we predict that the orbital parameters of the
two planets are always very similar and hence should show evidence of that.
  We use the orbital parameters from our simulation to calculate a radial
velocity curve and compare it to observations. Our model can explain the
observational data as good as the previously reported fit. The eccentricities
of both planets are considerably smaller and the libration pattern is
different. Within a few years, it will be possible to observe the planet-planet
interaction directly and thus distinguish between these different dynamical
states.
