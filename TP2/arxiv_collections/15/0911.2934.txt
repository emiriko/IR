One possibility for Beyond Standard Model physics is a new
strongly-interacting gauge theory. One way to determine if a non-abelian gauge
theory is QCD-like or conformal is to measure the running of the renormalized
gauge coupling. We define the renormalized coupling from Wilson loop ratios,
and measure these ratios via lattice simulations. We test this method in SU(3)
pure gauge theory and show some first results for simulations with dynamical
fermions in the fundamental representation.
