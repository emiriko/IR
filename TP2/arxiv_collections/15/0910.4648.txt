We report on our study of flavor-singlet mesons in three-flavor QCD with
dynamical overlap quarks. Gauge ensembles are generated on a 16^3 x 48 lattice
at a lattice spacing of 0.10 fm with the strange quark masses around its
physical value m_s,phys and up and down quark masses down to m_s,phys/5.
Connected and disconnected meson correlators are calculated using the
all-to-all quark propagator. We present our preliminary results on the spectrum
of flavor-singlet pseudoscalar and vector mesons.
