III-V nanowires are useful platforms for studying the electronic and
mechanical properties of materials at the nanometer scale. However, the costs
associated with commercial nanowire growth reactors are prohibitive for most
research groups. We developed hot-wall and cold-wall metal organic vapor phase
epitaxy (MOVPE) reactors for the growth of InAs nanowires, which both use the
same gas handling system. The hot-wall reactor is based on an inexpensive
quartz tube furnace and yields InAs nanowires for a narrow range of operating
conditions. Improvement of crystal quality and an increase in growth run to
growth run reproducibility are obtained using a homebuilt UHV cold-wall reactor
with a base pressure of 2 X 10$^{-9}$ Torr. A load-lock on the UHV reactor
prevents the growth chamber from being exposed to atmospheric conditions during
sample transfers. Nanowires grown in the cold-wall system have a low defect
density, as determined using transmission electron microscopy, and exhibit
field effect gating with mobilities approaching 16,000 cm$^2$(V.s).
