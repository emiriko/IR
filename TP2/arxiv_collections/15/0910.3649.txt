We present results for two-body observables that are sensitive to the
parity-violating component of nucleon-nucleon interactions. These interactions
are studied using an effective field theory in which the only dynamic degrees
of freedom are nucleon fields. The observables we study are cross-section
asymmetries in nucleon-nucleon scattering and asymmetries and induced
polarizations in the process np \to d\gamma.
