We argue that adding gauge-singlet real scalars to the Standard Model can
both ameliorate the little hierarchy problem and provide a realistic source of
Dark Matter. Masses of the scalars should be in the 1-3 TeV range, while the
lowest cutoff of the (unspecified) UV completion of the model must be ~> 5 TeV,
depending on the Higgs boson mass and the number of singlets present. The
scalars couple to the Majorana mass term for right-handed neutrinos implying
one massless neutrino. The resulting mixing angles are consistent with the
tri-bimaximal mixing scenario.
