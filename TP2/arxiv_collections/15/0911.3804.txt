We analyze $V$-band photometry of the aperiodic variability in T CrB. By
applying a simple idea of angular momentum transport in the accretion disc, we
have developed a method to simulate the statistical distribution of flare
durations with the assumption that the aperiodic variability is produced by
turbulent elements in the disc. Both cumulative histograms with
Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests, and power density spectra are used to compare the
observed data and simulations. The input parameters of the model $R_{\rm in}$
and $\alpha$ are correlated on a certain interval and the most probable values
are an inner disc radius of $R_{\rm in} \simeq 4 \times 10^9$ cm and a
viscosity of $\alpha \simeq 0.9$. The disc is then weakly truncated. We find
that the majority of turbulent events producing flickering activity are
concentrated in the inner parts of the accretion disc.
