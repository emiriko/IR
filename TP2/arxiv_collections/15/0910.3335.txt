In our continuing attempts to understand theoretically various surface
properties such as corrosion and potential catalytic activity of actinide
surfaces in the presence of environmental gases, we report here the first ab
initio study of molecular adsorption on the double hexagonal packed (dhcp)
americium (0001) surface. Dissociative adsorption is found to be energetically
more favorable compared to molecular adsorption. The most stable configuration
corresponds to a horizontal approach molecular dissociation with the oxygen
atoms occupying neighboring h3 sites, with chemisorption energies at the NSOC
and SOC theoretical levels being 9.395 eV and 9.886 eV, respectively. The
corresponding distances of the oxygen molecule from the surface and
oxygen-oxygen distance were found to be 0.953 Ang. and 3.731 Ang.,
respectively. Overall our calculations indicate that chemisorption energies in
cases with SOC are slightly more stable than the cases with NSOC in the
0.089-0.493 eV range. The work functions and net magnetic moments respectively
increased and decreased in all cases compared with the corresponding quantities
of the bare dhcp Am (0001) surface. The adsorbate-substrate interactions have
been analyzed in detail using the partial charges inside the muffin-tin
spheres, difference charge density distributions, and the local density of
states. The effects, if any, of chemisorption on the Am 5f electron
localization-delocalization characteristics in the vicinity of the Fermi level
are also discussed.
