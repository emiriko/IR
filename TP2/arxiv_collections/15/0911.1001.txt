We review some recent coarse-graining and multi-scale methods, but also put
forward some new ideas for addressing such issues. We find that, if one is
guided by nonequilibrium statistical mechanics and thermodynamics, it is
possible to design well-founded multi-scale modeling tools that can link
microscopic models with macroscopic constitutive equations. Such multi-scale
modeling tools benefit from recently proposed approaches for static coarse
graining which are mainly built on potentials of mean force. For dynamical
properties, however, coarse-grained models need to account for dissipative
effects that arise due to fast degrees of freedom that are eliminated in favor
of the remaining slowly varying ones. The proper definition of the set of the
state variables, effectively representing the nonequilibrium states is the
first key to the success of such an approach. Linking the microscopic model
with a macroscopic model built on these slowly relaxing variables is the second
key. We illustrate the new approach for a flowing, low-molecular polymer melt.
