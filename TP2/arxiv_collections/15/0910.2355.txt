Quark-hadron (QH) duality in lepton scattering off nucleons is studied with
the resonance quark model. It is shown that in the case of neutrino scattering
off an isoscalar target the duality is simultaneously observed for charged and
neutral currents $xF_1^{\nu N}$, $F_2^{\nu N}$, and $xF_3^{\nu N}$ weak
structure functions.
  We demonstrate that the QH duality can be useful property for modeling
structure functions in the so-called resonance region. As an example it is
shown that combining relativistic quark model predictions with duality
arguments allows a construction of the inclusive resonance $F_2^{ep}$ structure
function.
