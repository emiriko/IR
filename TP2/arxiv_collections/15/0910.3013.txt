The Bc meson is composed of two heavy quarks of distinct flavor. Measurements
of its lifetime and production properties have been made based on semileptonic
Bc to J/psi+l+X decays using data collected with the CDF II detector
corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1 fb-1. The Bc average lifetime
ctau is measured to be 142.5+15.8-14.8(stat) 5.5(syst) mum. The measurements of
the ratio of the production cross section times branching ratio of Bc to
J/psi+mu+nu relative to B+ to J/psi+K were done for two pT(B) thresholds: for
pT(B) greater 4 GeV/c as 0.295+/-0.040(stat)+0.033-0.026(syst.)0.036(pT
spectrum) and for pT(B) greater 6 GeV/c as
  0.227+/-0.033(stat)+0.024-0.017(syst.)+/-0.014(pT spectrum).
