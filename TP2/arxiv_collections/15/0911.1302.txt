We study a sudden interaction quench in the weak-coupling regime of the
quantum sine-Gordon model. The real time dynamics of the bosonic mode
occupation numbers is calculated using the flow equation method. While we
cannot prove results for the asymptotic long time limit, we can establish the
existence of an extended regime in time where the mode occupation numbers relax
to twice their equilibrium values. This factor two indicates a non-equilibrium
distribution and is a universal feature of weak interaction quenches. The
weak-coupling quantum sine-Gordon model therefore turns out to be on the
borderline between thermalization and non-thermalization.
