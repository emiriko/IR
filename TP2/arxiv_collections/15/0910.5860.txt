We present the two- and three-point real space correlation functions of the
five-year WMAP sky maps, and compare the observed functions to simulated LCDM
concordance model ensembles. In agreement with previously published results, we
find that the temperature correlation functions are consistent with
expectations. However, the pure polarization correlation functions are
acceptable only for the 33GHz band map; the 41, 61, and 94 GHz band correlation
functions all exhibit significant large-scale excess structures. Further, these
excess structures very closely match the correlation functions of the two
(synchrotron and dust) foreground templates used to correct the WMAP data for
galactic contamination, with a cross-correlation statistically significant at
the 2sigma-3sigma confidence level. The correlation is slightly stronger with
respect to the thermal dust template than with the synchrotron template.
