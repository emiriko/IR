We give an introductory account of the AdS/CFT correspondence in the 1/2-BPS
sector of ${\cal N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory.Six of the dimensions of the
string theory are emergent in the Yang-Mills theory. In this article we suggest
how these dimensions and local physics in these dimensions emerge. The
discussion is aimed at non-experts.
