The distributions of the quark number and chiral condensate over the gauge
fields are computed for QCD in Euclidean space at nonzero quark chemical
potential. As both operators are non-hermitian the distributions are in the
complex plane. Moreover, because of the sign problem, the distributions are not
real and positive. The computations are carried out within leading order chiral
perturbation theory and give a direct insight into the delicate cancellations
that take place in contributions to the total baryon number and the chiral
condensate.
