We study Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) favored weak decays of Bc mesons in
the Isgur-Scora-Grinstein-Wise (ISGW) quark model. We present a detailed
analysis of the Bc meson decaying to a pseudoscalar meson (P) and an
axial-vector meson (A). We also give the form factors involving transition in
the ISGW II framework and consequently, predict the branching ratios of decays.
