We consider Cheeger-like shape optimization problems of the form
$$\min\big\{|\Omega|^\alpha J(\Omega) : \Omega\subset D\big\}$$ where $D$ is a
given bounded domain and $\alpha$ is above the natural scaling. We show the
existence of a solution and analyze as $J(\Omega)$ the particular cases of the
compliance functional $C(\Omega)$ and of the first eigenvalue
$\lambda_1(\Omega)$ of the Dirichlet Laplacian. We prove that optimal sets are
open and we obtain some necessary conditions of optimality.
