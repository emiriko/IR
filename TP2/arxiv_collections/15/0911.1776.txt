Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) have been one of the most widely discussed
sources of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). The recent results of Pierre
Auger observatory (PAO) have indicated a possible composition change of UHECRs
above ~10^{18.5} eV towards heavy nuclei. We show here that if indeed UHECRs
are largely heavy nuclei, then nearby radio quiet AGNs can also be viable
sources of UHECRs. We derive constraints on the acceleration sites which enable
acceleration of UHECRs to 10^{20} eV without suffering losses. We show that the
acceleration of UHECRs and the survival of energetic heavy nuclei are possible
in the parsec scale weak jets that are typically observed in these objects, the
main energy loss channel being photodisintegration. On this scale, energy
dissipation by shock waves resulting from interactions inside a jet or of the
jet with surrounding material are expected, which may accelerate the particles
up to very high energies. We discuss the possible contribution of radio-quiet
AGNs to the observed UHECR flux, and show that the required energy production
rate in UHECRs by a single object could be as low as ~ 3*10^{39} erg/s, which
is less than a percent of the bolometric luminosity, and thus energetically
consistent. We discuss consequences of this model, the main one being the
difficulty in detecting energetic secondaries (\gamma-rays and neutrinos) from
the same sources.
