We present an experimental investigation of alkali atom vapor cells coated
with a high quality anti-relaxation coating material based on alkenes. The
prepared cells with single compound alkene based coating showed the longest
spin relaxation times which have been measured up to now with room temperature
vapor cells. Suggestions are made that chemical binding of a cesium atom and an
alkene molecule by attack to the C=C bond plays a crucial role in such
improvement of anti-relaxation coating quality.
