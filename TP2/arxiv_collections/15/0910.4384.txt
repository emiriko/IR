High-beta superconducting radiofrequency (SRF) elliptical cavities are being
developed for several accelerator projects including Project X, the European
XFEL, and the International Linear Collider (ILC). Fermilab has recently
established an extensive infrastructure for SRF cavity R&D for future
accelerators, including cavity surface processing and testing and cavity
assembly into cryomodules. Some highlights of the global effort in SRF R&D
toward improving cavity performance, and Fermilab SRF cavity R&D in the context
of global projects are reviewed.
