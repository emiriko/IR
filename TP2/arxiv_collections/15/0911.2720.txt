Long range rapidity correlations in A+A collisions are sensitive to strong
color field dynamics at early times after the collision. These can be computed
in a factorization formalism \cite{GelisLV5} which expresses the $n$-gluon
inclusive spectrum at arbitrary rapidity separations in terms of the
multi-parton correlations in the nuclear wavefunctions. This formalism includes
all radiative and rescattering contributions, to leading accuracy in
$\alpha_s\Delta Y$, where $\Delta Y$ is the rapidity separation between either
one of the measured gluons and a projectile, or between the measured gluons
themselves. In this paper, we use a mean field approximation for the evolution
of the nuclear wavefunctions to obtain a compact result for inclusive two gluon
correlations in terms of the unintegrated gluon distributions in the nuclear
projectiles. The unintegrated gluon distributions satisfy the
Balitsky-Kovchegov equation, which we solve with running coupling and with
initial conditions constrained by existing data on electron-nucleus collisions.
Our results are valid for arbitrary rapidity separations between measured
gluons having transverse momenta $p_\perp,q_\perp\gtrsim \qs$, where $\qs$ is
the saturation scale in the nuclear wavefunctions. We compare our results to
data on long range rapidity correlations observed in the near-side ridge at
RHIC and make predictions for similar long range rapidity correlations at the
LHC.
