The effect of long-range correlated quenched structural defects on the
critical ultrasound attenuation and sound velocity dispersion is studied for
three-dimensional Ising-like systems. A field-theoretical description of the
dynamic critical effects of ultrasound propagation in solids is performed with
allowance for both fluctuation and relaxation attenuation mechanisms. The
temperature and frequency dependences of the dynamical scaling functions of the
ultrasound critical characteristics are calculated in a two-loop approximation
for different values of the correlation parameter $a$ of the Weinrib-Halperin
model with long-range correlated defects. The asymptotic behavior of the
dynamical scaling functions in hydrodynamic and critical regions is separated.
The influence of long-range correlated disorder on the asymptotic behavior of
the critical ultrasonic anomalies is discussed.
