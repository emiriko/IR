We present the implementation of tailored trapping potentials for ultracold
gases on an atom chip. We realize highly elongated traps with box-like
confinement along the long, axial direction combined with conventional harmonic
confinement along the two radial directions. The design, fabrication and
characterization of the atom chip and the box traps is described. We load
ultracold ($\lesssim1 \mu$K) clouds of $^{87}$Rb in a box trap, and demonstrate
Bose-gas focusing as a means to characterize these atomic clouds in arbitrarily
shaped potentials. Our results show that box-like axial potentials on atom
chips are very promising for studies of one-dimensional quantum gases.
