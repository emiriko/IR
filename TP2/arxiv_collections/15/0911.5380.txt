We study the $d$-dimensional Fisher solution which represents a static,
spherically symmetric, asymptotically flat spacetime with a massless scalar
field. The solution has two parameters, the mass and the "scalar charge." The
Fisher solution has a naked curvature singularity which divides the spacetime
manifold into two disconnected parts. The part which is asymptotically flat we
call the {\em Fisher spacetime}, and another part we call the {\em Fisher
universe}. The Schwarzschild-Tangherlini (ST) solution and the Fisher solution
belong to the same theory and are dual to each other. The duality
transformation acting in the parameter space maps the exterior region of the ST
black hole into the Fisher spacetime which has a naked timelike singularity,
and interior region of the black hole into the Fisher universe, which is an
anisotropic expanding-contracting universe and which has two spacelike
singularities representing its "Big Bang" and "Big Crunch". The Big Bang
singularity and the singularity of the Fisher spacetime are {\em radially weak}
in the sense that a 1-dimensional object moving along a timelike radial
geodesic can arrive to the singularities intact. At the vicinity of the
singularity the Fisher spacetime of nonzero mass has a region where its
Misner-Sharp energy is negative. The Fisher universe has a marginally trapped
surface corresponding to the state of its maximal expansion in the angular
directions. These results and derived relations between geometric quantities of
the Fisher spacetime, the Fisher universe, and the ST black hole may suggest
that the massless scalar field transforms the black hole event horizon into the
naked radially weak disjoint singularities of the Fisher spacetime and the
Fisher universe which are "dual to the horizon."
