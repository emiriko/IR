We show how neutrino data can be used in order to constrain the free
parameters of possible extensions to the standard model of elementary particles
(SM). For definiteness, we focus in the recently proposed unparticle scenario.
We show that neutrino data, in particular the MUNU experiment, can set stronger
bounds than previous reported limits in the scale dimension parameter for
certain region (d > 1.5). We compute the sensitivity of future neutrino
experiments to unparticle physics such as future neutrino-electron scattering
detectors, coherent neutrino-nuclei scattering as well as the ILC . In
particular, we show that the measurement of coherent reactor neutrino
scattering off nuclei provide a good sensitivity to the couplings of unparticle
interaction with neutrinos and quarks.Finally our results are compared with the
current astrophysical limits.
