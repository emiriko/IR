We provide methods for computing the geometric measure of entanglement for
two families of pure states with both experimental and theoretical interests:
symmetric multiqubit states with non-negative amplitudes in the Dicke basis and
symmetric three-qubit states. In addition, we study the geometric measure of
pure three-qubit states systematically in virtue of a canonical form of their
two-qubit reduced states, and derive analytical formulae for a three-parameter
family of three-qubit states. Based on this result, we further show that the W
state is the maximally entangled three-qubit state with respect to the
geometric measure.
