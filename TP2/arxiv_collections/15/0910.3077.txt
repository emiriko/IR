We discuss the QCD sum-rule approach for the spacelike electromagnetic pion
form factor in the $O(\alpha_s)$ approximation. We show that the nonlocality of
the condensates is a key point to include nonperturbative contributions to the
pion form factor. We compare our results with the Local-Duality predictions and
show that the continuum threshold $s_0(Q^2)$ parameter is highly underestimated
in the Local-Duality approach at $Q^2\gtrsim 2$ GeV$^2$. Using our fit for this
parameter, $s_0^\text{LD}(Q^2)$, and applying the fractional analytic
perturbation theory, we estimate with an accuracy of the order of 1% the
$O(\alpha_s^2)$ contribution to the pion's form factor.
