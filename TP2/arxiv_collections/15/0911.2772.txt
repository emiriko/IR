Casson-type invariants emerging from Donaldson theory over certain negative
definite 4-manifolds were recently suggested by Andrei Teleman. These are
defined by a count of a zero-dimensional moduli space of flat instantons.
Motivated by the cobordism program of proving Witten's conjecture, we use a
moduli space of PU(2) Seiberg-Witten monopoles to exhibit an oriented
one-dimensional cobordism of the instanton moduli space to the empty space. The
Casson-type invariant must therefore vanish.
