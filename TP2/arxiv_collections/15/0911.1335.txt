The following parameters are determined for 63 Galactic supergiants in the
solar neighbourhood: effective temperature Teff, surface gravity log g, iron
abundance log e(Fe), microturbulent parameter Vt, mass M/Msun, age t and
distance d. A significant improvement in the accuracy of the determination of
log g and, all parameters dependent on it, is obtained through application of
van Leeuwens (2007) re-reduction of the Hipparcos parallaxes. The typical error
in the log g values is now +-0.06 dex for supergiants with distances d < 300 pc
and +-0.12 dex for supergiants with d between 300 and 700 pc; the mean error in
Teff for these stars is +-120 K. For supergiants with d > 700 pc parallaxes are
uncertain or unmeasurable, so typical errors in their log g values are 0.2-0.3
dex.
  A new Teff scale for A5-G5 stars of luminosity classes Ib-II is presented.
Spectral subtypes and luminosity classes of several stars are corrected.
Combining the Teff and log g with evolutionary tracks, stellar masses and ages
are determined; a majority of the sample has masses between 4 Msun and 15 Msun
and, hence, their progenitors were early to middle B-type main sequence stars.
  Using Fe ii lines, which are insensitive to departures from LTE, the
microturbulent parameter Vt and the iron abundance log e(Fe) are determined
from high-resolution spectra. The parameter Vt is correlated with gravity: Vt
increases with decreasing log g. The mean iron abundance for the 48 supergiants
with distances d < 700 pc is log e(Fe)=7.48+-0.09, a value close to the solar
value of 7.45+-0.05, and thus the local supergiants and the Sun have the same
metallicity.
