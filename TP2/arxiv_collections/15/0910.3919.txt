We present a program to study D semi-leptonic decay form factors with HISQ
charm and light quarks. In this exploratory work, we study $D_s$ to $\eta_s$,
$l\nu_l$ semi-leptonic decay on MILC coarse ($20^3\times64$) gauge
configurations with 2+1 dynamical flavors. We develop a new method to calculate
$f_+(0)$ and $f_0(q^2)$ from scalar current matrix elements,
$<\pi|\bar{s}c|D>$, which does not require any operator renormalization. We
also determine $f_+(q^2)$ and $f_0(q^2)$ from vector currents with a fully
non-perturbative renormalization method.
