We present a classical probability model appropriate to the description of
quantum randomness. This tool, that we have called stochastic gauge system,
constitutes a contextual scheme in which the Kolmogorov probability space
depends upon the experimental setup, in accordance with quantum mechanics.
Therefore, the probability space behaves like a gauge parameter. We discuss the
technical issues of this theory and apply the concept to classically emulate
quantum entangled states and even `super-quantum' systems. We exhibit bipartite
examples leading to maximum violation of Bell-CHSH inequalities like EPR pairs
or exceeding the Tsirelson bound like PR-boxes, as well as tripartite cases
simulating GHZ or W-states. We address also the question of partially
correlated systems and multipartite entanglements. In this model, the classical
equivalent of the entanglement entropy is identified with the Kullback-Leibler
divergence. Hence, we propose a natural generalisation of this function to
multipartite systems, leading to a simple evaluation of the degree of
entanglement and determining the bounds of maximum entanglement. Finally, we
obtain a constructive necessary and sufficient condition of multipartite
entanglement.
