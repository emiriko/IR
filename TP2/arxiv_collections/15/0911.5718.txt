The results of speckle interferometric measurements of binary and multiple
stars conducted in 2008 and 2009 at the Blanco and SOAR 4-m telescopes in Chile
are presented. A total of 1898 measurements of 1189 resolved pairs or
sub-systems and 394 observations of 285 un-resolved targets are listed. We
resolved for the first time 48 new pairs, 21 of which are new sub-systems in
close visual multiple stars. Typical internal measurement precision is 0.3 mas
in both coordinates, typical companion detection capability is $\Delta m \sim
4.2$ at 0\farcs15 separation. These data were obtained with a new
electron-multiplication CCD camera; data processing is described in detail,
including estimation of magnitude difference, observational errors, detection
limits, and analysis of artifacts. We comment on some newly discovered pairs
and objects of special interest.
