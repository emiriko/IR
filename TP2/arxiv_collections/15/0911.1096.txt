We evaluate the quantum discord dynamics of two qubits in independent and
common non-Markovian environments. We compare the dynamics of entanglement with
that of quantum discord. For independent reservoirs the quantum discord
vanishes only at discrete instants whereas the entanglement can disappear
during a finite time interval. For a common reservoir, quantum discord and
entanglement can behave very differently with sudden birth of the former but
not of the latter. Furthermore, in this case the quantum discord dynamics
presents sudden changes in the derivative of its time evolution which is
evidenced by the presence of kinks in its behavior at discrete instants of
time.
