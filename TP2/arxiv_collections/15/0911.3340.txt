It has been shown recently that phantom-like effect can be realized on the
normal branch of the DGP setup without introduction of any phantom matter
neither in the bulk nor on the brane and therefore without violation of the
null energy condition. It has been shown also that inclusion of the
Gauss-Bonnet term in the bulk action modifies this picture via curvature
effects. Here, based on the Lue-Starkman conjecture on the dynamical screening
of the brane cosmological constant in the DGP setup, we extend this proposal to
a general DGP-inspired $f(R,\phi)$ model that stringy effects in the
ultra-violet sector of the theory are taken into account by inclusion of the
Gauss-Bonnet term in the bulk action. We study cosmological dynamics of this
setup, especially its phantom-like behavior and possible crossing of the
phantom divide line especially with a non-minimally coupled quintessence field
on the brane. In this setup, scalar field and curvature quintessence are
treated in a unified framework.
