Among a sample of 140 OB associations and clusters, we want to identify
probable parent associations for the Guitar pulsar (PSR B2224+65) which would
then also constrain its age. For this purpose, we are using an Euler-Cauchy
technique treating the vertical component of the galactic potential to
calculate the trajectories of the pulsar and each association into the past. To
include errors we use Monte-Carlo simulations varying the initial parameters
within their error intervals. The whole range of possible pulsar radial
velocities is taken into account during the simulations. We find that the
Guitar pulsar most probably originated from the Cygnus OB3 association ~0.8 Myr
ago inferring a current radial velocity of v_r~-30 km/s, consistent with the
inclination of its bow shock.
