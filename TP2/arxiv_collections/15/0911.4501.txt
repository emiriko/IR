[abridged] Three years of optical monitoring of the low-mass X-ray binary
(LMXB) 4U 1957+11 is presented. The source was observed in V, R and i-bands
using the Faulkes Telescopes North and South. The light curve is dominated by
long-term variations which are correlated (at the > 3 sigma level) with the
RXTE ASM soft X-ray flux. The variations span one magnitude in all three
filters. We find no evidence for periodicities in our light curves, contrary to
a previous short-timescale optical study in which the flux varied on a 9.3-hour
sinusoidal period by a smaller amplitude. The optical spectral energy
distribution is blue and typical of LMXBs in outburst, as is the power law
index of the correlation beta = 0.5, where F_{nu,OPT} propto F_X^beta. The
discrete cross-correlation function reveals a peak at an X-ray lag of 2 - 14
days, which could be the viscous timescale. However, adopting the least squares
method the strongest correlation is at a lag of 0 +/- 4 days, consistent with
X-ray reprocessing on the surface of the disc. We therefore constrain the
optical lag behind X-ray to be between -14 and +4 days. In addition, we use the
optical - X-ray luminosity diagram for LMXBs as a diagnostic tool to constrain
the nature of the compact object in 4U 1957+11, since black hole (BH) and
neutron star (NS) sources reside in different regions of this diagram. If the
system contains a BH (as is the currently favoured hypothesis), its distance
must exceed ~ 20 kpc for the optical and X-ray luminosities to be consistent
with other soft state BH systems. For distances < 20 kpc, the data lie in a
region of the diagram populated only by NS sources. 4U 1957+11 is unique: it is
either the only BH LMXB to exist in an apparent persistent soft state, or it is
a NS LMXB which behaves like a black hole.
