A solution of the large discrepancy existing between inclusive and exclusive
measurements of the ${}^8{\rm Li}+{}^4{\rm He}\to{}^{11}{\rm B}+n$ reaction
cross section at $E_{cm} <3$ MeV is evaluated. This problem has profound
astrophysical relevance for this reaction is of great interest in Big-Bang and
r-process nucleosynthesis. By means of a novel technique, a comprehensive study
of all existing ${}^8{\rm Li}+{}^4{\rm He}\to{}^{11}{\rm B}+n$ cross section
data is carried out, setting up a consistent picture in which all the inclusive
measurements provide the reliable value of the cross section. New unambiguous
signatures of the strong branch pattern non-uniformities, near the threshold of
higher ${}^{11}{\rm B}$ excited levels, are presented and their possible
origin, in terms of the cluster structure of the involved excited states of
${}^{11}{\rm B}$ and ${}^{12}{\rm B}$ nuclei, is discussed.
