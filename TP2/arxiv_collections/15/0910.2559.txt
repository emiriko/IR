Many physical and chemical processes, such as folding of biopolymers, are
best described as dynamics on large combinatorial energy landscapes. A concise
approximate description of dynamics is obtained by partitioning the
micro-states of the landscape into macro-states. Since most landscapes of
interest are not tractable analytically, the probabilities of transitions
between macro-states need to be extracted numerically from the microscopic
ones, typically by full enumeration of the state space. Here we propose to
approximate transition probabilities by a Markov chain Monte-Carlo method. For
landscapes of the number partitioning problem and an RNA switch molecule we
show that the method allows for accurate probability estimates with
significantly reduced computational cost.
