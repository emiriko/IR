We study the motion of N=2 overdamped Brownian particles in gravitational
interaction in a space of dimension d=2. This is equivalent to the simplified
motion of two biological entities interacting via chemotaxis when time delay
and degradation of the chemical are ignored. This problem also bears some
similarities with the stochastic motion of two point vortices in viscous
hydrodynamics [Agullo & Verga, Phys. Rev. E, 63, 056304 (2001)]. We
analytically obtain the density probability of finding the particles at a
distance r from each other at time t. We also determine the probability that
the particles have coalesced and formed a Dirac peak at time t (i.e. the
probability that the reduced particle has reached r=0 at time t). Finally, we
investigate the variance of the distribution <r^2> and discuss the proper form
of the virial theorem for this system. The reduced particle has a normal
diffusion behaviour for small times with a gravity-modified diffusion
coefficient <r^2>=r_0^2+(4k_B/\xi\mu)(T-T_*)t, where k_BT_{*}=Gm_1m_2/2 is a
critical temperature, and an anomalous diffusion for large times
<r^2>~t^(1-T_*/T). As a by-product, our solution also describes the growth of
the Dirac peak (condensate) that forms in the post-collapse regime of the
Smoluchowski-Poisson system (or Keller-Segel model) for T<T_c=GMm/(4k_B). We
find that the saturation of the mass of the condensate to the total mass is
algebraic in an infinite domain and exponential in a bounded domain.
