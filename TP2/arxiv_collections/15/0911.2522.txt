This paper describes the design, fabrication, installation and performance of
the new inner layer called Layer 0 (L0) that was inserted in the existing Run
IIa Silicon Micro-Strip Tracker (SMT) of the D0 experiment at the Fermilab
Tevatron collider. L0 provides tracking information from two layers of sensors,
which are mounted with center lines at a radial distance of 16.1 mm and 17.6 mm
respectively from the beam axis. The sensors and readout electronics are
mounted on a specially designed and fabricated carbon fiber structure that
includes cooling for sensor and readout electronics. The structure has a thin
polyimide circuit bonded to it so that the circuit couples electrically to the
carbon fiber allowing the support structure to be used both for detector
grounding and a low impedance connection between the remotely mounted hybrids
and the sensors.
