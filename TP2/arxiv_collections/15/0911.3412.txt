The interaction among the three sub-dynamics of economic exchange,
technological innovation, and institutional control can be captured with a
generalized Triple Helix model. We propose to use the information contained in
the configuration among the three sub-dynamics as an indicator of the synergy
in a configuration. This measure indicates the reduction of the uncertainty
which prevails at the level of an innovation system. On the basis of data at
the district level in Germany, the conclusions of a previous study about the
Netherlands are tested: medium-tech manufacturing is the main driver of the
knowledge-based configuration in a regional economy, while knowledge-intensive
services tend to uncouple the economy from the regional configuration. At the
level of regions (NUTS-2) Germany's knowledge-based economy is no longer
structured in terms of the previous East-West divide of the country, while this
divide has prevailed at the level of the states (NUTS-1) that constitute the
Federal Republic. However, the effects of high and medium-tech are not specific
for the western or eastern parts of the country. The configuration of
medium-tech manufacturing can be considered a better indicator of the
knowledge-based economy than that of high-tech manufacturing.
