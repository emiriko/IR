This paper presents an empirical discussion on the design and implementation
of a power-efficient Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol for in-body and
on-body sensor networks. We analyze the performance of a beacon-enabled IEEE
802.15.4, PB-TDMA, and S-MAC protocols for on-body sensor networks. We further
present a Traffic Based Wakeup Mechanism that utilizes the traffic patterns of
the BAN Nodes (BNs) to accommodate the entire BSN traffic. To enable a logical
connection between different BNs working on different frequency bands, a method
called Bridging function is proposed. The Bridging function integrates all BNs
working on different bands into a complete BSN.
