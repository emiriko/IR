We report the measurement of multivariable scaling functions for the temporal
average shape of Barkhausen noise avalanches, and show that they are consistent
with the predictions of simple mean-field theories. We bypass the confounding
factors of time-retarded interactions (eddy currents) by measuring thin permal-
loy films, and bypass thresholding effects and amplifier distortions by
applying Wiener deconvolution. We find experimental shapes that are
approximately symmetric, and track the evolution of the scaling function. We
solve a mean- field theory for the magnetization dynamics and calculate the
form of the scaling function in the presence of a demagnetizing field and a
finite field ramp-rate, yielding quantitative agreement with the experiment.
