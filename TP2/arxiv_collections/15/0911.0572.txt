We present the Monte Carlo event generator WINHAC for the charged-current
Drell-Yan process, i.e. single W-boson production with leptonic decays in
hadronic collisions. It features multiphoton radiationwithin the
Yennie-Frautschi-Suura exclusive exponentiation scheme with O(alpha)
electroweak corrections. For the initial-state QCD/QED parton shower and
hadronisation it is interfaced directly to PYTHIA. It implements the options
for proton-proton, proton-antipronton and any nucleus-nucleus collisions.
Moreover, it includes the polarized W-boson production and the neutral current
Drell-Yan process, both at the Born level. Generation of weighted as well as
unweighted (weight=1) events is possible. WINHAC has been thoroughly tested
numerically and cross-checked with independent Monte Carlo programs, such as
HORACE and SANC; in the so-called tuned comparisons, an agreement at the
sub-permil-level has been reached. It has also been used as a basic tool for
developing and testing some new measurement methods of the Standard Model
parameters at the LHC.
