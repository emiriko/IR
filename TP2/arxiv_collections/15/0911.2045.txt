This paper reports the synthesis and superconducting behaviors of the
tetragonal iron-chalcogenide superconductor FeSe. The electrical resistivity
and magnetic moment measurements confirmed its superconductivity with a
$T_c^{zero}$ and $T_c^{mag}$ at 9.4 K under ambient pressure. EPMA indicated
the sample to have a stoichiometric Fe:Se ratio of 1:1 ($\pm$0.02). The Seebeck
coefficient which was 12.3 $\mu$V/K at room temperature, changed to a negative
value near 200 K, indicating it to be a two carriers material. Above $T_c$, the
$\rho(T)$ curve revealed an 'S' shape. Hence $d\rho(T)/dT$, and
$d^2\rho(T)/dT^2$ showed pseudogap-like behavior at $T^*$=110 K according to
the resistivity curvature mapping (RCM) method for high $T_c$ cuprates.
Moreover, the magnetoresistance $\rho_H(T)/\rho_{H=0}$ under a magnetic field
and the Seebeck coefficient $S(T)$ revealed revealed pseudogap-like behavior
near $T^*$. Interestingly, at the same temperature, 30 K, the sign of $S(T)$
and all signs of $d^2\rho(T)/dT^2$ changed from negative to positive above
$T_c$.
