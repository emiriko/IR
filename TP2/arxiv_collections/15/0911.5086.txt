Given a set $\Sigma$ of spheres in $\mathbb{E}^d$, with $d\ge{}3$ and $d$
odd, having a fixed number of $m$ distinct radii $\rho_1,\rho_2,...,\rho_m$, we
show that the worst-case combinatorial complexity of the convex hull
$CH_d(\Sigma)$ of $\Sigma$ is
$\Theta(\sum_{1\le{}i\ne{}j\le{}m}n_in_j^{\lfloor\frac{d}{2}\rfloor})$, where
$n_i$ is the number of spheres in $\Sigma$ with radius $\rho_i$.
  To prove the lower bound, we construct a set of $\Theta(n_1+n_2)$ spheres in
$\mathbb{E}^d$, with $d\ge{}3$ odd, where $n_i$ spheres have radius $\rho_i$,
$i=1,2$, and $\rho_2\ne\rho_1$, such that their convex hull has combinatorial
complexity
$\Omega(n_1n_2^{\lfloor\frac{d}{2}\rfloor}+n_2n_1^{\lfloor\frac{d}{2}\rfloor})$.
Our construction is then generalized to the case where the spheres have
$m\ge{}3$ distinct radii.
  For the upper bound, we reduce the sphere convex hull problem to the problem
of computing the worst-case combinatorial complexity of the convex hull of a
set of $m$ $d$-dimensional convex polytopes lying on $m$ parallel hyperplanes
in $\mathbb{E}^{d+1}$, where $d\ge{}3$ odd, a problem which is of independent
interest. More precisely, we show that the worst-case combinatorial complexity
of the convex hull of a set $\{\mathcal{P}_1,\mathcal{P}_2,...,\mathcal{P}_m\}$
of $m$ $d$-dimensional convex polytopes lying on $m$ parallel hyperplanes of
$\mathbb{E}^{d+1}$ is
$O(\sum_{1\le{}i\ne{}j\le{}m}n_in_j^{\lfloor\frac{d}{2}\rfloor})$, where $n_i$
is the number of vertices of $\mathcal{P}_i$.
  We end with algorithmic considerations, and we show how our tight bounds for
the parallel polytope convex hull problem, yield tight bounds on the
combinatorial complexity of the Minkowski sum of two convex polytopes in
$\mathbb{E}^d$.
