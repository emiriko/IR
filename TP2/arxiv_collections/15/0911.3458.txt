This paper aims to find new explicit solutions including multi-soliton,
multi-positon, multi-negaton, and multi-periodic for a coupled Volterra lattice
system which is an integrable discrete version of the coupled KdV equation. The
dynamical properties of these new solutions are discussed in detail.
