In recent years it has emerged that the high energy behavior of gravity could
be governed by an ultraviolet non-Gaussian fixed point of the (dimensionless)
Newton's constant, whose behavior at high energy is thus {\it antiscreened}.
This phenomenon has several astrophysical implications. In particular in this
article recent works on renormalization group improved cosmologies based upon a
renormalization group trajectory of Quantum Einstein Gravity with realistic
parameter values will be reviewed. It will be argued that quantum effects can
account for the entire entropy of the present Universe in the massless sector
and give rise to a phase of inflationary expansion. Moreover the prediction for
the final state of the black hole evaporation is a Planck size remnant which is
formed in an infinite time.
