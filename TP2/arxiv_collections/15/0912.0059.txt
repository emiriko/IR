In this paper, we investigate finitely generated groups of isometries of
CAT(0) spaces containing some central hyperbolic isometry, and study CAT(0)
groups. We show that every CAT(0) group $\Gamma$ has the semi-direct product
structure
$\Gamma=(\cdots(((\Gamma'\rtimes\langle\delta_{n}\rangle)\rtimes\langle\delta_{n-1}\rangle)\rtimes\langle\delta_{n-2}\rangle)\cdots)\rtimes\langle\delta_{1}\rangle$
where $\Gamma'$ is a CAT(0) group with finite center and $\delta_i\in \Gamma$
for $i=1,\dots,n$, and $\Gamma$ contains a finite-index subgroup $\Gamma'\times
A$ where $A$ is isomorphic to ${\mathbb{Z}}^n$. We introduce some examples and
remarks. Also we provide an example of a virtually irreducible CAT(0) group
with trivial-center that acts geometrically on some CAT(0) space that splits as
a product $T \times {\mathbb{R}}$.
