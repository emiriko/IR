We present a didactical approach to the which-way experiment and the
counterintuitive effect of the quantum erasure for one-particle quantum
interferences. The fundamental concept of entanglement plays a central role and
highlights the complementarity between quantum interference and knowledge of
which path is followed by the particle.
