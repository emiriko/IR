We show the exact solution of Bogoliubov equations at zero-energy in the
critical supercurrent state for arbitrary shape of potential barrier. With use
of this solution, we prove the absence of perfect transmission of excitations
in the low-energy limit by giving the explicit expression of transmission
coefficient. The origin of disappearance of perfect transmission is the
emergence of zero-energy density fluctuation near the potential barrier.
