Recently the Fermi GBM and LAT Collaborations reported their new
observational data disfavoring quite a number of the quantum gravity theories,
including the one suggesting the nonlinear (logarithmic) modification of a
quantum wave equation. We show that the latter is still far from being ruled
out: it is not only able to explain the new data but also its phenomenological
implications turn out to be more vast (and more interesting) than one expected
before.
