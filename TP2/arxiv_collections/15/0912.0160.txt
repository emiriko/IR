We derive the expression for the anisotropic heterogeneous matrices of
permittivity and permeability associated with two-dimensional polygonal and
star shaped cloaks. We numerically show using finite elements that the forward
scattering worsens when we increase the number of sides in the latter cloaks,
whereas it improves for the former ones. This antagonistic behavior is
discussed using a rigorous asymptotic approach. We use a symmetry group
theoretical approach to derive the cloaks design.
