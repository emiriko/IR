In conventional supervised pattern recognition tasks, model selection is
typically accomplished by minimizing the classification error rate on a set of
so-called development data, subject to ground-truth labeling by human experts
or some other means. In the context of speech processing systems and other
large-scale practical applications, however, such labeled development data are
typically costly and difficult to obtain. This article proposes an alternative
semi-supervised framework for likelihood-based model selection that leverages
unlabeled data by using trained classifiers representing each model to
automatically generate putative labels. The errors that result from this
automatic labeling are shown to be amenable to results from robust statistics,
which in turn provide for minimax-optimal censored likelihood ratio tests that
recover the nonparametric sign test as a limiting case. This approach is then
validated experimentally using a state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition
system to select between candidate word pronunciations using unlabeled speech
data that only potentially contain instances of the words under test. Results
provide supporting evidence for the utility of this approach, and suggest that
it may also find use in other applications of machine learning.
