In this second paper of the series on the coherence of wave packets, we study
neutrinos in high energy experiments where neutrinos are produced by decays of
pions or muons which are described using wave packets. The space time position
where one neutrino is produced is not fixed to one value but is extended in
macroscopic area. Hence the amplitude is defined by a superposition of the
amplitudes of different neutrino's production time in the macroscopic region
and depends on the absolute value of the neutrino mass. We analyze neutrino
interference based on operator product expansion near the light cone and find a
new universal term in the time dependent neutrino probability. This new term
has an origin in higher order quantum effect in a similar manner as axial
anomaly. Roles of Lorentz invariance and the operator product expansion in the
light-cone region are clarified and a possibility of measuring the absolute
value of neutrino mass from neutrino interference experiments is pointed out.
