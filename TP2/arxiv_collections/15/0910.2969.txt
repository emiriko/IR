In light of recent experimental information from the CLEO, BaBar, KTeV, and
Belle collaborations, we investigate some consequences of the possibility that
a light spin-one particle is responsible for the three Sigma^+ -> p mu^+ mu^-
events observed by the HyperCP experiment. In particular, allowing the new
particle to have both vector and axial-vector couplings to ordinary fermions,
we systematically study its contributions to various processes involving
b-flavored mesons, including B-Bbar mixing as well as leptonic, inclusive, and
exclusive B decays. Using the latest experimental data, we extract bounds on
its couplings and subsequently estimate upper limits for the branching ratios
of a number of B decays with the new particle. This can serve to guide
experimental searches for the particle in order to help confirm or refute its
existence.
