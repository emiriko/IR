We have produced high-quality complex microwave circuits, such as multiplexed
resonators and superconducting phase qubits, using a "vacuum-gap" technology
that eliminates lossy dielectric materials. We have improved our design and
fabrication strategy beyond our earlier work, leading to increased yield,
enabling the realization of these complex circuits. We incorporate both novel
vacuum-gap wiring crossovers (VGX) for gradiometric inductors and vacuum-gap
capacitors(VGC) on chip to produce resonant circuits that have large internal
quality factors (30,000<Q<165,000) at 50 mK, outperforming most
dielectric-filled devices. Resonators with VGCs as large as 180 pF confirm
single mode behavior of our lumped-element components.
