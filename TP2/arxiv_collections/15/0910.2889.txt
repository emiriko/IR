We investigate the deconfinement transition in SU(Nc) gauge theories, and
properties of the deconfined phase. A detailed lattice study of SU(4) and SU(6)
gauge theories are conducted, and finite volume and cutoff effects on
thermodynamic observables are studied. The scaling of the deconfinement
transition point with lattice spacing is used to calculate the scale,
Lambda_MSbar. The continuum estimates of the thermodynamic quantities are used
to study properties of the gluon plasma. In particular, the approach to
conformal limit is studied. We do not find any evidence of a strongly coupled,
conformal phase in these theories.
