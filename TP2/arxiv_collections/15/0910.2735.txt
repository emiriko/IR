We report the dispersion measurements, using angle-resolved reflection
electron-energy-loss-spectroscopy (AREELS), on two-dimensional (2D) plasmons in
single and multilayer graphene which couple strongly to surface optical phonon
(FK phonon) modes of silicon carbide substrate. The coupled modes show discrete
dispersion behaviors in the single and bilayer graphene. With increasing
graphene layers on SiC(0001), a transition from plasmon-like dispersion to
phonon-like dispersion is observed. For plasmon-like modes, the dispersion is
strongly damped by electron-hole pair excitations at entering single-particle
continuum, while phonon-like mode is undamped. In the region free of coupling,
the graphene 2D plasmon exhibits acoustic behavior with linear dispersion with
slope and damping determined by the Fermi surface topology.
