Selected results from tau analyses performed using the BaBar detector at the
SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory are presented. A precise measurement of
the tau mass and the tau{+} tau{-} mass difference is undertaken using the
hadronic decay mode tau- --> pi+ pi- pi- nu. In addition an investigation into
the strange decay modes tau- --> K0S pi- pi0 nu and tau- --> K0S pi- nu is also
presented, including a fit to the tau- --> K0S pi-nu invariant mass spectrum.
Precise values for the Mass and Width of the K*(892) are obtained.
