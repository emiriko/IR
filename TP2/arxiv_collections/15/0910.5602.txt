Already with very first data, the ATLAS experiment should be sensitive to a
SUSY signal well beyond the regions explored by the Tevatron. We present a
detailed study of the ATLAS discovery reach in the parameter space for various
SUSY models. The expected uncertainties on the background estimates are taken
ito account.
