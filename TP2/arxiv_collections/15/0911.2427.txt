Constructing dynamical maps from the filtered output of numerical
integrations, we analyze the structure of the $\nu_\odot$ secular resonance for
fictitious irregular satellites in retrograde orbits. This commensurability is
associated to the secular angle $\theta = \varpi - \varpi_\odot$, where
$\varpi$ is the longitude of pericenter of the satellite and $\varpi_\odot$
corresponds to the (fixed) planetocentric orbit of the Sun. Our study is
performed in the restricted three-body problem, where the satellites are
considered as massless particles around a massive planet and perturbed by the
Sun. Depending on the initial conditions, the resonance presents a diversity of
possible resonant modes, including librations of $\theta$ around zero (as found
for Sinope and Pasiphae) or 180 degrees, as well as asymmetric librations (e.g.
Narvi). Symmetric modes are present in all giant planets, although each regime
appears restricted to certain values of the satellite inclination. Asymmetric
solutions, on the other hand, seem absent around Neptune due to its almost
circular heliocentric orbit. Simulating the effects of a smooth orbital
migration on the satellite, we find that the resonance lock is preserved as
long as the induced change in semimajor axis is much slower compared to the
period of the resonant angle (adiabatic limit). However, the librational mode
may vary during the process, switching between symmetric and asymmetric
oscillations. Finally, we present a simple scaling transformation that allows
to estimate the resonant structure around any giant planet from the results
calculated around a single primary mass.
