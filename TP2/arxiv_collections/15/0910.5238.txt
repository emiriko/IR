Recently spin-transistors receive considerable attention as a
highly-functional building block of future integrated circuits. In order to
realize spin-transistors, it is essential that technology of efficient spin
injection/detection for semiconductor channel is established. However, this is
not so easy challenge owing to ferromagnet/semiconductor-interface-related
several problems. In this paper, we demonstrate pseudo-spin-MOSFET (PS-MOSFET)
architecture that is a new circuit approach using an ordinary MOSFET and
magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) to reproduce the functions of spin transistors.
