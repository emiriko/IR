The plasmon resonance of metal nanoparticles can enhance and direct light
from optical emitters in much the same way that radio frequency (RF) antennas
enhance and direct the emission from electrical circuits. In the RF regime, a
typical antenna design for high directivity is the Yagi-Uda antenna, which
basically consists of a one-dimensional array of antenna elements driven by a
single feed element. Here, we present the experimental demonstration of
directional light emission from a nano-optical Yagi-Uda antenna composed of an
array of appropriately tuned gold nanorods. Our results indicate that
nano-optical antenna arrays are a simple but efficient tool for the spatial
control of light emission.
