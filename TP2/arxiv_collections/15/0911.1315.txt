WMAP5 and related data have greatly restricted the range of acceptable
cosmologies, by providing precise likelihood ellypses on the the w_0-w_a plane.
We discuss first how such ellypses can be numerically rebuilt, and present then
a map of constant-w models whose spectra, at various redshift, are expected to
coincide with acceptable models within ~1%.
