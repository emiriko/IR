The seeding of vortex domain walls in V-shaped nanowires by a magnetic field
has been investigated via simulations and Scanning Electron Microscopy with
Polarization Analysis (SEMPA). It is found that the orientation of the magnetic
field can be used to purposely tune the chirality, polarity and position of
single vortex domain walls in soft magnetic nanowires.
