Recent theoretical developments have shown that gauge mediation has a much
larger parameter space of possible spectra and mixings than previously
considered. Motivated by this, we explore the collider phenomenology of gauge
mediation models where a general neutralino is the lightest MSSM superpartner
(the NLSP), focusing on the potential reach from existing and future Tevatron
searches. Promptly decaying general neutralino NLSPs can give rise to final
states involving missing energy plus photons, Zs, Ws and/or Higgses. We survey
the final states and determine those where the Tevatron should have the most
sensitivity. We then estimate the reach of existing Tevatron searches in these
final states and discuss new searches (or optimizations of existing ones) that
should improve the reach. Finally we comment on the potential for discovery at
the LHC.
