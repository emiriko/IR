The deduction of a constant of motion, a Lagrangian, and a Hamiltonian for
relativistic particle moving in a dissipative medium characterized by a force
which depends on the square of the velocity of the particle is done. It is
shown that meanwhile the trajectories in the space (x,v), defined by the
constant of motion, look as one might expected, the trajectories in the space
(x,p), defined by the Hamiltonian, have a odd behavior.
