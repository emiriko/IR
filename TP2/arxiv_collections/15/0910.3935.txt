Mid-infrared (IR) observations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and
molecular hydrogen emission are a potentially powerful tool to derive physical
properties of dense environments irradiated by intense UV fields. We present
new, spatially resolved, \emph{Spitzer} mid-IR spectroscopy of the high
UV-field and dense photodissocation region (PDR) around Monoceros R2, the
closest ultracompact \hII region, revealing the spatial structure of ionized
gas, PAHs and H$_2$ emissions. Using a PDR model and PAH emission feature
fitting algorithm, we build a comprehensive picture of the physical conditions
prevailing in the region. We show that the combination of the measurement of
PAH ionization fraction and of the ratio between the H$_2$ 0-0 S(3) and S(2)
line intensities, respectively at 9.7 and 12.3 $\mu$m, allows to derive the
fundamental parameters driving the PDR: temperature, density and UV radiation
field when they fall in the ranges $T = 250-1500 $K, $n_H=10^4-10^6$cm$^{-3}$,
$G_0=10^3-10^5$ respectively. These mid-IR spectral tracers thus provide a tool
to probe the similar but unresolved UV-illuminated surface of protoplanetary
disks or the nuclei of starburst galaxies.
