The configuration-fixed deformation constrained relativistic mean field
approach with time-odd component has been applied to investigate the
ground-state properties of $^{33}$Mg with effective interaction PK1. The ground
state of $^{33}$Mg has been found to be prolate deformed, $\beta_2=0.23$, with
the odd neutron in $1/2[330]$ orbital and the energy -251.85 MeV which is close
to the data -252.06 MeV. The magnetic moment $- 0.9134 \mu_\mathrm{N}$ is
obtained with the effective electromagnetic current which well reproduces the
data $- 0.7456 \mu_\mathrm{N}$ self-consistently without introducing any
parameter. The energy splittings of time reversal conjugate states, the neutron
current, the energy contribution from the nuclear magnetic potential, and the
effect of core polarization are discussed in detail.
