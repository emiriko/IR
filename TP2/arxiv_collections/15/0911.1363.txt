We report on nine wide common proper motion systems containing late-type M,
L, or T companions. We confirm six previously reported companions, and identify
three new systems. The ages of these systems are determined using diagnostics
for both stellar primaries and low--mass secondaries and masses for the
secondaries are inferred using evolutionary models. Of our three new
discoveries, the M3+T6.5 pair G 204-39 and SDSS J1758+4633 has an age
constrained to 0.5-1.5 Gyr making the secondary a potentially useful brown
dwarf benchmark. The G5+L4 pair G 200-28 and SDSS J1416+5006 has a projected
separation of ~25,000 AU making it one of the widest and lowest binding energy
systems known to date. The system containing NLTT 2274 and SDSS J0041+1341 is
an older M4+L0 (>4.5 Gyr) pair which shows Halpha activity in the secondary but
not the primary making it a useful tracer of age/mass/activity trends. We find
a resolved binary frequency for widely-separated (> 100 AU) low--mass
companions (i.e. at least a triple system) which is at least twice the
frequency found for the field ultracool dwarf population. The ratio of triples
to binaries and quadruples to binaries is also high for this sample: 3:5 and
1:4, respectively, compared to 8-parsec sample values of 1:4 and 1:26. The
additional components in these wide companion systems indicates a formation
mechanism that requires a third or fourth component to maintain gravitational
stability or facilitate the exchange of angular momentum. The binding energies
for the nine multiples discussed in this text are among the lowest known for
wide low-mass systems, suggesting that weakly bound, low--to--intermediate mass
(0.2M_sun < M_tot <1.0M_sun) multiples can form and survive to exist in the
field (1-8 Gyr).
