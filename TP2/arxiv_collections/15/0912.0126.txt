In this paper we generalize an identity first given by Heinrich Eduard Heine
in his treatise, {\it Handbuch der Kugelfunctionen, Theorie und Anwendungen
(1881), which gives a Fourier series for $1/[z-\cos\psi]^{1/2}$, for
$z,\psi\in\R$, and $z>1$, in terms of associated Legendre functions of the
second kind with odd-half-integer degree and vanishing order. In this paper we
give a generalization of this identity as a Fourier series of
$1/[z-\cos\psi]^\mu$, where $z,\mu\in\C$, $|z|>1$, and the coefficients of the
expansion are given in terms of the same functions with order given by
$\frac12-\mu$. We are also able to compute certain closed-form expressions for
associated Legendre functions of the second kind.
