Anisotropic magnetic properties of single crystalline RAu_{2}Ge_{2} (R = La,
Ce and Pr) compounds are reported. LaAu_{2}Ge_{2} exhibit a Pauli-paramagnetic
behavior whereas CeAu_{2}Ge_{2} and PrAu_{2}Ge_{2} show an antiferromagnetic
ordering with N\grave{e}el temperatures T_{N} = 13.5 and 9 K, respectively. The
anisotropic magnetic response of Ce and Pr compounds establishes [001] as the
easy axis of magnetization and a sharp spin-flip type metamagnetic transition
is observed in the magnetic isotherms. The resistance and magnetoresistance
behavior of these compounds, in particular LaAu_{2}Ge_{2}, indicate an
anisotropic Fermi surface. The magnetoresistivity of CeAu_{2}Ge_{2} apparently
reveals the presence of a residual Kondo interaction. A crystal electric field
analysis of the anisotropic susceptibility in conjunction with the
experimentally inferred Schottky heat capacity enables us to propose a crystal
electric field level scheme for Ce and Pr compounds. For CeAu_{2}Ge_{2} our
values are in excellent agreement with the previous reports on neutron
diffraction. The heat capacity data in LaAu_{2}Ge_{2} show clearly the
existence of Einstein contribution to the heat capacity.
