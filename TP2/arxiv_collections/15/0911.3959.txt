We examine the nature and statistical properties of electron-electron
collisions in the recollision process in a strong laser field. The separation
of the double ionization yield into sequential and nonsequential components
leads to a bell-shaped curve for the nonsequential probability and a
monotonically rising one for the sequential process. We identify key features
of the nonsequential process and connect our findings in a simplified model
which reproduces the knee shape for the probability of double ionization with
laser intensity and associated trends.
