The N = 1 supersymmetric Born-Infeld action is known to describe the vector
Goldstone multiplet for partially broken N = 2 rigid supersymmetry, and this
model is believed to be unique. However, it can be deformed by adding the
Fayet-Iliopoulos term without losing the second nonlinearly realized
supersymmetry. Although the first supersymmetry then becomes spontaneously
broken, the deformed action still describes partial N = 2 to N = 1
supersymmetry breaking. The unbroken supercharges in this theory correspond to
a different choice of N = 1 subspace in the N = 2 superspace, as compared with
the undeformed case. Implications of the Fayet-Iliopoulos term for general
models for self-dual nonlinear supersymmetric electrodynamics are discussed.
The known ubiquitous appearance of the Volkov-Akulov action in such models is
explained. We also present a two-parameter duality-covariant deformation of the
N = 1 supersymmetric Born-Infeld action as a model for partial breaking of N =
2 supersymmetry.
