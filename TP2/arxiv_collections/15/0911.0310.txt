Our work aims at studying tools offered to learners and tutors involved in
face-to-face or blended project-based learning activities. To understand better
the needs and expectations of each actor, we are especially interested in the
specific case of project management training. The results of a course
observation show that the lack of monitoring and expertise transfer tools
involves important dysfunctions in the course organisation and therefore
dissatisfaction for tutors and students (in particular about the acquisition of
knowledge and expertise). So as to solve this problem, we propose a
personalised platform (according to the actor: project group, student or tutor)
which gives information to monitor activities and supports the acquisition and
transfer of expertise. This platform is meant for the complex educational
context of project-based learning. Indeed, as for the majority of project-based
learning activities, the articulation conceptualisation-experiment is an
important part of the process. The originality of our approach relies on also
supporting the articulation between action (experiment or conceptualisation)
and reflection. This approach so improves the acquisition of complex skills
(e.g. management, communication and collaboration), which requires a
behavioural evolution. We aim at making the students become able ?to learn to
learn' and evolve according to contexts. We facilitate their ability to have a
critical analysis of their actions according to the situations they encounter.
