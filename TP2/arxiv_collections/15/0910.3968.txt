A previously-developed hybrid particle-continuum method [J. B. Bell, A.
Garcia and S. A. Williams, SIAM Multiscale Modeling and Simulation,
6:1256-1280, 2008] is generalized to dense fluids and two and three dimensional
flows. The scheme couples an explicit fluctuating compressible Navier-Stokes
solver with the Isotropic Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) particle method
[A. Donev and A. L. Garcia and B. J. Alder, ArXiv preprint 0908.0510]. To
achieve bidirectional dynamic coupling between the particle (microscale) and
continuum (macroscale) regions, the continuum solver provides state-based
boundary conditions to the particle subdomain, while the particle solver
provides flux-based boundary conditions for the continuum subdomain. The
equilibrium diffusive (Brownian) motion of a large spherical bead suspended in
a particle fluid is examined, demonstrating that the hybrid method correctly
reproduces the velocity autocorrelation function of the bead but only if
thermal fluctuations are included in the continuum solver. Finally, the hybrid
is applied to the well-known adiabatic piston problem and it is found that the
hybrid correctly reproduces the slow non-equilibrium relaxation of the piston
toward thermodynamic equilibrium but, again, only the continuum solver includes
stochastic (white-noise) flux terms. These examples clearly demonstrate the
need to include fluctuations in continuum solvers employed in hybrid multiscale
methods.
