The magnetic properties of graphene on finite geometries are studied using a
self-consistent mean-field theory of the Hubbard model. This approach is known
to predict ferromagnetic edge states close to the zig-zag edges in single-layer
graphene quantum dots and nanoribbons. In order to assess the accuracy of this
method, we perform complementary exact diagonalization and quantum Monte Carlo
simulations. We observe good quantitative agreement for all quantities
investigated provided that the Coulomb interaction is not too strong.
