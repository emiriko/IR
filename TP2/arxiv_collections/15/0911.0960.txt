The observed abundances of Li7 and He4 are significantly inconsistent with
the predictions from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) when using the LCDM
cosmological model together with the value for Omega_Bh^2 = 0.0224 +/- 0.0009
from WMAP CMB fluctuations, with the value from BBN required to fit observed
abundances being 0.009<Omega_Bh^2<0.013. The dynamical 3-space theory is shown
to predict a 20% hotter universe in the radiation-dominated epoch, which then
results in a remarkable parameter-free agreement between the BBN and the WMAP
value for Omega_Bh^2. The dynamical 3-space also gives a parameter-free fit to
the supernova redshift data, and predicts that the LCDM model would require
Omega_L=0.73 and Omega_M=0.27 to fit the 3-space dynamics Hubble expansion, and
independently of the supernova data. These results amount to the discovery of
new physics for the early universe that is matched by numerous other successful
observational and experimental tests.
