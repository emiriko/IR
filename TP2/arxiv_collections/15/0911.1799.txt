In this paper we study the coupling between a quantum dot and the edge of a
non-Abelian fractional quantum Hall state. We assume the dot is small enough
that its level spacing is large compared to both the temperature and the
coupling to the spatially proximate bulk non-Abelian fractional quantum Hall
state. We focus on the physics of level degeneracy with electron number on the
dot. The physics of such a resonant level is governed by a $k$-channel Kondo
model when the quantum Hall state is a Read-Rezayi state at filling fraction
$\nu=2+k/(k+2)$ or its particle-hole conjugate at $\nu=2+2/(k+2)$. The
$k$-channel Kondo model is channel symmetric even without fine tuning any
couplings in the former state; in the latter, it is generically channel
asymmetric. The two limits exhibit non-Fermi liquid and Fermi liquid
properties, respectively, and therefore may be distinguished. By exploiting the
mapping between the resonant level model and the multichannel Kondo model, we
discuss the thermodynamic and transport properties of the system. In the
special case of $k=2$, our results provide a novel venue to distinguish between
the Pfaffian and anti-Pfaffian states at filling fraction $\nu=5/2$. We present
numerical estimates for realizing this scenario in experiment.
