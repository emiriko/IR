Single crystals FeSex were grown in an evacuated sealed quartz tube using
polycrystalline material by gas-transport reaction with I2 as a gas-carrier.
Crystals with hexagonal-prismatic, tetragonal-prismatic, planar-square and
hexagonal faceting 0.1 to 0.5 mm in size were obtained. The electronic
transport and magnetic prop-erties measurements of FeSex single crystal exhibit
an onset of superconducting transition Tc at up to 24 K.
