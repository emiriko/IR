In a number of recent articles in this journal F. Cardone and collaborators
have claimed the observation of several striking nuclear phenomena which they
attribute to "piezonuclear reactions". One such claim [Phys. Lett. A 373 (2009)
1956] is that subjecting a solution of 228Th to cavitation leads to a
"transformation" of thorium nuclei that is 104 times faster than the normal
nuclear decay for this isotope. In a "Comment" [Phys. Lett. A 373 (2009) 3795]
to the thorium work, we have criticized the evidence provided for this claim.
In a "Reply" [Phys. Lett. A 373 (2009) 3797] Cardone et al. answer only some
minor points but avoid addressing the real issue. The information provided in
their Reply displays a worrying lack of control of their experimental situation
and the data they put forward as evidence for their claims. We point out
several shortcomings and errors in the described experimental preparations,
set-up and reporting, as well as in the data analysis. We conclude that the
evidence presented by Cardone et al. is insufficient to justify their claims of
accelerated thorium decay (by "piezonuclear reactions" or otherwise). We also
briefly discuss the role of the physics community (peer review) in the
evaluation of new discoveries and claims.
