We present a new open superstring field theory, whose string fields carry an
arbitrary picture number and reside in the large Hilbert space. The redundancy
related to picture number is resolved by treating picture changing as a gauge
transformation. A mid-point insertion is imperative for this formalism. We find
that this mid-point insertion must include all multi-picture changing
operators. It is also proven that this insertion as well as all the
multi-picture changing operators are zero weight conformal primaries.
  This new theory solves the problems with the Ramond sector shared by other
RNS string field theories, while naturally unifying the NS and Ramond string
fields. When partially gauge fixed, it reduces in the NS sector to the modified
cubic superstring field theory. Hence, it shares all the good properties of
this theory, e.g., it has analytical vacuum and marginal deformation solutions.
  Treating the redundant gauge symmetry using the BV formalism is
straightforward and results in a cubic action with a single string field, whose
quantum numbers are unconstrained. The generalization to an arbitrary brane
system is simple and includes the standard Chan-Paton factors and the most
general string field consistent with the brane system.
