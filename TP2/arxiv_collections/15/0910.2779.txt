We observe a novel type of vector dark soliton in a fiber ring laser. The
vector dark soliton consists of stable localized structures separating the two
orthogonal linear polarization eigenstates of the laser emission and is visible
only when the total laser emission is measured. Moreover, polarization domain
splitting and moving polarization domain walls (PDWs) were also experimentally
observed.
