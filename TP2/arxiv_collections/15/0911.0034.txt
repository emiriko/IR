We analyze the Tevatron and Large Hadron Collider (LHC) reach for the Higgs
sector of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) in the presence of
explicit CP-violation. Using the most recent studies from the Tevatron and LHC
collaborations, we examine the CPX benchmark scenario for a range of
CP-violating phases in the soft trilinear and gluino mass terms and compute the
exclusion/discovery potentials for each collider on the $(M_{H^+}, \tan\beta)$
plane. Projected results from Standard Model (SM)-like, non-standard, and
charged Higgs searches are combined to maximize the statistical significance.
We exhibit complementarity between the SM-like Higgs searches at the LHC with
low luminosity and the Tevatron, and estimate the combined reach of the two
colliders in the early phase of LHC running.
