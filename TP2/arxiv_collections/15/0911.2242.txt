We present a supersymmetric SO(10) grand unified theory (GUT) of flavor based
on an $S_4$ family symmetry. It makes use of our recent proposal to use SO(10)
with type II seesaw mechanism for neutrino masses combined with a simple ansatz
that the dominant Yukawa matrix (the {\bf 10}-Higgs coupling to matter) has
rank one. In this paper, we show how the rank one model can arise within some
plausible assumptions as an effective field theory from vectorlike {\bf 16}
dimensional matter fields with masses above the GUT scale. In order to obtain
the desired fermion flavor texture we use $S_4$ flavon multiplets which acquire
vevs in the ground state of the theory. By supplementing the $S_4$ theory with
an additional discrete symmetry, we find that the flavon vacuum field
alignments take a discrete set of values provided some of the higher
dimensional couplings are small. Choosing a particular set of these vacuum
alignments appears to lead to an unified understanding of observed quark-lepton
flavor:
  (i) the lepton mixing matrix that is dominantly tri-bi-maximal with small
corrections related to quark mixings; (ii) quark lepton mass relations at GUT
scale: $m_b\simeq m_{\tau}$ and $m_\mu\simeq 3 m_s$ and (iii) the solar to
atmospheric neutrino mass ratio $m_\odot/m_{\rm atm}\simeq \theta_{\rm
Cabibbo}$ in agreement with observations. The model predicts the neutrino
mixing parameter, $U_{e3} \simeq \theta_{\rm Cabibbo}/(3\sqrt2) \sim 0.05$,
which should be observable in planned long baseline experiments.
