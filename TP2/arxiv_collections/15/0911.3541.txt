We study the three-quark static potential in perturbation theory in QCD. A
complete next-to-leading order calculation is performed in the singlet, octets
and decuplet channels and the potential exponentiation is demonstrated. The
mixing of the octet representations is calculated. At next-to-next-to-leading
order, the subset of diagrams producing three-body forces is identified in
Coulomb gauge and its contribution to the potential calculated. Combining it
with the contribution of the two-body forces, which may be extracted from the
quark-antiquark static potential, we obtain the complete
next-to-next-to-leading order three-quark static potential in the
colour-singlet channel.
