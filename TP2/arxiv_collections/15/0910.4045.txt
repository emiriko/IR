The distribution of information is essential for living system's ability to
coordinate and adapt. Random walkers are often used to model this distribution
process and, in doing so, one effectively assumes that information maintains
its relevance over time. But the value of information in social and biological
systems often decay and must continuously be updated. To capture the spatial
dynamics of ageing information, we introduce time walkers. A time walker moves
like a random walker, but interacts with traces left by other walkers, some
representing older information, some newer. The traces forms a navigable
information landscape. We quantify the dynamical properties of time walkers
moving on a two-dimensional lattice and the quality of the information
landscape generated by their movements. We visualise the self-similar landscape
as a river network, and show that searching in this landscape is superior to
random searching and scales as the length of loop-erased random walks.
