An investigation of the spatially resolved distribution of domains in the
multiferroic phase of MnWO$_4$ reveals that characteristic features of magnetic
and ferroelectric domains are inseparably entangled. Consequently, the concept
of "multiferroic hybrid domains" is introduced for compounds in which
ferroelectricity is induced by magnetic order. The three-dimensional structure
of the domains is resolved. Annealing cycles reveal a topological memory effect
that goes beyond previously reported memory effects and allows one to
reconstruct the entire multiferroic multidomain structure subsequent to
quenching it.
