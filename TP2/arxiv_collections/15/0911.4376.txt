We report the detection, from observations using the James Clerk Maxwell
Telescope, of CO J $=$ 3$\to$ 2 transition lines in six carbon stars, selected
as members of the Galactic Halo and having similar infrared colors. Just one
Halo star had been detected in CO before this work. Infrared observations show
that these stars are red (J-K $>$3), due to the presence of large dusty
circumstellar envelopes. Radiative transfer models indicates that these stars
are losing mass with rather large dust mass-loss rates in the range 1--3.3
$\times$$10^{-8}$M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$, similar to what can be observed in the
Galactic disc. We show that two of these stars are effectively in the Halo, one
is likely linked to the stream of the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal galaxy (Sgr
dSph), and the other three stars certainly belong to the thick disc. The wind
expansion velocities of the observed stars are low compared to carbon stars in
the thin disc and are lower for the stars in the Halo and the Sgr dSph stream
than in the thick disc. We discuss the possibility that the low expansion
velocities result from the low metallicity of the Halo carbon stars. This
implies that metal-poor carbon stars lose mass at a rate similar to metal-rich
carbon stars, but with lower expansion velocities, as predicted by recent
theoretical models. This result implies that the current estimates of mass-loss
rates from carbon stars in Local Group galaxies will have to be reconsidered.
