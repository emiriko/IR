New spectra from the FINUDA experiment of the Non Mesonic Weak Decay (NMWD)
proton kinetic energy for 9(Lambda)Be, 11(Lambda)B, 12(Lambda)C, 13(Lambda)C,
15 (Lambda)N and 16(Lambda)O are presented and discussed along with the
published data on 5(Lambda)He and 7(Lambda)Li. Exploiting the large mass number
range and the low energy threshold (15 MeV) for the proton detection of FINUDA,
an evaluation of both Final State Interactions (FSI) and the two nucleon
induced NMWD contributions to the decay process has been done. Based on this
evaluation, a linear dependence of FSI on the hypernuclear mass number A is
found and for the two nucleon stimulated decay rate the experimental value of
Gamma2/Gammap=0.43+-0.25 is determined for the first time. A value for the two
nucleon stimulated decay rate to the total decay rate
Gamma2/GammaNMWD=0.24+-0.10 is also extracted.
