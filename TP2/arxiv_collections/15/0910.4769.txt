Information retrieval (IR) is a user approach to obtain relevant information
which meets needs with the help of a IR system (IRS). However, the IRS shows
certain differences between user relevance and system relevance. These gaps are
essentially related to the imperfection of the indexing process (as approach
related to the IR), to problems related to the misunderstanding of the natural
language and the non correspondence between the real needs of the user and the
results of his query. As idea is to think about an ?intellectual? indexing that
takes into account the point of view of the user. By consulting the document,
user can build information as added-value on the existing content: new
information which grows contents and allows the semantic visibility or
facilitates the reading by the annotations, by links to other content, by new
descriptors, specific new abstracts of users: it is the reindexing of the
contents by the contribution or the vote of the uses
