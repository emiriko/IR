We present a derivation of Boltzmann principle $S_{B}=k_{B}\ln \mathcal{W}$
based on classical mechanical models of thermodynamics. The argument is based
on the heat theorem and can be traced back to the second half of the nineteenth
century with the works of Helmholtz and Boltzmann. Despite its simplicity, this
argument has remained almost unknown. We present it in a modern, self-contained
and accessible form. The approach constitutes an important link between
classical mechanics and statistical mechanics.
