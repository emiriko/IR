We discovered multiple high-velocity (ranging from -900 to -650 km/s) and
narrow (FWHM = 15 km/s) absorption components corresponding to both the D2 and
the D1 lines of Na I on a high dispersion spectrum of V1280 Sco observed on
2009 May 9 (UT), 814 d after the V-band maximum. Subsequent observations
carried out on 2009 June and July confirmed at least 11 distinct absorption
components in both systems. Some components had deepened during the two months
period while their HWHMs and wavelengths remained nearly constant. We suggest
these high velocity components originate in cool clumpy gas clouds moving on
the line of sight, produced in interactions between pre-existing cool
circumstellar gas and high velocity gas ejected in the nova explosion. The
optical region spectrum of V1280 Sco in 2009 is dominated by the continuum
radiation and exhibits no forbidden line characterizing the nebular phase of
typical novae. Permitted Fe II lines show doubly peaked emission profiles and
some strong Fe II lines are accompanied by a blue shifted (about -255 km/s)
absorption component. However, no high-velocity and narrow components
corresponding to those of Na I could be detected in Fe II lines nor in the
Balmer lines. The 255 km/s low velocity absorption component is most probably
originating in the wind from the nova.
