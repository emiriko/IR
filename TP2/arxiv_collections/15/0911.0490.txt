This paper presents an algorithm which aims to assist the radiologist in
identifying breast cancer at its earlier stages. It combines several image
processing techniques like image negative, thresholding and segmentation
techniques for detection of tumor in mammograms. The algorithm is verified by
using mammograms from Mammographic Image Analysis Society. The results obtained
by applying these techniques are described.
