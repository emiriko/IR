We present a new approach for studying the problem of optimal hedging of a
European option in a finite and complete discrete-time market model. We
consider partial hedging strategies that maximize the success probability or
minimize the expected shortfall under a cost constraint and show that these
problems can be treated as so called knapsack problems, which are a widely
researched subject in linear programming. This observation gives us better
understanding of the problem of optimal hedging in discrete time.
