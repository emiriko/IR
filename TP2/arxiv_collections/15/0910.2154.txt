BACKGROUND: Navigational simulator use for specialized training purposes is
rather uncommon in orthopaedic and trauma surgery. However, it reveals
providing a valuable tool to train orthopaedic surgeons and help them to plan
complex surgical procedures. PURPOSE: This work's objective was to assess
educational efficiency of a path simulator under fluoroscopic guidance applied
to sacroiliac joint percutaneous screw fixation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We
evaluated 23 surgeons' accuracy inserting a guide-wire in a human cadaver
experiment, following a pre-established procedure. These medical trainees were
defined in three prospective respects: novice or skilled; with or without
theoretical knowledge; with or without surgical procedure familiarity. Analysed
criteria for each tested surgeon included the number of intraoperative X-rays
taken in order to achieve the surgical procedure as well as an iatrogenic index
reflecting the surgeon's ability to detect any hazardous trajectory at the time
of performing said procedure. RESULTS: An average number of 13 X-rays was
required for wire implantation by the G1 group. G2 group, assisted by the
simulator use, required an average of 10 X-rays. A substantial difference was
especially observed within the novice sub-group (N), with an average of 12.75
X-rays for the G1 category and an average of 8.5 X-rays for the G2 category. As
far as the iatrogenic index is concerned, we were unable to observe any
significant difference between the groups.
