We study theoretically transitions of a double quantum-dot qubit caused by
nonequilibrium charge fluctuations in a nearby quantum point contact (QPC) used
as a detector. We show that these transitions are related to the fundamental
Heisenberg backaction associated with the measurement, and use the uncertainty
principle to derive a lower bound on the transition rates. We also derive
simple expressions for the transition rates for the usual model of a QPC as a
mesoscopic conductor, with screening treated at the RPA level. Finally,
numerical results are presented which demonstrate that the charge noise and
shot noise backaction mechanisms can be distinguished in QPCs having
nonadiabatic potentials. The enhanced sensitivity of the charge noise to the
QPC potential is explained in terms of interference contributions similar to
those which cause Friedel oscillations.
