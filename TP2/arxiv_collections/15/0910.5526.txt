We consider a nonlinear 4th-order degenerate parabolic partial differential
equation that arises in modelling the dynamics of an incompressible thin liquid
film on the outer surface of a rotating horizontal cylinder in the presence of
gravity. The parameters involved determine a rich variety of qualitatively
different flows. Depending on the initial data and the parameter values, we
prove the existence of nonnegative periodic weak solutions. In addition, we
prove that these solutions and their gradients cannot grow any faster than
linearly in time; there cannot be a finite-time blow-up. Finally, we present
numerical simulations of solutions.
