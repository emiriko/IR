In this talk I show recent results on how many excited baryon resonances
appear as systems of one meson and one baryon, or two mesons and one baryon,
with the mesons being either pseudoscalar or vectors. Connection with
experiment is made including a discussion on old predictions and recent results
for the photoproduction of the $\Lambda(1405)$ resonance, as well as the
prediction of one $1/2^+$ baryon state around 1920 MeV which might have been
seen in the $\gamma p \to K^+ \Lambda$ reaction.
