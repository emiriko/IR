We use point contact Andreev reflection measurements to determine the spin
polarization of the transport current in pulse laser deposited thin films of
ZnO with 1% Al and with and without 2%Mn. Only films with Mn are ferromagnetic
and show spin polarization of the transport current of up to 55 $\pm$ 0.5% at
4.2 K, in sharp contrast to measurements of the nonmagnetic films without Mn
where the polarization is consistent with zero. Our results imply strongly that
ferromagnetism in these Al doped ZnO films requires the presence of Mn.
