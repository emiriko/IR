Based on the tight-binding formalism, we investigate the Anderson and the
Kondo model for an adaom magnetic impurity above graphene. Different impurity
positions are analyzed. Employing a partial wave representation we study the
nature of the coupling between the impurity and the conducting electrons. The
components from the two Dirac points are mixed while interacting with the
impurity. Two configurations are considered explicitly: the adatom is above one
atom (ADA), the other case is the adatom above the center the honeycomb (ADC).
For ADA the impurity is coupled with one flavor for both A and B sublattice and
both Dirac points. For ADC the impurity couples with multi-flavor states for a
spinor state of the impurity. We show, explicitly for a 3d magnetic atom,
$d_{z^{2}}$, ($d_{xz}$,$d_{yz}$), and ($d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$,$d_{xy}$) couple
respectively with the $\Gamma_{1}$, $\Gamma_{5} (E_{1})$, and $\Gamma_{6}
(E_{2})$ representations (reps) of $C_{6v}$ group in ADC case. The basses for
these reps of graphene are also derived explicitly. For ADA we calculate the
Kondo temperature.
