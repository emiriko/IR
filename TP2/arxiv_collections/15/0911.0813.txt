The accuracy of wavefront reconstruction from discrete slope measurements
depends on the sampling geometry, coherence length of the incoming wavefronts,
wavefront sensor specifications and the accuracy of the reconstruction
algorithm. Monte Carlo simulations were performed and a comparison of Fourier
and Vector Matrix Multiply reconstruction methods was made with respect to
these experimental and computational parameters. It was observed that although
Fourier reconstruction gave consistent accuracy when coherence length of
wavefronts is larger than the corresponding pitch on the wavefront sensor, VMM
method gives even better accuracy when the coherence length closely matches
with the wavefront sensor pitch.
