We study the traffic of two types of molecular motors using the two-species
symmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) with periodic boundary conditions and
with attachment and detachment of particles. We determine characteristic
properties such as motor densities and currents by simulations and analytical
calculations. For motors with different unbinding probabilities, mean field
theory gives the correct bound density and total current of the motors, as
shown by numerical simulations. For motors differing in their stepping
probabilities, the particle-hole symmetry of the current-density relationship
is broken and mean field theory fails drastically. The total motor current
exhibits exponential finite-size scaling, which we use to extrapolate the total
current to the thermodynamic limit. Finally, we also study the motion of a
single motor in the background of many non-moving motors.
