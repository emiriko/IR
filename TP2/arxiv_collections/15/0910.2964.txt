Supersymmetry (SUSY) is one of the most interesting and comprehensively
studied models for new physics beyond the Standard Model. If SUSY exists in
nature the Large Hadron Collider will provide excellent opportunities to search
for SUSY. SUSY discovery strategies of the ATLAS and CMS experiments are
presented with a focus on early data. SUSY mass measurement techniques and
determination of SUSY model parameters are also demonstrated.
