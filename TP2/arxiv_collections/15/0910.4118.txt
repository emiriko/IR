Whether turbulence intermittencies shall be described by a log-Poisson, a
log-stable pdf or other distributions is still debated nowadays. In this paper,
a bridge between polymer physics, self-avoiding walk and random vortex
stretching is established which may help in getting a new insight on this
topics. Actually a very simple relationship between stability index of the
stable law and the well known Flory exponent stemming from polymer physics is
established. Moreover the scaling of turbulence intermittencies with Reynolds
number is also obtained and the overall picture is very close to Tennekes'
simple model for the fine scale structure of turbulence [Phys. Fluids, 11, 3
(1968)] : vortex tubes of Kolmogorov length width are bend by bigger vortices
of Taylor length scale. This thus results in both a simple and sound model with
no fitting parameter needed.
