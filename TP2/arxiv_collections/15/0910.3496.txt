The cross sections of 151Eu(alpha,gamma)155Tb and 151Eu(alpha,n)154Tb
reactions have been measured with the activation method. Some aspects of the
measurement are presented here to illustrate the requirements of experimental
techniques needed to obtain nuclear data for the astrophysical p-process
nucleosynthesis. Preliminary cross section results are also presented and
compared with the predictions of statistical model calculations.
