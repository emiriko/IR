Structural, magnetic and electronic structural properties of
Ni0.2Cd0.3Fe2.5-xAlxO4 ferrites nanoparticles have been studied x-ray
diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dc magnetization,
and near edge x-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (NEXAFS)
measurements. Nanoparticles of Ni0.2Cd0.3Fe2.5-xAlxO4 (x = 0.0 - 0.4) ferrite
were synthesized using sol-gel method. The XRD and TEM measurements show that
all samples have single phase nature with cubic structure and have
nanocrystalline behavior. From the XRD and TEM analysis, it is observed that
particle size increases with Al doping. DC magnetization measurements infer
that magnetic moment decreases whereas blocking temperature increases with
increase in Al doping. It is observed that the magnetic moment decreases with
Al doping which may be due to the dilution of the sublattice by the doping of
Al ions. The NEXAFS measurements performed at room temperature indicates that
Fe exist in mixed valence state.
