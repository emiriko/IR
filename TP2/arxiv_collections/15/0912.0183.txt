Using a geometric averaging procedure applied to a non-affine linear
connection, we prove that for a narrow one particle distribution function and
in the ultra-relativistic limit, a bunch of point charged particles can be
described by a Charged Cold Fluid Model, without additional hypothesis on the
moments.
