We present results of variability search in the field of the young open
cluster NGC 1502. Eight variable stars were discovered. Of six other stars in
the observed field that were suspected for variability, we confirm variability
of two, including one beta Cep star, NGC 1502-26. The remaining four suspects
were found to be constant in our photometry. In addition, UBVI photometry of
the well-known massive eclipsing binary SZ Cam was obtained. The new variable
stars include: two eclipsing binaries of which one is a relatively bright
detached system with an EA-type light curve, an alpha2 CVn-type variable, an
SPB candidate, a field RR Lyrae star and three other variables showing
variability of unknown origin. The variability of two of them is probably
related to their emission in Halpha, which has been measured by means of the
alpha index obtained for 57 stars brighter than V=16 mag in the central part of
the observed field. Four other non-variable stars with emission in Halpha were
also found. Additionally, we provide VI photometry for stars down to V=17 mag
and UB photometry for about 50 brightest stars in the observed field. We also
show that the 10-Myr isochrone fits very well the observed color-magnitude
diagram if a distance of 1 kpc and mean reddening, E(V-I)=0.9 mag, are adopted.
