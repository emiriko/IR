We show how a quantum walk can be used to find a marked edge or a marked
complete subgraph of a complete graph. We employ a version of a quantum walk,
the scattering walk, which lends itself to experimental implementation. The
edges are marked by adding elements to them that impart a specific phase shift
to the particle as it enters or leaves the edge. If the complete graph has N
vertices and the subgraph has K vertices, the particle becomes localized on the
subgraph in O(N/K) steps. This leads to a quantum search that is quadratically
faster than a corresponding classical search. We show how to implement the
quantum walk using a quantum circuit and a quantum oracle, which allows us to
specify the resource needed for a quantitative comparison of the efficiency of
classical and quantum searches -- the number of oracle calls.
