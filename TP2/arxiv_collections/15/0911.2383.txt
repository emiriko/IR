We consider the evolution of the ground state in the Two Higgs Doublet Model
during cooling down of the Universe after the Big Bang. Different regions in
the space of free parameters of this model correspond to different sequences of
thermal phase transitions. We discuss different paths of thermal evolution and
corresponding evolution of physical properties of the system for different
modern values of the parameters.
