We present the uncertainty discussion of a recent experiment performed at the
GSI storage ring ESR for the accurate energy measurement of the He-like uranium
1s2p3P2- 1s2s3S1 intra-shell transition. For this propose we used a Johann-type
Bragg spectrometer that enables to obtain a relative energy measurement between
the He-like uranium transition, about 4.51 keV, and a calibration x-ray source.
As reference, we used the Ka fluorescence lines of zinc and the Li-like uranium
1s22p2P3/2 - 1 s22s 2S1/2 intra-shell transition from fast ions stored in the
ESR. A comparison of the two different references, i.e., stationary and moving
x-ray source, and a discussion of the experimental uncertainties is presented.
