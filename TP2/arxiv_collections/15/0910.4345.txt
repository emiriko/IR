Theory of exciton fine structure in semiconductor quantum dots and its
dependence on quantum dot anisotropy and external lateral electric field is
presented. The effective exciton Hamiltonian including long range electron-hole
exchange interaction is derived within the k*p effective mass approximation
(EMA). The exchange matrix elements of the Hamiltonian are expressed explicitly
in terms of electron and hole envelope functions. The matrix element
responsible for the "bright" exciton splitting is identified and analyzed. An
excitonic fine structure for a model quantum dot with quasi- two-dimensional
anisotropic harmonic oscillator (2DLAHO) confining potential is analyzed as a
function of the shape anisotropy, size and applied lateral electric field.
