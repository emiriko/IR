We discuss the scalar analogue of the Casimir-Polder force between a sphere
and a uniaxially corrugated surface with Dirichlet boundary conditions.
Presenting a formulation that is nonperturbative in the height profile of the
surface, we give explicit numerical results for a sinuosoidal corrugation
profile.
