We study the $K^{+}d$ scattering at low energies using the optical potential.
Our optical potential consists of the first-order and second-order terms. The
total, integrated elastic and elastic differential cross sections at incident
kaon momenta below 800 MeV/c are calculated using our optical potential. We
found that our results are consistent with the Faddeev calculation as well as
the data and especially the second-order optical potential is essential to
reproduce them at low energies. We also discuss the multiple scattering effects
in this process.
