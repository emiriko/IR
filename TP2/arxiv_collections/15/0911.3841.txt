The Advanced Technology Large Aperture Space Telescope (ATLAST) is a set of
mission concepts for the next generation UV-Optical-Near Infrared space
telescope with an aperture size of 8 to 16 meters. ATLAST, using an internal
coronagraph or an external occulter, can characterize the atmosphere and
surface of an Earth-sized exoplanet in the Habitable Zone of long-lived stars
at distances up to ~45 pc, including its rotation rate, climate, and
habitability. ATLAST will also allow us to glean information on the nature of
the dominant surface features, changes in cloud cover and climate, and,
potentially, seasonal variations in surface vegetation. ATLAST will be able to
visit up to 200 stars in 5 years, at least three times each, depending on the
technique used for starlight suppression and the telescope aperture. More
frequent visits can be made for interesting systems.
