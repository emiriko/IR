An increasing number of experiments at the Belle, BNL, CERN, DA{\Phi}NE and
SLAC accelerators are confirming the violation of time reversal invariance (T).
The violation signifies a fundamental asymmetry between the past and future and
calls for a major shift in the way we think about time. Here we show that
processes which violate T symmetry induce destructive interference between
different paths that the universe can take through time. The interference
eliminates all paths except for two that represent continuously forwards and
continuously backwards time evolution. Evidence from the accelerator
experiments indicates which path the universe is effectively following. This
work may provide fresh insight into the long-standing problem of modeling the
dynamics of T violation processes. It suggests that T violation has previously
unknown, large-scale physical effects and that these effects underlie the
origin of the unidirectionality of time. It may have implications for the
Wheeler-DeWitt equation of canonical quantum gravity. Finally it provides a
view of the quantum nature of time itself.
