Low temperature magnetoconductance measurements were made in the vicinity of
the charge neutrality point. Two origins for the fluctuations were identified
close to the CNP. At very low magnetic fields there exist only mesoscopic
magneto-conductance quantum interference features which develop rapidly as a
function of density. At slightly higher fields (> 0.5T), close to the CNP,
additional fluctuations track the quantum Hall sequence expected for monolayer
graphene. These additional features are attributed to effects of locally
charging individual quantum Hall (QH) localized states. These effects reveal a
precursor to the quantum Hall effect (QHE) since, unlike previous transport
observations of QH dots charging effects, they occur in the absence of quantum
Hall plateaus or Shubnikov- de Haas (SdH) oscillations. From our transport data
we are able to extract parameters that characterize the inhomogeneities in our
device.
