The search for life outside of the Solar System should not be restricted to
exclusively planetary bodies; large moons of extrasolar planets may also be
common habitable environments throughout the Galaxy. Extrasolar moons, or
exomoons, may be detected through transit timing effects induced onto the host
planet as a result of mutual gravitational interaction. In particular, transit
timing variations (TTV) and transit duration variations (TDV) are predicted to
produce a unique exomoon signature, which is not only easily distinguished from
other gravitational perturbations, but also provides both the period and mass
of an exomoon. Using these timing effects, photometry greater or equal to that
of the Kepler Mission is readily able to detect habitable-zone exomoons down to
0.2 Earth masses and could survey up to 25,000 stars for 1 Earth-mass
satellites. We discuss future possibilities for spectral retrieval of such
bodies and show that transmission spectroscopy with JWST should be able to
detect molecular species with ~30 transit events, in the best cases.
