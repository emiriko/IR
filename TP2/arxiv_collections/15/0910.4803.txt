Within the interacting Fermi gas model for isospin asymmetric nuclear matter,
effects of the in-medium three-body interaction and the two-body short-range
tensor force due to the $\rho$ meson exchange as well as the short-range
nucleon correlation on the high-density behavior of the nuclear symmetry energy
are demonstrated respectively in a transparent way. Possible physics origins of
the extremely uncertain nuclear symmetry energy at supra-saturation densities
are discussed.
