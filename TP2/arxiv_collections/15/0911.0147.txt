Statistical properties of classical random process are considered in
tomographic representation. The Radon integral transform is used to construct
the tomographic form of kinetic equations. Relation of probability density on
phase space for classical systems with tomographic probability distributions is
elucidated. Examples of simple kinetic equations like Liouville equations for
one and many particles are studied in detail.
