General principles for the existence of perfect transmission resonances in
photonic multilayer structures are formulated in terms of light interference
described by recurrent Airy formulas. Mirror symmetry in the multilayer is
shown to be a sufficient but not necessary condition for perfect transmission
resonances. Asymmetric structures displaying perfect transmission in accordance
with the proposed principles are demonstrated. A hybrid
Fabry-Perot/photonic-crystal structure of the type (BA)^k(AB)^k(AABB)^m is
proposed, combining perfect transmission and highly asymmetric electric field
localization. Strength and asymmetry of localization can be controlled
independently, to be of use in tailoring non-reciprocal behavior of nonlinear
all-optical diodes.
