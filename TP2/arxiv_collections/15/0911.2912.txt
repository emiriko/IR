Wave properties and instabilities in a magnetized, anisotropic,
collisionless, rarefied hot plasma in fluid approximation are studied, using
the 16-moments set of the transport equations obtained from the Vlasov
equations. These equations differ from the CGL-MHD fluid model (single fluid
equations by Chew, Goldberger, and Low, 1956) by including two anisotropic heat
flux evolution equations, where the fluxes invalidate the double polytropic CGL
laws. We derived the general dispersion relation for linear compressible wave
modes. Besides the classic incompressible fire hose modes there appear four
types of compressible wave modes: two fast and slow mirror modes - strongly
modified compared to the CGL model - and two thermal modes. In the presence of
initial heat fluxes along the magnetic field the wave properties become
different for the waves running forward and backward with respect to the
magnetic field. The well known discrepancies between the results of the CGL-MHD
fluid model and the kinetic theory are now removed: i) The mirror slow mode
instability criterion is now the same as that in the kinetic theory. ii)
Similarly, in kinetic studies there appear two kinds of fire hose instabilities
- incompressible and compressible ones. These two instabilities can arise for
the same plasma parameters, and the instability of the new compressible oblique
fire hose modes can become dominant. The compressible fire hose instability is
the result of the resonance coupling of three retrograde modes - two thermal
modes and a fast mirror mode. The results can be applied to the theory of solar
and stellar coronal and wind models.
