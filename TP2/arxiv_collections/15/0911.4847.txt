Secondary charged hadrons multiplicity distributions in proton-proton and
proton-antiproton collisions differ on principle. There are three types of
inelastic processes in proton-antiproton scattering. The first type is
production of secondary hadrons shower at gluon string decay. The second type
is shower produced from two quark strings decay, the third type is shower
produced from three quark strings decay. At the same time there are only two
types of inelastic processes for proton-proton scattering - gluon string shower
and two quark strings shower. Theoretical description of multiplicity
distributions is obtained for proton-proton collisions at energies from 44.5
GeV to 200 GeV and for proton-antiproton collisions at energies from 200 GeV to
1800 GeV. The difference between proton-proton and proton-antiproton
multiplicity distributions is discussed. The predictions of multiplicity
distribution and mean multiplicity at LHC energy are given.
