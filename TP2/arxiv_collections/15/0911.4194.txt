The top quark could provide very important information for the Standard Model
extentions due to its large mass close to the electroweak symmetry breaking
scale. In this work, anomalous single top production is studied by using gamma
p-->W^{+}b process at the LHeC based gamma p collider. The sensitivity to
anomalous coupling kappa/Lambda could be reached down to 0.01 TeV^{-1}.
