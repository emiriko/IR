In this paper, we analyze the performance of the encoding and the modulation
processes in the downlink and uplink of the EPCglobal Gen2 system through the
analysis and simulation. Furthermore, the synchronization issues on time and
frequency domain and the preamble architecture are evaluated. Through the
simulation in the uplink, we find that the detection probability of FM0 and
Miller coding approaches 1 at 13dB Eb/N0.
