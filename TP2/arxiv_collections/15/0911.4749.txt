In this paper, we explore the parameter space for a Right-Handed (RH)
sneutrino curvaton that can generate large non-Gaussianity without assuming any
particular inflation sector. The mass of the RH sneutrino is suggested from a
discussion on the initial condition of the curvaton field. It is shown that a
small Yukawa coupling is generally required for a successful RH sneutrino
curvaton. However, the Yukawa coupling can be larger if we consider the
braneworld scenario. Some general discussion about the spectral index in
curvaton scenario is also provided.
