We study the representation theory of the quantum Teichmueller space when
going to infinity in the classical Teichmueller space. The geometric
ingredients are the extension of Thurston's shear coordinates to the augmented
Teichmueller space and the study of the Weil-Petersson Poisson structure for
this extension. The result is analogous to the factorization rule found in
conformal field theory.
