Let X be some Riemann surface, and let omega be a meromorphic quadratic
differential form on X, that is, omega can be written in local coordinates as
f(z) dz^2, for some meromorphic function f. We say that a curve gamma is part
of a horizontal leaf of omega if for each t in I, we have that f(gamma(t))
(gamma'(t))^2 is real and positive. The differential omega is said to be a
Strebel differential if its noncompact horizontal leaves form a set of measure
0.
  Now, most quadratic differential forms on any given Riemann surface are not
Strebel (in fact, the space of Strebel differentials on the projective line as
a subset of the space of all quadratic differentials on the projective line is
a countable union of real lines in the complex plane. Because of this, this
paper focuses on writing down explicit examples of Strebel differentials.
  Most papers that discuss Strebel differentials seem to focus on those that
have only second order poles, since they define a cellular decomposition on X.
However, we construct an explicit family of examples of holomorphic Strebel
differentials on any hyperelliptic curve branched over the points 0, 1,
infinity, and 1/2 + ir, for any real r.
  Later, we look at an example from a previous paper, where omega was an
algebraic Strebel differential such that omega had integral residues, on a
Riemann surface X defined over the algebraic closure of the rationals that had
a transcendental period. We then modify this example to obtain another
algebraic Strebel differential omega', defined on an algebraic Riemann surface
X', all of whose periods are transcendental.
