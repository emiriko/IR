In constituent models, glueballs are described as bound states of effective
gluons. The dynamical mass generation lead to a gluon mass without violating
gauge invariance. One can then consider three degrees of freedom for those
effective massive gluons. However, models with only two degrees of freedom are
shown to be in better agreement with the lattice glueball spectrum. I review
both models for two- and three-gluon models and explain why even though the
gluon gains a mass, it behaves as a massless particle with only two degrees of
freedom.
