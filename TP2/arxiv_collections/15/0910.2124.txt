We investigate the prospects to extract supersymmetric couplings from a decay
length measurement at the LHC. Specifically, we exploit the opportunity of a
light and long-lived stop which is pair-produced through gluinos in association
with like-sign top quarks. Any observed finite value of the stop decay length
strongly supports models in which flavor is broken in a minimal way solely by
the Standard Model Yukawa couplings. We find that a 1 picosecond stop lifetime,
dominated by t~ -> c chi^0 decays, yields macroscopic transverse impact
parameters of about 180 microns. If the lightest neutralino is predominantly
higgsino or very close in mass to the light stop, the stop lifetime even
increases and allows to observe stop tracks and possibly secondary vertices
directly. Measuring squark flavor violation with the stop decay length works
also with a gravitino LSP if the neutralino is the NLSP. For this case,
opportunities from t~ -> c chi^0 -> c gamma G~ decays for very light gravitinos
with mass <= keV are pointed out.
