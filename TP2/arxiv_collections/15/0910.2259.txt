The crystal lattice of a complex compound may contain a subsystem of ions
with each one possessing two close equilibrium positions (double-well
structure). For example, the oxygen ions in the cuprates form such a subsystem.
In such a situation it is impossible to separate electronic and local
vibrational motions. This leads to a large increase in the effective strength
of the electron-lattice interaction, which is beneficial for pairing.
