In Kohn-Sham density functional theory (KS-DFT) a fictitious system of
non-interacting particles is constructed having the same ground-state (GS)
density as the physical system of interest. A fundamental open question in DFT
concerns the ability of an exact KS calculation to spot and characterize the GS
degeneracies in the physical system. In this article we provide theoretical
evidence suggesting that the GS density, as a function of position on a 2D
manifold of parameters affecting the external potential, is "topologically
scarred" in a distinct way by degeneracies. These scars are sufficiently
detailed to enable determination of the positions of degeneracies and even the
associated Berry phases. We conclude that an exact KS calculation can spot and
characterize the degeneracies of the physical system.
