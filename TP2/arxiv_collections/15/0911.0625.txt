Given a faithful action of a finite group on an algebraic curve of genus at
least 2, we prove that the induced action on the space of global holomorphic
differentials is faithful as well, except in the following very special case:
the given action is not tame, the genus of the quotient curve is 0 and the
characteristic of the base field is 2.
