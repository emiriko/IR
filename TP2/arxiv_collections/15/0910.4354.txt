We show that it is possible to excite higher rotational states J > 2 in
ultracold photoassociation by two laser fields. Usually higher J states are
suppressed in photoassociation at ultracold temperatures in the regime of
Wigner threshold laws. We propose a scheme in which one strong laser field
drives photoassociation transition close to either J = 1 or J = 2 rotational
state of a particular vibrational level of an electronically excited molecule.
The other laser field is tuned near photoassociation resonance with J > 2
rotational levels of the same vibrational state. The strong laser field induces
a strong continnum-bound dipole coupling. The resulting dipole force between
two colliding atoms modifies the continnum states forming continnum-bound
dressed states with a significant component of higher partial waves in the
continnum configuration. When the second laser is scanned near the resonance of
the higher J states, these states become populated due to photoassociative
transitions from the modified continnum.
