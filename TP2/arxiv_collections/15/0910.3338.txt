We consider the activated random walk (ARW) model where particles follow the
path of a general Markov process on a general graph. We prove ARW dominates a
simpler process, multiple source internal aggregation (MSIA), and use this to
formulate a deterministic sufficient condition on initial occupations for
nonfixation of ARW and similar variants. In particular, on bounded degree
graphs, initial occupation density greater than one almost surely implies
nonfixation, where independence requirements are weakened to ergodic in the
case of Euclidean lattices. We show that for Euclidean lattices of dimension
lower than five, initial density of exactly one also implies nonfixation.
Finally, we prove the critical density for the infinite sleep rate ARW is
positive for all dimensions.
