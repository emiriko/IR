In a boost-invariant hydrodynamic model, we have analyzed $\phi$ meson
production in Pb+Pb and Au+Au collisions, in the centre of mass energy range
$\sqrt{s}$= 6-200 GeV. Hydrodynamic evolution is governed by a lattice based
equation of state with a confinement-deconfinement {\em cross over} at
$T_{co}$=196 MeV. We also look for the threshold energy above which the
confined matter undergoes a deconfinement transition. Analysis indicate that
above a threshold energy, ${\sqrt{s}}_{th}$=$13.65 \pm 3.06$ GeV, the fluid
medium crosses over from a confined phase to a deconfined phase.
