Fermilab operates the world's most intense antiproton source. Newly proposed
experiments can use those antiprotons either parasitically during Tevatron
Collider running or after the Tevatron Collider finishes in about 2011. For
example, the annihilation of 8 GeV antiprotons might make the world's most
intense source of tagged D^0 mesons, and thus the best near-term opportunity to
study charm mixing and, via CP violation, to search for new physics. Other
potential measurements include sensitive studies of hyperons and of the
mysterious X, Y, and Z states. Production of antihydrogen in flight can be used
for first searches for antihydrogen CPT violation. With antiproton deceleration
to low energy, an experiment using a Penning trap and an atom interferometer
could make the world's first measurement of the gravitational force on
antimatter.
