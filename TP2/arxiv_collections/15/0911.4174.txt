We study a class of models for \sbentcore molecules using low density version
of Local Density Functional Theory. Arms of the molecules are modeled using
two- and three Gay-Berne (GB) interacting units of uniaxial and biaxial
symmetry. Dipole-dipole interactions are taken into account by placing a dipole
moment along the ${\mathcal{C}}_2$symmetry axis of the molecule. The main aim
of the study is to identify molecular factors that can help stabilizing the
biaxial nematic phase. The phase diagrams involving isotropic ($I$), uniaxial
($N_U$) and biaxial ($N_B$) nematic phases are determined at given density and
dipole strength as function of bent angle. For molecules composed of two
uniaxial arms a direct $I-N_B$ phase transition is found at a single Landau
point, which moves towards lower bent angles with increasing dipole magnitude.
For the three-segment model strengthening of the dipole-dipole interaction
results in appearance of a line of Landau points. There exists an optimal
dipole strength for which this line covers the maximal range of opening angles.
Interestingly, the inclusion of biaxial GB ellipsoids as building blocks
reveals the direct $I-N_B$ transitions line even in a non-polar, two-arms
model. The line is shifted towards higher opening angles as compared to the
uniaxial case.
