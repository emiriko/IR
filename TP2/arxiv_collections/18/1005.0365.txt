We develop a Monte Carlo wave function algorithm for the quantum linear
Boltzmann equation, a Markovian master equation describing the quantum motion
of a test particle interacting with the particles of an environmental
background gas. The algorithm leads to a numerically efficient stochastic
simulation procedure for the most general form of this integro-differential
equation, which involves a five-dimensional integral over microscopically
defined scattering amplitudes that account for the gas interactions in a
non-perturbative fashion. The simulation technique is used to assess various
limiting forms of the quantum linear Boltzmann equation, such as the limits of
pure collisional decoherence and quantum Brownian motion, the Born
approximation and the classical limit. Moreover, we extend the method to allow
for the simulation of the dissipative and decohering dynamics of superpositions
of spatially localized wave packets, which enables the study of many physically
relevant quantum phenomena, occurring e.g. in the interferometry of massive
particles.
