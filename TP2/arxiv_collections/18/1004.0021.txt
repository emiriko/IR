A new thermometer based on fragment momentum fluctuations is presented. This
thermometer exhibited residual contamination from the collective motion of the
fragments along the beam axis. For this reason, the transverse direction has
been explored. Additionally, a mass dependence was observed for this
thermometer. This mass dependence may be the result of the Fermi momentum of
nucleons or the different properties of the fragments (binding energy, spin
etc..) which might be more sensitive to different densities and temperatures of
the exploding fragments. We expect some of these aspects to be smaller for
protons (and/or neutrons); consequently, the proton transverse momentum
fluctuations were used to investigate the temperature dependence of the source.
