The earlier paper "Introduction to clarithmetic I" constructed an axiomatic
system of arithmetic based on computability logic (see
http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~giorgi/cl.html), and proved its soundness and
extensional completeness with respect to polynomial time computability. The
present paper elaborates three additional sound and complete systems in the
same style and sense: one for polynomial space computability, one for
elementary recursive time (and/or space) computability, and one for primitive
recursive time (and/or space) computability.
