Recent studies show that quantum oscillations thought to be associated with a
density wave reconstructed Fermi surface disappear at a critical value of the
doping for YBa2Cu3O6+y, and the cyclotron mass diverges as the critical value
is approached from the high doping side. We argue that the phenomenon is due to
a Lifshitz transition where the pockets giving rise to the quantum oscillations
connect to form an open (quasi-1d) Fermi surface. The estimated critical doping
is close to that found by experiment, and the theory predicts a logarithmic
divergence of the cyclotron mass with a coefficient comparable to that observed
in experiment.
