Acoustic waves and pulses propagating from the solar photosphere upwards may
quickly develop into shocks due to the rapid decrease of atmospheric density.
However, if they propagate along a magnetic flux tube, then the nonlinear
steepening may be balanced by tube dispersion effects. This may result in the
formation of sausage soliton. The aim of this letter is to report an
observational evidence of sausage soliton in the solar chromosphere. Time
series of Ca II H line obtained at the solar limb with the Solar Optical
Telescope (SOT) on the board of Hinode is analysed. Observations show an
intensity blob, which propagates from 500 km to 1700 km above the solar surface
with the mean apparent speed of 35 km s$^{-1}$. The speed is much higher than
expected local sound speed, therefore the blob can not be a simple pressure
pulse. The blob speed, length to width ratio and relative intensity correspond
to slow sausage soliton propagating along a magnetic tube. The blob width is
increased with height corresponding to the magnetic tube expansion in the
stratified atmosphere. Propagation of the intensity blob can be the first
observational evidence of slow sausage soliton in the solar atmosphere.
