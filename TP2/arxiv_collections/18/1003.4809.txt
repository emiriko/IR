It is shown that columnar fluctuations, in conjunction with weak quenched
disorder, lead to a T^{3/2} temperature dependence of the electrical
resistivity. This is proposed as an explanation of the observed
non-Fermi-liquid behavior in the helimagnet MnSi, with one possible realization
of the columnar fluctuations provided by skyrmion lines that have independently
been proposed to be present in this material.
