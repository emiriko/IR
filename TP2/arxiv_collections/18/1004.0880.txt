N = 2 supersymmetry in four space-time dimensions is intimately related to
hyperkahler and quaternionic Kahler geometries. On one hand, the target spaces
for rigid supersymmetric sigma-models are necessarily hyperkahler manifolds. On
the other hand, when coupled to N = 2 supergravity, the sigma-model target
spaces must be quaternionic Kahler. It is known that such manifolds of
restricted holonomy are difficult to generate explicitly. Projective superspace
is a field-theoretic approach to constructing general N = 2 supersymmetric
nonlinear sigma-models, and hence to generate new hyperkahler and quaternionic
Kahler metrics. Intended for a mixed audience consisting of both physicists and
mathematicians, these lectures provide a pedagogical introduction to the
projective-superspace approach.
