We report the observation of self-oscillations in a bottom-up
nanoelectromechanical system (NEMS) during field emission driven by a constant
applied voltage. An electromechanical model is explored that explains the
phenomenon and that can be directly used to develop integrated devices. In this
first study we have already achieved ~50% DC/AC (direct to alternative current)
conversion. Electrical self-oscillations in NEMS open up a new path for the
development of high speed, autonomous nanoresonators, and signal generators and
show that field emission (FE) is a powerful tool for building new
nano-components.
