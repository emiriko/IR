We present our study of effect of substrate induced strain on the
La5/8-yPryCa3/8MnO3 (y=0.45), thin films grown on LaAlO3, NdGaO3 and SrTiO3
susbtrates that show large scale phase separation. It is observed that
unstrained films grown on NdGaO3 behave quite similar to bulk material but the
strained film grown on SrTiO3 show melting of insulating phase to metallic
phase at low temperatures. However, the large scale phase separation and
metastable glass-like state is observed in all the films despite difference in
substrate induced strain. The measurements of resistivity as a function of
temperature under cooling and heating in unequal field (CHUF) protocol
elucidates the presence of glass-like meta-stable phase generated due to
kinetic arrest of first order transformation in all the films. Like structural
glasses, these magnetic glass-like phase shows evidence of devitrification of
the arrested charge order-antiferromagnetic insulator (CO-AFI) phase to
equilibrium ferromagnetic metallic (FMM) phase with isothermal increase of
magnetic field and/or iso-field warming. These measurements also clearly
brought out the equilibrium ground state of this system to be FMM and
metastable glass-like phase to be AFI phase.
