We show that suprathermal particles, termed pick-up ions (PUIs), might reduce
the postshock temperature of the fast wind and jets in some planetary nebulae
(PNs) and in symbiotic systems. The goal is to explain the finding that the
temperature of the hot bubble formed by the post-shock gas in some PNs and
symbiotic nebulae is lower, sometimes by more than an order of magnitude, than
the value expected from simple hydrodynamical calculations. Although various
explanations have been proposed, there is as yet no prefered solution for this
low tempeature problem. PUIs have been invoked to explain the low temperature
behind the termination shock of the solar wind. While in the case of the solar
wind the neutral atoms that turn into PUIs penetrate the pre-shock solar wind
region from the interstellar medium (ISM), in PNs the PUI source is more likely
slowly moving clumps embedded in the fast wind or jets. These clumps are formed
by instabilities or from backflowing cold gas. Our estimates indicate that in
young PNs these PUIs will thermalize before leaving the system. Only in older
PNs whose sizes exceed ~5000 AU and for which the fast-wind mass loss rate is
below ~10^{-7} Mo/yr do we expect the PUIs to be an efficient carrier of energy
out of the postshock region (the hot bubble).
