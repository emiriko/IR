We investigate a possibility of realizing the entropic force into the
cosmology. A main issue is how the holographic screen is implemented in the
Newtonian cosmology. Contrary to the relativistic realization of Friedmann
equations, we do not clarify the connection between Newtonian cosmology and
entropic force because there is no way of implementing the holographic screen
in the Newtonian cosmology.
