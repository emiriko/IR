We study the applications of non-equilibrium relations such as the Jarzynski
equality and fluctuation theorem to spin glasses with gauge symmetry. It is
shown that the exponentiated free-energy difference appearing in the Jarzynski
equality reduces to a simple analytic function written explicitly in terms of
the initial and final temperatures if the temperature satisfies a certain
condition related to gauge symmetry. This result is used to derive a lower
bound on the work done during the non-equilibrium process of temperature
change. We also prove identities relating equilibrium and non-equilibrium
quantities. These identities suggest a method to evaluate equilibrium
quantities from non-equilibrium computations, which may be useful to avoid the
problem of slow relaxation in spin glasses.
