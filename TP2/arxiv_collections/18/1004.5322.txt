Several scenarios have been proposed in which the orbits of binary black
holes enter the band of a gravitational wave detector with significant
eccentricity. To avoid missing these signals or biasing parameter estimation it
is important that we consider waveform models that account for eccentricity.
The ingredients needed to compute post-Newtonian (PN) waveforms produced by
spinning black holes inspiralling on quasi-eccentric orbits have been available
for almost two decades at 2 PN order, and this work has recently been extended
to 2.5 PN order. However, the computational cost of directly implementing these
waveforms is high, requiring many steps per orbit to evolve the system of
coupled differential equations. Here we employ the standard techniques of a
separation of timescales and a generalized Keplerian parameterization of the
orbits to produce efficient waveforms describing spinning black hole binaries
with arbitrary masses and spins on quasi-eccentric orbits to 1.5 PN order. We
separate the fast orbital timescale from the slow spin-orbit precession
timescale by solving for the orbital motion in a non-interial frame of
reference that follows the orbital precession. We outline a scheme for
extending our approach to higher post-Newtonian order.
