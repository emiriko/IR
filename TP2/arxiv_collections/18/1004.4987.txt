We analyze the so-called pinched weights, that are generally thought to
reduce the violation of quark-hadron duality in Finite-Energy Sum Rules. After
showing how this is not true in general, we explain how to address this
question for the LR correlator and any particular pinched weight taking
advantage of our previous work [1], where the possible high-energy behavior of
the LR spectral function was studied. In particular we show that the use of
pinched weights allows to determine with high accuracy the dimension six and
eight contributions in the operator product expansion,
O6=(-4.3^[+0.9}_{-0.7})*10^-3 GeV^6 and O8=(-7.2^{+4.2}_{-5.3})*10^-3 GeV^8.
