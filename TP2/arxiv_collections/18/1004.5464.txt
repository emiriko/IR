The LMC star BI 108 is photometrically variable with the unique light curve:
Two strong periods are present in a strict 3:2 resonance, staying coherent over
several observing seasons. A spectroscopic data collected at VLT/UVES reveals
unexpected and still not fully understood behavior of the system, that has not
been observed in any other early-type multiple systems.
