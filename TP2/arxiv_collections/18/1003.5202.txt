In this paper we show that a particular twist of $\mathcal{N}=4$ super
Yang-Mills in three dimensions with gauge group SU(2) possesses a set of
classical vacua corresponding to the space of flat connections of the {\it
complexified} gauge group $SL(2,C)$. The theory also contains a set of
topological observables corresponding to Wilson loops wrapping non-trivial
cycles of the base manifold. This moduli space and set of topological
observables is shared with the Chern Simons formulation of three dimensional
gravity and we hence conjecture that the Yang-Mills theory gives an equivalent
description of the gravitational theory. Unlike the Chern Simons formulation
the twisted Yang-Mills theory possesses a supersymmetric and gauge invariant
lattice construction which then provides a possible non-perturbative definition
of three dimensional gravity.
