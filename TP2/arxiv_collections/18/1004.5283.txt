Communities are clusters of nodes with a higher than average density of
internal connections. Their detection is of great relevance to better
understand the structure and hierarchies present in a network. Modularity has
become a standard tool in the area of community detection, providing at the
same time a way to evaluate partitions and, by maximizing it, a method to find
communities. In this work, we study the modularity from a combinatorial point
of view. Our analysis (as the modularity definition) relies on the use of the
configurational model, a technique that given a graph produces a series of
randomized copies keeping the degree sequence invariant. We develop an approach
that enumerates the null model partitions and can be used to calculate the
probability distribution function of the modularity. Our theory allows for a
deep inquiry of several interesting features characterizing modularity such as
its resolution limit and the statistics of the partitions that maximize it.
Additionally, the study of the probability of extremes of the modularity in the
random graph partitions opens the way for a definition of the statistical
significance of network partitions.
