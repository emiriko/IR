We propose in this paper a generic model of a non-standard aggregation
mechanism for self-assembly processes of a class of materials involving the
mediation of intermediates consisting of a polydisperse population of
nano-sized particles. The model accounts for a long induction period in the
process. The proposed mechanism also gives insight on future experiments aiming
at a more comprehensive picture of the role of self-organization in
self-assembly processes.
