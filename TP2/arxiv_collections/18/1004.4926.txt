The flux and line shape of the fine-structure transitions of \NeII\ and
\NeIII\ at 12.8 and 15.55\,$\mu$m and of the forbidden transitions of \OI\
$\lambda6300$ are calculated for young stellar objects with a range of
mass-loss rates and X-ray luminosities using the X-wind model of jets and the
associated wide-angle winds. For moderate and high accretion rates, the
calculated \NeII\ line luminosity is comparable to or much larger than produced
in X-ray irradiated disk models. All of the line luminosities correlate well
with the main parameter in the X-wind model, the mass-loss rate, and also with
the assumed X-ray luminosity --- and with one another. The line shapes of an
approaching jet are broad and have strong blue-shifted peaks near the effective
terminal velocity of the jet. They serve as a characteristic and testable
aspect of jet production of the neon fine-structure lines and the \OI\
forbidden transitions.
