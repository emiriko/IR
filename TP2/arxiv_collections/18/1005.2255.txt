We consider Kerr-Newman-AdS-dS black holes near extremality and work out the
near-horizon geometry of these near-extremal black holes. We identify the exact
U(1)_L x U(1)_R isometries of the near-horizon geometry and provide boundary
conditions enhancing them to a pair of commuting Virasoro algebras. The
conserved charges of the corresponding asymptotic symmetries are found to be
well defined and non-vanishing and to yield central charges c_L\neq0 and c_R=0.
The Cardy formula subsequently reproduces the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the
black hole. This suggests that the near-extremal Kerr-Newman-AdS-dS black hole
is holographically dual to a non-chiral two-dimensional conformal field theory.
