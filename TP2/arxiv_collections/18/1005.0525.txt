A deuteron beam polarimeter has been constructed at the Internal Target
Station
  at the Nuclotron of JINR. The polarimeter is based on spin-asymmetry
measurements in the d-p elastic scattering at large angles and the deuteron
kinetic energy of 270 MeV. It allows to measure vector and tensor components of
the deuteron beam polarization
  simultaneously.
