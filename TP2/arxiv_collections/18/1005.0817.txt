We introduce a new regularization for Thiemann's Hamiltonian constraint. The
resulting constraint can generate the 1-4 Pachner moves and is therefore more
compatible with the dynamics defined by the spinfoam formalism. We calculate
its matrix elements and observe the appearence of the 15j Wigner symbol in
these.
