Nd2Fe14B magnetic nanoparticles have been successfully produced using a
surfactant-assisted ball milling technique. The nanoparticles with different
size about 6, 20 and 300 nm were obtained by a size-selection process.
Spin-reorientation transition temperature of the NdFeB nanoparticles was then
determined by measuring the temperature dependence of DC and AC magnetic
susceptibility. It was found that the spin-reorientation transition temperature
(Tsr) of the nanoparticles is strongly size dependent, i.e., Tsr of the 300 nm
particles is lower than that of raw materials and a significant decrease was
observed in the 20 nm particles.
