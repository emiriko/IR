In this paper, we have analyzed item response times measured at a large scale
unspeeded low stakes test for primary-school students. We have demonstrated the
existence of significant difference in the response time for boys and girls as
well as difference in response time of correct and incorrect answers on this
test. We have also demonstrated existence of the warm up effect for this test.
The results show that responses given by girls exhibit much greater warm up
effect and that difference appears to be the most important cause of the
difference on the test level.
