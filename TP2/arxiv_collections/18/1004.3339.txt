We present the package SADE (Symmetry Analysis of Differential Equations) for
the determination of symmetries and related properties of systems of
differential equations. The main methods implemented are: Lie, nonclassical,
Lie-B\"acklund and potential symmetries, invariant solutions, first-integrals,
N\"other theorem for both discrete and continuous systems, solution of ordinary
differential equations, reduction of order or dimension using Lie symmetries,
classification of differential equations, Casimir invariants, and the
quasi-polynomial formalism for ODE's (previously implemented in the package
QPSI by the authors) for the determination of quasi-polynomial first-integrals,
Lie symmetries and invariant surfaces. Examples of use of the package are
given.
