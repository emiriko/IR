The dynamics of a geometric measure of the quantum discord (GMQD) under
decoherence is investigated. We show that the GMQD of a two-qubit state can be
alternatively obtained through the singular values of a $3\times4$ matrix whose
elements are the expectation values of Pauli matrices of the two qubits. By
using Heisenberg picture, the analytic results of the GMQD is obtained for
three typical kinds of the quantum decoherence channels. We compare the
dynamics of the GMQD with that of the quantum discord and of entanglement. We
show that a sudden change in the decay rate of the GMQD does not always imply
that of the quantum discord, and vice versa. We also give a general analysis on
the sudden change in behavior and find that at least for the Bell diagonal
states, the sudden changes in decay rates of the GMQD and that of the quantum
discord occur simultaneously.
