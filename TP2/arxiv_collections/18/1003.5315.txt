Axion-like fields can have a strong impact on non-Abelian strings. I discuss
axion connection to such strings and its implications in two cases: (i) axion
localized on the strings, and (ii) axions propagating in the four-dimensional
bulk. Talk at the Workshop "Axions 2010", in honor of the 60-th birthday of
Pierre Sikivie, University of Florida, January 15-17, 2010.
