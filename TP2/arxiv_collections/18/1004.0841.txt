We explore the discovery potential of doubly charged Higgs bosons
(\xi^{\pm\pm}) at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). For moderate values of
the coupling constants in the original Type-II seesaw model, these
doubly-charged Higgs bosons are not accessible by any present or near future
collider experiments. In a gauged B-L symmetric model we introduce two triplet
scalars to execute a variant of type-II seesaw at the TeV scale. This leads to
a clear like-sign dilepton signal in the decay mode of \xi^{\pm\pm} for a small
vacuum expectation value (\lsim 10^5 \eV) of the triplet scalar \xi= (\xi^{++},
\xi^+, \xi^0) of mass \lsim 1 \TeV. To be specific, for a mass range of
200-1000 GeV of \xi^{\pm\pm}, the like-sign dilepton signal can be detected at
CERN LHC at a center of mass energy 14 TeV with an integrated luminosity > 30
{\rm fb}^{-1}. The same analysis is also pursued with center of mass energies 7
TeV and 10 TeV as well. We also comment on the decay mode of singly charged
scalars and neutral B-L gauge boson in this model.
