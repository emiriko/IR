High-resolution spectrometer measurements of the reaction H(e,e'K+)X at small
Q2 are used to extract the mass and width of the Lambda(1520). We investigate
the influence of various assumptions used in the extraction. The width appears
to be more sensitive to the assumptions than the mass. To reach a width
uncertainty about 1 MeV or better, one needs to know the structure of the
non-resonant background. Based on the new Jefferson Lab Hall A data, our final
values for the Breit-Wigner parameters are M = 1520.4 +- 0.6 (stat) +- 1.5
(syst) MeV, Gamma = 18.6 +- 1.9 (stat) +- 1 (syst) MeV. For the first time, we
also estimate the pole position for this resonance and find that both the pole
mass and width seem to be smaller than the Breit-Wigner values.
