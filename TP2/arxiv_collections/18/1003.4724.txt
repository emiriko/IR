The mutual influence of singularities of the dielectric permittivity e(q,w)
in a Coulomb system in two limiting cases w tends to zero, q tends to zero, and
opposite q tends to zero, w tends to zero is established. It is shown that the
dielectric permittivity e(q,w) satisfies the Kramers-Kronig relations, which
possesses the singularity due to a finite value of the static conductivity.
This singularity is associated with the long "tails" of the time correlation
functions.
