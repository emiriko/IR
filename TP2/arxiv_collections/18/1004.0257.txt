Sorting the integers 1 through $N$ into an ordered list is a simple task that
can be done rapidly. However, using an algorithm based on the
thermally-activated pairwise exchanges of neighboring list elements, we find
sorting can display many features of a glass, even for lists as small as $N =
5$. This includes memory and rejuvenation effects during aging --- two
hallmarks of glassy dynamics that have been difficult to reproduce in standard
glass simulations.
