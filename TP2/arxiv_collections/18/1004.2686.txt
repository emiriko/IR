The ability to transduce non-classical states of light from one wavelength to
another is a requirement for integrating disparate quantum systems that take
advantage of telecommunications-band photons for optical fiber transmission of
quantum information and near-visible, stationary systems for manipulation and
storage. In addition, transducing a single-photon source at 1.3 {\mu}m to
visible wavelengths for detection would be integral to linear optical quantum
computation due to the challenges of detection in the near-infrared. Recently,
transduction at single-photon power levels has been accomplished through
frequency upconversion, but it has yet to be demonstrated for a true
single-photon source. Here, we transduce the triggered single-photon emission
of a semiconductor quantum dot at 1.3 {\mu}m to 710 nm with a total detection
(internal conversion) efficiency of 21% (75%). We demonstrate that the 710 nm
signal maintains the quantum character of the 1.3 {\mu}m signal, yielding a
photon anti-bunched second-order intensity correlation, g^(2)(t), that shows
the optical field is composed of single photons with g^(2)(0) = 0.165 < 0.5.
