Domain wall dynamics in ferroic materials underpins functionality of data
storage and information technology devices. Using localized electric field of a
scanning probe microscopy tip, we experimentally demonstrate a surprisingly
rich range of polarization reversal behaviors in the vicinity of the initially
flat 180\deg ferroelectric domain wall. The nucleation bias is found to
increase by an order of magnitude from a 2D nucleus at the wall to 3D nucleus
in the bulk. The wall is thus significantly ferroelectrically softer than the
bulk. The wall profoundly affects switching on length scales of the order of
micrometers. The mechanism of correlated switching is analyzed using analytical
theory and phase-field modeling. The long-range effect is ascribed to wall
bending under the influence of a tip bias well below the bulk nucleation field
and placed many micrometers away from the wall. These studies provide an
experimental link between the macroscopic and mesoscopic physics of domain
walls and atomistic models of nucleation.
