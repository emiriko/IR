We study a coupled dark energy-dark matter model in which the energy-momentum
exchange is proportional to the Hubble expansion rate. The inclusion of its
perturbation is required by gauge invariance. We derive the linear perturbation
equations for the gauge invariant energy density contrast and velocity of the
coupled fluids, and we determine the initial conditions. The latter turn out to
be adiabatic for dark energy, when assuming adiabatic initial conditions for
all the standard fluids. We perform a full Monte Carlo Markov Chain likelihood
analysis of the model, using WMAP 7-year data.
