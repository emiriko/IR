Deep observations of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) and region were carried
out in the hard X-ray band by the INTEGRAL observatory in 2008-2009. The field
of view of the instrument permitted simultaneous coverage of the entire SMC and
the eastern end of the Magellanic Bridge. In total, INTEGRAL detected seven
sources in the SMC and five in the Magellanic Bridge; the majority of the
sources were previously unknown systems. Several of the new sources were
detected undergoing bright X- ray outbursts and all the sources exhibited
transient behaviour except the supergiant system SMC X-1. They are all thought
to be High Mass X-ray Binary (HMXB) systems in which the compact object is a
neutron star.
