Due to mobility in Ad-Hoc network the topology of the network may change
randomly, rapidly and unexpectedly, because of these aspects, the routes in the
network often disappear and new to arise. To avoid frequent route discovery and
route failure EAOMDV was proposed based on existing routing protocol AOMDV. The
EAOMDV (Enhanced Ad-Hoc on Demand Multipath Distance Vector) Routing protocol
was proposed to solve the "route failure" problem in AOMDV. EAOMDV protocol
reduces the route failure problem by preemptively predicting the link failure
by the signal power received by the receiver (pr). This proposed protocol
controls overhead, increases throughput and reduces the delay. The EAOMDV
protocol was implemented on NS-2 and evaluation results show that the EAOMDV
outperformed AOMDV.
