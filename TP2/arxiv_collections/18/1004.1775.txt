Aims: Low-resolution optical spectroscopic observations for 78 very low-mass
star and brown dwarf candidates that have been photometrically selected using
the DENIS survey point source catalogue. Methods: Spectral types are derived
for them using measurements of the PC3 index. They range from M6 to L4. H_alpha
emission and NaI subordinate doublet (818.3 nm and 819.9 nm) equivalent widths
are measured in the spectra. Spectroscopic indices of TiO, VO, CrH and FeH
molecular features are also reported. Results: A rule-of-thumb criterion to
select young very low-mass objects using the NaI doublet equivalent width is
given. It is used to confirm seven new members of the Upper Sco OB association
and two new members of the R Cr-A star-forming region. Four of our field
objects are also classified as very young, but are not members of any known
nearby young association. The frequency of lower-gravity young objects in our
field ultracool sample is 8.5%. Our results provide the first spectroscopic
classification for 38 ultracool dwarfs in the solar vicinity with
spectrophotometric distances in the range 17 pc to 65 pc (3 of them are new L
dwarfs within 20 pc).
