In this talk I describe recent joint works with R.Schoen and with G.Gibbons
and R.Schoen which prove the non-existence of certain asymptotically flat,
stationary solutions of the Einstein equations with more than one body. The
basic restriction is for example satisfied when spacetime has an isometry
reversing the sign of the timelike Killing vector and fixing a hypersurface in
the space of Killing trajectories which is disjoint from the bodies. I also
give a detailed treatment of the Newtonian situation.
