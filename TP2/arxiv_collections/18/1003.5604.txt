Quantum transport for DNA conduction has widely studied with interest in
application as a candidate in making nanowires as well as interest in the
scientific mechanism. In this paper, we review recent works with concerning the
electronic states and the conduction/transfer in DNA polymers. We have mainly
investigated the energy band structure and the correlation effects of
localization property in the two- and three-chain systems (ladder model) with
long-range correlation as a simple model for electronic property in a double
strand of DNA by using the tight-binding model. In addition, we investigated
the localization properties of electronic states in several actual DNA
sequences such as bacteriophages of Escherichia coli, human-chromosome 22,
compared with those of the artificial disordered sequences with correlation.
The charge transfer properties for poly(dA)-poly(dT) and poly(dG)-poly(dC) DNA
polymers are also presented in terms of localization lengths within the
frameworks of the polaron models due to the coupling between the charge
carriers and the lattice vibrations of the double strand of DNA.
