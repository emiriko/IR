In this article, we analyze the third of three papers, in which Einstein
presented his quantum theory of the ideal gas of 1924-1925. Although it failed
to attract the attention of Einstein's contemporaries and although also today
very few commentators refer to it, we argue for its significance in the context
of Einstein's quantum researches. It contains an attempt to extend and exhaust
the characterization of the monatomic ideal gas without appealing to
combinatorics. Its ambiguities illustrate Einstein's confusion with his initial
success in extending Bose's results and in realizing the consequences of what
later became to be called Bose-Einstein statistics. We discuss Einstein's
motivation for writing a non-combinatorial paper, partly in response to
criticism by his friend Ehrenfest, and we paraphrase its content. Its arguments
are based on Einstein's belief in the complete analogy between the
thermodynamics of light quanta and of material particles and invoke
considerations of adiabatic transformations as well as of dimensional analysis.
These techniques were well-known to Einstein from earlier work on Wien's
displacement law, Planck's radiation theory, and the specific heat of solids.
We also investigate the possible role of Ehrenfest in the gestation of the
theory.
