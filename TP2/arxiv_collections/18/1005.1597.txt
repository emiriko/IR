We present Herschel-SPIRE observations at 250-500um of the giant elliptical
galaxy M86 and examine the distribution of the resolved cold dust emission and
its relation with other galactic tracers. The SPIRE images reveal three dust
components: emission from the central region; a dust lane extending
north-south; and a bright emission feature 10kpc to the south-east. We estimate
that approximately 10^6 solar masses of dust is spatially coincident with
atomic and ionized hydrogen, originating from stripped material from the nearby
spiral NGC4438 due to recent tidal interactions with M86. The gas-to-dust ratio
of the cold gas component ranges from ~20-80. We discuss the different heating
mechanisms for the dust features.
