Casimir energy is calculated for 5D scalar theory in the {\it warped}
geometry. A new regularization, called {\it sphere lattice regularization}, is
taken. The regularized configuration is {\it closed-string like}. We
numerically evaluate $\La$(4D UV-cutoff), $\om$(5D bulk curvature, warp
parameter) and $T$(extra space IR parameter) dependence of Casimir energy. 5D
Casimir energy is {\it finitely} obtained after the {\it proper renormalization
procedure.} The {\it warp parameter} $\om$ suffers from the {\it
renormalization effect}. We examine the cosmological constant problem.
