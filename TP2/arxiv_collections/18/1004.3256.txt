Composing Web services is a convenient means of dealing with complex
requests. However, the number of Web services on the Internet is increasing.
This explains the growing interest in composing Web services automatically.
Nevertheless, the Web services' semantics is necessary for any dynamic
composition process. In this article, we present an MDA approach to develop and
compose SAWSDL semantic Web services. To model Web services, we use a UML
profile which is independent of the description standards. The SAWSDL interface
files are generated by using transformation rules. To model the behavior of a
composite Web service and generate its executable BPEL file, we use the BPMN
notation in a platform of modeling and implementing business process. The main
contribution of this work is the easy and extensible solution to a model-driven
development of the semantic atomic and composite Web services.
