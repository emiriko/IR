We present an adaptation of the standard scenario of disk-galaxy formation to
the concordant LCDM cosmology aimed to derive analytical expressions for the
scale length and rotation speed of present-day disks that form within four
different, cosmologically motivated protogalactic dark matter halo-density
profiles. We invoke a standard galaxy-formation model that includes virial
equilibrium of spherical dark halos, specific angular momentum conservation
during gas cooling, and adiabatic halo response to the gas inflow. The mean
mass-fraction and mass-to-light ratio of the central stellar disk are treated
as free parameters whose values are tuned to match the zero points of the
observed size-luminosity and circular speed-luminosity relations of galaxies.
We supply analytical formulas for the characteristic size and rotation speed of
disks built inside Einasto r^{1/6}, Hernquist, Burkert, and Navarro-Frenk-White
dark matter halos. These expressions match simultaneously the observed zero
points and slopes of the different correlations that can be built in the RVL
space of disk galaxies from plausible values of the galaxy- and star-formation
efficiencies.
