A highly phosphrous delta-doped Si device is modeled with a quantum well with
periodic boundary conditions and the semi-empirical spds* tight-binding band
model. Its temperature-dependent electronic properties are studied. To account
for high doping density with many electrons, a highly parallelized
self-consistent Schroedinger-Poisson solver is used with atomistic
representations of multiple impurity ions. The band-structure in equilibrium
and the corresponding Fermi-level position are computed for a selective set of
temperatures. The result at room temperature is compared with previous studies
and the temperature-dependent electronic properties are discussed further in
detail with the calculated 3-D self-consistent potential profile.
