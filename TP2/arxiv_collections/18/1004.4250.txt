This paper investigates the optimal harvesting strategy for a single species
living in random environments whose growth is given by a regime-switching
diffusion. Harvesting acts as a (stochastic) control on the size of the
population. The objective is to find a harvesting strategy which maximizes the
expected total discounted income from harvesting {\em up to the time of
extinction} of the species; the income rate is allowed to be state- and
environment-dependent. This is a singular stochastic control problem with both
the extinction time and the optimal harvesting policy depending on the initial
condition. One aspect of receiving payments up to the random time of extinction
is that small changes in the initial population size may significantly alter
the extinction time when using the same harvesting policy. Consequently, one no
longer obtains continuity of the value function using standard arguments for
either regular or singular control problems having a fixed time horizon. This
paper introduces a new sufficient condition under which the continuity of the
value function for the regime-switching model is established. Further, it is
shown that the value function is a viscosity solution of a coupled system of
quasi-variational inequalities. The paper also establishes a verification
theorem and, based on this theorem, an $\varepsilon$-optimal harvesting
strategy is constructed under certain conditions on the model. Two examples are
analyzed in detail.
