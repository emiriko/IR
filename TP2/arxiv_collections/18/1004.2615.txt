We survey some prospects of identifying further in-medium modifications of
hadrons in a strongly interacting medium with respect to ongoing experiment
series of the HADES Collaboration and planned experiments of the CBM
Collaboration at FAIR. Di-electrons, strange and charm mesons are considered
and their potential for signaling imprints of chiral restoration is
highlighted.
