The successful execution of a construction project is heavily impacted by
making the right decision during tendering processes. Managing tender
procedures is very complex and uncertain involving coordination of many tasks
and individuals with different priorities and objectives. Bias and inconsistent
decision are inevitable if the decision-making process is totally depends on
intuition, subjective judgement or emotion. In making transparent decision and
healthy competition tendering, there exists a need for flexible guidance tool
for decision support. Aim of this paper is to give a review on current
practices of Decision Support Systems (DSS) technology in construction
tendering processes. Current practices of general tendering processes as
applied to the most countries in different regions such as United States,
Europe, Middle East and Asia are comprehensively discussed. Applications of
Web-based tendering processes is also summarised in terms of its properties.
Besides that, a summary of Decision Support System (DSS) components is included
in the next section. Furthermore, prior researches on implementation of DSS
approaches in tendering processes are discussed in details. Current issues
arise from both of paper-based and Web-based tendering processes are outlined.
Finally, conclusion is included at the end of this paper.
