We have used a shell model to study the phonon dynamics of multiferroic
manganites RMnO3 (R= Tb, Dy, Ho). The calculated phonon dynamical properties,
crystal structure, Raman frequencies and specific heat are found to be in good
agreement with the available experimental data. Besides, the phonon density of
states, elastic constants and phonon dispersion curves along high symmetry
directions (sigma, delta and lambda) have also been computed. A zone-center
imaginary Au mode is revealed in these phonon dispersion curves, which
indicates the occurrence of metastability of the perovskite phase. The Gibbs
free energy values of orthorhombic phase, when compared with those of hexagonal
phase, indicate the possibility of coexistence of these two phases of these
multiferroic manganites under ambient conditions.
