A possible solution to the dark energy problem is that Einstein's theory of
general relativity is modified. A suite of models have been proposed that, in
general, are unable to predict the correct amount of large scale structure in
the distribution of galaxies or anisotropies in the Cosmic Microwave
Background. It has been argued, however, that it should be possible to
constrain a general class of theories of modified gravity by focusing on
properties such as the growing mode, gravitational slip and the effective, time
varying Newton's constant. We show that assuming certain physical requirements
such as stability, metricity and gauge invariance, it is possible to come up
with consistency conditions between these various parameters. In this paper we
focus on theories which have, at most, 2nd derivatives in the metric variables
and find restrictions that shed light on current and future experimental
constraints without having to resort to a (as yet unknown) complete theory of
modified gravity. We claim that future measurements of the growth of structure
on small scales (i.e. from 1-200 h^{-1} Mpc) may lead to tight constraints on
both dark energy and modified theories of gravity.
