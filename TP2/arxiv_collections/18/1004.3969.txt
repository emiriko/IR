We develop a generalized principle of EIT vector magnetometry based on
high-contrast EIT-resonances and the symmetry of atom-light interaction in the
linearly polarized bichromatic fields. Operation of such vector magnetometer on
the D1 line of 87Rb has been demonstrated. The proposed compass-magnetometer
has an increased immunity to shifts produced by quadratic Zeeman and ac-Stark
effects, as well as by atom-buffer gas and atom-atom collisions. In our
proof-of-principle experiment the detected sensitivity to magnetic field
orientation is 10^{-3} deg/Hz^{1/2}, which is limited by laser intensity
fluctuations, light polarization quality, and the magnitude of the magnetic
field.
