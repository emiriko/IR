A recent experiment has questioned the standard relative value of spin-orbit
and crystal-field strengths in rare-earth $4f$ electron systems, according to
which the first should be one order of magnitude larger that the second. We
find it difficult to reconcile the standard values of crystal field strength
with the Single Ion Model of magnetic anisotropy. If in rare-earth systems the
spin-orbit force is much larger than the crystal field, however, spin and orbit
of $4f$ electrons should be locked to each other. For rare earths with
non-vanishing spin, an applied magnetic field should rotate both spin and
charge density profile. We suggest experiments to investigate the possible
occurrence of such Spin-Orbit Locking, thus making a test of the standard
picture, by studying the Scissors Modes in such systems.
