Photonic entanglement source and quantum memory are two basic building blocks
of linear-optical quantum computation and long-distance quantum communication.
In the past decades, intensive researches have been carried out, and remarkable
progress, particularly based on the spontaneous parametric down-converted
(SPDC) entanglement source and atomic ensembles, has been achieved. Currently,
an important task towards scalable quantum information processing (QIP) is to
efficiently write and read entanglement generated from a SPDC source into and
out of an atomic quantum memory. Here we report the first experimental
realization of a quantum interface by building a 5 MHz frequency-uncorrelated
SPDC source and reversibly mapping the generated entangled photons into and out
of a remote optically thick cold atomic memory using electromagnetically
induced transparency. The frequency correlation between the entangled photons
is almost fully eliminated with a suitable pump pulse. The storage of a
triggered single photon with arbitrary polarization is shown to reach an
average fidelity of 92% for 200 ns storage time. Moreover,
polarization-entangled photon pairs are prepared, and one of photons is stored
in the atomic memory while the other keeps flying. The CHSH Bell's inequality
is measured and violation is clearly observed for storage time up to 1
microsecond. This demonstrates the entanglement is stored and survives during
the storage. Our work establishes a crucial element to implement scalable
all-optical QIP, and thus presents a substantial progress in quantum
information science.
