Observations made during the last ten years with the Chandra X-ray
Observatory have shed much light on the cooling gas in the centers of clusters
of galaxies and the role of active galactic nucleus (AGN) heating. Cooling of
the hot intracluster medium in cluster centers can feed the supermassive black
holes found in the nuclei of the dominant cluster galaxies leading to AGN
outbursts which can reheat the gas, suppressing cooling and large amounts of
star formation. AGN heating can come in the form of shocks, buoyantly rising
bubbles that have been inflated by radio lobes, and the dissipation of sound
waves.
