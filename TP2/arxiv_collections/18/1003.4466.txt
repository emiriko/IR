We propose a method to generate a warning system for the early detection of
time clusters applied to public health surveillance data. This new method
relies on the evaluation of a return period associated to any new count of a
particular infection reported to a surveillance system. The method is applied
to Salmonella surveillance in France and compared to the model developed by
Farrington et al.
