We first give simple arguments in favor of the "Zero Constants Party", i.e.
that quantum theory should not contain fundamental dimensionful constants at
all. Then we argue that quantum theory should proceed not from a space-time
background but from a Lie algebra, which is treated as a symmetry algebra. With
such a formulation of symmetry, the fact that $\Lambda\neq 0$ means not that
the space-time background is curved (since the notion of the space-time
background is not physical) but that the symmetry algebra is the de Sitter
algebra rather than the Poincare one. In particular, there is no need to
involve dark energy or other fields for explaining this fact. As a consequence,
instead of the cosmological constant problem we have a problem why nowadays
Poincare symmetry is so good approximate symmetry. This is rather a problem of
cosmology but not fundamental quantum physics.
