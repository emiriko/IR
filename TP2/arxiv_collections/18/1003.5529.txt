A recent method of constructing quantum mechanics in noncommutative
coordinates, alternative to implying noncommutativity by means of star product
is discussed. Within this approach we study Hall effect as well as quantum
phases in noncommutative coordinates. The $\theta$--deformed phases which we
obtain are velocity independent.
