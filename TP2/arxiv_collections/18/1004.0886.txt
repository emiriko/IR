Using partially twisted boundary conditions we compute the K->pi
semi-leptonic form factors in the range of momentum transfers 0 <~ q^2 <=
q^2_{max}=(mK-mpi)^2 in lattice QCD with N_f=2+1 dynamical flavours. In this
way we are able to determine f+(0) without any interpolation in the momentum
transfer, thus eliminating one source of systematic error. This study confirms
our earlier phenomenological ansatz for the strange quark mass dependence of
the scalar form factor. We identify and estimate potentially significant NNLO
effects in the chiral expansion that guides the extrapolation of the data to
the physical point. Our main result is f+(0) = 0.9599(34)(^{+31}_{-43})(14)$,
where the first error is statistical, the second error is due to the
uncertainties in the chiral extrapolation of the lattice data and the last
error is an estimate of potential discretisation effects.
