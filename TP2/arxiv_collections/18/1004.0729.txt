Negative dielectric constant and dominant kinetic resistance make
superconductors an intriguing plasmonic media. Here we report on the first
study of one of the most important and disputed manifestations of plasmonics,
the effect of extraordinary transmission through an array of sub-wavelength
holes, using a perforated film of high-temperature superconductor.
