We use Herschel PACS and SPIRE observations of the edge-on spiral galaxy UGC
4754, taken as part of the H-ATLAS SDP observations, to investigate the dust
energy balance in this galaxy. We build detailed SKIRT radiative models based
on SDSS and UKIDSS maps and use these models to predict the far-infrared
emission. We find that our radiative transfer model underestimates the observed
FIR emission by a factor of two to three. Similar discrepancies have been found
for other edge-on spiral galaxies based on IRAS, ISO, and SCUBA data. Thanks to
the good sampling of the SED at FIR wavelengths, we can rule out an
underestimation of the FIR emissivity as the cause for this discrepancy.
Instead we support highly obscured star formation that contributes little to
the optical extinction as a more probable explanation.
