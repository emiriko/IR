Background: We study the statistical properties of fragment coverage in
genome sequencing experiments. In an extension of the classic Lander-Waterman
model, we consider the effect of the length distribution of fragments. We also
introduce the notion of the shape of a coverage function, which can be used to
detect abberations in coverage. The probability theory underlying these
problems is essential for constructing models of current high-throughput
sequencing experiments, where both sample preparation protocols and sequencing
technology particulars can affect fragment length distributions.
  Results: We show that regardless of fragment length distribution and under
the mild assumption that fragment start sites are Poisson distributed, the
fragments produced in a sequencing experiment can be viewed as resulting from a
two-dimensional spatial Poisson process. We then study the jump skeleton of the
the coverage function, and show that the induced trees are Galton-Watson trees
whose parameters can be computed.
  Conclusions: Our results extend standard analyses of shotgun sequencing that
focus on coverage statistics at individual sites, and provide a null model for
detecting deviations from random coverage in high-throughput sequence census
based experiments. By focusing on fragments, we are also led to a new approach
for visualizing sequencing data that should be of independent interest.
