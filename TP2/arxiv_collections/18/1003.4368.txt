The star HD 49385 is the first G-type solar-like pulsator observed in the
seismology field of the space telescope CoRoT. The satellite collected 137 days
of high-precision photometric data on this star, confirming that it presents
solar-like oscillations. HD 49385 was also observed in spectroscopy with the
NARVAL spectrograph in January 2009. Our goal is to characterize HD 49385 using
both spectroscopic and seismic data. The fundamental stellar parameters of HD
49385 are derived with the semi-automatic software VWA, and the projected
rotational velocity is estimated by fitting synthetic profiles to isolated
lines in the observed spectrum. A maximum likelihood estimation is used to
determine the parameters of the observed p modes. We perform a global fit, in
which modes are fitted simultaneously over nine radial orders, with degrees
ranging from l=0 to l=3 (36 individual modes). Precise estimates of the
atmospheric parameters (Teff, [M/H], log g) and of the vsini of HD 49385 are
obtained. The seismic analysis of the star leads to a clear identification of
the modes for degrees l=0,1,2. Around the maximum of the signal (nu=1013
microHz), some peaks are found significant and compatible with the expected
characteristics of l=3 modes. Our fit yields robust estimates of the
frequencies, linewidths and amplitudes of the modes. We find amplitudes of
about 5.6 +/- 0.8 ppm for radial modes at the maximum of the signal. The
lifetimes of the modes range from one day (at high frequency) to a bit more
than two days (at low frequency). Significant peaks are found outside the
identified ridges and are fitted. They are attributed to mixed modes.
