In this paper we continue the study of the Hamiltonian formalism of the
healthy extended Horava-Lifshitz gravity. We find the constraint structure of
given theory and argue that this is the theory with the second class
constraints. Then we discuss physical consequence of this result. We also apply
the Batalin-Tyutin formalism of the conversion of the system with the second
class constraints to the system with the first class constraints to the case of
the healthy extended Horava-Lifshitz theory. As a result we find new theory of
gravity with structure that is different from the standard formulation of
Horava-Lifshitz gravity or General Relativity.
