In the Standard Model with a fourth generation of quarks, we study the
relation between the Jarlskog invariants and the triangle areas in the 4-by-4
CKM matrix. To identify the leading effects that may probe the CP violation in
processes involving quarks, we invoke small mass and small angle expansions,
and show that these leading effects are enhanced considerably compared to the
three generation case by the large masses of fourth generation quarks. We
discuss the leading effect in several cases, in particular the possibility of
large CP violation in $ b \to s $ processes, which echoes the heightened recent
interest because of experimental hints.
