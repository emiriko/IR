A description of the electronic correlations contained in the Hubbard model
on the square-lattice perturbed by very weak three-dimensional uniaxial
anisotropy in terms of the residual interactions of charge $c$ fermions and
spin-neutral composite two-spinon $s1$ fermions is used to access further
information on the origin of quantum critical behavior in the hole-doped
cuprate superconductors. Excellent quantitative agreement with their
anisotropic linear-$\omega$ one-electron scattering rate and normal-state
linear-$T$ resistivity is achieved. Our results provide strong evidence that
the normal-state linear-$T$ resistivity is indeed a manifestation of
low-temperature scale-invariant physics.
