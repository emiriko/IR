We consider the $\mu-\tau$ symmetric Friedberg-Lee (FL) symmetry for the
neutrino sector and show that a specific FL translation leads to the
tribimaximal mixing pattern of the Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (MNS) matrix. We also
apply the symmetry to the type-I seesaw framework and address the baryon
asymmetry of the universe through the leptogenesis mechanism. We try to
establish a relation between the net baryon asymmetry and CP phases included in
the MNS matrix.
