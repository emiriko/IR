We investigate the velocity dispersion of Pal 14, an outer Milky-Way globular
cluster at Galactocentric distance of 71 kpc with a very low stellar density
(central density 0.1-0.2 Msun/pc^3). Due to this low stellar density the binary
population of Pal 14 is likely to be close to the primordial binary population.
Artificial clusters are generated with the observed properties of Pal 14 and
the velocity dispersion within these clusters is measured as Jordi et al.
(2009) have done with 17 observed stars of Pal 14. We discuss the effect of the
binary population on these measurements and find that the small velocity
dispersion of 0.38 km/s which has been found by Jordi et al. (2009) would imply
a binary fraction of less than 0.1, even though from the stellar density of Pal
14 we would expect a binary fraction of more than 0.5. We also discuss the
effect of mass segregation on the velocity dispersion as possible explanation
for this discrepancy, but find that it would increase the velocity dispersion
further. Thus, either Pal 14 has a very unusual stellar population and its
birth process was significantly different than we see in today's star forming
regions, or the binary population is regular and we would have to correct the
observed 0.38 km/s for binarity. In this case the true velocity dispersion of
Pal 14 would be much smaller than this value and the cluster would have to be
considered as "kinematically frigid", thereby possibly posing a challenge for
Newtonian dynamics but in the opposite sense to MOND.
