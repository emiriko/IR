To describe the strongly nonlinear dynamics of waves propagating in the final
stages of shoaling and in the surf and swash zones, fully nonlinear models are
required. The ability of the Serre or Green Naghdi (S-GN) equations to
reproduce this nonlinear processes is reviewed. Two high-order methods for
solving S-GN equations, based on Finite Volume approaches, are presented. The
first one is based on a quasi-conservative form of the S-GN equations, and the
second on a hybrid Finite Volume/Finite Difference method. We show the ability
of these two approaches to accurately simulate nonlinear shoaling, breaking and
runup processes.
