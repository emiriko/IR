Due to intra-field gravitational interactions, field configurations have a
strong negative component to their energy density at the planckian and
transplanckian scales, conceivably resulting in a sequestration of the
transplanckian field degrees of freedom. Quantum fluctuations then allow these
to tunnel into cisplanckian configurations to seed inflation and conventional
observed physics: propagating modes of QFT in a geometry which responds to the
existence of these new modes through the energy constraint of general
relativity, H^2 = \rho/3. That this tunnelling results in geometries and field
configurations that are homogeneous allows for an estimate of the mass of the
inflaton, m=O(10^{-6}), and the amplitude of the inflaton condensate,
\phiav=O(10), both consistent with phenomenology.
