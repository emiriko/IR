The extended L\"uroth's Theorem says that if the transcendence degree of
$\KK(\mathsf{f}_1,\dots,\mathsf{f}_m)/\KK$ is 1 then there exists $f \in
\KK(\underline{X})$ such that $\KK(\mathsf{f}_1,\dots,\mathsf{f}_m)$ is equal
to $\KK(f)$. In this paper we show how to compute $f$ with a probabilistic
algorithm. We also describe a probabilistic and a deterministic algorithm for
the decomposition of multivariate rational functions. The probabilistic
algorithms proposed in this paper are softly optimal when $n$ is fixed and $d$
tends to infinity. We also give an indecomposability test based on gcd
computations and Newton's polytope. In the last section, we show that we get a
polynomial time algorithm, with a minor modification in the exponential time
decomposition algorithm proposed by Gutierez-Rubio-Sevilla in 2001.
