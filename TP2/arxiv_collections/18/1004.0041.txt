An electrical analysis is performed for a memristor crossbar array integrated
with operational amplifiers including the effects of parasitic or contact
resistances. It is shown that the memristor crossbar array can act as a
transfer matrix for a multiple input-multiple output signal processing system.
Special cases of the transfer matrix are described related to reconfigurable
analog filters, waveform generators, analog computing, and pattern similarity.
