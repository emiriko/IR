We investigated the optical spectrum of Ba(Fe1-xCox)2As2 single crystals with
various doping levels. It is found that the low-energy optical conductivity
spectrum of this system can be decomposed into two components: a sharp Drude
term and a broad "incoherent" term. For the compounds showing magnetic order, a
gap appears predominantly in the "incoherent" component, while an s-wave like
superconducting gap opens in both components for highly doped compounds. The
Drude weight steadily increases as doping proceeds, consistent with electron
doping in this system. On the other hand, the "incoherent" spectral weight is
almost doping independent, but its spectral feature is intimately connected
with the magnetism. We demonstrate that the presence of two distinct components
in the optical spectrum well explains the doping and temperature dependences of
the dc resistivity.
