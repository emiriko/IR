We theoretically and numerically analyze x-ray scattering from asymmetric-top
molecules three-dimensionally aligned using elliptically polarized laser light.
A rigid-rotor model is assumed. The principal axes of the polarizability tensor
are assumed to coincide with the principal axes of the moment of inertia
tensor. Several symmetries in the Hamiltonian are identified and exploited to
enhance the efficiency of solving the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation for
each rotational state initially populated in a thermal ensemble. Using a
phase-retrieval algorithm, the feasibility of structure reconstruction from a
quasi-adiabatically-aligned sample is illustrated for the organic molecule
naphthalene. The spatial resolution achievable strongly depends on the laser
parameters, the initial rotational temperature, and the x-ray pulse duration.
We demonstrate that for a laser peak intensity of 5 TW/cm^2, a laser pulse
duration of 100 ps, a rotational temperature of 10 mK, and an x-ray pulse
duration of 1 ps, the molecular structure may be probed at a resolution of 1
\AA.
