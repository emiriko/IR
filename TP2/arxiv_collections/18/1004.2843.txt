In this proceeding we explore a pathway to radio-loudness under the
hypothesis that retrograde accretion onto giant spinning black holes leads to
the launch of powerful jets, as seen in radio loud QSOs and recently in
LAT/Fermi and BAT/Swift Blazars. Counter-rotation of the accretion disc
relative to the BH spin is here associated to gas-poor galaxy mergers
progenitors of giant (missing-light) ellipticals. The occurrence of retrograde
accretion enters as unifying element that may account for the
radio-loudness/galaxy morphology dichotomy observed in AGN.
