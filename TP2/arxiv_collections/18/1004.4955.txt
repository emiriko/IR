It is well known that, under broad assumptions, the time-scaled point process
of exceedances of a high level by a stationary sequence converges to a compound
Poisson process as the level grows. The purpose of this note is to demonstrate
that, for any given distribution G on the natural numbers, there exists a
stationary sequence for which the compounding law of this limiting process of
exceedances will coincide with G.
