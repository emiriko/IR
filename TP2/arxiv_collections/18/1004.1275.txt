The superfluid density \rho_s in underdoped (T_c\simeq23K), optimally doped
(T_c\simeq35K) and overdoped (T_c\simeq29K) single crystalline
(BiPb)_2(SrLa)_2CuO_{6+\delta} samples was studied by means of muon-spin
rotation (\muSR). By combining the \muSR data with the results of ARPES
measurements on similar samples [Nature 457, 296 (2009)] good self-consistent
agreement is obtained between two techniques concerning the temperature and the
doping evolution of \rho_s.
