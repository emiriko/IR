We investigate the structure and the novel emerging features of the mesonic
non-singlet spectrum of the Minimal Walking Technicolor (MWT) theory. Precision
measurements in the nonsinglet pseudoscalar and vector channels are compared to
the expectations for an IR-conformal field theory and a QCD-like theory. Our
results favor a scenario in which MWT is (almost) conformal in the infrared,
while spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking seems less plausible.
