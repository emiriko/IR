We consider the Dirac equation in 3+1 dimensions with spherical symmetry and
coupling to 1/r singular vector potential. An approximate analytic solution for
all angular momenta is obtained. The approximation is made for the 1/r orbital
term in the Dirac equation itself not for the traditional and more singular
1/r^2 term in the resulting second order differential equation. Consequently,
the validity of the solution is for a wider energy spectrum. As examples, we
consider the Hulthen and Eckart potentials.
