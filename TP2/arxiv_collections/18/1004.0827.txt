Using a tight-binding model and some well-known approaches and methods based
on Green's function theory and Landauer formalism, we numerically investigate
the conductance properties and I-V characteristics of zigzag single-walled BCN
alloy nanotube in the CNT/BCN/CNT structure, where nanocontacts are considered
as zigzag single-walled carbon nanotubes. Our calculations show that any
increasing in considerably give rise to the enhancing of the conductance of the
system. With our system characteristics, this system can be a possible
candidate for a nanoelectronic switching device.
