We investigate the formation of terrestrial planets in the late stage of
planetary formation using two-planet model. At that time, the protostar has
formed for about 3 Myr and the gas disk has dissipated. In the model, the
perturbations from Jupiter and Saturn are considered. We also consider
variations of the mass of outer planet, and the initial eccentricities and
inclinations of embryos and planetesimals. Our results show that, terrestrial
planets are formed in 50 Myr, and the accretion rate is about 60% - 80%. In
each simulation, 3 - 4 terrestrial planets are formed inside "Jupiter" with
masses of $0.15 - 3.6 M_{\oplus}$. In the 0.5 - 4AU, when the eccentricities of
planetesimals are excited, planetesimals are able to accrete material from wide
radial direction. The plenty of water material of the terrestrial planet in the
Habitable Zone may be transferred from the farther places by this mechanism.
Accretion may also happen a few times between two giant planets only if the
outer planet has a moderate mass and the small terrestrial planet could survive
at some resonances over time scale of $10^8$ yr.
