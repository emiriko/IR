We investigate the tensor form factors of the baryon octet within the
framework of the chiral quark-soliton model, emphasizing those of the nucleon,
taking linear 1/N_c rotational as well as linear m_s corrections into account,
and applying the symmetry-conserving quantization. We explicitly calculate the
tensor form factors H_{T}^{q}(Q^{2}) corresponding to the generalized parton
distributions H_{T}(x,\xi,t). The tensor form factors are obtained for the
momentum transfer up to Q^{2}\leq1\,\mathrm{GeV}^{2} and at a renormalization
scale of 0.36\,\mathrm{GeV}^{2}. We find for the tensor charges \delta u=1.08,
\delta d=-0.32, \delta s=-0.01 and discuss their physical consequences,
comparing them with those from other models. Results for tensor charges for the
baryon octet are also given.
