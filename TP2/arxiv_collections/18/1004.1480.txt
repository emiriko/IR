The energetically driven Ehrlich-Schwoebel (ES) barrier had been generally
accepted as the primary cause of the growth instability in the form of
quasi-regular mound-like structures observed on the surface of thin film grown
via molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) technique. Recently the second mechanism of
mound formation was proposed in terms of a topologically induced flux of
particles originating from the line tension of the step edges which form the
contour lines around a mound. Through large-scale simulations of MBE growth on
a variety of crystalline lattice planes using limited mobility, solid-on-solid
models introduced by Wolf-Villain and Das Sarma-Tamborenea in 2+1 dimensions,
we propose yet another type of topological uphill particle current which is
unique to some lattice, and has hitherto been overlooked in the literature.
Without ES barrier, our simulations produce spectacular mounds very similar, in
some cases, to what have been observed in many recent MBE experiments. On a
lattice where these currents cease to exist, the surface appears to be
scale-invariant, statistically rough as predicted by the conventional continuum
growth equation.
