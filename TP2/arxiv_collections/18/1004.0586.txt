We argue that observations of old neutron stars can impose constraints on
dark matter candidates even with very small elastic or inelastic cross section,
and self-annihilation cross section. We find that old neutron stars close to
the galactic center or in globular clusters can maintain a surface temperature
that could in principle be detected. Due to their compactness, neutron stars
can acrete WIMPs efficiently even if the WIMP-to-nucleon cross section obeys
the current limits from direct dark matter searches, and therefore they could
constrain a wide range of dark matter candidates.
