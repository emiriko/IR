Electron pairing in one-dimensional binary Hubbard chains is studied for
different values of the band-filling using the Density Matrix Renormalization
Group method. The systems consist of linear arrays of sites with two types of
on-site correlations defined by two potentials: U_A being attractive (< 0), and
U_B repulsive (> 0). The atomic levels of the system are modulated with
periodic and quasiperiodic ordering, in the latter case following the Fibonacci
sequence. We analyze the effect of such modulations and calculate the electron
pairing phase diagram as a function of the band-filling. It is observed that
there is a critical value of the band-filling where the behavior of the
periodic and the Fibonacci binary Hubbard chains is reversed.
