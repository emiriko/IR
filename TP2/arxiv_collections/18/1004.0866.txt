We examine the changeover in the particle configurations and the dynamics in
dense Lennard-Jones binary mixtures composed of small and large particles. By
varying the composition at a low temperature, we realize crystal with defects,
polycrystal with small grains, and glass with various degrees of disorder. In
particular, we show configurations where small crystalline regions composed of
the majority species are enclosed by percolated amorphous layers composed of
the two species. We visualize the dynamics of configuration changes using the
method of bond breakage and following the particle displacements. In quiescent
jammed states, the dynamics is severely slowed down and is highly heterogeneous
at any compositions. In shear, plastic deformations multiply occur in
relatively fragile regions, growing into large-scale shear bands where the
strain is highly localized. Such bands appear on short time scales and change
on long time scales with finite life times.
