USNO-B1.0 and 2MASS are the most widely used full-sky surveys. However, 2MASS
has no proper motions at all, and USNO-B1.0 published only relative, not
absolute (i.e. on ICRS) proper motions. We performed a new determination of
mean positions and proper motions on the ICRS system by combining USNO-B1.0 and
2MASS astrometry. This catalog is called PPMXL {VO-access to the catalog is
possible via http://vo.uni-hd.de/ppmxl}, and it aims to be complete from the
brightest stars down to about $V \approx 20$ full-sky. PPMXL contains about 900
million objects, some 410 million with 2MASS photometry, and is the largest
collection of ICRS proper motions at present. As representative for the ICRS we
chose PPMX. The recently released UCAC3 could not be used because we found
plate-dependent distortions in its proper motion system north of -20$^\circ$
declination. UCAC3 served as an intermediate system for $\delta \leq
-20^\circ$. The resulting typical individual mean errors of the proper motions
range from 4 mas/y to more than 10 mas/y depending on observational history.
The mean errors of positions at epoch 2000.0 are 80 to 120 mas, if 2MASS
astrometry could be used, 150 to 300 mas else. We also give correction tables
to convert USNO-B1.0 observations of e.g. minor planets to the ICRS system.
