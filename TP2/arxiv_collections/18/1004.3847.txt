In synchrotron Moessbauer spectroscopy, the nuclear exciton polariton
manifests itself in the lineshape of the spectra of nuclear forward scattering
(NFS) Fourier-transformed from time domain to frequency domain. This lineshape
is generally described by the convolution of two intensity factors. One of them
is Lorentzian related to free decay. We derived the expressions for the second
factor related to Frenkel exciton polariton effects at propagation of
synchrotron radiation in Moessbauer media. Parameters of this Frenkelian shape
depend on the spatial configuration of Moessbauer media. In a layer of uniform
thickness, this factor is found to be a simple hypergeometric function. Next,
we consider the particles spread over a 2D surface or diluted in non-Moessbauer
media to exclude an overlap of ray shadows by different particles. Deconvolving
the purely polaritonic component of linewidths is suggested as a simple
procedure sharpening the experimental NFS spectra in frequency domain. The
lineshapes in these sharpened spectra are theoretically expressed via the
parameters of the particle size distributions (PSD). Then, these parameters are
determined through least-squares fitting of the line shapes.
