The orbital magnetic susceptibility (OMS) of a gas of noninteracting massless
Dirac fermions is zero when the Fermi energy is away from the Dirac point.
Making use of diagrammatic perturbation theory, we calculate exactly the OMS of
massless Dirac fermions to first order in the Coulomb interaction demonstrating
that it is finite and positive. Doped graphene sheets are thus unique systems
in which the OMS is completely controlled by many-body effects.
