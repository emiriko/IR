A quantum chain model of many molecule motors is proposed as a mathematical
physics theory on the microscopic modeling of classical force-velocity relation
and tension transients of muscle fibre. We proposed quantum many-particle
Hamiltonian to predict the force-velocity relation for the slow release of
muscle fibre which has no empirical relation yet, it is much more complicate
than hyperbolic relation. Using the same Hamiltonian, we predicted the
mathematical force-velocity relation when the muscle is stimulated by
alternative electric current. The discrepancy between input electric frequency
and the muscle oscillation frequency has a physical understanding by Doppler
effect in this quantum chain model. Further more, we apply quantum physics
phenomena to explore the tension time course of cardiac muscle and insect
flight muscle. Most of the experimental tension transients curves found their
correspondence in the theoretical output of quantum two-level and three-level
model. Mathematically modeling electric stimulus as photons exciting a quantum
three-level particle reproduced most tension transient curves of water bug
Lethocerus Maximus.
