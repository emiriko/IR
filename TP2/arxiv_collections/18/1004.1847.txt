An improved treatment of neutrino oscillations follows when neutrino mass
eigenstates and their associated recoiling particle states are entangled. When
the neutrino and its recoil partner are treated as a single entangled quantum
state the conservation of energy and momentum in neutrino oscillations can be
assured, even in a plane-wave treatment. The oscillation wavelength between the
neutrino and its associated recoil partner emerges as the fundamental
periodicity in this analysis. However, the experimentally determined
oscillation wavelength for neutrinos detected at some distance from a known
source region is still in all cases given by the standard expression in current
use.
