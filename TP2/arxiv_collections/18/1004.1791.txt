A method of lossless data hiding in images using integer wavelet transform
and histogram shifting for gray scale images is proposed. The method shifts
part of the histogram, to create space for embedding the watermark information
bits. The method embeds watermark while maintaining the visual quality well.
The method is completely reversible. The original image and the watermark data
can be recovered without any loss.
