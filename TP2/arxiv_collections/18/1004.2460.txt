One of the main objective of this paper is to relate Beck's conjecture for
k-in-a-row games. The conjecture states that playing on the same board Picker
is better off in a Chooser-Picker game than the second player in the
Maker-Breaker version. It was shown that the 8-in-a-row game is a blocking draw
that is a Breaker win. To give the outcome of 7-, or 6-in-a-row-games is
hopeless, but these games are widely believed to be Breaker's win. If both
conjectures hold, Picker must win the Chooser-Picker version of the 7-in-a-row
game, and that is what we prove.
