In this paper, we try to focus the reader's interest on the problems that
transactional systems have to resolve for taking advantage of commutativity in
a serializable and recoverable way. Our framework is, (as others), based on the
use of conditional commutativity on abstract date types. We present new
features that have not been found in the literature hitherto, that both
increase concurrency and simplify recovery.
