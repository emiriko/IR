Recent theoretical predictions of the lowest very high energy (VHE)
luminosity of SN 1006 are only a factor 5 below the previously published
H.E.S.S. upper limit, thus motivating further in-depth observations of this
source. Deep observations at VHE energies (above 100 GeV) were carried out with
the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) of Cherenkov Telescopes from
2003 to 2008. More than 100 hours of data have been collected and subjected to
an improved analysis procedure. Observations resulted in the detection of VHE
gamma-rays from SN 1006. The measured gamma-ray spectrum is compatible with a
power-law, the flux is of the order of 1% of that detected from the Crab
Nebula, and is thus consistent with the previously established H.E.S.S. upper
limit. The source exhibits a bipolar morphology, which is strongly correlated
with non-thermal X-rays. Because the thickness of the VHE-shell is compatible
with emission from a thin rim, particle acceleration in shock waves is likely
to be the origin of the gamma-ray signal. The measured flux level can be
accounted for by inverse Compton emission, but a mixed scenario that includes
leptonic and hadronic components and takes into account the ambient matter
density inferred from observations also leads to a satisfactory description of
the multi-wavelength spectrum.
