We analyze various perspectives on the elliptic genus of non-compact
supersymmetric coset conformal field theories with central charge larger than
three. We calculate the holomorphic part of the elliptic genus via a free field
description of the model, and show that it agrees with algebraic expectations.
The holomorphic part of the elliptic genus is directly related to an
Appell-Lerch sum and behaves anomalously under modular transformation
properties. We analyze the origin of the anomaly by calculating the elliptic
genus through a path integral in a coset conformal field theory. The path
integral codes both the holomorphic part of the elliptic genus, and a
non-holomorphic remainder that finds its origin in the continuous spectrum of
the non-compact model. The remainder term can be shown to agree with a function
that mathematicians introduced to parameterize the difference between mock
theta functions and Jacobi forms. The holomorphic part of the elliptic genus
thus has a path integral completion which renders it non-holomorphic and
modular.
