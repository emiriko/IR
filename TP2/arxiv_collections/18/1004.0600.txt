We compute the one-point probability distribution function of small-angle
cosmic microwave background temperature fluctuations due to curved cosmic
(super-)strings with a simple model of string network by performing Monte Carlo
simulations. Taking into account of the correlation between the curvature and
the velocity of string segments, there appear non-Gaussian features,
specifically non-Gaussian tails and a skewness, in the one-point pdf. The
obtained sample skewness for the conventional field-theoretic cosmic strings is
$g_1\approx -0.14$, which is consistent with the result reported by Fraisse et
al.. We also discuss the dependence of the pdf on the intercommuting
probability. We find that the standard deviation of the Gaussian part increases
and non-Gaussian features are suppressed as the intercommuting probability
decreases. For sufficiently small intercommuting probability, the skewness is
given by $\lesssim$ (a\ few) $\times 10^{-2}$.
