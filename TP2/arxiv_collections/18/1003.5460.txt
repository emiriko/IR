A Kalman Filter alignment algorithm has been applied to cosmic-ray data. We
discuss the alignment algorithm and an experiment-independent implementation
including outlier rejection and treatment of weakly determined parameters.
Using this implementation, the algorithm has been applied to data recorded with
one CMS silicon tracker endcap. Results are compared to both photogrammetry
measurements and data obtained from a dedicated hardware alignment system, and
good agreement is observed.
