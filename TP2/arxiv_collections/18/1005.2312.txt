On 2009 July 19, we observed a single, large impact on Jupiter at a
planetocentric latitude of 55^{\circ}S. This and the Shoemaker-Levy 9 (SL9)
impacts on Jupiter in 1994 are the only planetary-scale impacts ever observed.
The 2009 impact had an entry trajectory opposite and with a lower incidence
angle than that of SL9. Comparison of the initial aerosol cloud debris
properties, spanning 4,800 km east-west and 2,500 km north-south, with those
produced by the SL9 fragments, and dynamical calculations of pre-impact orbit,
indicate that the impactor was most probably an icy body with a size of 0.5-1
km. The collision rate of events of this magnitude may be five to ten times
more frequent than previously thought. The search for unpredicted impacts, such
as the current one, could be best performed in 890-nm and K (2.03-2.36 {\mu}m)
filters in strong gaseous absorption, where the high-altitude aerosols are more
reflective than Jupiter's primary cloud.
