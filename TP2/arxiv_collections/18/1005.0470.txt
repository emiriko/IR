We derive the black hole mass density as a function of redshift with the
bolometric luminosity function of AGN assuming that massive black holes grew
via accreting the circumnuclear gases, in which the derived black hole mass
density is required to match the measured local black hole mass density at z=0.
ADAFs are supposed to present in low luminosity AGNs/normal galaxies, which are
very hot and radiate mostly in the hard X-ray band. Most of the XRB is
contributed by bright AGNs, and a variety of AGN population synthesis models
were developed to model the observed XRB in the last two decades. Based on our
derived black hole mass density, we calculate the contribution to the XRB from
the ADAFs in faint AGNs/normal galaxies with a given Eddington ratio
distribution, which is mostly in hard X-ray energy band with an energy peak at
~200 keV. The growth of massive black holes during ADAF phase can therefore be
constrained with the observed XRB. Combining an AGN population synthesis model
with our results, we find that the fitting on the observed XRB, especially at
hard X-ray energy band with \ga 100 keV, is improved provided the contribution
of the ADAFs in low luminosity AGNs/normal galaxies is properly included. It is
found that less than ~15 per cent of local massive black hole mass density was
accreted during ADAF phases. We suggest that more accurate measurements of the
XRB in the energy band with \ga 100 keV in the future may help constrain the
growth of massive black holes at their late stage. We also calculate their
contribution to the extragalactic gamma-ray background, and find that less than
~1% of the observed EGRB is contributed by the ADAFs in these faint sources.
