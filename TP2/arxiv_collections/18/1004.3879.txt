Recent observations of sunspot light-bridges have shed new light on the fact
that they are often associated with significant chromospheric activity. In
particular chromospheric jets (Shimizu et al. 2009) persisting over a period of
days have been identifies, sometimes associated with large downflows at the
photospheric level (Louis et al. 2009). One possible explanation for this
activity is reconnection low in the atmosphere. Light-bridges have also been
associated with a constant brightness enhancement in the 1600 angstroms
passband of TRACE, and the heating of 1 MK loops. Using data from EIS, SOT and
STEREO EUVI we investigate the response of the transition region and lower
corona to the presence of a light-bridge and specific periods of chromospheric
activity.
