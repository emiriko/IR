The physics of graphene is acting as a bridge between quantum field theory
and condensed matter physics due to the special quality of the graphene
quasiparticles behaving as massless two dimensional Dirac fermions. Moreover,
the particular structure of the 2D crystal lattice sets the arena to study and
unify concepts from elasticity, topology and cosmology. In this paper we
analyze these connections combining a pedagogical, intuitive approach with a
more rigorous formalism when required.
