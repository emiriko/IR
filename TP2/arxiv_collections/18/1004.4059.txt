It is shown that the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of an axially symmetric
dilaton-axion black hole can be expressed as a Cardy-Verlinde formula. By
utilizing the first order quantum correction in the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy
we find the modified expressions for the Casimir energy and pure extensive
energy. The first order correction to the Cardy-Verlinde formula in the context
of axially symmetric dilaton-axion black hole are obtained with the use of
modified Casimir and pure extensive energies.
