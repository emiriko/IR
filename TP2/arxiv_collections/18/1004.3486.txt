The convergence problem of the Laplace-Beltrami operators plays an essential
role in the convergence analysis of the numerical simulations of some important
geometric partial differential equations which involve the operator. In this
note we present a new effective and convergent algorithm to compute discrete
Laplace-Beltrami operators acting on functions over surfaces. We prove a
convergence theorem for our discretization. To our knowledge, this is the first
convergent algorithm of discrete Laplace-Beltrami operators over surfaces for
functions on general surfaces. Our algorithm is conceptually simple and easy to
compute. Indeed, the convergence rate of our new algorithm of discrete
Laplace-Beltrami operators over surfaces is $O(r)$ where r represents the size
of the mesh of discretization of the surface.
