It has been suggested that moons around transiting exoplanets may cause
observable signal in transit photometry or in the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM)
effect. In this paper a detailed analysis of parameter reconstruction from the
RM effect is presented for various planet-moon configurations, described with
20 parameters. We also demonstrate the benefits of combining photometry with
the RM effect. We simulated 2.7x10^9 configurations of a generic transiting
system to map the confidence region of the parameters of the moon, find the
correlated parameters and determine the validity of reconstructions. The main
conclusion is that the strictest constraints from the RM effect are expected
for the radius of the moon. In some cases there is also meaningful information
on its orbital period. When the transit time of the moon is exactly known, for
example, from transit photometry, the angle parameters of the moon's orbit will
also be constrained from the RM effect. From transit light curves the mass can
be determined, and combining this result with the radius from the RM effect,
the experimental determination of the density of the moon is also possible.
