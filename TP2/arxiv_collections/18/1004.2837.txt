We prove that every topological conjugation between two germs of singular
holomorphic curves in the complex plane is homotopic to another conjugation
which extends homeomorphically to the exceptional divisors of their minimal
desingularizations. As an application we give an explicit presentation of a
finite index subgroup of the mapping class group of the germ of such a
singularity.
