Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) produce characteristic infrared
emission bands that have been observed in a wide range of astrophysical
environments, where carbonaceous material is subjected to ultraviolet (UV)
radiation. Although PAHs are expected to form in carbon-rich AGB stars, they
have up to now only been observed in binary systems where a hot companion
provides a hard radiation field. In this letter, we present low-resolution
infrared spectra of four S-type AGB stars, selected from a sample of 90 S-type
AGB stars observed with the infrared spectrograph aboard the Spitzer satellite.
The spectra of these four stars show the typical infrared features of PAH
molecules. We confirm the correlation between the temperature of the central
star and the centroid wavelength of the 7.9 {\mu}m feature, present in a wide
variety of stars spanning a temperature range from 3 000 to 12 000 K. Three of
four sources presented in this paper extend this relation towards lower
temperatures. We argue that the mixture of hydrocarbons we see in these S-stars
has a rich aliphatic component. The fourth star, BZ CMa, deviates from this
correlation. Based on the similarity with the evolved binary TU Tau, we predict
that BZ CMa has a hot companion as well.
