We present a scheme to generate two-dimensional cluster state efficiently.
The number of the basic gate-entangler-for the operation is in the order of the
entanglement bonds of a cluster state, and could be reduced greatly if one uses
them repeatedly. The scheme is deterministic and uses few ancilla resources and
no quantum memory. It is suitable for large-scale quantum computation and
feasible with the current experimental technology.
