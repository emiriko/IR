Invited talk at the EPS-HEPP meeting in Krakow, July 2009. My first thought,
and presumably the default expectation, was that I'd talk in a general way
about the grandeur of high energy physics and the exciting future we
anticipate, especially with LHC coming on line. But an unfortunate byproduct of
the delays at LHC and the slow pace of other experiments is that I've already
done that sort of thing many times, as have many other conference embellishers,
and the ritual is getting stale. So I'll speed through the litany, and then
indulge myself by advertising some ideas I've been fond of, some for quite a
while, that I think are interesting, promising, and not as well known as they
should be.
