Several recent studies performed on constraints of a fourth generation of
quarks and leptons suffer from the ad-hoc assumption that 3 x 3 unitarity holds
for the first three generations in the neutrino sector. Only under this
assumption one is able to determine the Fermi constant G_F from the muon
lifetime measurement with the claimed precision of G_F = 1.16637 (1) x 10^-5
GeV^-2. We study how well G_F can be extracted within the framework of four
generations from leptonic and radiative mu and tau decays, as well as from K_l3
decays and leptonic decays of charged pions, and we discuss the role of lepton
universality tests in this context. We emphasize that constraints on a fourth
generation from quark and lepton flavour observables and from electroweak
precision observables can only be obtained in a consistent way if these three
sectors are considered simultaneously. In the combined fit to leptonic and
radiative mu and tau decays, K_l3 decays and leptonic decays of charged pions
we find a p-value of 2.6% for the fourth generation matrix element |U_{e 4}|=0
of the neutrino mixing matrix.
