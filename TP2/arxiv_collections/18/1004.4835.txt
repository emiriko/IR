We investigate the behaviour of Bridgeland stability conditions under change
of base field with particular focus on the case of finite Galois extensions. In
particular, we prove that for a variety X over a field K and a finite Galois
extension L/K the stability manifold of X embeds as a closed submanifold into
the stability manifold of the base change variety.
