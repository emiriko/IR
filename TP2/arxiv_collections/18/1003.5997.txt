We investigate characteristics of radio frequency interference (RFI) signals
that can affect the excision potential of some interference mitigation
algorithms. The techniques considered are those that modify signals from
auxiliary reference antennas to model and cancel interference from an
astronomical observation. These techniques can be applied in the time domain,
where the RFI voltage is modeled and subtracted from the astronomy signal path
(adaptive noise canceling), or they can be applied to the autocorrelated and
cross-correlated voltage spectra in the frequency domain (postcorrelation
canceling). For ideal receivers and a single, statistically stationary
interfering signal, both precorrelation and postcorrelation filters can result
in complete cancellation of the interference from the observation. The
postcorrelation method has the advantage of being applied on tens or hundreds
of millisecond timescales rather than tens or hundreds of nanosecond
timescales. However, this can be a disadvantage if the RFI transmitter location
is changing, since the cross-correlated power measurements which link the
interference power in the astronomy and reference signal paths can decorrelate.
If the decorrelation is not too severe, it can be allowed for, at the expense
of a noise increase. The time domain adaptive cancelers are allowed to slightly
vary their internal coefficients and adapt to changing phases during the
integrations, which means that they avoid the decorrelation problem. However,
the freedom to adapt also results in a noise increase. In this paper the
ability of both types of cancelers to excise interference originating from a
moving source is compared. The cancelers perform well on both observed and
simulated data, giving complete cancellation.
