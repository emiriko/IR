Using a 3D GCM, we create dynamical model atmospheres of a representative
transiting giant exoplanet, HD 209458b. We post-process these atmospheres with
an opacity code to obtain transit radius spectra during the primary transit.
Using a spectral atmosphere code, we integrate over the face of the planet seen
by an observer at various orbital phases and calculate light curves as a
function of wavelength and for different photometric bands. The products of
this study are generic predictions for the phase variations of a
zero-eccentricity giant planet's transit spectrum and of its light curves. We
find that for these models the temporal variations in all quantities and the
ingress/egress contrasts in the transit radii are small ($< 1.0$\%). Moreover,
we determine that the day/night contrasts and phase shifts of the brightness
peaks relative to the ephemeris are functions of photometric band. The $J$,
$H$, and $K$ bands are shifted most, while the IRAC bands are shifted least.
Therefore, we verify that the magnitude of the downwind shift in the planetary
``hot spot" due to equatorial winds is strongly wavelength-dependent. The phase
and wavelength dependence of light curves, and the associated day/night
contrasts, can be used to constrain the circulation regime of irradiated giant
planets and to probe different pressure levels of a hot Jupiter atmosphere. We
posit that though our calculations focus on models of HD 209458b similar
calculations for other transiting hot Jupiters in low-eccentricity orbits
should yield transit spectra and light curves of a similar character.
