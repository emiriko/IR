We discuss the potential and limitations of Gaussian cluster states for
measurement-based quantum computing. Using a framework of Gaussian projected
entangled pair states (GPEPS), we show that no matter what Gaussian local
measurements are performed on systems distributed on a general graph, transport
and processing of quantum information is not possible beyond a certain
influence region, except for exponentially suppressed corrections. We also
demonstrate that even under arbitrary non-Gaussian local measurements, slabs of
Gaussian cluster states of a finite width cannot carry logical quantum
information, even if sophisticated encodings of qubits in continuous-variable
(CV) systems are allowed for. This is proven by suitably contracting tensor
networks representing infinite-dimensional quantum systems. The result can be
seen as sharpening the requirements for quantum error correction and fault
tolerance for Gaussian cluster states, and points towards the necessity of
non-Gaussian resource states for measurement-based quantum computing. The
results can equally be viewed as referring to Gaussian quantum repeater
networks.
