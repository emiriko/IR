We analyze the applicability of the Rosenfeld entropy scaling relations to
the systems with the core-softened potentials demonstrating the water-like
anomalies. It is shown that the validity of the of Rosenfeld scaling relation
for the diffusion coefficient depends on the thermodynamic path which is used
for the calculations of the kinetic coefficients and the excess entropy. In
particular, it is valid along isochors, but it breaks down along isotherms.
