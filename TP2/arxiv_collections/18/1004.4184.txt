This paper describes a numerical experiment, based on full micromagnetic
simulations of current-driven magnetization dynamics in nanoscale spin valves,
to identify the origins of spectral linewidth broadening in spin torque
oscillators. Our numerical results show two qualitatively different regimes of
magnetization dynamics at zero temperature: regular (single-mode precessional
dynamics) and chaotic. In the regular regime, the dependence of the oscillator
integrated power on frequency is linear, and consequently the dynamics is well
described by the analytical theory of current-driven magnetization dynamics for
moderate amplitudes of oscillations. We observe that for higher oscillator
amplitudes, the functional dependence of the oscillator integrated power as a
function of frequency is not a single-valued function and can be described
numerically via introduction of nonlinear oscillator power. For a range of
currents in the regular regime, the oscillator spectral linewidth is a linear
function of temperature. In the chaotic regime found at large current values,
the linewidth is not described by the analytical theory. In this regime we
observe the oscillator linewidth broadening, which originates from sudden jumps
of frequency of the oscillator arising from random domain wall nucleation and
propagation through the sample. This intermittent behavior is revealed through
a wavelet analysis that gives superior description of the frequency jumps
compared to several other techniques.
