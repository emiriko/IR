From hydro-gravitational-dynamics theory HGD, gravitational structure
formation begins 30,000 years (10^12 s) after the turbulent big bang by
viscous-gravitational fragmentation into super-cluster-voids and 10^46 kg
proto-galaxy-super-clusters. Linear and spiral gas-proto-galaxies GPGs are the
smallest fragments to emerge from the plasma epoch at decoupling at 10^13 s
with Nomura turbulence morphology and length scale L_N ~ (\gamma \nu / \rho
G)^1/2 ~10^20 m, determined by rate-of-strain \gamma, photon viscosity \nu, and
density \rho of the plasma fossilized at 10^12 s. GPGs fragment into 10^36 kg
proto-globular-star-cluster PGC clumps of 10^24 kg primordial-fog-particle PFP
dark matter planets. All stars form from planet mergers, with ~97% unmerged as
galaxy baryonic-dark-matter BDM. The non-baryonic-dark-matter NBDM is so weakly
collisional it diffuses to form galaxy cluster halos. It does not guide galaxy
formation, contrary to conventional cold-dark-matter hierarchical clustering
CDMHC theory (\Gamma=0). NBDM has ~97% of the mass of the universe. It binds
rotating clusters of galaxies by gravitational forces. The galaxy rotational
spin axis matches that for low wavenumber spherical harmonic components of CMB
temperature anomalies and extends to 4.5x10^25 m (1.5 Gpc) in quasar
polarization vectors, requiring a big bang turbulence origin. GPGs stick
together by frictional processes of the frozen gas planets, just as PGCs have
been meta-stable for the 13.7 Gyr age of the universe.
