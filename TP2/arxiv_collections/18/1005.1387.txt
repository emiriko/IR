Lie symmetries of various geometrical and physical quantities in general
relativity play an important role in understanding the curvature structure of
manifolds. The Riemann curvature and Weyl tensors are two fourth-rank tensors
in the theory. Interrelations between the symmetries of these two tensors
(known as collineations) are studied. Some illustrative examples are also
provided.
