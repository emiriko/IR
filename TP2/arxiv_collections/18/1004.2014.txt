We derive for applications to isolated systems - on the scale of the Solar
System - the first relativistic terms in the $1/c$ expansion of the space time
metric $g_{\mu\nu}$ for metric $f(R)$ gravity theories, where $f$ is assumed to
be analytic at $R=0$. For our purpose it suffices to take into account up to
quadratic terms in the expansion of $f(R)$, thus we can approximate $f(R) = R +
aR^2$ with a positive dimensional parameter $a$. In the non-relativistic limit,
we get an additional Yukawa correction with coupling strength $G/3$ and Compton
wave length $\sqrt{6a}$ to the Newtonian potential, which is a known result in
the literature. As an application, we derive to the same order the correction
to the geodetic precession of a gyroscope in a gravitational field and the
precession of binary pulsars. The result of the Gravity Probe B experiment
yields the limit $a \lesssim 5 \times 10^{11} \, \mathrm{m}^2$, whereas for the
pulsar B in the PSR J0737-3039 system we get a bound which is about $10^4$
times larger. On the other hand the E\"ot-Wash experiment provides the best
laboratory bound $a \lesssim 10^{-10} \, \mathrm{m}^2$. Although the former
bounds from geodesic precession are much larger than the laboratory ones, they
are still meaningful in the case some type of chameleon effect is present and
thus the effective values could be different at different length scales.
