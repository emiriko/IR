The Dickman function F(alpha) gives the asymptotic probability that a large
integer N has no prime divisor exceeding N^alpha. It is given by a finite sum
of generalized polylogarithms defined by the exquisite recursion L_k(alpha)=-
int_alpha^{1/k} dx L_{k-1}(x/(1-x))/x with L_0(alpha)=1. The behaviour of these
Dickman polylogarithms as alpha tends to 0 defines an intriguing series of
constants, C_k. I conjecture that exp(gamma z)/Gamma(1-z) is the generating
function for sum_{k\ge0} C_k z^k. I obtain high-precision evaluations of
F(1/k), for integers k<11, and compare the Dickman problem with problems in
condensed matter physics and quantum field theory.
