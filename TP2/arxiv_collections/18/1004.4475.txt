I show that whenever a system undergoes a reproducible macroscopic process
the mutual distinguishability of macrostates, as measured by their relative
entropy, diminishes. This extends the second law which regards only ordinary
entropies, and hence only the distinguishability between macrostates and one
specific reference state (equidistribution). The new result holds regardless of
whether the process is linear or nonlinear. Its proof hinges on the
monotonicity of quantum relative entropy under arbitrary coarse grainings, even
those that cannot be represented by completely positive maps.
