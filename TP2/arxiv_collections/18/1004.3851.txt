In this paper, we study a macroscopic system of electrically interacting
metallic beads organized as a sequence along an annulus. A random mechanical
shaking mimics the thermal excitation. We exhibit non Fickian diffusion (Single
File Diffusion) at large time. We measure the mobility of the particles, and
compare it to theoretical expectations. We show that our system cannot be
accurately described by theories assuming only hard sphere interactions. Its
behavior is qualitatively described by a theory extended to more realistic
potentials [Kollmann, PRL {\bf 90} 180602, (2003)]. A correct quantitative
agreement is shown, and we interpret the discrepancies by the violation of a
key assumption of the theory, that of overdamped dynamics. We recast previous
results on colloids with known interaction potentials, and compare them
quantitatively to the theory. Focusing on the transition between ordinary and
single file diffusion, we exhibit a dimensionless crossover time that is of
order one both for colloids and our system, although the time and length scales
differ by several orders of magnitude.
