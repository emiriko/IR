NGC 1316 is a giant, elliptical galaxy containing a complex network of dark,
dust features. The morphology of these features has been examined in some
detail using a Hubble Space Telescope, Advanced Camera for Surveys image. It is
found that most of the features are constituted of long filaments. There also
exist a great number of dark structures protruding inwards from the filaments.
Many of these structures are strikingly similar to elephant trunks in H II
regions in the Milky Way Galaxy, although much larger. The structures, termed
mammoth trunks, generally are filamentary and often have shapes resembling the
letters V or Y. In some of the mammoth trunks the stem of the Y can be resolved
into two or more filaments, many of which showing signs of being intertwined. A
model of the mammoth trunks, related to a recent theory of elephant trunks, is
proposed. Based on magnetized filaments, the model is capable of giving an
account of the various shapes of the mammoth trunks observed, including the
twined structures.
