Atomic ensembles have many potential applications in quantum information
science. Owing to collective enhancement, working with ensembles at high
densities increases the overall efficiency of quantum operations, but at the
same time also increases the collision rate and leads to faster decoherence.
Here we report on experiments with optically trapped 87Rb atoms demonstrating a
20-fold increase of the coherence time when a dynamical decoupling sequence
with more than 200 pi-pulses is applied. We perform quantum process tomography
and demonstrate that using the decoupling scheme a dense ensemble with an
optical depth of 230 can be used as an atomic memory with coherence times
exceeding 3 sec.
