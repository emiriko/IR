This paper presents the overall design of a multi-agent framework for tuning
the performance of an application executing in a distributed environment. The
multi-agent framework provides services like resource brokering, analyzing
performance monitoring data, local tuning and also rescheduling in case of any
performance problem on a specific resource provider. The paper also briefly
describes the implementation of some part of the framework. In particular, job
migration on the basis of performance monitoring data is particularly
highlighted in this paper.
