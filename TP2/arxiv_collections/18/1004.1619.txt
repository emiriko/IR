The most important characteristic of {\em multiplicative noise} is that its
effects of system's dynamics depends on the recent system's state.
Consideration of multiplicative noise on self-referential systems including
biological and economical systems therefore is of importance. In this note we
study an elementary example. While in a deterministic super critical pitchfork
bifurcation with positive bifurcation parameter $\lambda$ the positive branch
$\sqrt{\lambda}$ is stable, multiplicative white noise $\lambda_t ={\lambda} +
\sigma \zeta_t$ on the unique parameter reduces stability in that the system's
state tends to 0 almost surely, even for ${\lambda}>0$, while for 'small' noise
$\sigma < \sqrt{2 \lambda}$ the point $\sqrt{\lambda-\sigma^2/2}$ is a
meta-stable state. In this case, correspondingly, the system will 'die out',
i.e. $X_t \to 0$ within finite time.
