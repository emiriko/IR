Simple type theory is suited as framework for combining classical and
non-classical logics. This claim is based on the observation that various
prominent logics, including (quantified) multimodal logics and intuitionistic
logics, can be elegantly embedded in simple type theory. Furthermore, simple
type theory is sufficiently expressive to model combinations of embedded logics
and it has a well understood semantics. Off-the-shelf reasoning systems for
simple type theory exist that can be uniformly employed for reasoning within
and about combinations of logics.
