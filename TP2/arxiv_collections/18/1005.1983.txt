The astrophysical S-factor of p2H radiative capture in the energy range down
to 1 keV is considered in the potential cluster model with the classification
of orbital states according to Young's scheme symmetry. It is shown that the
approach used, which takes into account E1 transition only, gives a good
description of the new experimental data for two potentials of the bound state
of 3He nucleus and leads to the value S=1.35(5) \cdot 10-4 keVb and
1.65(5)\cdot 10-4 keVb.
