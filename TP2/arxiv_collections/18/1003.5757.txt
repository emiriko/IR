During its second Antarctic flight, the CREAM (Cosmic Ray Energetics And
Mass) balloon experiment collected data for 28 days, measuring the charge and
the energy of cosmic rays (CR) with a redundant system of particle
identification and an imaging thin ionization calorimeter. Preliminary direct
measurements of the absolute intensities of individual CR nuclei are reported
in the elemental range from carbon to iron at very high energy.
