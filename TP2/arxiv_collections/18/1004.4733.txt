Despite the recent upsurge of theoretical reduced models for vesicle shape
dynamics, comparisons with experiments have not been accomplished. We review
the implications of some of the recently proposed models for vesicle dynamics,
especially the Tumbling-Trembling domain regions of the phase plane and show
that they all fail to capture the essential behavior of real vesicles for
excess areas, \Delta, greater than 0.4. We emphasize new observations of shape
harmonics and the role of thermal fluctuations.
