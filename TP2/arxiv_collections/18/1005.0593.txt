This study explores atomic and molecular adsorption on a number of early
transition-metal carbides (TMC's) by means of density-functional theory
calculations. Trend studies are conducted with respect to both period and group
in the periodic table, choosing the substrates ScC, TiC, VC, ZrC, NbC,
delta-MoC, TaC, and WC and the adsorbates H, B, C, N, O, F, NH, NH2, and NH3.
Trends in adsorption strength are explained in terms of surface electronic
factors, by correlating the calculated adsorption energy values with the
calculated surface electronic structures. The results are rationalized with use
of a concerted-coupling model (CCM), which has previously been applied
succesfully to the description of adsorption on TiC(111) and TiN(111) surfaces
[Solid State Commun. 141, 48 (2007)]. First, the clean TMC(111) surfaces are
characterized by calculating surface energies, surface relaxations, Bader
charges, and surface-localized densities of states (DOS's). Detailed
comparisons between surface and bulk DOS's reveal the existence of
transition-metal localized SR's (TMSR's) in the pseudogap and of several
C-localized SR's (CSR's) in the upper valence band on all considered TMC(111)
surfaces. Then, atomic and molecular adsorption energies, geometries, and
charge transfers are presented. An analysis of the adsorbate-induced changes in
surface DOS's reveals a presence of both adsorbate--TMSR and adsorbate--CSR's
interactions, of varying strengths depending on the surface and the adsorbate.
These variations are correlated to the variations in adsorption energies. The
results are used to generalize the content and applications of the previously
proposed CCM to this larger class of substrates and adsorbates. Implications
for other classes of materials, for catalysis, and for other surface processes
are discussed.
