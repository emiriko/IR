It was recently suggested that quantum field theory is not fundamental but
emerges from the loss of phase space information about matter crossing causal
horizons. Possible connections between this formalism and Verlinde's entropic
gravity and Jacobson's thermodynamic gravity are proposed.
  The holographic screen in Verlinde's formalism can be identified as local
Rindler horizons and its entropy as that of the bulk fields beyond the
horizons.
  This naturally resolves some issues on entropic gravity.
  The quantum fluctuation of the fields is the origin of the thermodynamic
nature of entropic gravity.
  It is also suggested that inertia is related to dragging
  Rindler horizons.
