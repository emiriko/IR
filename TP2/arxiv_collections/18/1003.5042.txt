In this paper we introduce the concept of dynamic link pages. A web site/page
contains a number of links to other pages. All the links are not equally
important. Few links are more frequently visited and few rarely visited. In
this scenario, identifying the frequently used links and placing them in the
top left corner of the page will increase the user's satisfaction. This process
will reduce the time spent by a visitor on the page, as most of the times, the
popular links are presented in the visible part of the screen itself. Also, a
site can be indexed based on the popular links in that page. This will increase
the efficiency of the retrieval system. We presented a model to display the
popular links, and also proposed a method to increase the quality of retrieval
system.
