We address the problem if the early thermalization and HBT puzzles in
relativistic heavy-ion collisions may be solved by the assumption that the
early dynamics of the produced matter is locally anisotropic. The hybrid model
describing the purely transverse hydrodynamic evolution followed by the
perfect-fluid hydrodynamic stage is constructed. The transition from the
transverse to perfect-fluid hydrodynamics is described by the Landau matching
conditions applied at a fixed proper time. The global fit to the RHIC data
reproduces the soft hadronic observables (the pion, kaon, and the proton
spectra, the pion and kaon elliptic flow, and the pion HBT radii) with the
accuracy of about 20%. These results indicate that the assumption of the very
fast thermalization may be relaxed. In addition, the presented model suggests
that a large part of the inconsistencies between the theoretical and
experimental HBT results may be removed.
