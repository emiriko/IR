In this paper, a novel data hiding technique is proposed, as an improvement
over the Fibonacci LSB data-hiding technique proposed by Battisti et al. First
we mathematically model and generalize our approach. Then we propose our novel
technique, based on decomposition of a number (pixel-value) in sum of prime
numbers. The particular representation generates a different set of (virtual)
bit-planes altogether, suitable for embedding purposes. They not only allow one
to embed secret message in higher bit-planes but also do it without much
distortion, with a much better stego-image quality, and in a reliable and
secured manner, guaranteeing efficient retrieval of secret message. A
comparative performance study between the classical Least Significant Bit
(LSB)method, the Fibonacci LSB data-hiding technique and our proposed schemes
has been done. Analysis indicates that image quality of the stego-image hidden
by the technique using Fibonacci decomposition improves against that using
simple LSB substitution method, while the same using the prime decomposition
method improves drastically against that using Fibonacci decomposition
technique. Experimental results show that, the stego-image is visually
indistinguishable from the original cover-image.
