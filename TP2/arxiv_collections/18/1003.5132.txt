We discuss N_2-dominated leptogenesis in the presence of flavour dependent
effects that have hitherto been neglected, in particular the off-diagonal
entries of the flavour coupling matrix that connects the total flavour
asymmetries, distributed in different particle species, to the lepton and Higgs
doublet asymmetries. We derive analytical formulae for the final asymmetry
including the flavour coupling at the N_2-decay stage as well as at the stage
of washout by the lightest right-handed neutrino N_1. Moreover, we point out
that in general part of the electron and muon asymmetries (phantom terms), can
completely escape the wash-out at the production and a total B-L asymmetry can
be generated by the lightest RH neutrino wash-out yielding so called phantom
leptogenesis. However, the phantom terms are proportional to the initial N_2
abundance and in particular they vanish for initial zero N_2-abundance. Taking
any of these new effects into account can significantly modify the final
asymmetry produced by the decays of the next-to-lightest RH neutrinos, opening
up new interesting possibilities for N_2-dominated thermal leptogenesis.
