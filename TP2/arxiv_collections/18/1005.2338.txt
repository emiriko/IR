The Tevatron, with $p\bar{p}$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=$1.96 TeV, can produce
all flavors of $B$ hadrons and allows for unprecedented studies in the $B$
physics sector. These range from measurements of $B$ hadron properties to
searches of new physics signatures. The CDF and D0 detectors currently have
more than 7 fb$^{-1}$ of data recorded. This paper presents a selection of
recent results on lifetimes and flavor changing neutral currents using between
4.3--5.0 fb$^{-1}$ of data.
