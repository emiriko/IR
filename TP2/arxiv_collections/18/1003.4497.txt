Results of recent EMC effect measurements and nuclear scaling measurements
have both been attributed to local nuclear density effects and not properties
of the bulk nuclear system. This lead us to the phenomenological observation
that the ratio of the slopes in the 0.3 < x_B < 0.7 EMC data scale as the ratio
of the x_B > 1 nuclear scaling plateaus. Using this correlation, we developed a
phenomenological relation which reproduces the general trends and features of
the EMC effect for nuclei from 3He to 56Fe.
