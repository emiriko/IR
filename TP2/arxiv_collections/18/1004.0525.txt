A phenomenological framework is presented for incorporating quantum gravity
motivated corrections into the dynamics of spherically symmetric collapse. The
effective equations are derived from a variational principle that guarantees
energy conservation and the existence of a Birkhoff theorem. The gravitational
potential can be chosen as a function of the areal radius to yield specific
non-singular static spherically symmetric solutions that generically have two
horizons. For a specific choice of potential the effective stress energy tensor
violates only the dominant energy condition. The violations are maximum near
the inner horizon and die off rapidly. A numerical study of the quantum
corrected collapse of a spherically symmetric scalar field in this case reveals
that the modified gravitational potential prevents the formation of a central
singularity and ultimately yields a static, mostly vacuum, spacetime with two
horizons. The matter "piles up" on the inner horizon giving rise to mass
inflation at late times. The Cauchy horizon is transformed into a null, weak
singularity, but in contrast to Einstein gravity, the absence of a central
singularity renders this null singularity stable.
