In these lectures I will give an introduction to Feynman integrals. In the
first part of the course I review the basics of the perturbative expansion in
quantum field theories. In the second part of the course I will discuss more
advanced topics: Mathematical aspects of loop integrals related to periods,
shuffle algebras and multiple polylogarithms are covered as well as practical
algorithms for evaluating Feynman integrals.
