We have fabricated a single Cooper-pair box (SCB) together with an on-chip
lumped element resonator. By utilizing the quantum capacitance of the SCB, its
state can be read out by detecting the phase of a radio-frequency (rf) signal
reflected off the resonator. The resonator was optimized for fast readout. By
studying quasiparticle tunneling events in the SCB, we have characterized the
performance of the readout and found that we can perform a single shot parity
measurement in approximately 50 ns. This is an order of magnitude faster than
previously reported measurements.
