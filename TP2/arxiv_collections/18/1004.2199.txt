The original idea of quantum optical spring arises from the requirement of
quantization of the frequency of oscillations in Hamiltonian of harmonic
oscillator. This purpose is achieved by considering a spring whose constant
(and so its frequency) depends on the quantum states of another system.
Recently, it is realized that by the assumption of frequency modulation of
$\omega$ to $\omega\sqrt{1+\mu a^\dagger a}$ the mentioned idea can be
established. In the present paper we generalize the approach of quantum optical
spring (has been called by us as nonlinear quantum optical spring) with
attention to the {\it dependence of frequency to the intensity of radiation
field} that {\it naturally} observed in nonlinear coherent states. Then, after
the introduction of the generalized Hamiltonian of nonlinear quantum optical
spring and it's solution, we will investigate the nonclassical properties of
the obtained states. Specially, typical collapse and revival in the
distribution functions and squeezing parameters as particular quantum features
will be revealed.
