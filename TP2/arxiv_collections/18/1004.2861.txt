Mid-IR emission lines of H2 are useful probes to determine the mass of warm
gas present in the surface layers of disks. Numerous observations of Herbig
Ae/Be stars (HAeBes) have been performed, but only 2 detections of mid-IR H2
toward HD97048 and AB Aur have been reported. We aim at tracing the warm gas in
the disks of 5 HAeBes with gas-rich environments and physical characteristics
close to those of AB Aur and HD97048, to discuss whether the detections toward
these 2 objects are suggestive of peculiar conditions for the gas. We search
for the H2 S(1) emission line at 17.035 \mu\m with VISIR, and complemented by
CH molecule observations with UVES. We gather the H2 measurements from the
literature to put the new results in context and search for a correlation with
some disk properties. None of the 5 VISIR targets shows evidence for H2
emission. From the 3sigma upper limits on the integrated line fluxes we
constrain the amount of optically thin warm gas to be less than 1.4 M_Jup in
the disk surface layers. There are now 20 HAeBes observed with VISIR and TEXES
instruments to search for warm H2, but only two detections (HD97048 and AB Aur)
were made so far. We find that the two stars with detected warm H2 show at the
same time high 30/13 \mu\m flux ratios and large PAH line fluxes at 8.6 and
11.3 \mu\m compared to the bulk of observed HAeBes and have emission CO lines
detected at 4.7 \mu\m. We detect the CH 4300.3A absorption line toward both
HD97048 and AB Aur with UVES. The CH to H2 abundance ratios that this would
imply if it were to arise from the same component as well as the radial
velocity of the CH lines both suggest that CH arises from a surrounding
envelope, while the detected H2 would reside in the disk. The two detections of
the S(1) line in the disks of HD97048 and AB Aur suggest either peculiar
physical conditions or a particular stage of evolution.
