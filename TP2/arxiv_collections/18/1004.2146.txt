A space-filling, low blockage fractal grid is used as a novel turbulence
generator in a premixed turbulent combustion experiment. In contrast to the
power law decay of a standard turbulence grid, the downstream turbulence
intensity of the fractal grid increases until it reaches a peak at some
distance from the grid before it finally decays. The effective mesh size and
the solidity are the same as those of a standard square mesh grid with which it
is compared. It is found that, for the same flow rate and stoichiometry, the
fractal generated turbulence enhances the burning rate and causes the flame to
further increase its area. Using a flame fractal model, an attempt is made to
highlight differences between the flames established at the two different
turbulent fields.
