The Hermitian matrix model with general linear symmetry is argued to decouple
into a finite unitary matrix model that contains metastable multidimensional
lattice configurations and a fermion determinant. The simplest metastable state
is a Hermitian Weyl kinetic operator of either handedness on a 3+1 D lattice
with general nonlocal interactions. The Hermiticity produces 16 effective Weyl
fermions by species doubling, 8 left- and 8 right-handed. These are identified
with a Standard Model generation. Only local non-anomalous gauge fields within
the soup of general fluctuations can survive at long distances, and the degrees
of freedom for gauge field subgroups of $U(8)_L X U(8)_R$ are present. Standard
Model gauge symmetries associate with particular species symmetries, for
example change of QCD color associates with permutation of doubling status
amongst space directions. Vierbein gravity is probably also generated. While
fundamental Higgs fields are not possible, low fermion current masses can arise
from chiral symmetry breaking solutions of the fermion self-energy
Schwinger-Dyson equations, generating W mass and composite Higgs states,
similar to a scheme proposed by Gribov. Specific higher dimensional lattices
with larger spinors are potentially stable but produce non-Riemannian spaces
without conserved quadratic distances. However if the extra dimensions are
compactified, the Minowski space persists at low energy accompanied by SM
generations, potentially doubled further by duplicate zero modes in the compact
directions and potentially containing dark matter. The model is conjectured to
have an origin in infinite dimensional conformal invariance and the concept of
Bare Particulars.
