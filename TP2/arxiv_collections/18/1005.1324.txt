We identify universal quasiconformal (walking) behaviour in non-Abelian gauge
field theories based on the mass-dependent all-order beta-function introduced
in arXiv:0908.1364. We find different types of walking behaviour in the
presence of (partially) massive species. We employ our findings to the
construction of candidate theories for dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking
by walking technicolour.
