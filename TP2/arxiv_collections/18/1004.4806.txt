Linear Finite State Machines (LFSMs) are particular primitives widely used in
information theory, coding theory and cryptography. Among those linear
automata, a particular case of study is Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs)
used in many cryptographic applications such as design of stream ciphers or
pseudo-random generation. LFSRs could be seen as particular LFSMs without
inputs.
  In this paper, we first recall the description of LFSMs using traditional
matrices representation. Then, we introduce a new matrices representation with
polynomial fractional coefficients. This new representation leads to sparse
representations and implementations. As direct applications, we focus our work
on the Windmill LFSRs case, used for example in the E0 stream cipher and on
other general applications that use this new representation.
  In a second part, a new design criterion called diffusion delay for LFSRs is
introduced and well compared with existing related notions. This criterion
represents the diffusion capacity of an LFSR. Thus, using the matrices
representation, we present a new algorithm to randomly pick LFSRs with good
properties (including the new one) and sparse descriptions dedicated to
hardware and software designs. We present some examples of LFSRs generated
using our algorithm to show the relevance of our approach.
