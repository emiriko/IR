By assuming an appropriate energy composition law between two systems
governed by the same non-extensive entropy, we revisit the definitions of
temperature and pressure, arising from the zeroth principle of thermodynamics,
in a manner consistent with the thermostatistics structure of the theory. We
show that the definitions of these quantities are sensitive to the composition
law of entropy and internal energy governing the system. In this way, we can
clarify some questions raised about the possible introduction of intensive
variables in the context of non-extensive statistical mechanics.
