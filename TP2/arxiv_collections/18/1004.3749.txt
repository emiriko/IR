In galaxy clusters the entropy distribution of the IntraCluster Plasma
modulates the latter's equilibrium within the Dark Matter gravitational wells,
as rendered by our Supermodel. We argue the entropy production at the boundary
shocks to be reduced or terminated as the accretion rates of DM and
intergalactic gas peter out; this behavior is enforced by the slowdown in the
outskirt development at late times, when the Dark Energy dominates the
cosmology while the outer wings of the initial perturbation drive the growth.
In such conditions, we predict the ICP temperature profiles to steepen into the
cluster outskirts. The detailed expectations from our simple formalism agree
with the X-ray data concerning five clusters whose temperature profiles have
been recently measured out to the virial radius. We predict steep temperature
declines to prevail in clusters at low redshift, tempered only by rich environs
including adjacent filamentary structures.
