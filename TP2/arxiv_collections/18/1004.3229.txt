This anniversary paper is an occasion to recall some of the events that
shaped institutional econophysics. But in these thoughts about the evolution of
econophysics in the last 15 years we also express some concerns. Our main worry
concerns the relinquishment of the simplicity requirement. Ever since the
groundbreaking experiments of Galileo some three centuries ago, the great
successes of physicists were largely due to the fact that they were able to
decompose complex phenomena into simpler ones. Remember that the first
observation of the effects of an electrical current was made by Alessandro
Volta (1745-1827) on the leg of a frog! Clearly, to make sense this observation
had to be broken down into several separate effects. Nowadays, with computers
being able to handle huge amounts of data and to simulate any stochastic
process no matter how complicated, there is no longer any real need for such a
search for simplicity. Why should one spend time and effort trying to break up
complicated phenomena when it is possible to handle them globally? On this new
road there are several stumbling blocks, however. Do such global mathematical
descriptions lead to a real understanding? Do they produce building blocks
which can be used elsewhere and thus make our knowledge and comprehension to
grow in a cumulative way? Should econophysics also adopt the "globalized"
perspective that has been endorsed, developed and spread by the numerous
"Complexity Departments" which sprang up during the last decade?
