We report on the observation of a new spin mode in a quantum Hall system in
the vicinity of odd electron filling factors under experimental conditions
excluding the possibility of Skyrmion excitations. The new mode having
presumably zero energy at odd filling factors emerges at small deviations from
odd filling factors and couples to the spin-exciton. The existence of an extra
spin mode assumes a nontrivial magnetic order at partial fillings of Landau
levels surrounding quantum Hall ferromagnets other then the Skyrmion crystal.
