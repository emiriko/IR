Greaves (2006) proposed that three red, high proper motion stars within 10
degrees of 51 Peg (NLTT 54007, 54064, & 55547) are co-moving companions to this
famous exoplanet host star. While the stars clearly have proper motions similar
to 51 Peg, the inferred kinematic parallaxes for these stars produce extremely
inconsistent color-magnitude positions 2 to 4 magnitudes below the main
sequence. All three stars are likely to be background stars unrelated to 51
Peg.
