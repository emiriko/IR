Here, we present numerical simulations of magnetic flux buoyantly rising from
a granular convection zone into the low corona. We study the complex
interaction of the magnetic field with the turbulent plasma. The model includes
the radiative loss terms, non-ideal equations of state, and empirical corona
heating. We find that the convection plays a crucial role in shaping the
morphology and evolution of the emerging structure. The emergence of magnetic
fields can disrupt the convection pattern as the field strength increases, and
form an ephemeral region-like structure, while weak magnetic flux emerges and
quickly becomes concentrated in the intergranular lanes, i.e. downflow regions.
As the flux rises, a coherent shear pattern in the low corona is observed in
the simulation. In the photosphere, both magnetic shearing and velocity
shearing occur at a very sharp polarity inversion line (PIL). In a case of
U-loop magnetic field structure, the field above the surface is highly sheared
while below it is relaxed.
