We have revisited glueball mixing with the pseudoscalar mesons in the MIT bag
model scheme. The calculation has been performed in the spherical cavity
approximation to the bag using two different fermion propagators, the cavity
and the free propagators. We obtain a very small probability of mixing for the
eta at the level of $0.04-0.1% and a bigger for the eta' at the level of 4-12%.
Our results differ from previous calculations in the same scheme but seem to
agree with the experimental analysis. We discuss the origin of our difference
which stems from the treatment of our time integrations.
