In the context of Large Extra Dimensions the fundamental Planck scale can be
as low as the TeV scale. If this is the way of nature, quantum gravity effects
could be visible at the LHC or other High energy colliders. A model independent
signal is given by elastic scattering at small angles and transplanckian
energy, which can be computed in the eikonal approximation. It is interesting
both from a phenomenological and a theoretical point of view to study the
corrections to this process due to the QCD radiation. To include it, we
generalize a shock-wave method proposed by 't Hooft, so that we are able to
obtain the amplitude at first order in the gauge interaction but resummed to
all orders in gravity. From this result we can learn many interesting things,
for example we can extract the true scale of the process which agrees with an
earlier guess of Emparan, Masip and Rattazzi. The problem of radiation in
transplanckian scattering is briefly introduced, we then report and comment the
recent results and mention the perspectives for the near future.
