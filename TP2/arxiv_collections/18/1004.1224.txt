The Personality and emotions are effective parameters in learning process.
Thus, virtual learning environments should pay attention to these parameters.
In this paper, a new e-learning model is designed and implemented according to
these parameters. The Virtual learning environment that is presented here uses
two agents: Virtual Tutor Agent (VTA), and Virtual Classmate Agent (VCA).
During the learning process and depending on events happening in the
environment, learner's emotions are changed. In this situation, learning style
should be revised according to the personality traits as well as the learner's
current emotions. VTA selects suitable learning style for the learners based on
their personality traits. To improve the learning process, the system uses VCA
in some of the learning steps. VCA is an intelligent agent and has its own
personality. It is designed so that it can present an attractive and real
learning environment in interaction with the learner. To recognize the
learner's personality, this system uses MBTI test and to obtain emotion values
uses OCC model. Finally, the results of system tested in real environments show
that considering the human features in interaction with the learner increases
learning quality and satisfies the learner.
