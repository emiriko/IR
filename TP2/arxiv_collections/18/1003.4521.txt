Nonleptonic two body B decays including radially excited $\pi(1300)$ or
$\rho(1450)$ mesons in the final state are studied using the framework of
generalized naive factorization approach. Branching ratios and CP asymmetries
of $B\to P\pi(1300)$, $B\to V\pi(1300)$, $B\to P\rho(1450)$ and $B\to
V\rho(1450)$ decays are calculated, where P and V stand for pseudoscalar and
vector charmless mesons. Form factors for $B\to \pi(1300)$ and $B\to
\rho(1450)$ transitions are estimated in the improved version of the
Isgur-Scora-Grinstein-Wise quark model. In some processes, CP asymmetries of
more than 10% and branching ratios of $10^{-5}$ order are found, which could be
reached in experiments.
