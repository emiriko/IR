We describe a tool to create, edit, visualise and compute with interaction
nets - a form of graph rewriting systems. The editor, called GraphPaper, allows
users to create and edit graphs and their transformation rules using an
intuitive user interface. The editor uses the functionalities of the TULIP
system, which gives us access to a wealth of visualisation algorithms.
Interaction nets are not only a formalism for the specification of graphs, but
also a rewrite-based computation model. We discuss graph rewriting strategies
and a language to express them in order to perform strategic interaction net
rewriting.
