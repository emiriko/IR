In this first paper on the results of our Herschel PACS survey of local
Ultraluminous Infrared Galaxies (ULIRGs), as part of our SHINING survey of
local galaxies, we present far-infrared spectroscopy of Mrk 231, the most
luminous of the local ULIRGs, and a type 1 broad absorption line AGN. For the
first time in a ULIRG, all observed far-infrared fine-structure lines in the
PACS range were detected and all were found to be deficient relative to the far
infrared luminosity by 1 - 2 orders of magnitude compared with lower luminosity
galaxies. The deficits are similar to those for the mid-infrared lines, with
the most deficient lines showing high ionization potentials. Aged starbursts
may account for part of the deficits, but partial covering of the highest
excitation AGN powered regions may explain the remaining line deficits. A
massive molecular outflow, discovered in OH and 18OH, showing outflow
velocities out to at least 1400 km/sec, is a unique signature of the clearing
out of the molecular disk that formed by dissipative collapse during the
merger. The outflow is characterized by extremely high ratios of 18O / 16O
suggestive of interstellar medium processing by advanced starbursts.
