In this paper, we systematically develop the "ghost" symmetry of the BKP
hierarchy through its actions on the Lax operator $L$, the eigenfunctions and
the $\tau$ function. In this process, the spectral representation of the
eigenfunctions and a new potential are introduced by using squared
eigenfunction potential(SEP) of the BKP hierarchy. Moreover, the bilinear
identity of the constrained BKP hierarchy and Adler-Shiota-van-Moerbeke formula
of the BKP hierarchy are re-derived compactly by means of the spectral
representation and "ghost" symmetry.
