Following a short report of our preliminary results [Phys. Rev. E 79,
055203(R) (2009)], we present a more detailed study of the effects of coupling
delay in diffusively coupled phase oscillator populations. We find that
coupling delay induces chimera and globally clustered chimera (GCC) states in
delay coupled populations. We show the existence of multi-clustered states that
act as link between the chimera and the GCC states. A stable GCC state goes
through a variety of GCC states, namely periodic, aperiodic, long-- and
short--period breathers and becomes unstable GCC leading to global
synchronization in the system, on increasing time delay. We provide numerical
evidence and theoretical explanations for the above results and discuss
possible applications of the observed phenomena.
