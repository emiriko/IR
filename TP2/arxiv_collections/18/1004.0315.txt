On a fixed Riemann surface $(M_0,g_0)$ with $N$ Euclidean ends and genus $g$,
we show that, under a topological condition, the scattering matrix $S_V(\la)$
at frequency $\la > 0$ for the operator $\Delta+V$ determines the potential $V$
if $V\in C^{1,\alpha}(M_0)\cap e^{-\gamma d(\cdot,z_0)^j}L^\infty(M_0)$ for all
$\gamma>0$ and for some $j\in\{1,2\}$, where $d(z,z_0)$ denotes the distance
from $z$ to a fixed point $z_0\in M_0$. The topological condition is given by
$N\geq\max(2g+1,2)$ for $j=1$ and by $N\geq g+1$ if $j=2$. In $\rr^2$ this
implies that the operator $S_V(\la)$ determines any $C^{1,\alpha}$ potential
$V$ such that $V(z)=O(e^{-\gamma|z|^2})$ for all $\gamma>0$.
