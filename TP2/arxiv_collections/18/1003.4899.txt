The distribution function of the free energy fluctuations in one-dimensional
directed polymers with $\delta$-correlated random potential is studied by
mapping the replicated problem to a many body quantum boson system with
attractive interactions. Performing the summation over the entire spectrum of
excited states the problem is reduced to the Fredholm determinant with the Airy
kernel which is known to yield the Tracy-Widom distribution
