Signatures of antiferromagnetism (AF) in the underdoped Ln2-xCexCuO4 (Ln =
Nd, Pr,...) family are observed even for doping levels for which
superconductivity exists. We have looked for a similar property in a different
electron-doped cuprate family, Sr1-xLaxCuO2, which consists of CuO2 planes
separated by Sr/La atoms, and is exempt of the possible influence of magnetic
rare earth ions. We report in-plane magnetoresistance measurements in the
normal state of underdoped, superconducting, c-axis oriented, epitaxial
Sr1-xLaxCuO2 thin films. This probe is sensitive to spin arrangement and we
find that the in-plane magnetoresistance, which is negative and does not
saturate for T, exhibits an angular dependence when measured upon rotating a
magnetic field within the CuO2 planes. The analysis reveals a superposition of
fourfold and twofold angular oscillations. Both of these increase in amplitude
with increasing field and decreasing and appear below a temperature, which gets
higher with decreasing doping levels. Our results demonstrate that these
magnetoresistance oscillations, also observed for the Ln2-xCexCuO4 (Ln = Nd,
Pr,...) family and attributed to an AF signature, are, without ambiguity, a
property of CuO2 planes. Besides, these oscillations vary with doping in an
unusual way compared to previous results: fourfold oscillations are essentially
present in the more underdoped samples while only twofold oscillations are
visible in the less underdoped ones. This intriguing observation appears to be
a consequence of spin dilution with increasing doping level.
