Many geophysical processes can be modelled by using interconnected networks.
The small-world network model has recently attracted much attention in physics
and applied sciences. In this paper, we try to use and modify the small-world
theory to model geophysical processes such as diffusion and transport in
disordered porous rocks. We develop an analytical approach as well as numerical
simulations to try to characterize the pollutant transport and percolation
properties of small-world networks. The analytical expression of system
saturation time and fractal dimension of small-world networks are given and
thus compared with numerical simulations.
