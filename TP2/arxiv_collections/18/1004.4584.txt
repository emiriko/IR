We present an updated dynamical and statistical analysis of outer Oort cloud
cometary evidence suggesting the sun has a wide-binary Jovian mass companion.
The results support a conjecture that there exists a companion of mass ~ 1-4
M_Jup orbiting in the innermost region of the outer Oort cloud. Our most
restrictive prediction is that the orientation angles of the orbit normal in
galactic coordinates are centered on the galactic longitude of the ascending
node Omega = 319 degree and the galactic inclination i = 103 degree (or the
opposite direction) with an uncertainty in the normal direction subtending ~ 2%
of the sky. A Bayesian statistical analysis suggests that the probability of
the companion hypothesis is comparable to or greater than the probability of
the null hypothesis of a statistical fluke. Such a companion could also have
produced the detached Kuiper Belt object Sedna. The putative companion could be
easily detected by the recently launched Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer
(WISE).
