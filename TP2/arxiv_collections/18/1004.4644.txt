As part of our search for young M dwarfs within 25 pc, we acquired
high-resolution spectra of 185 low-mass stars compiled by the NStars project
that have strong X-ray emission. By cross-correlating these spectra with radial
velocity standard stars, we are sensitive to finding multi-lined spectroscopic
binaries. We find a low-mass spectroscopic binary fraction of 16% consisting of
27 SB2s, 2 SB3s and 1 SB4, increasing the number of known low-mass SBs by 50%
and proving that strong X-ray emission is an extremely efficient way to find
M-dwarf SBs. WASP photometry of 23 of these systems revealed two low-mass EBs,
bringing the count of known M dwarf EBs to 15. BD -22 5866, the SB4, is fully
described in Shkolnik et al. 2008 and CCDM J04404+3127 B consists of a two
mid-M stars orbiting each other every 2.048 days. WASP also provided rotation
periods for 12 systems, and in the cases where the synchronization time scales
are short, we used P_rot to determine the true orbital parameters. For those
with no P_rot, we use differential radial velocities to set upper limits on
orbital periods and semi-major axes. More than half of our sample has
near-equal-mass components (q > 0.8). This is expected since our sample is
biased towards tight orbits where saturated X-ray emission is due to tidal
spin-up rather than stellar youth. Increasing the samples of M dwarf SBs and
EBs is extremely valuable in setting constraints on current theories of stellar
multiplicity and evolution scenarios for low-mass multiple systems.
