We present a numerical approximation technique for the analysis of
continuous-time Markov chains that describe networks of biochemical reactions
and play an important role in the stochastic modeling of biological systems.
Our approach is based on the construction of a stochastic hybrid model in which
certain discrete random variables of the original Markov chain are approximated
by continuous deterministic variables. We compute the solution of the
stochastic hybrid model using a numerical algorithm that discretizes time and
in each step performs a mutual update of the transient probability distribution
of the discrete stochastic variables and the values of the continuous
deterministic variables. We implemented the algorithm and we demonstrate its
usefulness and efficiency on several case studies from systems biology.
