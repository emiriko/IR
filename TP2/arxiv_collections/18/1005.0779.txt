We present the gravitational wave signatures for a suite of axisymmetric core
collapse supernova models with progenitors masses between 12 and 25 solar
masses. These models are distinguished by the fact they explode and contain
essential physics (in particular, multi-frequency neutrino transport and
general relativity) needed for a more realistic description. Thus, we are able
to compute complete waveforms (i.e., through explosion) based on
non-parameterized, first-principles models. This is essential if the waveform
amplitudes and time scales are to be computed more precisely. Fourier
decomposition shows that the gravitational wave signals we predict should be
observable by AdvLIGO across the range of progenitors considered here. The
fundamental limitation of these models is in their imposition of axisymmetry.
Further progress will require counterpart three-dimensional models.
