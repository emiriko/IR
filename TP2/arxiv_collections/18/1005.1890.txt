The discovery of accelerated expansion using supernova surveys has been one
of the most surprising discoveries in cosmology in the past ten years. Present
and future surveys, among which SNLS, JDEM or LSST, are based on samples of a
few hundreds to a million supernovae. The measurement of their spectroscopic
redshifts to investigate dark energy properties is already by far the limiting
aspect of such surveys. In this paper, I will discuss and illustrate with SNLS
data an approach based solely on photometry to both select supernova candidates
and determine their redshift.
