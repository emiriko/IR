We present a collection of signatures for physics beyond the standard model
that need to be explored at the LHC. First, are presented various tools
developed to measure new particle masses in scenarios where all decays include
an unobservable particle. Second, various aspects of supersymmetric models are
discussed. Third, some signatures of models of strong electroweak symmetry are
discussed. In the fourth part, a special attention is devoted to high mass
resonances, as the ones appearing in models with warped extra dimensions.
Finally, prospects for models with a hidden sector/valley are presented. Our
report, which includes brief experimental and theoretical reviews as well as
original results, summarizes the activities of the "New Physics" working group
for the "Physics at TeV Colliders" workshop (Les Houches, France, 8-26 June,
2009).
