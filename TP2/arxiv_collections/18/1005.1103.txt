We theoretically investigate the robustness of cluster states in charge qubit
system based on quantum dot (QD) and double quantum point contact (DQPC). Trap
state is modeled by an island structure in DQPC and represents a dynamical
fluctuation. We found that the dynamical fluctuations affect the cluster states
more than static fluctuation caused by QD size fluctuation.
