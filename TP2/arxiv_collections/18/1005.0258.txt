We provide hot star wind models with radiative force calculated using the
solution of comoving frame (CMF) radiative transfer equation. The wind models
are calculated for the first stars, O stars, and the central stars of planetary
nebulae. We show that without line overlaps and with solely thermal line
broadening the pure Sobolev approximation provides a reliable estimate of the
radiative force even close to the wind sonic point. Consequently, models with
the Sobolev line force provide good approximations to solutions obtained with
non-Sobolev transfer. Taking line overlaps into account, the radiative force
becomes slightly lower, leading to a decrease in the wind mass-loss rate by
roughly 40%. Below the sonic point, the CMF line force is significantly lower
than the Sobolev one. In the case of pure thermal broadening, this does not
influence the mass-loss rate, as the wind mass-loss rate is set in the
supersonic part of the wind. However, when additional line broadening is
present (e.g., the turbulent one) the region of low CMF line force may extend
outwards to the regions where the mass-loss rate is set. This results in a
decrease in the wind mass-loss rate. This effect can at least partly explain
the low wind mass-loss rates derived from some observational analyses of
luminous O stars.
