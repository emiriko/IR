We report the first detection of a linear correlation between rms variability
amplitude and flux in the Ultraluminous X-ray source NGC 5408 X-1. The rms-flux
relation has previously been observed in several Galactic black hole X-ray
binaries (BHBs), several Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and at least one neutron
star X-ray binary. This result supports the hypothesis that a linear rms-flux
relation is common to all luminous black hole accretion and perhaps even a
fundamental property of accretion flows about compact objects. We also show for
the first time the cross-spectral properties of the variability of this ULX,
comparing variations below and above 1 keV. The coherence and time delays are
poorly constrained but consistent with high coherence between the two bands,
over most of the observable frequency range, and a significant time delay (with
hard leading soft variations). The magnitude and frequency dependence of the
lags are broadly consistent with those commonly observed in BHBs, but the
direction of the lag is reversed. These results indicate that ULX variability
studies, using long X-ray observations, hold great promise for constraining the
processes driving ULXs behaviour, and the position of ULXs in the scheme of
black hole accretion from BHBs to AGN.
