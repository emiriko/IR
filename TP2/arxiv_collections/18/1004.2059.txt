Context. Supergiant fast X-ray transients are a subclass of high mass X-ray
binaries that host a neutron star accreting mass from the wind of its OB
supergiant companion. They are characterized by an extremely pronounced and
rapid variability in X-rays, which still lacks an unambiguous interpretation. A
number of deep pointed observations with XMM-Newton have been carried out to
study the quiescent emission of these sources and gain insight into the
mechanism that causes their X-ray variability. Aims. We continued this study by
using three XMM-Newton observations of the two supergiant fast X-ray transient
prototypes XTEJ1739-302 and IGR J08408-4503 in quiescence. Methods. An in-depth
timing and spectral analysis of these data have been carried out. Results. We
found that the quiescent emission of these sources is characterized by both
complex timing and spectral variability, with multiple small flares occurring
sporadically after periods of lower X-ray emission. Some evidence is found in
the XMM-Newton spectra of a soft component below ~2 keV, similar to that
observed in the two supergiant fast X-ray transients AXJ1845.0-0433 and
IGRJ16207-5129 and in many other high mass X-ray binaries. Conclusions.We
suggest some possible interpretations of the timing and spectral properties of
the quiescent emission of XTEJ1739- 302 and IGR J08408-4503 in the context of
the different theoretical models proposed to interpret the behavior of the
supergiant fast X-ray transients.
