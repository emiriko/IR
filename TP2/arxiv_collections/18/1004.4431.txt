Exploiting the performance of today's processors requires intimate knowledge
of the microarchitecture as well as an awareness of the ever-growing complexity
in thread and cache topology. LIKWID is a set of command-line utilities that
addresses four key problems: Probing the thread and cache topology of a
shared-memory node, enforcing thread-core affinity on a program, measuring
performance counter metrics, and toggling hardware prefetchers. An API for
using the performance counting features from user code is also included. We
clearly state the differences to the widely used PAPI interface. To demonstrate
the capabilities of the tool set we show the influence of thread pinning on
performance using the well-known OpenMP STREAM triad benchmark, and use the
affinity and hardware counter tools to study the performance of a stencil code
specifically optimized to utilize shared caches on multicore chips.
