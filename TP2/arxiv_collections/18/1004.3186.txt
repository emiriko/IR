By molecular dynamic simulations we study a system of particles interacting
through a continuous isotropic pairwise core-softened potential consisting of a
repulsive shoulder and an attractive well. The model displays a phase diagram
with three fluid phases, a gas-liquid critical point, a liquid-liquid critical
point, and anomalies in density, diffusion and structure. The hierarchy of the
anomalies is the same as for water. We study the effect on the anomalies of
varying the softness of the potential. We find that, making the soft-core
steeper, the regions of density and diffusion anomalies contract in the T -
{\rho} plane, while the region of structural anomaly is weakly affected.
Therefore, a liquid can have anomalous structural behavior without density or
diffusion anomalies. We show that, by considering as effective distances those
corresponding to the maxima of the first two peaks of the radial distribution
function g(r) in the high-density liquid, we can generalize to continuous
two-scales potentials a criterion for the occurrence of the anomalies of
density and diffusion, originally proposed for discontinuous potentials. We
observe that the knowledge of the structural behavior within the first two
coordination shells of the liquid is not enough to establish the occurrence of
the anomalies. By introducing the density derivative of the the cumulative
order integral of the excess entropy we show that the anomalous behavior is
regulated by the structural order at distances as large as the fourth
coordination shell. By comparing the results for different softness of the
potential, we conclude that the disappearing of the density and diffusion
anomalies for the steeper potentials is due to a more structured short-range
order. All these results increase our understanding on how, knowing the
interaction potential, we can evaluate the possible presence of anomalies for a
liquid.
