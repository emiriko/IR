We explore, in a concrete example, to which extent new particle mass
determinations are practicable with LHC data. Our chosen example is that of
Yukawa-unified SUSY GUTs, whose viability has been recently studied for two
general patterns of soft SUSY-breaking terms. We note that both patterns of
SUSY spectra do not admit long decay chains, which would make it possible to
determine the masses of the SUSY particles involved using endpoints or mass
relations. We thus take the so-called mT2-kink method as our key strategy,
since it does not rely on the presence of long decay chains. We then discuss a
procedure allowing to determine the masses of the gluino, of the lightest
chargino as well as of the first two neutralinos and, for the scenario where a
stop is lighter than the gluino, the mass of the light stop too. Our worked
example of Yukawa-unified SUSY GUTs may offer a useful playground for dealing
with other theories which predict similar patterns of SUSY spectra.
