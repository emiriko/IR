We consider propagation of optical pulses under the interplay of dispersion
and Kerr non-linearity in optical fibres with impurities distributed at random
uniformly on the fibre. By using a model based on the non-linear Schrodinger
equation we clarify how such inhomogeneities affect different aspects such as
the number of solitons present and the intensity of the signal. We also obtain
the mean distance for the signal to dissipate to a given level.
