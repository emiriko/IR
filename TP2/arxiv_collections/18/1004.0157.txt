We review a communication protocol recently proposed by us that makes use of
a two-way quantum channel. We provide a characterization of such a protocol
from a practical perspective, and consider the most relevant eavesdropping
strategies against it. This allows us to compare its potentialities with those
of a standard protocol which uses a one-way quantum channel.
