In this paper we revisit the Brownian motion on the basis of {the fractional
Langevin equation which turns out to be a particular case of the generalized
Langevin equation introduced by Kubo in 1966. The importance of our approach is
to model the Brownian motion more realistically than the usual one based on the
classical Langevin equation, in that it takes into account also the retarding
effects due to hydrodynamic back-flow, i.e. the added mass and the Basset
memory drag. We provide the analytical expressions of the correlation functions
(both for the random force and the particle velocity) and of the mean squared
particle displacement. The random force has been shown to be represented by a
superposition of the usual white noise with a "fractional" noise. The velocity
correlation function is no longer expressed by a simple exponential but
exhibits a slower decay, proportional to t^{-3/2} for long times, which indeed
is more realistic. Finally, the mean squared displacement is shown to maintain,
for sufficiently long times, the linear behaviour which is typical of normal
diffusion, with the same diffusion coefficient of the classical case. However,
the Basset history force induces a retarding effect in the establishing of the
linear behaviour, which in some cases could appear as a manifestation of
anomalous diffusion to be correctly interpreted in experimental measurements.
