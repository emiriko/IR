Single crystals of LaFeAsO, NdFeAsO, and SmFeAsO have been prepared by means
of a NaAs flux growth technique and studied by optical spectroscopy
measurements. We show that the spectral features corresponding to the partial
energy gaps in the spin-density-wave (SDW) state are present below the
structural phase transition. This indicates that the electronic state below the
structural phase transition is already very close to that in the SDW state. We
also show that in-plane infrared phonon modes display systematic shifts towards
high frequency upon rare-earth element substitutions for La, suggesting a
strong enhancement of the bonding strength. Furthermore, an asymmetric
line-shape of the in-plane phonon mode is observed, implying the presence of an
electron-phonon coupling effect in Fe-pnictides.
