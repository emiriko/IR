The combined effects of strong disorder, strong correlations and hopping in
the Anderson-Hubbard model have been shown to produce a zero bias anomaly which
has an energy scale proportional to the hopping and minimal dependence on
interaction strength, disorder strength and doping. Disorder-induced
suppression of the density of states for a purely local interaction is
inconsistent with both the Efros-Shklovskii Coulomb gap and the
Altshuler-Aronov anomaly, and moreover the energy scale of this anomaly is
inconsistent with the standard energy scales of both weak and strong coupling
pictures. We demonstrate that a density of states anomaly with similar features
arises in an ensemble of two-site systems, and we argue that the energy scale t
emerges in strongly correlated systems with disorder due to the mixing of lower
and upper Hubbard orbitals on neighboring sites.
