Nova Scorpii 2008 was the target of our Directory Discretionary Time proposal
at VLT+UVES in order to study the evolution, origin and abundances of the
heavy-element absorption system recently discovered in 80% of classical novae
in outburst. The early decline of Nova Scorpii 2008 was monitored with high
resolution echelle spectroscopy at 5 different epochs. The analysis of the
absorption and the emission lines show many unusual characteristics. Nova
Scorpii 2008 is confirmed to differ from a common Classical Nova as well as a
Symbiotic Recurrent Nova, and it shows characteristics which are common to the
so called, yet debated, red-novae. The origin of this new nova remains
uncertain.
