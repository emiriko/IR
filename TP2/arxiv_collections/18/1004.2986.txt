Antoniadis et al proposed a relation between the Omega-deformation and
refined correlation functions of the topological string theory. We investigate
the proposal for the deformed conifold geometry from a non-compact Gepner model
approach. The topological string theory on the deformed conifold has a dual
description in terms of the c=1 non-critical string theory at the self-dual
radius, and the Omega-deformation yields the radius deformation. We show that
the refined correlation functions computed from the twisted SL(2,R)/U(1)
Kazama-Suzuki coset model at level k=1 have direct c=1 non-critical string
theory interpretations. After subtracting the leading singularity to procure
the 1PI effective action, we obtain the agreement with the proposal.
