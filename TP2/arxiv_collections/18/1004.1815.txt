In this paper, the exp-function method with the aid of symbolic computational
system is used to obtain generalized travelling wave solutions of a
Burgers-Fisher equation with variable coefficients. It is shown that the
exp-function method, with the help of symbolic computation, provides a
straightforward and powerful mathematical tool to solve the nonlinear evolution
equation with variable coefficients in mathematical physics.
