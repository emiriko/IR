Modal fixpoint logics traditionally play a central role in computer science,
in particular in artificial intelligence and concurrency. The mu-calculus and
its relatives are among the most expressive logics of this type. However,
popular fixpoint logics tend to trade expressivity for simplicity and
readability, and in fact often live within the single variable fragment of the
mu-calculus. The family of such flat fixpoint logics includes, e.g., LTL, CTL,
and the logic of common knowledge. Extending this notion to the generic
semantic framework of coalgebraic logic enables covering a wide range of logics
beyond the standard mu-calculus including, e.g., flat fragments of the graded
mu-calculus and the alternating-time mu-calculus (such as alternating-time
temporal logic ATL), as well as probabilistic and monotone fixpoint logics. We
give a generic proof of completeness of the Kozen-Park axiomatization for such
flat coalgebraic fixpoint logics.
