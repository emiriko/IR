We study the possibility of suppressing three-body losses in atomic
Bose-Einstein condensates via the quantum Zeno effect, which means the delay of
quantum evolution by frequent measurements. It turns out that this requires
very fast measurements with the rate being determined by the spatial structure
of the three-body form factor, i.e., the point interaction approximation
$\delta^3(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r'})$ is not adequate. Since the molecular binding
energy $E_b$ provides a natural limit for the measurement rate, this
suppression mechanism can only work if the form factor possesses certain
special properties.
