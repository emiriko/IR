I review progress in calculating strange quark and antiquark distributions of
the nucleon using the meson cloud model. This progress parallels that of the
meson cloud model, which is now a useful theoretical basis for understanding
symmetry breaking in nucleon parton distribution functions. I examine the
breaking of symmetries involving strange quarks and antiquarks, including quark
- antiquark symmetry in the sea, SU(3) flavour symmetry and SU(6) spin-flavour
symmetry.
