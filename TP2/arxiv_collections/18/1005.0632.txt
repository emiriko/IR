In this paper we prove the existence and uniqueness of strong solutions for
SPDE in Hilbert space with locally monotone coefficients, which is a
generalization of the classical result of Krylov and Rozovskii for monotone
coefficients. Our main result can be applied to different types of SPDEs such
as stochastic reaction-diffusion equations, stochastic Burgers type equation,
stochastic 2-D Navier-Stokes equation, stochastic $p$-Laplace equation and
stochastic porous media equation with some non-monotone perturbations.
