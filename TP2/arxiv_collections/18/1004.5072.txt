The energies of the excited states of the Nucleon, $\Delta$ and $\Omega$ are
computed in lattice QCD, using two light quarks and one strange quark on
anisotropic lattices. The calculation is performed at three values of the light
quark mass, corresponding to pion masses $m_{\pi}$ = 392(4), 438(3) and 521(3)
MeV. We employ the variational method with a large basis of interpolating
operators enabling six energies in each irreducible representation of the
lattice to be distinguished clearly. We compare our calculation with the
low-lying experimental spectrum, with which we find reasonable agreement in the
pattern of states. The need to include operators that couple to the expected
multi-hadron states in the spectrum is clearly identified.
