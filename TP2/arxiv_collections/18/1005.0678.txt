An interesting paper has recently been published claiming that the
long-sought Rosetta Stone needed to decipher the nature of pulsar radio
emission has been finally identified as the double features in averaged pulsar
profiles. The authors argue that highly symmetric bifurcated features are
produced by a split-fan beams of extraordinary-mode curvature radiation emitted
by thin microscopic streams of magnetospheric plasma conducted by a very narrow
bundle of magnetic field lines. We examined arguments leading to these
intriguing conclusions and found a number of flaws. At least one of them is
fatal, namely there is not enough available energy within such thin microscopic
plasma streams. Using an elementary pulsar physics we show that if the stream
is so thin that its emission can reveal the signatures of elementary radiation
mechanism, then the energy deficit tends to be severe and reaches a few to
several orders of magnitude (depending on the actual efficiency of converting
the available kinetic energy of relativistic charged particles into the
coherent radio emission). We are certain that the answer to the question
contained in the title of this paper is definitely negative.
