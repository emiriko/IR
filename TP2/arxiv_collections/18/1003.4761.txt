We demonstrate a compact laser source suitable for the trapping and cooling
of potassium. By frequency doubling a fiber laser diode at 1534 nm in a
waveguide, we produce 767 nm laser light. A current modulation of the diode
allows to generate the two required frequencies for cooling in a simple and
robust apparatus. We successfully used this laser source to trap ^39 K.
