We show that electromagnetically-induced transparency and lasing without
inversion are simultaneously achieved for microwave fields by using a fluxonium
superconducting circuit. As a result of the $\Delta$ energy-level structure of
this artificial three-level atom, we find the surprising phenomenon that the
electromagnetically-induced transparency window in the frequency domain is
sandwiched between absorption on one side and amplification on the other side.
