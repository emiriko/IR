We propose multilayer cylindrical invisibility cloaks that are optimized for
oblique incidences through combination of analytic formalism of scattering and
genetic optimization. We show that by using only four layers of homogeneous and
anisotropic metamaterials without large values of constitutive parameters, the
scattering for oblique incidences can be reduced by two orders. Although the
optimization is done at a single incident angle, the cloak provides reduced
scattering over a large range of incident angles.
