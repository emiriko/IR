The first part is an introductory description of a small cross-section of the
literature on algebraic methods in non-perturbative quantum gravity with a
specific focus on viewing algebra as a laboratory in which to deepen
understanding of the nature of geometry. This helps to set the context for the
second part, in which we describe a new algebraic characterisation of the Dirac
operator in non-commutative geometry and then use it in a calculation on the
form of the fermion mass matrix. Assimilating and building on the various ideas
described in the first part, the final part consists of an outline of a
speculative perspective on (non-commutative) quantum spectral gravity. This is
the second of a pair of papers so far on this project.
