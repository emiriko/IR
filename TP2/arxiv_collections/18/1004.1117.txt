We present results from simultaneous observations of the high-mass X-ray
binary system Cygnus X-1 / HDE 226868 with Suzaku, Chandra-HETGS, XMM-Newton,
RXTE, INTEGRAL, and Swift in 2008 April. Performed shortly after orbital phase
0, when our line of sight to the black hole passes through the densest part of
the O-star's wind, these obervations show common transient absorption dips in
the soft X-ray band. For the first time, however, we detect a simultaneous
scattering trough in the hard X-ray light curves. The more neutral clump is
thus only the core of a larger ionized blob, which contains a significant
fraction of the total wind mass. The diluted wind outside of these clumps is
almost completely photoionized.
