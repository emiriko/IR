Observations of Serpens have been performed at the JCMT using Harp-B. Maps
over a 4.5'x5.4' region were made in a frequency window around 338 GHz,
covering the 7-6 transitions of methanol. Emission is extended over each
source, following the column density of H2 but showing up also particularly
strongly around outflows. The rotational temperature is low, 15-20 K, and does
not vary with position within each source. The abundance is typically 10^-9 -
10^-8 with respect to H2 in the outer envelope, whereas "jumps" by factors of
up to 10^2 -10^3 inside the region where the dust temperature exceeds 100 K are
not excluded. A factor of up to ~ 10^3 enhancement is seen in outflow gas. In
one object, SMM4, the ice abundance has been measured to be ~ 3x10^-5 with
respect to H2 in the outer envelope, i.e., a factor of 10^3 larger than the
gas-phase abundance. Comparison with C18O J=3-2 emission shows that strong CO
depletion leads to a high gas-phase abundance of CH3OH not just for the Serpens
sources, but for a larger sample of protostars. The observations illustrate the
large-scale, low-level desorption of CH3OH from dust grains, extending out to
and beyond 7500 AU from each source, a scenario which is consistent with
non-thermal (photo-)desorption from the ice. The observations also illustrate
the usefulness of CH3OH as a tracer of energetic input in the form of outflows,
where methanol is sputtered from the grain surfaces. Finally, the observations
provide further evidence of CH3OH formation through CO hydrogenation proceeding
on grain surfaces in low-mass envelopes.
