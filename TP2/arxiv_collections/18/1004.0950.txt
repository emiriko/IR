The sixth part of the OGLE-III catalog of Variable Stars presents \delta Sct
pulsators in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Altogether 2786 variable stars were
found and amongst them 92 are multi-mode objects, including 67 stars pulsating
in the fundamental mode and the first overtone (F/1O), nine double-mode
pulsators with various combinations of the first three overtones excited
(1O/2O, 2O/3O and 1O/3O pulsators), and two triple mode (F/1O/2O) \delta Sct
stars. In total 1490 of stars are marked as uncertain, due to scattered
photometry and small amplitudes. For single-mode objects it was not possible to
unambiguously identify pulsation mode, however we suggest the most of the
single-mode variable stars pulsate in the first overtone.
