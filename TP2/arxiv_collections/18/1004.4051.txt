The restriction, on the spectral variables, of the Baker-Akhiezer (BA) module
of a g-dimensional principally polarized abelian variety with the non-singular
theta divisor to an intersection of shifted theta divisors is studied. It is
shown that the restriction to a k-dimensional variety becomes a free module
over the ring of differential operators in $k$ variables. The remaining g-k
derivations define evolution equations for generators of the BA-module. As a
corollary new examples of commutative ring of partial differential operators
with matrix coefficients and their non-trivial evolution equations are
obtained.
