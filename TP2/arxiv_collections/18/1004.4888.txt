We define a variety of doubly indexed flags, this is a smooth, projective
variety, and we describe it as an iterated over Grassmannian varieties. On the
other hand, we consider the variety of partial flags which are stabilized by a
given nilpotent endomorphism. We partition this variety into locally closed
subvarieties which are vector bundles over varieties of the aforedmentioned
type.
