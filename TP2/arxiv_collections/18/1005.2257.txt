The electrical resistivity of the accreted mountain in a millisecond pulsar
is limited by the observed spin-down rate of binary radio millisecond pulsars
(BRMSPs) and the spins and X-ray fluxes of accreting millisecond pulsars
(AMSPs). We find $\eta \ge 10^{-28}\,\mathrm{s}\,
(\tau_\mathrm{SD}/1\,\mathrm{Gyr})^{-0.8}$ (where $\tau_\mathrm{SD}$ is the
spin-down age) for BRMSPs and $\eta \ge
10^{-25}\,\mathrm{s}\,(\dot{M}_\mathrm{a}/\dot{M}_\mathrm{E})^{0.6}$ (where
$\dot{M}_\mathrm{a}$ and $\dot{M}_\mathrm{E}$ are the actual and Eddington
accretion rates) for AMSPs. These limits are inferred assuming that the
mountain attains a steady state, where matter diffuses resistively across
magnetic flux surfaces but is replenished at an equal rate by infalling
material. The mountain then relaxes further resistively after accretion ceases.
The BRMSP spin-down limit approaches the theoretical electron-impurity
resistivity at temperatures $\ga 10^5$ K for an impurity concentration of $\sim
0.1$, while the AMSP stalling limit falls two orders of magnitude below the
theoretical electron-phonon resistivity for temperatures above $10^8$ K. Hence
BRMSP observations are already challenging theoretical resistivity calculations
in a useful way. Next-generation gravitational-wave interferometers will
constrain $\eta$ at a level that will be competitive with electromagnetic
observations.
