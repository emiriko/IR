We present the recent works \cite{trisetyarso2011} on the application of
Darboux transformation on one-dimensional Dirac equation related to the field
of Quantum Information and Computation (QIC). The representation of physical
system in one-dimensional equation and its transformation due to the Bagrov,
Baldiotti, Gitman, and Shamshutdinova (BBGS)-Darboux transformation showing the
possibility admitting the concept of relativity and the trade-off of concurrent
condition of quantum and classical physics play into the area of QIC. The
applications in cavity quantum electrodynamics and on the proposal of quantum
transistor are presented.
