A convex optimization based method is proposed for quantum process
tomography, in the case of known channel model structure, but unknown channel
parameters. The main idea is to select an affine parametrization of the Choi
matrix as a set of optimization variables, and formulate a semidefinite
programming problem with a least squares objective function. Possible convex
relations between the optimization variables are also taken into account to
improve the estimation. Simulation case studies show, that the proposed method
can significantly increase the accuracy of the parameter estimation, if the
channel model structure is known. Beside the convex part, the determination of
the channel parameters from the optimization variables is a nonconvex step in
general. In the case of Pauli channels however, the method reduces to a purely
convex optimization problem, allowing to obtain a globally optimal solution.
