Multistate dark matter (DM) models with small mass splittings and couplings
to light hidden sector bosons have been proposed as an explanation for the
PAMELA/Fermi/H.E.S.S. high-energy lepton excesses. We investigate this proposal
over a wide range of DM density profiles, in the framework of concrete models
with doublet or triplet dark matter and a hidden SU(2) gauge sector that mixes
with standard model hypercharge. The gauge coupling is bounded from below by
the DM relic density, and the Sommerfeld enhancement factor is explicitly
computable for given values of the DM and gauge boson masses M, mu and the
(largest) dark matter mass splitting delta M_{12}. Sommerfeld enhancement is
stronger at the galactic center than near the Sun because of the radial
dependence of the DM velocity profile, which strengthens the inverse Compton
(IC) gamma ray constraints relative to usual assumptions. We find that the
PAMELA/Fermi/H.E.S.S. lepton excesses are marginally compatible with the model
predictions, and with CMB and Fermi gamma ray constraints, for M ~ 800 GeV, mu
~ 200 MeV, and a dark matter profile with noncuspy Einasto parameters alpha >
0.20, r_s ~ 30 kpc. We also find that the annihilating DM must provide only a
subdominant (< 0.4) component of the total DM mass density, since otherwise the
boost factor due to Sommerfeld enhancement is too large.
