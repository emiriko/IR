Recently, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy has been used to
highlight an anomalously large band renormalization at high binding energies in
cuprate superconductors: the high energy "waterfall" or high energy anomaly
(HEA). The anomaly is present for both hole- and electron-doped cuprates as
well as the half-filled parent insulators with different energy scales arising
on either side of the phase diagram. While photoemission matrix elements
clearly play a role in changing the aesthetic appearance of the band
dispersion, i.e. creating a "waterfall"-like appearance, they provide an
inadequate description for the physics that underlies the strong band
renormalization giving rise to the HEA. Model calculations of the single-band
Hubbard Hamiltonian showcase the role played by correlations in the formation
of the HEA and uncover significant differences in the HEA energy scale for
hole- and electron-doped cuprates. In addition, this approach properly captures
the transfer of spectral weight accompanying doping in a correlated material
and provides a unifying description of the HEA across both sides of the cuprate
phase diagram. We find that the anomaly demarcates a transition, or cross-over,
from a quasiparticle band at low binding energies near the Fermi level to
valence bands at higher binding energy, assumed to be of strong oxygen
character.
