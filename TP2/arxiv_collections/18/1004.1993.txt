We investigate the MSSM with very large tan(beta) > 50, where the fermion
masses are strongly affected by loop-induced couplings to the "wrong" Higgs,
imposing perturbative Yukawa couplings and constraints from flavour physics.
Performing a low-energy scan of the MSSM with flavour-blind soft terms, we find
that the branching ratio of B->tau nu and the anomalous magnetic moment of the
muon are the strongest constraints at very large tan(beta) and identify the
viable regions in parameter space. Furthermore we determine the scale at which
the perturbativity of the Yukawa sector breaks down, depending on the
low-energy MSSM parameters. Next, we analyse the very large tan(beta) regime of
General Gauge Mediation (GGM) with a low mediation scale. We investigate the
requirements on the parameter space and discuss the implied flavour
phenomenology. We point out that the possibility of a vanishing Bmu term at a
mediation scale M = 100 TeV is challenged by the experimental data on B->tau nu
and the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon.
