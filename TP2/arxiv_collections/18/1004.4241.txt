We propose a novel error concealment algorithm to be used at the receiver
side of a lossy image transmission system. Our algorithm involves hiding the
edge map of the original image at the transmitter within itself using a robust
watermarking scheme. At the receiver, wherever a lost block is detected, the
extracted edge information is used as border constraint for the spatial
smoothing employing the intact neighboring blocks in order to conceal errors.
Simulation results show the superiority of our technique over existing methods
even in case of high packet loss ratios in the communication network.
