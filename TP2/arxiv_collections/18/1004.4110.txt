The diamond norm measures the distance between two quantum channels. From an
operational vewpoint, this norm measures how well we can distinguish between
two channels by applying them to input states of arbitrarily large dimensions.
In this paper, we show that the diamond norm can be conveniently and in a
physically transparent way computed by means of a Monte-Carlo algorithm based
on the Fano representation of quantum states and quantum operations. The
effectiveness of this algorithm is illustrated for several single-qubit quantum
channels.
