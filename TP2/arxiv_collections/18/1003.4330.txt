This paper applies Hermite function techniques to give elementary proofs of
Kato type smoothing estimates for the Schr\"odinger equation with quadratic
potential in R^n+1. This is equivalent to proving a uniform L^2(R^n) to
L^2(R^n) boundedness for a family of singularized Hermite projection kernels.
As an applicationas the above estimate, we also prove the R^9 collapsing
variable type Strichartz estimate.
