We investigate the electronic structure of Chromium Nitride (CrN) across the
first-order magneto-structural transition at T_N ~ 286 K. Resonant
photoemission spectroscopy shows a gap in the 3d partial density of states at
the Fermi level and an On-site Coulomb energy U ~ 4.5 eV, indicating strong
electron-electron correlations. Bulk-sensitive high resolution (6 meV) laser
photoemission reveals a clear Fermi edge indicating an antiferromagnetic metal
below T_N. Hard x-ray Cr 2p core-level spectra show T-dependent changes across
T_N which originate from screening due to coherent states as substantiated by
cluster model calculations using the experimentally observed U. The electrical
resistivity confirms an insulator above T_N (E_g ~ 70 meV) which becomes a
disordered metal below T_N. The results indicate CrN transforms from a
correlated insulator to an antiferromagnetic metal, coupled to the
magneto-structural transition.
