An analysis of the fluorine abundance in Galactic AGB carbon stars (24
N-type, 5 SC-type and 5 J-type) is presented. This study uses the state-
of-the-art carbon rich atmosphere models and improved atomic and molecular line
lists in the 2.3 {\mu}m region. F abundances significantly lower are obtained
in comparison to previous study in the literature. The main reason of this
difference is due to molecular blends. In the case of carbon stars of SC-type,
differences in the model atmospheres are also relevant. The new F enhancements
are now in agreement with the most recent theoretical nucleosynthesis models in
low- mass AGB stars, solving the long standing problem of F in Galactic AGB
stars. Nevertheless, some SC-type carbon stars still show larger F abundances
than predicted by stellar models. The possibility that these stars are of
larger mass is briefly discussed.
