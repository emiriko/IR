Following the approach outlined in [26], convergence to SLE$_6$ of the
Exploration Processes for the correlated bond-triangular type models studied in
[11] is established. This puts the said models in the same universality class
as the standard site percolation model on the triangular lattice [27]. In the
context of these models, the result is proven for all domains with boundary
Minkowski dimension less than two. Moreover, the proof of convergence applies
in the context of general critical 2D percolation models and for general
domains, under the stipulation that Cardy's Formula can be established for
domains in this generality.
