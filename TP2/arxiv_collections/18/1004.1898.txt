The lattice dynamics and the effect of pressure on superconducting LiFeAs in
both nonmagnetic (NM) and striped antiferromagnetic (SAF) phases are
investigated using the plane-wave pseudopotential, density-functional-based
method. While the obtained electron-phonon coupling $\lambda$ is very small for
the NM calculation, the softening of phonon in the SAF phase may lead to a
large increase in $\lambda$. In the SAF phase, strong anisotropy of the phonon
softening in the Fe plane is found to arise from different spin orders in the
$x$ and $y$ directions, indicating that the phonon softening is of spin-phonon
coupling origin. For the SAF structure, the calculated variation trend of the
electronic density of states and the phonon frequencies under pressure can
explain a large negative pressure coefficient of $T_{c}$ in the LiFeAs
compound.
