A simple binary model to compute the degree of balancedness in the output
sequence of LFSR-combinational generators has been developed. The computational
method is based exclusively on the handling of binary strings by means of logic
operations. The proposed model can serve as a deterministic alternative to
existing probabilistic methods for checking balancedness in binary sequence
generators. The procedure here described can be devised as a first selective
criterium for acceptance/rejection of this type of generators.
