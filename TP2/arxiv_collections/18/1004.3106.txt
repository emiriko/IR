We survey some new progress on the pricing models driven by fractional
Brownian motion \cb{or} mixed fractional Brownian motion. In particular, we
give results on arbitrage opportunities, hedging, and option pricing in these
models. We summarize some recent results on fractional Black & Scholes pricing
model with transaction costs. We end the paper by giving some approximation
results and indicating some open problems related to the paper.
