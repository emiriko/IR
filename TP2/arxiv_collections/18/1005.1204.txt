Seven years of successful observations of the sky have been completed within
the INTEGRAL mission, in the transition regime between X-rays and gamma-rays
from ~10-8000 keV. Initially-agreed mission goals have been pursued, and both
high-resolution images of point sources and high-resolution spectra of nuclear
lines have been obtained. New discoveries have been made, such as X-ray
emission from embedded binaries, hard emission tails from AXPs and 60Fe
radioactivity lines; these stimulated both theoretical and observational
studies, and now make INTEGRAL a valuable asset for the astronomical survey of
high-energy sources across the sky. This contribution summarizes the situation
after seven years of the mission, and concludes the 7-year anniversary workshop
"The extreme sky" held in Otranto, Italy, in Oct 2009.
