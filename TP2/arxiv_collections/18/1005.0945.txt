This paper presents an efficient human recognition system based on vein
pattern from the palma dorsa. A new absorption based technique has been
proposed to collect good quality images with the help of a low cost camera and
light source. The system automatically detects the region of interest from the
image and does the necessary preprocessing to extract features. A Euclidean
Distance based matching technique has been used for making the decision. It has
been tested on a data set of 1750 image samples collected from 341 individuals.
The accuracy of the verification system is found to be 99.26% with false
rejection rate (FRR) of 0.03%.
