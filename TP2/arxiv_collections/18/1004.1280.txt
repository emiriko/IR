After discussing the relevance of statistical physics in molecular
recognition processes, we present a schematic model for ligand-receptor
association based on an Ising chain. We discuss the possible behaviors of the
affinity when the stiffness of the ligand increases. We also consider the case
of flexible receptors. A variety of interesting behaviors is obtained,
including some affinity modulation upon bond hardening of softening. The
affinity of a ligand for its receptor is shown to depend on the details of
their rigidity profile, and we question the possibility of encoding information
in the rigidities as well as in the shape. An exhaustive study of the
selectivity of patterns with length $n<8$ is carried on. Connection with other
spin models, in particular spin glasses is mentioned in conclusion.
