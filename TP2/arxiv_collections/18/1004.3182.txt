We consider a way to generate operational inequalities to test
nonclassicality (or quantumness) of multimode (or multiparty) bosonic fields
that unifies the derivation of many known inequalities and allows to propose
new ones. The nonclassicality criteria are based on Vogel's criterion
corresponding to analyzing the positivity of multimode P functions or,
equivalently, the positivity of matrices of expectation values of, e.g.,
creation and annihilation operators. We analyze not only monomials, but also
polynomial functions of such moments, which can sometimes enable simpler
derivations of physically relevant inequalities. As an example, we derive
various classical inequalities which can be violated only by nonclassical
fields. In particular, we show how the criteria introduced here easily reduce
to the well-known inequalities describing: (a) multimode quadrature squeezing
and its generalizations including sum, difference and principal squeezing, (b)
two-mode one-time photon-number correlations including sub-Poisson
photon-number correlations and effects corresponding to violations of the
Cauchy-Schwarz and Muirhead inequalities, (c) two-time single-mode
photon-number correlations including photon antibunching and hyperbunching, and
(d) two- and three-mode quantum entanglement. Other simple inequalities for
testing nonclassicality are also proposed. We have found some general relations
between the nonclassicality and entanglement criteria, in particular, those
resulting from the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. It is shown that some known
entanglement inequalities can be derived as nonclassicality inequalities within
our formalism, while some other known entanglement inequalities can be seen as
sums of more than one inequality derived from the nonclassicality criterion.
This approach enables a deeper analysis of the entanglement for a given
nonclassicality.
