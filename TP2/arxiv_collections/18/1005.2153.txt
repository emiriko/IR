We present the coherent excitation of a single Rubidium atom to the Rydberg
state (58d3/2) using a two-photon transition. The experimental setup is
described in detail, as well as experimental techniques and procedures. The
coherence of the excitation is revealed by observing Rabi oscillations between
ground and Rydberg states of the atom. We analyze the observed oscillations in
detail and compare them to numerical simulations which include imperfections of
our experimental system. Strategies for future improvements on the coherent
manipulation of a single atom in our settings are given.
