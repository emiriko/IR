VisIVO is an integrated suite of tools and services specifically designed for
the Virtual Observatory. This suite constitutes a software framework for
effective visual discovery in currently available (and next-generation) very
large-scale astrophysical datasets. VisIVO consists of VisiVO Desktop - a stand
alone application for interactive visualization on standard PCs, VisIVO Server
- a grid-enabled platform for high performance visualization and VisIVO Web - a
custom designed web portal supporting services based on the VisIVO Server
functionality. The main characteristic of VisIVO is support for
high-performance, multidimensional visualization of very large-scale
astrophysical datasets. Users can obtain meaningful visualizations rapidly
while preserving full and intuitive control of the relevant visualization
parameters. This paper focuses on newly developed integrated tools in VisIVO
Server allowing intuitive visual discovery with 3D views being created from
data tables. VisIVO Server can be installed easily on any web server with a
database repository. We discuss briefly aspects of our implementation of VisiVO
Server on a computational grid and also outline the functionality of the
services offered by VisIVO Web. Finally we conclude with a summary of our work
and pointers to future developments.
