We show that the maximum clique problem (decision version) can be expressed
in existential second order (ESO) logic, where the first order part is a Horn
formula in second-order quantified predicates. Without ordering, the first
order part is $\Pi_2$ Horn; if ordering is used, then it is universal Horn (in
which case, the second order variables can be determined in polynomial time).
UPDATE: Manuscript withdrawn, because results are incorrect. If phi = phi_1 AND
phi_2, and phi is a Horn formula, it does NOT mean that both phi_1 and phi_2
are Horn formulae. Furthermore, the cardinality constraint CANNOT be expressed
as a universal Horn sentence in ESO (NOT even when the structure is ordered).
Graedel's theorem is valid at a lower (machine) level, but probably NOT at a
higher level.
