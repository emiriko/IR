We study the formalization of a collection of documents created for a
Software Engineering project from an MKM perspective. We analyze how document
and collection markup formats can cope with an open-ended, multi-dimensional
space of primary and secondary classifications and relationships. We show that
RDFa-based extensions of MKM formats, employing flexible "metadata"
relationships referencing specific vocabularies for distinct dimensions, are
well-suited to encode this and to put it into service. This formalized
knowledge can be used for enriching interactive document browsing, for enabling
multi-dimensional metadata queries over documents and collections, and for
exporting Linked Data to the Semantic Web and thus enabling further reuse.
