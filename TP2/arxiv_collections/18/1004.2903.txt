We present a new proof of an Ergodic theorem for Wide-Sense Stationary Random
Processes added with a new canonical sampling theorem of mine for finite time
duration signals in the frequency domain (periodograms) which is free from the
Nyquist interval restriction.We point out the usefulness of such theorem in the
context of a model of random vibrations transmission (pressure-explosive
fluctuations).Replacement due to inadvertent and wrong acknowledgments
