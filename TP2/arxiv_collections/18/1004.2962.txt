THz and infrared spectroscopy is widely utilized to investigate the
electrodynamic properties of the novel iron-based superconductors in the normal
and superconducting states. Besides electronic excitations and correlations,
electron-phonon coupling and the influence of magnetism, the experiments yield
important information on low-lying excitations and help to clarify the number
and symmetry of superconducting gaps. While the experimental data of different
groups converge, the interpretation is still under debate. Here we review the
status of optical investigations on the superconducting state for the 122 and
11 family of iron pnictides.
