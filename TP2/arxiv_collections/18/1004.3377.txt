In this paper we consider a stable particle with flavor mixing. We
demonstrate that incoherent conversion of heavy mass eigenstates into light
ones and vice versa can occur, as a result of elastic scattering. This effect
is nontrivial for non-relativistic particles, for which the standard flavor
oscillation ceases rapidly due to incoherence. We also prove that if a heavy
state is bound in a gravitational potential and a light state is unbound, the
mass-state conversion can lead to gradual "evaporation" of the mixed particle
from the potential. A number of implications, ranging from the cosmic neutrino
background distortions to scenarios of cold dark matter evaporation from halos,
are addressed.
