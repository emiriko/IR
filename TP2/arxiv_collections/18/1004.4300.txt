The coherent evolution of two atomic qubits mediated by a set of bosonic
field modes is investigated. By assuming a specific encoding of the quantum
states in the internal levels of the two atoms we show that entangling quantum
gates can be realised, with high fidelity, even when a large number of
mediating modes is involved. The effect of losses and imperfections on the
gates' operation is also considered in detail.
