The goal of this paper is to extend the framework of finite size analysis
recently developed for quantum key distribution to continuous-variable
protocols. We do not solve this problem completely here, and we mainly consider
the finite size effects on the parameter estimation procedure. Despite the fact
that some questions are left open, we are able to give an estimation of the
secret key rate for protocols which do not contain a postselection procedure.
As expected, these results are significantly more pessimistic than the ones
obtained in the asymptotic regime. However, we show that recent
continuous-variable protocols are able to provide fully secure secret keys in
the finite size scenario, over distances larger than 50 km.
