IGR J16493-4348 is a supergiant high mass X-ray binary discovered by INTEGRAL
in 2004. The source is detected at a significance level of $\sim21$ standard
deviations in the Swift-BAT survey data collected during the first 54 months of
the Swift mission. The timing analysis reveals an orbital period of $\sim$6.78
days and the presence of a full eclipse of the compact ob\ ject. The dynamical
range (variability up to a factor $\sim$20) observed during the BAT monitoring
suggests that IGR J16493-4348 is a wind-fed system. The derived semi-major axis
of the binary system is $\sim55 R_{\sun}$ with an orbit eccentr\ icity lower
than 0.15.
