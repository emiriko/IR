We report pronounced magnetoconductance oscillations observed on suspended
bilayer and trilayer graphene devices with mobilities up to 270,000 cm2/Vs. For
bilayer devices, we observe conductance minima at all integer filling factors
nu between 0 and -8, as well as a small plateau at {\nu}=1/3. For trilayer
devices, we observe features at nu=-1, -2, -3 and -4, and at {\nu}~0.5 that
persist to 4.5K at B=8T. All of these features persist for all accessible
values of Vg and B, and could suggest the onset of symmetry breaking of the
first few Landau (LL) levels and fractional quantum Hall states.
