In this paper, we prove that a non-semisimple Hopf algebra H of dimension 4p
with p an odd prime over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero
is pointed provided H contains more than two group-like elements. In
particular, we prove that non-semisimple Hopf algebras of dimensions 20, 28 and
44 are pointed or their duals are pointed, and this completes the
classification of Hopf algebras in these dimensions.
