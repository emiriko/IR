Aiming to perform a study of the warm dust and gas in the luminous blue
variable star G79.29+0.46 and its associated nebula, we present infrared
Spitzer imaging and spectroscopy, and new CO J=2-->1 and 4-->3 maps obtained
with the IRAM 30m radio telescope and with the Submillimeter Telescope,
respectively. We have analyzed the nebula detecting multiple shells of dust and
gas connected to the star. Using Infrared Spectrograph-Spitzer spectra, we have
compared the properties of the central object, the nebula, and their
surroundings. These spectra show a rich variety of solid-state features
(amorphous silicates, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and CO2 ices) and
narrow emission lines, superimposed on a thermal continuum. We have also
analyzed the physical conditions of the nebula, which point to the existence of
a photo-dissociation region.
