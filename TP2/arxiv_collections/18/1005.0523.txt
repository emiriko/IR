We present several new examples of speed-ups obtainable by quantum algorithms
in the context of property testing. First, motivated by sampling algorithms, we
consider probability distributions given in the form of an oracle
$f:[n]\to[m]$. Here the probability $\PP_f(j)$ of an outcome $j\in[m]$ is the
fraction of its domain that $f$ maps to $j$. We give quantum algorithms for
testing whether two such distributions are identical or $\epsilon$-far in
$L_1$-norm. Recently, Bravyi, Hassidim, and Harrow \cite{BHH10} showed that if
$\PP_f$ and $\PP_g$ are both unknown (i.e., given by oracles $f$ and $g$), then
this testing can be done in roughly $\sqrt{m}$ quantum queries to the
functions. We consider the case where the second distribution is known, and
show that testing can be done with roughly $m^{1/3}$ quantum queries, which we
prove to be essentially optimal. In contrast, it is known that classical
testing algorithms need about $m^{2/3}$ queries in the unknown-unknown case and
about $\sqrt{m}$ queries in the known-unknown case. Based on this result, we
also reduce the query complexity of graph isomorphism testers with quantum
oracle access. While those examples provide polynomial quantum speed-ups, our
third example gives a much larger improvement (constant quantum queries vs
polynomial classical queries) for the problem of testing periodicity, based on
Shor's algorithm and a modification of a classical lower bound by Lachish and
Newman \cite{lachish&newman:periodicity}. This provides an alternative to a
recent constant-vs-polynomial speed-up due to Aaronson \cite{aaronson:bqpph}.
