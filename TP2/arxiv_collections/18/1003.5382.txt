We investigate the experimental capabilities required to test whether black
holes destroy information. We show that an experiment capable of illuminating
the information puzzle must necessarily be able to detect or manipulate
macroscopic superpositions (i.e., Everett branches). Hence, it could also
address the fundamental question of decoherence versus wavefunction collapse.
