By considering the logarithmic correction to the energy density, we study the
behavior of Hubble parameter in the holographic dark energy model. We assume
that the universe is dominated by interacting dark energy and matter and the
accelerated expansion of the universe, which may be occurred in the early
universe or late time, is studied.
