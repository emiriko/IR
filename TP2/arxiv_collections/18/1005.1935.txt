Theoretical and experimental work have not provided a consistent picture of
the phase diagram of the nearly ideal Ising ferromagnet LiHoF4 in a transverse
magnetic field. Using a newly fabricated capacitive dilatometer, we have
investigated the thermal expansion and magnetostriction of LiHoF4 in magnetic
fields applied perpendicular to the Ising direction. Critical points for the
ferromagnetic phase transition have been determined from both methods in the
classical paramagnetic to ferromagnetic regime. Excellent agreement has been
found with existing experimental data suggesting that, in this regime, the
current theoretical calculations have not entirely captured the physics of this
interesting model system.
