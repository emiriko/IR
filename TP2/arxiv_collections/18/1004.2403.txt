To every matroid, we associate a class in the K-theory of the Grassmannian.
We study this class using the method of equivariant localization. In
particular, we provide a geometric interpretation of the Tutte polynomial. We
also extend results of the second author concerning the behavior of such
classes under direct sum, series and parallel connection and two-sum; these
results were previously only established for realizable matroids, and their
earlier proofs were more difficult.
