It is by the long established fact in experiment and theory that
electromagnetic waves, here as one component of an IED particle, passing a
double slit will undergo self inference each, producing at a detector plane
fringed intensities. The wave generating point charge of a zero rest mass, as
the other component of the particle, is maintained a constant energy and speed
by a repeated radiation reabsorption/reemission scheme, and in turn steered in
direction in its linear motion by the reflected radiation field, and will
thereby travel to the detector along (one of) the optical path(s) of the waves
leading to a bright interference fringe. We elucidate the process formally
based on first principles solutions for the IED particle and known principles
for wave-matter interaction.
