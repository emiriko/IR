The inflationary paradigm enjoys a very wide acceptance in the cosmological
community, due in large part to the fact that it is said to "naturally account"
for a nearly scale independent power primordial spectrum of fluctuations which
is in very good agreement with the observations. The expected overall scale of
the fluctuations in most models, turns out to be too large, because it is
inversely proportional to the slow roll parameter, which is expected to be very
small. This fact requires the fine tuning of the inflaton potential. In series
of recent works it has been argued that the success of the inflationary picture
is not fully justified in terms of the rules of quantum theory as applied to
the cosmological setting and that an extra element, something akin to a self
induced collapse of the wave function is required. There, it was suggested that
the incorporation of such collapse in the treatment might avoid the need for
fine tuning of the potential that afflicts most inflationary models. In this
article we will discuss in detail the manner in which one obtains the
estimation of the magnitude of the perturbations in the new scheme and that of
the standard accounts, comparing one of the most popular among the later and
that corresponding to the new proposal. We will see that the proposal includes
a collapse scheme that bypasses the problem, but we will see that the price
seems to a be a teleological, and thus unphysical, fine tuning of the
characteristics of collapse.
