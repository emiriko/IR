With applying of new proposed electromagnetic gravity Lagrangian together
with Einstein-Hilbert equation not zero space curvature was derived. The
curvature gives "a priory" postulate of equivalence of mass and electromagnetic
field gravity properties. The non zero trace of energy-stress tensor of
electrical field changes space curvature of gravity mass, which yields to
prediction of dependence of capacitor gravity mass from capacitor capacitance
and voltage values, observed in Biefeld-Brown effect. The other, not observed
prediction could be applied to coil gravity mass dependence from coil
inductance and current values. New physical constant, electromagnetic field
gravity constant, was introduced to conform with theoretical and experimental
data.
