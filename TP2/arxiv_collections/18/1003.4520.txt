Graphene has been considered by many as a revolutionary material with
electronic and structural properties that surpass conventional semiconductors
and metals. Due to its superlative qualities, graphene is being considered as
the reference material for a post-CMOS technology. Furthermore, graphene is
also quite unusual electronically since its electric carriers behave as if they
were massless and relativistic, the so-called Dirac particles. Because of its
exotic electronic properties, theorists are being forced to revisit the
conceptual basis for the theory of metals. Hence, graphene seems to be
unveiling a new era in science and technology with still unseen consequences.
