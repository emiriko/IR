We determine the infrared behaviour of the BFKL forward amplitude for
gluon-gluon scattering. Our approach, based on the discrete pomeron solution,
leads to an excellent description of the new combined inclusive HERA data at
low values of x (<0.01) and at the same time determines the unintegrated gluon
density inside the proton, for squared transverse momenta of the gluon less
than 100 GeV^2. The phases of this amplitude are sensitive to the
non-perturbative gluonic dynamics and could be sensitive to the presence of
Beyond-the-Standard-Model particles at very high energies.
