Many microorganisms swim through gels and non-Newtonian fluids in their
natural environments. In this paper, we focus on microorganisms which use
flagella for propulsion. We address how swimming velocities are affected in
nonlinearly viscoelastic fluids by examining the problem of an infinitely long
cylinder with arbitrary beating motion in the Oldroyd-B fluid. We solve for the
swimming velocity in the limit in which deflections of the cylinder from its
straight configuration are small relative to the radius of the cylinder and the
wavelength of the deflections; furthermore, the radius of the cylinder is small
compared to the wavelength of deflections. We find that swimming velocities are
diminished by nonlinear viscoelastic effects. We apply these results to examine
what types of swimming motions can produce net translation in a nonlinear
fluid, comparing to the Newtonian case, for which Purcell's "scallop" theorem
describes how time-reversibility constrains which swimming motions are
effective. We find that the leading order violation of the scallop theorem
occurs for reciprocal motions in which the backward and forward strokes occur
at different rates.
