The most critical component of any adaptive numerical quadrature routine is
the estimation of the integration error. Since the publication of the first
algorithms in the 1960s, many error estimation schemes have been presented,
evaluated and discussed. This paper presents a review of existing error
estimation techniques and discusses their differences and their common
features. Some common shortcomings of these algorithms are discussed and a new
general error estimation technique is presented.
