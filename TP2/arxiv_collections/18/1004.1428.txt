We review some of the possible models that are able to describe the current
Universe which point out the future singularities that could appear. We show
that the study of the dark energy accretion onto black- and worm-holes
phenomena in these models could lead to unexpected consequences, allowing even
the avoidance of the considered singularities. We also review the debate about
the approach used to study the accretion phenomenon which has appeared in
literature to demonstrate the advantages and drawbacks of the different points
of view. We finally suggest new lines of research to resolve the shortcomings
of the different accretion methods. We then discuss future directions for new
possible observations that could help choose the most accurate model.
