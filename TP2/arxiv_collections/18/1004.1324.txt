This paper examines the problem of introducing advanced forms of
fault-tolerance via reconfiguration into safety-critical avionic systems. This
is required to enable increased availability after fault occurrence in
distributed integrated avionic systems(compared to static federated systems).
The approach taken is to identify a migration path from current architectures
to those that incorporate re-configuration to a lesser or greater degree. Other
challenges identified include change of the development process; incremental
and flexible timing and safety analyses; configurable kernels applicable for
safety-critical systems.
