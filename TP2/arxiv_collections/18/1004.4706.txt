By using a coherent state quantization of paragrassmann variables, operators
are constructed in finite Hilbert spaces. We thus obtain in a straightforward
way a matrix representation of the paragrassmann algebra. This algebra of
finite matrices realizes a deformed Weyl-Heisenberg algebra. The study of mean
values in coherent states of some of these operators lead to interesting
conclusions.
