Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS) experiments have provided important
information on the structure of hadrons and ultimately the structure of matter
and on the nature of interactions between leptons and hadrons, since the
discovery of partons. Various high energy deep inelastic interactions lead to
different evolution equations from which we obtain various structure functions
giving information about the partons i.e. quarks and gluons involved in
different scattering processes. Actually structure function is a mathematical
picture of the hadron structure in the high energy region. Understanding the
behaviour of the structure functions of the nucleon at low-x, where x is the
Bjorken variable, is interesting both theoretically and phenomenologically.
Structure functions are important inputs in many high energy processes and also
important for examination of perturbative quantum chromodynamics (PQCD), the
underlying dynamics of quarks and gluons. In PQCD, for high-Q2, where Q2 is the
four momentum transfer in a DIS process, the Q2-evolutions of these densities
(at fixed-x) are given by mainly Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi
(DGLAP) Evolution Equations. In this thesis, we solved both spin-independent
and spin-dependent DGLAP evolution equations applying Regge behaviour of
structure functions at low-x up-to next-next-to-leading order (NNLO) and have
got the respective approximate analytical solutions of structure functions.
