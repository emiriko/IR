We investigate the mechanism in the tunneling dynamics of open ultracold
few-boson systems by numerically solving the time-dependent few-boson
Schr\"{o}dinger equation exactly. By starting from a weakly repulsive,
initially coherent two-boson system we demonstrate that the decay dynamics
incorporate fragmentation. The wavefunction of the tunneling state exhibits a
pronounced dynamically-stable pattern which we explain by an analytical model.
By studying more bosons and stronger interactions we arrive to the conclusion
that the decay by tunneling is not a coherent process and exhibits a wealth of
phenomena depending on the interaction between the particles.
