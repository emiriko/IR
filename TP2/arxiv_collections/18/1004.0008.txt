We consider explicit models of dynamical supersymmetry breaking where dark
matter is a 10 -- 100 TeV strongly-interacting composite state carrying no
standard model quantum numbers. These constructions are simple variants of
well-known supersymmetry breaking mechanisms, augmented to allow for a large
"flavor" symmetry. Dark matter is the lightest composite modulus charged under
this symmetry and is a viable cold dark matter candidate with a thermal relic
abundance. This is an attractive possibility in low-scale gauge-mediated
scenarios where the gravitino is the lightest superparticle. A light R-axion
associated with supersymmetry breaking is present in these hidden sectors and
serves as the portal between dark matter and the standard model. Such scenarios
are relevant for present and future indirect detection experiments.
