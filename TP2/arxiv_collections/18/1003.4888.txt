The complex nature of the magnetic ground state in La$_{1-x}$A$_{x}$CoO$_{3}$
(A = Ca, Sr, Ba) has been investigated via neutron scattering. It was
previously observed that ferromagnetic (FM) as well as antiferromagnetic (AFM)
correlations can coexist prior to the insulator-metal transition (IMT). We
focused on a unique region in the Ba phase diagram, from x = 0.17 - 0.22, in
which a commensurate AFM phase appears first with a propagation vector, k = (0,
-0.5, 0.5), and the Co moment in the (001)$_{R}$ plane of the rhombohedral
lattice. With increasing x, the AFM component weakens while an FM order appears
with the FM Co moment directed along the (001)$_{R}$ (=(111)$_{C}$) axis. By x
= 0.22, a spin flip to new FM component appears as the crystal fully transforms
to an orthorhombic (Pnma) structure, with the Co moments pointing along a new
direction, (001)$_{O}$ (=(110)$_{C}$). It is the emergence of the magnetic Pnma
phase that leads to IMT.
