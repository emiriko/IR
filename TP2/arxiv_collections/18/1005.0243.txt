Based on our earlier works [Phys. Rev. B 75, 195127 (2007) & J. Chem. Phys.
128, 234703 (2008)], we propose a formally exact and numerically convenient
approach to simulate time-dependent quantum transport from first-principles.
The proposed approach combines time-dependent density functional theory with
quantum dissipation theory, and results in a useful tool for studying transient
dynamics of electronic systems. Within the proposed exact theoretical
framework, we construct a number of practical schemes for simulating realistic
systems such as nanoscopic electronic devices. Computational cost of each
scheme is analyzed, with the expected level of accuracy discussed. As a
demonstration, a simulation based on the adiabatic wide-band limit
approximation scheme is carried out to characterize the transient current
response of a carbon nanotube based electronic device under time-dependent
external voltages.
