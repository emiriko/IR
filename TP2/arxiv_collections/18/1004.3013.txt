In this paper, we consider non-autonomous Ornstein-Uhlenbeck operators in
smooth exterior domains $\Omega\subset \R^d$ subject to Dirichlet boundary
conditions. Under suitable assumptions on the coefficients, the solution of the
corresponding non-autonomous parabolic Cauchy problem is governed by an
evolution system $\{P_\Omega(t,s)\}_{0\leq s\leq t}$ on $L^p(\Omega)$ for $1< p
< \infty$. Furthermore, $L^p$-estimates for spatial derivatives and $L^p$-$L^q$
smoothing properties of $P_\Omega(t,s)$, $0\leq s\leq t$, are obtained.
