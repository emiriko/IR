In this paper, we emphasize the need for data cleansing when clustering
large-scale transaction databases and propose a new data cleansing method that
improves clustering quality and performance. We evaluate our data cleansing
method through a series of experiments. As a result, the clustering quality and
performance were significantly improved by up to 165% and 330%, respectively.
