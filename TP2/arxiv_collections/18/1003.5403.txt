It is demonstrated that energy is conserved during runaway motion of a
radiating charge, and during free fall of a charge in a field of gravity. The
decisive role of the Schott energy in this connection is made clear. Also it is
pointed out that a proton and a neutron fall with the same acceleration in a
uniform gravitational field although the proton radiates and the neutron does
not.
