The aim of this article is to give a quantization of some coisotropic
subalgebras in complex semisimple Lie bialgebras. The coisotropic subalgebras
that will be quantized are those given by Zambon in his paper "`A Construction
for coisotropic subalgebras of Lie Bialgebras"' [Zam08]. We will also extend
the construction for the exceptional complex semisimple Lie bialgebras.
