Enhanced fluctuations and correlations have been observed in the phase
transitions of many systems. Their appearance at the predicted QCD phase
transition (especially near the expected critical point) may provide insight
into the nature of the phase transition. Recent results from the STAR
experiment will be presented with a focus on particle ratio (K/$\pi$ and
p/$\pi$) fluctuations, forward-backward multiplicity correlations, and balance
functions. Also discussed will be possibilities for measuring these
correlations and fluctuations in the recently initiated beam energy scan at
RHIC.
