Consider a compact Riemannian manifold M of dimension n whose boundary
\partial M is totally geodesic and is isometric to the standard sphere S^{n-1}.
A natural conjecture of Min-Oo asserts that if the scalar curvature of M is at
least n(n-1), then M is isometric to the hemisphere S_+^n equipped with its
standard metric. This conjecture is inspired by the positive mass theorem in
general relativity, and has been verified in many special cases. In this paper,
we construct counterexamples to Min-Oo's conjecture in dimension n \geq 3.
