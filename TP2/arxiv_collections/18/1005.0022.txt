To precisely measure jets over a large background such as pile up in high
luminosity p+p collisions at LHC, a new generation of jet reconstruction
algorithms is developed. These algorithms are also applicable to reconstruct
jets in the heavy ion environment where large event multiplicities are
produced. Energy loss in the medium created in heavy ion collisions are already
observed indirectly via inclusive hadron distributions and di-hadron
correlations. Jets can be used to study this energy loss in detail with reduced
biases. We review the latest results on jet-medium interactions as seen in A+A
collisions at RHIC, focusing on the recent progress on jet reconstruction in
heavy ion collisions.
