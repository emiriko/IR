We present a lithography-free technique for fabrication of clean, high
quality graphene devices. This technique is based on evaporation through hard
Si shadow masks, and eliminates contaminants introduced by lithographical
processes. We demonstrate that devices fabricated by this technique have
significantly higher mobility values than those by standard electron beam
lithography. To obtain ultra-high mobility devices, we extend this technique to
fabricate suspended graphene samples with mobility as high as 120,000 cm^2/Vs.
