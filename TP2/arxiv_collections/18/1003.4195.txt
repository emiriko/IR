We present experimental data and a theoretical interpretation on the
conductance near the metal-insulator transition in thin ferromagnetic Gd films
of thickness b approximately 2-10 nm. A large phase relaxation rate caused by
scattering of quasiparticles off spin wave excitations renders the dephasing
length L_phi < b in the range of sheet resistances considered, so that the
effective dimension is d = 3. The observed approximate fractional temperature
power law of the conductivity is ascribed to the scaling regime near the
transition. The conductivity data as a function of temperature and disorder
strength collapse on to two scaling curves for the metallic and insulating
regimes. The best fit is obtained for a dynamical exponent z approximately 2.5
and a correlation length critical exponent \nu' approximately 1.4 on the
metallic side and a localization length exponent \nu approximately 0.8 on the
insulating side.
