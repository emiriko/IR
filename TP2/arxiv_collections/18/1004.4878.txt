Understanding mechanical properties of materials requires not only complete
determination of the three-dimensional response at a local scale, but also
knowledge of the mode or the mechanism by which deformation takes place.
Probing mechanical response at such a depth can be only achieved through a
diffraction based method. In spite of this, diffraction based methods still are
not commonly employed for strain measurements because they are perceived as
very time intensive and non-intuitive. Herein we introduce the concept of a
diffraction strain ellipsoid, and show how its shape, thickness, and
orientation represent the complete deformation state in a powerfully visual and
intuitive way. We also show how the geometry of the ellipsoid can be very
quickly determined from x-ray diffraction data obtained using a large area
detector, and how it can be used to understand micromechanical deformation of
nanocrystalline materials.
