Instruments for radio astronomical observations have come a long way. While
the first telescopes were based on very large dishes and 2-antenna
interferometers, current instruments consist of dozens of steerable dishes,
whereas future instruments will be even larger distributed sensor arrays with a
hierarchy of phased array elements. For such arrays to provide meaningful
output (images), accurate calibration is of critical importance. Calibration
must solve for the unknown antenna gains and phases, as well as the unknown
atmospheric and ionospheric disturbances. Future telescopes will have a large
number of elements and a large field of view. In this case the parameters are
strongly direction dependent, resulting in a large number of unknown parameters
even if appropriately constrained physical or phenomenological descriptions are
used. This makes calibration a daunting parameter estimation task, that is
reviewed from a signal processing perspective in this article.
