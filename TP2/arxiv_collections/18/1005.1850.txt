We study flavor-conserving radiative decays of double heavy baryons using a
manifestly Lorentz covariant constituent three-quark model. Decay rates are
calculated and compared to each other in the full theory, keeping masses
finite, and also in the heavy quark limit. We discuss in some detail hyperfine
mixing effects.
