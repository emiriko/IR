The rapid development of telecommunication networks is driven by user demands
for new applications and advances in technologies. The explosive growth of the
internet traffic is due to its use for collecting the information,
communication, multimedia application, entertainment, etc. These applications
are imposing a tremendous demand for bandwidth capacity on telecommunication
network. The introduction of fiber optics had proved to meet the huge demand of
bandwidth. These requirement can be meet by all optical network which is
capable of transmitting enormous data at very high speed, around 50 Tera bits
per seconds (Tbps) A wavelength conversion technique is addressed in this paper
to reduced the blocking probability in wavelength routed networks. It is seen
that the blocking probability of traffic requests decreases as the wavelength
conversion factor increases. We explode the possibility for network with
different size with variation in wavelength per link. In this work the
evaluation of wavelength routed optical network with varying number of
wavelength converters, different traffic types are carried out and results are
shown that the blocking probability is minimum with 50% to 60% wavelength
convertible nodes. Wavelength convertible nodes more than 60% are not showing
much effect on reduction in blocking probability rather it results in increase
in overall cost of network.
