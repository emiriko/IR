We consider, for a diffusion process in R^n, the Gallavotti-Cohen functional,
defined as the empirical power dissipated in a time interval by the
non-conservative part of the drift. We prove a large deviation principle in the
limit in which the noise vanishes and the time interval diverges. The
corresponding rate functional, which satisfies the fluctuation theorem, is
expressed in terms of a variational problem on the classical Freidlin-Wentzell
functional.
