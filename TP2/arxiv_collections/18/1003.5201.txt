We show that layered quenched randomness in planar magnets leads to an
unusual intermediate phase between the conventional ferromagnetic
low-temperature and paramagnetic high-temperature phases. In this intermediate
phase, which is part of the Griffiths region, the spin-wave stiffness
perpendicular to the random layers displays anomalous scaling behavior, with a
continuously variable anomalous exponent, while the magnetization and the
stiffness parallel to the layers both remain finite. Analogous results hold for
superfluids and superconductors. We study the two phase transitions into the
anomalous elastic phase, and we discuss the universality of these results, and
implications of finite sample size as well as possible experiments.
