We analyze the critical transitions (a) to endemic states in an SIS
epidemiological model, and (b) to full synchronization in an ensemble of
coupled chaotic maps, on networks where, at any given time, each node is
connected to just one neighbour. In these "monogamous" populations, the lack of
connectivity in the instantaneous interaction pattern -that would prevent both
the propagation of an infection and the collective entrainment into
synchronization- is compensated by occasional random reconnections which
recombine interacting couples by exchanging their partners. The transitions to
endemic states and to synchronization are recovered if the recombination rate
is sufficiently large, thus giving rise to a bifurcation as this rate varies.
We study this new critical phenomenon both analytically and numerically.
