P. Broussous and S. Stevens studied maps between enlarged Bruhat-Tits
buildings to construct types for p-adic unitary groups. They needed maps which
respect the Moy-Prasad filtrations. That property is called (CLF), i.e.
compatibility with the Lie algebra filtrations. In the first part of this
thesis we generalise their results on such maps to the Quaternion-algebra case.
Let k0 be a p-adic field of residue characteristic not two. We consider a
semisimple k0-rational Lie algebra element beta of a unitary group G:=U(h)
defined over k0 with a signed hermitian form h. Let H be the centraliser of
beta in G. We prove the existence of an affine H(k0)-equivariant CLF-map j from
the enlarged Bruhat-Tits building B^1(H,k0) to B^1(G,k0). As conjectured by
Broussous the CLF-property determines j, if none of the factors of H is
k0-isomorphic to the isotropic orthogonal group of k0-rank one and all factors
are unitary groups. Under the weaker assumption that the affine CLF-map j is
only equivariant under the center of H^0(k0) it is uniquely determined up to a
translation of B^1(H,k0). The second part is devoted to the decoding of
embedding types by the geometry of a CLF-map. Embedding types have been studied
by Broussous and M. Grabitz. We consider a division algebra D of finite index
with a p-adic center F. The construction of simple types for GLn(D) in the
Budhnell-Kutzko framework required an investigation of strata which had to
fulfil a rigidity property. Giving a stratum especially means to fix a pair
(E,a) consisting of a field extension E|F in Mn(D) and a hereditary order a
which is stable under conjugation by E^x, in other words we fix an embedding of
E^x into the normalizer of a. Broussous and Grabitz classified these pairs with
invariants. We describe and prove a way to decode these invariants using the
geometry of a CLF-map.
