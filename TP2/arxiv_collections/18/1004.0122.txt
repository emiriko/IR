Each irreducible component of the first resonance variety of a hyperplane
arrangement naturally determines a codimension one foliation on the ambient
space. The superposition of these foliations define what we call the resonance
web of the arrangement. In this paper we initiate the study of these objects
with emphasis on their spaces of abelian relations.
