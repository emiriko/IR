A regular language L is said to be cellular if there exists a 1-dimensional
cellular automaton CA such that L is the language consisting of the finite
blocks associated with CA. It is shown that cellularity of a regular language
is decidable using a new characterization of cellular languages formulated by
Freiling, Goldstein and Moews and implied by a deep result of Boyle in symbolic
dynamics.
