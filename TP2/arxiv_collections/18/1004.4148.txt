In the distant past, astronomy was often intertwined with religion into a
unified cosmos. As science became a distinct cultural enterprise, astronomy has
witnessed a variety of rich interactions with other fields. Mathematical
statistics was stimulated in the 19th century by astronomical problems, and
today astrostatistics is a small but growing cross-disciplinary field advancing
methodology to address challenges in astronomical data analysis. Throughout the
20th century, astronomy became closely allied with physics such that astronomy
and astrophysics are now profoundly intertwined. Physical chemistry played a
major role in the identification of molecules in the Milky Way Galaxy, and
astrochemistry is now an active subfield giving insights into cosmic molecular
processes. The importance of cross-disciplinary interactions with engineering
(for instrumentation), Earth sciences (for planetary studies), computer science
(for astroinformatics) and life sciences (for astrobiology) is also growing.
Cross-disciplinary research has been essential both for crucial discoveries in
astronomy and for improving the quality of astronomical research. It should be
fostered with increased flexibility in the training of young astronomers and
with sufficient funding to nurture these fields.
