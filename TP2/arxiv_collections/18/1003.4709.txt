We analyse the dispersion relation of ripplons, on the surface of superfluid
helium, using the dispersive hydrodynamics approach and find a new ripplon
branch. We obtain analytical equation for the dispersion relation and analytic
expressions for the limiting cases. We discuss where ripplons can exist in the
energy-wavenumber plane. A numerical solution for the ripplon dispersion curve
is obtained in the allowed regions. The new ripplon branch is found at energies
just below the instability point.
