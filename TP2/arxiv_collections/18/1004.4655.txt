We review the Moyal and Wick-Voros products, and more in general the
translation invariant non-commutative products, and apply them to classical and
quantum field theory. We investigate phi^4 field theories calculating their
Green's functions up to one-loop for the two- and four-point cases. We also
review the connections of these theories with Drinfeld twists.
