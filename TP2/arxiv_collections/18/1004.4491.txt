The dominance of string theory in the research landscape of quantum gravity
physics (despite any direct experimental evidence) can, I think, be justified
in a variety of ways. Here I focus on an argument from mathematical fertility,
broadly similar to Hilary Putnam's 'no miracles argument' that, I argue, many
string theorists in fact espouse. String theory leads to many surprising,
useful, and well-confirmed mathematical 'predictions' - here I focus on mirror
symmetry. These predictions are made on the basis of general physical
principles entering into string theory. The success of the mathematical
predictions are then seen as evidence for framework that generated them. I
attempt to defend this argument, but there are nonetheless some serious
objections to be faced. These objections can only be evaded at a high
(philosophical) price.
