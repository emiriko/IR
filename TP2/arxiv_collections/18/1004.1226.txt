I will propose that the reality to which the quantum formalism implicitly
refers is a kind of generalized history, the word history having here the same
meaning as in the phrase sum-over-histories. This proposal confers a certain
independence on the concept of event, and it modifies the rules of inference
concerning events in order to resolve a contradiction between the idea of
reality as a single history and the principle that events of zero measure
cannot happen (the Kochen-Specker paradox being a classic expression of this
contradiction). The so-called measurement problem is then solved if macroscopic
events satisfy classical rules of inference, and this can in principle be
decided by a calculation. The resulting conception of reality involves neither
multiple worlds nor external observers. It is therefore suitable for quantum
gravity in general and causal sets in particular.
