The XENON100 experiment, in operation at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran
Sasso in Italy, is designed to search for dark matter WIMPs scattering off 62
kg of liquid xenon in an ultra-low background dual-phase time projection
chamber. In this letter, we present first dark matter results from the analysis
of 11.17 live days of non-blind data, acquired in October and November 2009. In
the selected fiducial target of 40 kg, and within the pre-defined signal
region, we observe no events and hence exclude spin-independent WIMP-nucleon
elastic scattering cross-sections above 3.4 x 10^-44 cm^2 for 55 GeV/c^2 WIMPs
at 90% confidence level. Below 20 GeV/c^2, this result constrains the
interpretation of the CoGeNT and DAMA signals as being due to spin-independent,
elastic, light mass WIMP interactions.
