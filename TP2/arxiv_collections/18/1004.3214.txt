The influence of Coulomb correlation on magnetic and spectral properties in
metallic rutile phase of vanadium dioxide is studied by state of the art
LDA+DMFT method. Calculation results in strongly correlated metallic state with
an effective mass renormalization $m^*/m\approx2$. Uniform magnetic
susceptibility shows Curie-Weiss temperature dependence with effective magnetic
moment, $p_{eff}^{theor} = 1.54 \mu_B$, in a good agreement with the
experimental value $p_{eff}^{exp} = 1.53 \mu_B$ that is close to ideal value
for V$^{4+}$ ion with the spin $S=1/2$, $p_{eff} = 1.73 \mu_B$. Calculated
spectral function shows well developed Hubbard bands observabale in the recent
experimental photoemission spectra. We conclude that VO2 in rutile phase is
strongly correlated metal with local magnetic moments formed by vanadium
$d$-electrons.
