Screening in plasma with Bose-Einstein condensate is studied. Finite
temperature effects are taken into account. It is shown that, due to condensate
effects, the potential has several unusual features. It contains two
oscillating terms, one of which is analogous to the fermionic Friedel
oscillations in standard QED, and a power law decreasing term. In the $T \to 0$
limit, only one of the oscillating terms survives. On the whole, any charge
impurity is screened more efficiently than in ordinary plasma.
