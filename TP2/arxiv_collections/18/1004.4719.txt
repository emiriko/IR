In this paper, we investigate a relation between finite graphs, simplicial
flag complexes and right-angled Coxeter groups, and we provide a class of
reconstructible finite graphs. We show that if $\Gamma$ is a finite graph which
is the 1-skeleton of some simplicial flag complex $L$ which is a homology
manifold of dimension $n \ge 1$, then the graph $\Gamma$ is reconstructible.
