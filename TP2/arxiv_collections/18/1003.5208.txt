From the observed results, we deduced that the mass of the neutrino is about
10^(-1) eV and the mass of the fourth stable elementary particle (delta) is
about 10^(0) eV. While neutrino is related to electro-weak field, the fourth
stable elementary particle delta is related to gravitation-"strong" field, and
some new meta-stable baryons may appear near the TeV region. Therefore, a
twofold standard model diagram is proposed, and involves some experiment
phenomena: The new meta-stable baryons' decays produce delta particles, which
are helpful in explaining the Dijet asymmetry phenomena at LHC of CERN, the
different results for the Fermilab's data peak, etc; However, according to the
(B-L) invariance, the sterile "neutrino" about the event excess in MiniBooNe is
not the fourth neutrino but rather the delta particle; We think that the delta
particles are related to the phenomenon about neutrinos FTL, and that
anti-neutrinos are faster than neutrinos. FTL is also related to cosmic
inflation, singular point disappearance, a finite universe, and abnormal red
shift of SN Ia. Besides, the dark matter particles with low mass are helpful in
explaining missing solar neutrinos, the CMB angular power spectrum measured by
WMAP etc. Some experiments and observations are suggested, especially about the
measurement for the speed of gravitational wave c'. c' and c, in physics,
represent the limit speeds of moving particles made by different categories of
matter with different Lorentz factors. Lorentz transformation is compatible
with FTL. This will be helpful to look for new particles.
