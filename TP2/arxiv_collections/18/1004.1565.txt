The hydrokinetic approach, that incorporates hydrodynamic expansion of the
systems formed in A+A collisions and their dynamical decoupling, is applied to
restore the initial conditions and space-time picture of the matter evolution
in central Au+Au collisions at the top RHIC energy. The analysis is based on
the detailed reproduction of the pion and kaon momentum spectra and femtoscopic
data in whole interval of the transverse momenta studied by both STAR and
PHENIX collaborations. The fitting procedure utilizes the two parameters: the
maximal energy density at supposed thermalization time 1 fm/c and the strength
of the pre-thermal flows developed to this time. The quark-gluon plasma and
hadronic gas is supposed to be in complete local equilibrium above the chemical
freeze-out temperature $T_{ch}$ = 165 MeV with the equation of states (EoS) at
high temperatures as in the lattice QCD. Below $T_{ch}$ the EoS in the
expanding and gradually decoupling fluid depends on the composition of the
hadron-resonance gas at each space-time point and accounts for decays of
resonances into the non-equilibrated medium. A good description of the pion and
kaon transverse momentum spectra and interferometry radii is reached at both
used initial energy density profiles motivated by the Glauber and Color Glass
Condensate (CGC) models, however, at different initial energy densities. The
discussion as for the approximate pion and kaon $m_T$-scaling for the
interferometry radii is based on a comparison of the emission functions for
these particles.
