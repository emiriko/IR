We present an affine-intuitionistic system of types and effects which can be
regarded as an extension of Barber-Plotkin Dual Intuitionistic Linear Logic to
multi-threaded programs with effects. In the system, dynamically generated
values such as references or channels are abstracted into a finite set of
regions. We introduce a discipline of region usage that entails the confluence
(and hence determinacy) of the typable programs. Further, we show that a
discipline of region stratification guarantees termination.
