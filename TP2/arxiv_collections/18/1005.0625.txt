The rapid circularization and synchronization of the stellar components in an
eccentric binary system at the onset of Roche lobe overflow (RLO) is a
fundamental assumption common to all binary stellar evolution and population
synthesis codes, even though the validity of this assumption is questionable
both theoretically and observationally. Here we calculate the evolution of the
orbital elements of an eccentric binary through the direct three-body
integration of a massive particle ejected through the inner Lagrangian point of
the donor star at periastron. The trajectory of this particle leads to three
possible outcomes: direct accretion (DA) onto the companion star within a
single orbit, self-accretion (SA) back onto the donor star within a single
orbit, or a quasi-periodic orbit around the companion star. We calculate the
secular evolution of the binary orbit in the first two cases and conclude that
DA can increase or decrease the orbital semi-major axis and eccentricity, while
SA always decreases the orbital both orbital elements. In cases where mass
overflow contributes to circularizing the orbit, circularization can set in on
timescales as short as a few per cent of the mass transfer timescale. In cases
where mass overflow increases the eccentricity, the orbital evolution is
governed by competition between mass overflow and tidal torques. In the absence
of tidal torques, mass overflow resulting in DI can lead to substantially
subsynchronously rotating donor stars. Contrary to common assumptions, DI
furthermore does not always provide a strong sink of orbital angular momentum
in close mass-transferring binaries; in fact we instead find that a significant
part can be returned to the orbit during the particle orbit. The formulation
presented here can be combined with stellar and binary evolution codes to
generate a better picture of the evolution of eccentric, RLO binary star
systems.
