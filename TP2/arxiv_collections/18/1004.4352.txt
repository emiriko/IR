In this article we investigate the effects of shifting position decoherence,
arisen from the tunneling effect in the experimental realization of the quantum
walk, on the one-dimensional discreet time quantum walk. We show that in the
regime of this type of noise the quantum behavior of the walker does not fade,
in contrary to the coin decoherence for which the walker undergos the
quantum-to-classical transition even for weak noise. Particularly, we show that
the quadratic dependency of the variance on the time and also the coin-position
entanglement, i.e. two important quantum aspects of the coherent quantum walk,
are preserved in the presence of tunneling decoherence. Furthermore, we present
an explicit expression for the probability distribution of decoherent
one-dimensional quantum walk in terms of the corresponding coherent
probabilities, and show that this type of decoherence smooths the probability
distribution.
