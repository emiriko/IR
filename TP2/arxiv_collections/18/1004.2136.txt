This is a review on graphene quantum dots and their use as a host for spin
qubits. We discuss the advantages but also the challenges to use graphene
quantum dots for spin qubits as compared to the more standard materials like
GaAs. We start with an overview of this young and fascinating field and will
then discuss gate-tunable quantum dots in detail. We calculate the bound states
for three different quantum dot architectures where a bulk gap allows for
confinement via electrostatic fields: (i) graphene nanoribbons with armchair
boundary, (ii) a disc in single-layer graphene, and (iii) a disc in bilayer
graphene. In order for graphene quantum dots to be useful in the context of
spin qubits, one needs to find reliable ways to break the valley-degeneracy.
This is achieved here, either by a specific termination of graphene in (i) or
in (ii) and (iii) by a magnetic field, without the need of a specific boundary.
We further discuss how to manipulate spin in these quantum dots and explain the
mechanism of spin decoherence and relaxation caused by spin-orbit interaction
in combination with electron-phonon coupling, and by hyperfine interaction with
the nuclear spin system.
