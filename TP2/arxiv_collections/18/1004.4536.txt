I highlight the synergies of the Wide Field X-ray Telescope (WFXT) with the
next generation radio surveys, including those to be obtained with the
Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder and the Square Kilometre Array,
and discuss the overlap between the X-ray and radio source populations. WFXT
will benefit greatly from the availability of deep radio catalogues with very
high astrometric precision, while on the other hand WFXT data will be vital for
the identification of faint radio sources down to ~ 50 microJy.
