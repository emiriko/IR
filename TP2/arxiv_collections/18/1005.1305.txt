We determine numerically the self-similarity maps for spectra of the almost
Mathieu operators, a two-dimensional fractal-like structure known as the
Hofstadter butterfly. The similarity maps each have a horizontal component
determined by certain algebraic maps, and vertical component determined by a
Mobius transformation, indexed by a semigroup of the matrix group $GL_2(\Z)$.
Based on the numerical evidence, we state and prove a continuity result for the
similarity maps. We note a connection between the indexing of the similarity
maps and Morita equivalence of rotation algebras $A_\theta$, a continuous field
of C*-algebras.
