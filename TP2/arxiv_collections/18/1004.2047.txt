An active microbiota, reaching up to 10 E+7 cells/g, was found to inhabit a
naturally occurring asphalt lake characterized by low water activity and
elevated temperature. Geochemical and molecular taxonomic approaches revealed
novel and deeply branching microbial assemblages mediating anaerobic
hydrocarbon degradation, metal respiration and C1 utilization pathways. These
results open a window into the origin and adaptive evolution of microbial life
within recalcitrant hydrocarbon matrices, and establish the site as a useful
analog for the liquid hydrocarbon environments on Saturn's moon Titan.
