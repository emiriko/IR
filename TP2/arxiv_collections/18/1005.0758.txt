We propose a description of pairing properties in finite systems within the
canonical and microcanonical ensembles. The approach is derived by solving the
BCS and self-consistent quasiparticle random-phase approximation with the
Lipkin-Nogami particle-number projection at zero temperature. The obtained
eigenvalues are embedded into the canonical and microcanonical ensembles. The
results obtained are found in quite good agreement with the exact solutions of
the doubly-folded equidistant multilevel pairing model as well as the
experimental data for $^{56}$Fe nucleus. The merit of the present approach
resides in its simplicity and its application to a wider range of particle
number, where the exact solution is impracticable.
