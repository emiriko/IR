Using standard signal processing tools, we experimentally report that
intermittency of wave turbulence on the surface of a fluid occurs even when two
typical large-scale coherent structures (gravity wave breakings and bursts of
capillary waves on steep gravity waves) are not taken into account. We also
show that intermittency depends on the power injected into the waves. The
dependence of the power-law exponent of the gravity-wave spectrum on the
forcing amplitude cannot be also ascribed to these coherent structures.
Statistics of these both events are studied.
