A variety of complex fluids under shear exhibit complex spatio-temporal
behaviour, including what is now termed rheological chaos, at moderate values
of the shear rate. Such chaos associated with rheological response occurs in
regimes where the Reynolds number is very small. It must thus arise as a
consequence of the coupling of the flow to internal structural variables
describing the local state of the fluid. We propose a coupled map lattice (CML)
model for such complex spatio-temporal behaviour in a passively sheared nematic
liquid crystal, using local maps constructed so as to accurately describe the
spatially homogeneous case. Such local maps are coupled diffusively to nearest
and next nearest neighbours to mimic the effects of spatial gradients in the
underlying equations of motion. We investigate the dynamical steady states
obtained as parameters in the map and the strength of the spatial coupling are
varied, studying local temporal properties at a single site as well as
spatio-temporal features of the extended system. Our methods reproduce the full
range of spatio-temporal behaviour seen in earlier one-dimensional studies
based on partial differential equations. We report results for both the one and
two-dimensional cases, showing that spatial coupling favours uniform or
periodically time-varying states, as intuitively expected. We demonstrate and
characterize regimes of spatio-temporal intermittency out of which chaos
develops. Our work suggests that such simplified lattice representations of the
spatio-temporal dynamics of complex fluids under shear may provide useful
insights as well as fast and numerically tractable alternatives to continuum
representations.
