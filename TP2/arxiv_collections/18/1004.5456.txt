We calculate (q-deformed) Clebsch-Gordan and 6j-coefficients for rank two
quantum groups. We explain in detail how such calculations are done, which
should allow the reader to perform similar calculations in other cases.
Moreover, we tabulate the q-Clebsch-Gordan and 6j-coefficients explicitly, as
well as some other topological data associated with theories corresponding to
rank-two quantum groups. Finally, we collect some useful properties of the
fusion rules of particular conformal field theories.
