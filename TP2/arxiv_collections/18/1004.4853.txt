The heavy ion program at the LHC will present unprecedented opportunities to
probe hot QCD matter, that is, the quark gluon plasma (QGP). Among these
exciting new probes are high energy partons associated with the production of a
Z^0 boson, or Z^0 tagged jets. Once produced, Z^0 bosons are essentially
unaffected by the strongly interacting medium produced in heavy-ion collisions,
and therefore provide a powerful signal of the initial partonic energy and
subsequent medium induced partonic energy loss. When compared with theory,
experimental measurements of Z^0 tagged jets will help quantify the jet
quenching properties of the QGP and discriminate between different partonic
energy loss formalisms. In what follows, I discuss the advantages of tagged
jets over leading particles, and present preliminary results of the production
and suppression of Z^0 tagged jets in relativistic heavy-ion collisions at LHC
energies using the Guylassy-Levai-Vitev (GLV) partonic energy loss formalism.
