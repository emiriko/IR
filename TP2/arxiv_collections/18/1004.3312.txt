We show that any finite-dimensional pointed Hopf algebra over an abelian
group $\Gamma$ such that its infinitesimal braiding is of standard type is
generated by group-like and skew-primitive elements. This fact agrees with the
long-standing conjecture by Andruskiewitsch and Schneider. We also show that
the quantum Serre relations hold in any coradically graded pointed Hopf algebra
over $\Gamma$ of finite dimension and determine how these relations are lifted
in the standard case.
