Heading towards a full automation of next-to-leading order (NLO) QCD
corrections, one important ingredient is the analytical integration over the
one-particle phase space of the unresolved particle that is necessary when
adding the subtraction terms to the virtual corrections. We present the
implementation of these integrated dipoles in the MadGraph framework. The
result is a package that allows an automated calculation for the NLO real
emission parts of an arbitrary process.
