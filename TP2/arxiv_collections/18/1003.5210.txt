The density matrix expansion (DME) of Negele and Vautherin is a convenient
tool to map finite-range physics associated with vacuum two- and three-nucleon
interactions into the form of a Skyme-like energy density functional (EDF) with
density-dependent couplings. In this work, we apply the improved formulation of
the DME proposed recently in arXiv:0910.4979 by Gebremariam {\it et al.} to the
non-local Fock energy obtained from chiral effective field theory (EFT)
two-nucleon (NN) interactions at next-to-next-to-leading-order (N$^2$LO). The
structure of the chiral interactions is such that each coupling in the DME Fock
functional can be decomposed into a cutoff-dependent coupling {\it constant}
arising from zero-range contact interactions and a cutoff-independent coupling
{\it function} of the density arising from the universal long-range pion
exchanges. This motivates a new microscopically-guided Skyrme phenomenology
where the density-dependent couplings associated with the underlying
pion-exchange interactions are added to standard empirical Skyrme functionals,
and the density-independent Skyrme parameters subsequently refit to data. A
Mathematica notebook containing the novel density-dependent couplings is
provided.
