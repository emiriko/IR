Copper nanopowder preparation and its X-Ray diffraction studies are reported
in this paper. Electrolytic cathode deposition method is simple and cheapest
process for its preparation. Copper nanopowder has been prepared from aqueous
copper sulphate solution. Wide range of experimental conditions has been
adopted in this process and its X-Ray diffraction characterizations have been
studied. The results confirming copper nanopowder with size below 30 nm.
Uniformed size Copper nanopowder preparation, in normal room temperature is
importance of this study.
