The formation and interaction of ultracold polar molecules is a topic of
active research. Understanding possible reaction paths and molecular
combinations requires accurate studies of the fragment and product energetics.
We have calculated accurate gradient optimized ground state structures and zero
point corrected atomization energies for the trimers and tetramers formed by
the reaction of KRb with KRb and corresponding isolated atoms. The K${}_2$Rb
andKRb${}_2$ trimers are found to have global minima at the $C_{2v}$
configurationwith atomization energies of 6065 and 5931 cm${}^{-1}$ while the
tetramer is found to have two stable planar structures, of $D_{2h}$ and $C_s$
symmetry, which have atomization energies of 11131 cm${}^{-1}$ an 11133
cm${}^{-1}$, respectively. We have calculated the minimum energy reaction path
for the reaction KRb+KRb to K$_2+$Rb$_2$ and found it to be barrierless.
