Spontaneous symmetry breaking is an essential feature of modern science. We
demonstrate that it also plays an important role in the physics of complex
plasmas. Complex plasmas can serve as a powerful tool for observing and
studying discrete types of symmetry and disordering at the kinetic level that
numerous many-body systems exhibit.
