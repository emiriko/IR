We have made an analysis of limits on the neutrino mass based upon the
formation of large-scale structure in the presence of a primordial magnetic
field. We find that a new upper bound on the neutrino mass is possible based
upon fits to the cosmic microwave background and matter power spectrum when the
existing independent constraints on the matter density fluctuation parameter
$\sigma_8$ and the primordial magnetic field are taken into account.
