We study the automatic synthesis of fair non-repudiation protocols, a class
of fair exchange protocols, used for digital contract signing. First, we show
how to specify the objectives of the participating agents and the trusted third
party (TTP) as path formulas in LTL and prove that the satisfaction of these
objectives imply fairness; a property required of fair exchange protocols. We
then show that weak (co-operative) co-synthesis and classical (strictly
competitive) co-synthesis fail, whereas assume-guarantee synthesis (AGS)
succeeds. We demonstrate the success of assume-guarantee synthesis as follows:
(a) any solution of assume-guarantee synthesis is attack-free; no subset of
participants can violate the objectives of the other participants; (b) the
Asokan-Shoup-Waidner (ASW) certified mail protocol that has known
vulnerabilities is not a solution of AGS; (c) the Kremer-Markowitch (KM)
non-repudiation protocol is a solution of AGS; and (d) AGS presents a new and
symmetric fair non-repudiation protocol that is attack-free. To our knowledge
this is the first application of synthesis to fair non-repudiation protocols,
and our results show how synthesis can both automatically discover
vulnerabilities in protocols and generate correct protocols. The solution to
assume-guarantee synthesis can be computed efficiently as the secure
equilibrium solution of three-player graph games.
