We show that Majorana edge modes of two-dimensional spin-triplet topological
superconductors have Ising-like spin density whose direction is determined by
the d-vector characterizing the spin-triplet pairing symmetry. Exchange
coupling between an impurity spin (S=1/2) and Majorana edge modes is thus
Ising-type. Under external magnetic field perpendicular to the Ising axis, the
system can be mapped to a two-level system with Ohmic dissipation, which is
equivalent to the anisotropic Kondo model. The magnetic response of the
impurity spin can serve as a local experimental probe for the order parameter.
