Consider a proper metric space X and a sequence of i.i.d. random continuous
mappings F_n from X to X. It induces the stochastic dynamical system (SDS)
X_n^x = F_n(X_{n-1}^x) starting at x in X. In this paper, we study existence
and uniqueness of invariant measures, as well as recurrence and ergodicity of
this process. In the first part, we elaborate, improve and complete the
unpublished work of Martin Benda on local contractivity, which merits publicity
and provides an important tool for studying stochastic iterations. We consider
the case when the F_n are contractions and, in particular, discuss recurrence
criteria and their sharpness for reflected random walk.
  In the second part, we consider the case where the F_n are Lipschitz
mappings. The main results concern the case when the associated Lipschitz
constants are log-centered. Prinicpal tools are the Chacon-Ornstein theorem and
a hyperbolic extension of the space X as well as the process (X_n^x). The
results are applied to the reflected affine stochastic recursion on the
non-negative half-line.
