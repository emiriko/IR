In this paper we study infinitesimal and finite flexibility for generic
semidiscrete surfaces. We prove that generic 2-ribbon semidiscrete surfaces
have one degree of infinitesimal and finite flexibility. In particular we write
down a system of differential equations describing isometric deformations in
the case of existence. Further we find a necessary condition of 3-ribbon
infinitesimal flexibility. For an arbitrary $n\ge 3$ we prove that every
generic $n$-ribbon surface has at most one degree of finite/infinitesimal
flexibility. Finally, we discuss the relation between general semidiscrete
surface flexibility and 3-ribbon subsurface flexibility. We conclude this paper
with one surprising property of isometric deformations of developable
semidiscrete surfaces.
