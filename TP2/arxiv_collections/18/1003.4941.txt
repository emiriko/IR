The spectra of charged hadrons produced near mid-rapidity in d+Au, p+Au and
n+Au collisions at 200 GeV center of mass energy per nucleon pair are presented
as a function of transverse momentum and centrality. These measurements were
performed using the PHOBOS detector at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider
(RHIC). Nucleon-nucleus interactions were extracted from the d+Au data by
identifying the deuteron spectators. The deuteron spectators were measured
using two calorimeters; one that detected forward-going single neutrons and a
newly installed calorimeter that detected forward-going single protons. The
large suppression of high-pT hadron production in central Au+Au interactions
relative to a naive superposition of p+pbar collisions has been interpreted as
evidence of partonic energy loss in a dense medium. This interpretation is
founded upon the absence of such suppression in the yield of d+Au collisions.
It is shown that d+Au is indeed a valid reference system, as hadron production
in d+Au agrees with a simple binary collision scaling of hadron production in
p+Au. An ideal reference for Au+Au collisions is constructed using a weighted
combination of p+Au and n+Au yields and is found to be similar to the d+Au
reference. Further, hadron production in p+Au interactions is compared to that
of n+Au interactions, in order to study the transport of charge from the
initial state to mid-rapidity. No asymmetry between the positively and
negatively charged hadron spectra of p+Au and n+Au interactions is observed for
particles having an average pseudo-rapidity of 0.8. A study of the Cronin
enhancement of hadrons produced in d+Au collisions using different centrality
measures is also presented. A smooth evolution with centrality is observed,
independent of the chosen centrality measure, when centrality is parameterized
by the multiplicity density measured near mid-rapidity.
