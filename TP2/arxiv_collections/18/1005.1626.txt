Point-contact spectroscopy is a powerful tool for probing superconductors.
One of the most common observations in the point-contact spectra on the
recently discovered ferropnictide superconductors is a large conductance
asymmetry with respect to voltage across the point-contact. In this paper we
show that the antisymmetric part of the point-contact spectrum between a silver
tip and an epitaxial thin film of Ba(Fe$_{0.92}$Co$_{0.08}$)$_2$As$_2$ shows
certain unique features. These features have an interesting evolution with
increasing temperature up to a temperature that is 30% larger than the critical
temperature $T_c$ of the superconductor. We argue that this evolution can be
associated with the rich normal state properties of these materials.
