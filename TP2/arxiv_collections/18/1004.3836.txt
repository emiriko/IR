We propose a scheme to generate quantum superpositions of macroscopically
distinct flow states of ultracold atoms on a ring using Raman coupling
employing a quantized laser field that is a cat-like superposition of optical
vortices with opposite winding numbers. For atoms initially in their ground
state and entangled optical vortices of coherent states, this scheme can
produce a superposition of rotating and non-rotating states. We find fidelities
of the quantum superpositions around 0.9 even before optimization.
