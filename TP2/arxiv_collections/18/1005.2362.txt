None of the well established Nitrogen related IR absorption bands, common in
synthetic and terrestrial diamonds, have been identified in the pre-solar
diamond spectra. In the carbonado diamond spectra only the single nitrogen
impurity (C centre) is identified and the assignments of the rest of the
nitrogen-related bands are still debated. It is speculated that the
unidentified bands in the Nitrogen absorption region are not induced by
Nitrogen but rather by Nitrogen-hydrides because in the interstellar
environment Nitrogen reacts with Hydrogen and forms NH+; NH; NH2; NH3. Among
these Hydrides the electronic configuration of NH+ is the closest to Carbon.
Thus this ionized Nitrogen-mono-hydride is the best candidate to substitute
Carbon in the diamond structure. The bands of the substitutional NH+ defect are
deduced by red shifting the irradiation induced N+ bands due to the mass of the
additional Hydrogen. The six bands of the NH+ defects are identified in both
the pre-solar and the carbonado diamond spectra. The new assignments identify
all of the nitrogen-related bands in the spectra, indicating that pre-solar and
carbonado diamonds contain only single nitrogen impurities.
