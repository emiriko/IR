GW Notes was born from the need for a journal where the distinct communities
involved in gravitation wave research might gather. While these three
communities - Astrophysics, General Relativity and Data Analysis - have made
significant collaborative progress over recent years, we believe that it is
indispensable to future advancement that they draw closer, and that they speak
a common idiom. For this GW Notes issue we have approached Nicol\'as Yunes
(Princeton University) to extend in high detail his recent work on EMRI
waveforms for our highlight article.
