Motivated by Maggiore's new interpretation of quasinormal modes, starting
from the first law of thermodynamics of black holes, we investigate area
spectra of a near extremal Schwarzschild de sitter black hole and a higher
dimensional near extremal Reissner-Nordstrom de sitter black hole. We show that
the area spectra of all these black holes are equally spaced and irrelevant to
the parameters of black holes.
