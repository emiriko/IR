We present the temperature dependence of alpha-relaxation times of 13 glass
formers determined from broadband dielectric spectroscopy, also including data
from aging measurements. The data sets partly cover relaxation-time ranges of
up to 16 decades enabling a critical test of the validity of model predictions.
For this purpose, the data are provided for electronic download. Here we employ
these results to test the applicability of the Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann equation
and a recently proposed new approach that was demonstrated to provide superior
fits of a vast collection of viscosity data.
