In this paper we make an attempt to give a consistent background and
definitions suitable for the theory of integrable difference equations. We
adapt a concept of recursion operator to difference equations and show that it
generates an infinite sequence of symmetries and canonical conservation laws
for a difference equation. Similar to the case of partial differential
equations these canonical densities can serve as integrability conditions for
difference equations. We have found the recursion operators for the Viallet and
all ABS equations.
