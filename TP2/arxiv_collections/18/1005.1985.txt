Quantum molecular dynamic (QMD) simulations have been applied to study the
thermophysical properties of liquid xenon under dynamic compressions. The
equation of state (EOS) obtained from QMD calculations are corrected according
to Saha equation, and contributions from atomic ionization, which are of
predominance in determining the EOS at high temperature and pressure, are
considered. For the pressures below 160 GPa, the necessity in accounting for
the atomic ionization has been demonstrated by the Hugoniot curve, which shows
excellent agreement with previous experimental measurements, and three levels
of ionization have been proved to be sufficient at this stage.
