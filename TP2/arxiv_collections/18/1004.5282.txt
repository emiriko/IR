Multi-scale simulations of nanotube-based nanoelectromechanical systems
(NEMS) controlled by a nonuniform electric field are performed by an example of
a gigahertz oscillator. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we obtain the
friction coefficients and characteristics of the thermal noise associated with
the relative motion of the nanotube walls. These results are used in a
phenomenological one-dimensional oscillator model. The analysis based both on
this model and the Fokker-Planck equation for the oscillation energy
distribution function shows how thermodynamic fluctuations restrict the
possibility of controlling NEMS operation for systems of small sizes. The
parameters of the force for which control of the oscillator operation is
possible are determined.
