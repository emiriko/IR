Coherent states for power-law potentials are constructed using generalized
Heisenberg algabras. Klauder's minimal set of conditions required to obtain
coherent states are satisfied. The statistical properties of these states are
investigated through the evaluation of the Mandel's parameter. It is shown that
these coherent states are useful for describing the states of real and ideal
lasers.
