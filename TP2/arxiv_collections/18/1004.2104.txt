This paper studies a family of genie-MAC (multiple access channel) outer
bounds for K-user Gaussian interference channels. This family is inspired by
existing genie-aided bounding mechanisms, but differs from current approaches
in its optimization problem formulation and application. The fundamental idea
behind these bounds is to create a group of genie receivers that form multiple
access channels that can decode a subset of the original interference channel's
messages. The MAC sum capacity of each of the genie receivers provides an outer
bound on the sum of rates for this subset. The genie-MAC outer bounds are used
to derive new sum-capacity results. In particular, this paper derives
sum-capacity in closed-form for the class of K-user Gaussian degraded
interference channels. The sum-capacity achieving scheme is shown to be a
successive interference cancellation scheme. This result generalizes a known
result for two-user channels to K-user channels.
