We consider the effects of altruistic behavior on random medium access
control (slotted ALOHA) for local area communication networks. For an
idealized, synchronously iterative, two-player game with asymmetric player
demands, we find a Hamiltonian governing the Jacobi dynamics under purely
altruistic behavior. Though the positions of the interior Nash equilibrium
points do not change in the presence of altruistic behavior, the nature of
their local asymptotic stability does. There is a region of partially
altruistic behavior for which neither interior Nash equilibrium point is
locally asymptotically stable. Also, for a power control game with a single
Nash equilibrium, we show how its stability changes as a function of the
altruism parameter. Variations of these altruistic game frameworks are
discussed considering power (instead of throughput) based costs and linear
utility functions.
