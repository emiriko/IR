Scattered lights from terrestrial exoplanets provide valuable information
about the planetary surface. Applying the surface reconstruction method
proposed by Fujii et al. (2010) to both diurnal and annual variations of the
scattered light, we develop a reconstruction method of land distribution with
both longitudinal and latitudinal resolutions. We find that one can recover a
global map of an idealized Earth-like planet on the following assumptions: 1)
cloudless, 2) a face-on circular orbit, 3) known surface types and their
reflectance spectra 4) no atmospheric absorption, 5) known rotation rate 6)
static map, and 7) no moon. Using the dependence of light curves on the
planetary obliquity, we also show that the obliquity can be measured by
adopting the chi-square minimization or the extended information criterion. We
demonstrate a feasibility of our methodology by applying it to a multi-band
photometry of a cloudless model Earth with future space missions such as the
occulting ozone observatory (O3). We conclude that future space missions can
estimate both the surface distribution and the obliquity at least for cloudless
Earth-like planets within 5 pc.
