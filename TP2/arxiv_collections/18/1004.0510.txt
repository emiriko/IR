We present the effective action and self-consistency equations for the
bosonic dynamical mean field (B-DMFT) approximation to the bosonic Hubbard
model and show that it provides remarkably accurate phase diagrams and
correlation functions. To solve the bosonic dynamical mean field equations we
use a continuous-time Monte Carlo method for bosonic impurity models based on a
diagrammatic expansion in the hybridization and condensate coupling. This
method is readily generalized to bosonic mixtures, spinful bosons, and
Bose-Fermi mixtures.
