Coherent optical control schemes exploit the coherence of laser pulses to
change the phases of interfering dynamical pathways in order to manipulate
dynamical processes. These active control methods are closely related to
dynamical decoupling techniques, popularized in the field of Quantum
Information. Inspired by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy,
dynamical decoupling methods apply sequences of unitary operations to modify
the interference phenomena responsible for the system dynamics thus also
belonging to the general class of coherent control techniques. Here we review
related developments in the fields of coherent optical control and dynamical
decoupling, with emphasis on control of tunneling and decoherence in general
model systems. Considering recent experimental breakthroughs in the
demonstration of active control of a variety of systems, we anticipate that the
reviewed coherent control scenarios and dynamical decoupling methods should
raise significant experimental interest.
