We consider the model, which contains a nonminimal coupling of Dirac spinors
to torsion. Due to the action for torsion that breaks parity the left - right
asymmetry of the spinors appears. This construction is used in order to provide
dynamical Electroweak symmetry breaking. Namely, we arrange all Standard Model
fermions in the left - handed spinors. The additional technifermions are
arranged in right - handed spinors. Due to interaction with torsion
technifermions are condensed and, therefore, cause appearance of gauge boson
masses. In order to provide all fermions with masses we consider two
possibilities. The first one is related to an additional coupling of a real
massive scalar field to considered spinors. The second possibility is to
introduce the mass term for the mentioned Dirac spinors composed of the
Standard Model fermions and the technifermions.
