By solving Maxwell equations with the ideal-metal boundary conditions in the
TM case, we have fully described the transmission and diffraction properties of
a single slit regardless of its width. Efficiencies of the main transformation
processes -- transmission, diffraction, and reflection -- are analyzed in the
sub-to-few-wavelength range showing a number of sharp fundamental features.
Close links with the case of real metal are considered.
