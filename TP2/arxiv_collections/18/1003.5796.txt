Discovery of the first planetary system by direct imaging around HR8799 has
made the age determination of the host star a very important task. This
determination is the key to derive accurate masses of the planets and to study
the dynamical stability of the system. The age of this star has been estimated
using different procedures. In this work we show that some of these procedures
have problems and large uncertainties, and the real age of this star is still
unknown, needing more observational constraints. Therefore, we have developed a
comprehensive modeling of HR8799, and taking advantage of its gamma
Doradus-type pulsations, we have estimated the age of the star using
asteroseismology. The accuracy in the age determination depends on the rotation
velocity of the star, and therefore an accurate value of the inclination angle
is required to solve the problem. Nevertheless, we find that the age estimate
for this star previously published in the literature ([30,160] Myr) is
unlikely, and a more accurate value might be closer to the Gyr. This
determination has deep implications on the value of the mass of the objects
orbiting HR8799. An age around $\approx$ 1 Gyr implies that these objects are
brown dwarfs.
