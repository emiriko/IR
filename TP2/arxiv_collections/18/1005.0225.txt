We propose the use of the Dirac-Born-Infeld action in the phenomenological
description of graphene sheet dynamics and interactions. Both the electronic
properties of the Dirac fermions and the overall dynamics can be incorporated
into this model. Classical static configurations, as well as quantum
fluctuations of the membrane degrees of freedom can be studied in this
framework. This makes it an interesting tool for Casimir physics and novel QED
processes.
