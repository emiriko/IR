We present the results of an Ultracold neutron (UCN) production experiment in
a pulsed neutron beam line at the Los Alamos Neutron Scattering Center. The
experimental apparatus allows for a comprehensive set of measurements of UCN
production as a function of target temperature, incident neutron energy, target
volume, and applied magnetic field. However, the low counting statistics of the
UCN signal expected can be overwhelmed by the large background associated with
the scattering of the primary cold neutron flux that is required for UCN
production. We have developed a background subtraction technique that takes
advantage of the very different time-of-flight profiles between the UCN and the
cold neutrons, in the pulsed beam. Using the unique timing structure, we can
reliably extract the UCN signal. Solid ortho-D$_2$ is used to calibrate UCN
transmission through the apparatus, which is designed primarily for studies of
UCN production in solid O$_2$. In addition to setting the overall detection
efficiency in the apparatus, UCN production data using solid D$_2$ suggest that
the UCN upscattering cross-section is smaller than previous estimates,
indicating the deficiency of the incoherent approximation widely used to
estimate inelastic cross-sections in the thermal and cold regimes.
