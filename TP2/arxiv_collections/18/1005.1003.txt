We compare the expected abundance of cosmic-ray electrons and positrons from
pulsars and magnetars. We assume that the distribution of infant pulsars and
magnetars follows that of high-mass stars in the Milky Way and that the
production rate of cosmic rays is proportional to the spin-down and
magnetic-decay power of pulsars and magnetars, respectively. In combination
with primary and secondary cosmic-ray leptons from other sources (especially
supernova remnants), we find that both magnetars and pulsars can easily account
for the observed cosmic-ray spectrum, in particular the dip seen by HESS at
several TeV and the increase in positron fraction found by PAMELA.
