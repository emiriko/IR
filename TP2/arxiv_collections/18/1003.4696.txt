We present a brief overview of the recent theoretical progress to describe
the K_{l2} and K_{l3} decays. We discuss the interesting probes of the Standard
Model offered by these decays such as the extraction of |V_{us}| and the test
of the CKM unitarity, the tests of lepton universality, the quark mass ratio
determination and the test of the electroweak couplings of the light quarks to
the W-boson.
