In this paper, we investigate a Langevin model subjected to stochastic
intensity noise (SIN), which incorporates temporal fluctuations in
noise-intensity. We derive a higher-order Fokker-Planck equation (HFPE) of the
system, taking into account the effect of SIN by the adiabatic elimination
technique. Stationary distributions of the HFPE are calculated by using the
perturbation expansion. We investigate the effect of SIN in three cases: (a)
parabolic and quartic bistable potentials with additive noise, (b) a quartic
potential with multiplicative noise, and (c) a stochastic gene expression
model. We find that the existence of noise intensity fluctuations induces an
intriguing phenomenon of a bimodal-to-trimodal transition in probability
distributions. These results are validated with Monte Carlo simulations.
