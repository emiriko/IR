The aggregation of interacting Brownian particles in sheared concentrated
suspensions is an important issue in colloid and soft matter science per se.
Also, it serves as a model to understand biochemical reactions occurring in
vivo where both crowding and shear play an important role. We present an
effective medium approach within the Smoluchowski equation with shear which
allows one to calculate the encounter kinetics through a potential barrier
under shear at arbitrary colloid concentrations. Experiments on a model
colloidal system in simple shear flow support the validity of the model in the
range considered. By generalizing Kramers' rate theory to the presence of
collective hydrodynamics, our model explains the significant increase in the
shear-induced reaction-limited aggregation kinetics upon increasing the colloid
concentration.
