Making use of detailed classical Monte Carlo simulations, we study the
critical properties of a two dimensional planar spin model on a square lattice
composed by weakly interacting helimagnetic chains. We find a large temperature
window where the vector chirality order parameter, <k_{jk}>=<S_j x S_k>, the
key quantity in multiferroic systems, takes nonzero value in absence of
long-range order or quasi-long-range order, so that, our model is the first
example where, at finite temperatures, a vector chiral spin liquid phase in
absence of geometrical frustration is explicitly reported. We also show that
the strength of interchain interaction is fundamental in order to obtain the
vector chiral spin liquid phase. The relevance of our results for
three-dimensional models is also discussed.
