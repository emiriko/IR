The theoretical predictions, derived from the Lorentz and the Tangherlini
transformations, for the one-way speed of any physical entity are confronted
with the corresponding expressions for the one-way measured speed obtained from
a gedanken experiment. The experiment demonstrates that, for an inertial frame
$K'$ in motion relative to an inertial frame $K$ where the one-way speed of
light is isotropic, even the special theory of relativity renders the one-way
speed of light as function of the velocity of $K'$ in agreement with the
Tangherlini transformations. However, the two-way speed of light remains
constant for all inertial frames, in agreement with the two-way experimental
techniques. This implies that there must exist \emph{one and only one} inertial
frame where the one-way speed of light is isotropic. These investigations also
show how we can determine, with certain restrictions, the true speed of a
physical entity and of the true speed of $K'$ relative to $K$.
