An account is given of how the 'box integrals', as used for one-loop
calculations in massless field theory, appear in momentum-twistor geometry.
Particular attention is paid to the role of compact contour integration in
representing the Feynman propagator in twistor space. An explicit calculation
of all the box integrals, using only elementary methods, is included.
