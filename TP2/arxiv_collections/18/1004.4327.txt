KIF1A, a processive single headed kinesin superfamily motor, hydrolyzes
Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to move along a filamentous track called
microtubule. The stochastic movement of KIF1A on the track is characterized by
an alternating sequence of pause and translocation. The sum of the durations of
pause and the following translocation defines the dwell time. Using the NOSC
model (Nishinari et. al. PRL, {\bf 95}, 118101 (2005)) of individual KIF1A, we
systematically derive an analytical expression for the dwell time distribution.
More detailed information is contained in the probability densities of the
"conditional dwell times" $\tau_{\pm\pm}$ in between two consecutive steps each
of which could be forward (+) or backward (-). We calculate the probability
densities $\Xi_{\pm\pm}$ of these four conditional dwell times. However, for
the convenience of comparison with experimental data, we also present the two
distributions $\Xi_{\pm}^{*}$ of the times of dwell before a forward (+) and a
backward (-) step. In principle, our theoretical prediction can be tested by
carrying out single-molecule experiments with adequate spatio-temporal
resolution.
