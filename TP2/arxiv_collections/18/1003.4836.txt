Several propositions were done to provide adapted concurrency control to
object-oriented databases. However, most of these proposals miss the fact that
considering solely read and write access modes on instances may lead to less
parallelism than in relational databases! This paper cope with that issue, and
advantages are numerous: (1) commutativity of methods is determined a priori
and automatically by the compiler, without measurable overhead, (2) run-time
checking of commutativity is as efficient as for compatibility, (3) inverse
operations need not be specified for recovery, (4) this scheme does not
preclude more sophisticated approaches, and, last but not least, (5) relational
and object-oriented concurrency control schemes with read and write access
modes are subsumed under this proposition.
