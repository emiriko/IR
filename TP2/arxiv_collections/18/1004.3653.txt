We describe the calculation of the three-loop QCD corrections to quark and
gluon form factors. The relevant three-loop Feynman diagrams are evaluated and
the resulting three-loop Feynman integrals are reduced to a small set of known
master integrals by using integration-by-parts relations. Our calculation
confirms the recent results by Baikov et al.\ for the three-loop form factors.
In addition, we derive the subleading ${\cal O}(\e)$ terms for the fermion-loop
type contributions to the three-loop form factors which are required for the
extraction of the fermionic contributions to the four-loop quark and gluon
collinear anomalous dimensions. The finite parts of the form factors are used
to determine the hard matching coefficients for the Drell-Yan process and
inclusive Higgs-production in soft-collinear effective theory.
