The concept of kinematic assemblages evolving from dispersed stellar clusters
has remained contentious since Eggen's initial formulation of moving groups in
the 1960's. With high quality parallaxes from the Hipparcos space astrometry
mission, distance measurements for thousands of nearby, seemingly isolated
stars are currently available. With these distances, a high resolution
spectroscopic abundance analysis can be brought to bear on the alleged members
of these moving groups. If a structure is a relic of an open cluster, the
members can be expected to be monolithic in age and abundance inasmuch as
homogeneity is observed in young open clusters. In this work we have examined
34 putative members of the proposed Wolf 630 moving group using high resolution
stellar spectroscopy. The stars of the sample have been chemically tagged to
determine abundance homogeneity and confirm the existence of a homogeneous
subsample of 19 stars. Fitting the homogeneous subsample with Yale-Yonsei
isochrones yields a single evolutionary sequence of $\sim$2.7 $\pm$ 0.5 Gyr. It
is concluded that this 19 star subsample of the Wolf 630 moving group sample of
34 stars could represent a dispersed cluster with an $<$[Fe/H]$>$=-0.01 $\pm$
0.02 and an age of 2.7 $\pm$ 0.5 Gyr. In addition, chemical abundances of Na
and Al in giants are examined for indications of enhancements as observed in
field giants of old open clusters, overexcitation/ionization effects are
explored in the cooler dwarfs of the sample and oxygen is derived from the
infrared triplet and the forbidden line at $\lambda$6300 \AA.
