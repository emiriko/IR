Equations of motion that recognize biochemical patterns are described. The
equations are partial differential equations in a continuous multiple component
system in which adequate initial and boundary conditions are given. The
biochemical patterns are spatiotemporal distributions of multiple biochemical
components that can be regarded as a continuum in concentration and mass flux.
Recognizing biochemical patterns lead to a universal property of the equations,
which is also mathematically demonstrated, that the devised equations are
sufficient to approximate any orbits in an arbitrary dynamical system, even
though that of expectedly seen in complex biological systems. This theory can
be applied to also a non-biological system that can be regarded as a continuum
comprised of any multiple components such as liquids, solids, and nonlinear
viscoelastic materials.
