In this paper an econophysics model for the currency exchange operations with
commission is proposed. With this purpose some analogies and similarities of
the processes that take place in the frame of the electrochemical system made
from electrodes sunk into a solution of electrolytes and the process of the
currency exchange and determination of the international currency purchasing
power have been used. Some contact phenomena at the electrode/electrolyte
separation surface, the physical principles of an electrochemical source
operation and the determination of the sale attractiveness or the "potential"
of the currency that is to be exchanged are also introduced and analyzed.
