We derive an electric current density $j_{em}$ in the presence of a magnetic
field $B$ and a chiral chemical potential $\mu_5$. We show that $j_{em}$ has
not only the anomaly-induced term $\propto \mu_5 B$ (i.e. Chiral Magnetic
Effect) but also a non-anomalous correction which comes from interaction
effects and expressed in terms of the susceptibility. We find the correction
characteristically dependent on the number of quark flavors. The numerically
estimated correction turns out to be a minor effect on heavy-ion collisions but
can be tested by the lattice QCD simulation.
