A new class of linear sequence generators based on cellular automata is here
introduced in order to model several nonlinear keystream generators with
practical applications in symmetric cryptography. The output sequences are
written as solutions of linear difference equations, and three basic properties
(period, linear complexity and number of different output sequences) are
analyzed.
