In recent years, PHENIX has studied many important observables related to
heavy-flavor physics through their leptonic decay measurements including the
invariant yield of electrons from nonphotonic sources, and prompt single muons,
both of which are dominated by D and B mesons. Charm and beauty cross-sections
were measured and compared through single lepton, and lepton-hadron
correlations in p+p collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 200 GeV. Observables for
quarkonia production such as invariant yield and polarization were also
measured in p+p collisions. In Au+Au collisions, preliminary results for the
$R_{AA}$ for single electrons and a 90% CL upper limit for the suppression of
$\Upsilon$s were produced. And in $d$+Au collisions, a preliminary $R_{CP}$
study for $J/\psi$ production in different centrality ranges was extracted.
