Theoretically, communities at or near their equilibrium species number resist
entry of new species. Such 'biotic resistance' recently has been questioned
because of successful entry of alien species into diverse natural communities.
Data on 10,409 naturalizations of 5350 plant species over 16 sites dispersed
globally show exponential distributions for both species over sites and sites
over number of species shared. These exponentials signal a statistical
mechanics of species distribution, assuming two conditions. First, species and
sites are equivalent, either identical ('neutral'), or so complex that the
chance a species is in the right place at the right time is vanishingly small
('idiosyncratic'); the range of species and sites in our data disallows a
neutral explanation. Secondly, the total number of naturalisations is fixed in
any era by a 'regulator'. Previous correlation of species naturalization rates
with net primary productivity over time suggests that regulator is related to
productivity. We conclude that biotic resistance is a moving ceiling, with
resistance controlled by productivity. The general observation that the
majority of species occur naturally at only a few sites but only a few at many
now has a quantitative [exponential] character, offering the study of species'
distributions a previously unavailable rigor.
