We investigate the effects of impurities, either correlated disorder or a
single Gaussian defect, on the collective dipole motion of a Bose-Einstein
condensate of $^7$Li in an optical trap. We find that this motion is damped at
a rate dependent on the impurity strength, condensate center-of-mass velocity,
and interatomic interactions. Damping in the Thomas-Fermi regime depends
universally on the disordered potential strength scaled to the condensate
chemical potential and the condensate velocity scaled to the peak speed of
sound. The damping rate is comparatively small in the weakly interacting
regime, and the damping in this case is accompanied by strong condensate
fragmentation. \textit{In situ} and time-of-flight images of the atomic cloud
provide evidence that this fragmentation is driven by dark soliton formation.
