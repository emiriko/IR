The physical mechanisms behind the reduction of the bulk modulus of a
high-pressure cubic TiO2 phase are confirmed by first-principles calculations.
An unusual and abrupt change occurs in the dependence of energy on pressure at
43 GPa, indicating a pressure-induced phase transition from columbite TiO2 to a
newly-identified modified fluorite TiO2 with a Pca21 symmetry. Oxygen atom
displacement in Pca21 TiO2 unexpectedly reduces the bulk modulus by 34%
relative to fluorite TiO2. This discovering provides a direct evidence for
understanding the compressive properties of such groups of homologous materials
