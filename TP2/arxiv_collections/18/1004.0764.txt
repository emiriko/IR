We perform the resummation of large logarithmic corrections to the partonic
cross sections for single-inclusive jet production in polarized pp collisions.
We reach the next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy for this observable with the
corresponding matching to the next-to-leading order calculation performed in
the small-cone approximation. We present numerical results for the BNL-RHIC
collider at \sqrt{S}=200 GeV and 500 GeV. We find an enhancement of the
spin-dependent cross section, specially at high transverse momentum for the
jet, resulting in a rather small increase of the double-spin asymmetry A_LL for
this process.
