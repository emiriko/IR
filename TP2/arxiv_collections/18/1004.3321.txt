In this article, we give a partial description of the sandpile group of the
cone of the cartesian product of graphs in function of the sandpile group of
the cone of their factors. Also, we introduce the concept of uniform
homomorphism of graphs and prove that every surjective uniform homomorphism of
graphs induces an injective homomorphism between their sandpile groups. As an
application of these result we obtain an explicit description of a set of
generators of the sandpile group of the cone of the hypercube of dimension d.
