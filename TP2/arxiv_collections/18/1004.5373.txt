We find the asymptotic total variation distance between two distributions on
configurations of m balls in n labeled bins: in the first, each ball is placed
in a bin uniformly at random; in the second, k balls are planted in an
arbitrary but fixed arrangement and the remaining m-k balls placed uniformly at
random.
