We argue that Ulam-Hyers stability concept is quite significant in realistic
problems in numerical analysis, biology and economics. A generalization to
nonlinear systems is proposed and applied to the logistic equation (both
differential and difference), SIS epidemic model, Cournot model in economics
and a reaction diffusion equation. To the best of our knowledge this is the
first time Ulam-Hyers stability is considered from the applications point of
view.
