A discontinuous Galerkin method for the ideal 5 moment two-fluid plasma
system is presented. The method uses a second or third order discontinuous
Galerkin spatial discretization and a third order TVD Runge-Kutta time stepping
scheme. The method is benchmarked against an analytic solution of a dispersive
electron acoustic square pulse as well as the two-fluid electromagnetic shock
and existing numerical solutions to the GEM challenge magnetic reconnection
problem. The algorithm can be generalized to arbitrary geometries and three
dimensions. An approach to maintaining small gauge errors based on error
propagation is suggested.
