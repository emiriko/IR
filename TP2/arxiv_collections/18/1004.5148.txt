Negativity is regarded as an important measure of entanglement in quantum
information theory. In contrast to other measures of entanglement, it is easily
computable for bipartite states in arbitrary dimensions. In this paper, based
on the negativity and realignment, we provide a set of entanglement-sharing
constraints for multipartite states, where the entanglement is not necessarily
limited to bipartite and pure states, thus aiding in the quantification of
constraints for entanglement-sharing. These may find applications in studying
many-body systems.
