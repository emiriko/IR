This article presents a new classification framework that can extract
individual features per class. The scheme is based on a model of incoherent
subspaces, each one associated to one class, and a model on how the elements in
a class are represented in this subspace. After the theoretical analysis an
alternate projection algorithm to find such a collection is developed. The
classification performance and speed of the proposed method is tested on the AR
and YaleB databases and compared to that of Fisher's LDA and a recent approach
based on on $\ell_1$ minimisation. Finally connections of the presented scheme
to already existing work are discussed and possible ways of extensions are
pointed out.
