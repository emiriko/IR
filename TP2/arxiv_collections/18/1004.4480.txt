In resent years ANN is widely reported for modeling in different areas of
science including electro chemistry. This includes modeling of different
technological batteries such as lead acid battery, Nickel cadmium batteries
etc. Lithium ion batteries are advance battery technology which satisfy most of
the space mission requirements. Low earth orbit (LEO)space craft batteries
undergo large number of charge discharge cycles (about 25000 cycles)compared to
other ground level or space applications. This study is indented to develop ANN
model for about 25000 cycles, cycled under various temperature, Depth Of
Discharge (DOD) settings with constant charge voltage limit to predict the
retained capacity and End of Discharge Voltage (EODV). To extract firm
conclusion and distinguish the capability of ANN method, the predicted values
are compared with experimental result by statistical method and Bland Altman
plot.
