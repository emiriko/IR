This paper defines a constraint-based model dedicated to multidimensional
databases. The model we define represents data through a constellation of facts
(subjects of analyse) associated to dimensions (axis of analyse), which are
possibly shared. Each dimension is organised according to several hierarchies
(views of analyse) integrating several levels of data granularity. In order to
insure data consistency, we introduce 5 semantic constraints (exclusion,
inclusion, partition, simultaneity, totality) which can be intra-dimension or
inter-dimensions; the intra-dimension constraints allow the expression of
constraints between hierarchies within a same dimension whereas the
inter-dimensions constraints focus on hierarchies of distinct dimensions. We
also study repercussions of these constraints on multidimensional manipulations
and we provide extensions of the multidimensional operators.
