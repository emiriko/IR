The list of quantum mechanical systems with non-Abelian statistics has
recently been expanded by including generic spin-orbit-coupled semiconductors
e.g., InAs) in proximity to a s-wave superconductor. Demonstration of the
anyonic statistics using Majorana fermion interferometry in this system is a
necessary first step towards topological quantum computation (TQC). However,
since all isolated chiral edges that can be created in the semiconductor are
charge neutral, it is not clear if electrically controlled interferometry is
possible in this system. Here we show that when two isolated chiral Majorana
edges are brought into close contact, the resultant interface supports charge
current, enabling electrically controlled Majorana fermion interferometry in
the semiconductor structure. Such interferometry experiments on the
semiconductor are analogous to similar interferometry experiments on the
$\nu=5/2$ fractional quantum Hall systems and on the surface of a 3D strong
topological insulator, illustrating the usefulness of the 2D semiconductor
heterostructure as a suitable TQC platform. In particular, we proposed Majorana
interferometers may be the most direct method for establishing non-Abelian
braiding statistics in topological superconductors.
