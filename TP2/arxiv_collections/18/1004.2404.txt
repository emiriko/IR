Conventional superconductors are characterized by a single energy scale, the
superconducting gap, which is proportional to the critical temperature Tc . In
hole-doped high-Tc copper oxide superconductors, previous experiments have
established the existence of two distinct energy scales for doping levels below
the optimal one. The origin and significance of these two scales are largely
unexplained, although they have often been viewed as evidence for two gaps,
possibly of distinct physical origins. By measuring the temperature dependence
of the electronic Raman response of Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+d (Bi-2212) and HgBa2CuO4+d
(Hg-1201) crystals with different doping levels, we establish that these two
scales are associated with coherent excitations of the superconducting state
which disappears at Tc. Using a simple model, we show that these two scales do
not require the existence of two gaps. Rather, a single d-wave superconducting
gap with a loss of Bogoliubov quasiparticle spectral weight in the antinodal
region is shown to reconcile spectroscopic and transport measurements.
