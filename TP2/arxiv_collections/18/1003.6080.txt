We find the critical surface of the Ashkin-Teller model on the generic
iso-radial graphs by using the results for the anisotropic Ashkin-teller model
on the square lattice. Different geometrical aspects of this critical surface
are discussed, especially their connection to the anisotropy angle. The free
energy of the model on the generic iso-radial graph is extracted using the
inversion identities. In addition, lattice holomorphic variables are discussed
at some particular points of the critical line. We check our conjectures
numerically for the anisotropic triangular-lattice Ashkin-Teller model.
