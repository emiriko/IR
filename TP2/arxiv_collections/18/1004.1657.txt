Solar activity and helioseismology show the limitation of the standard solar
model and call for the inclusion of dynamical processes in both convective and
radiative zones. We concentrate here on the radiative zone and first show the
sensitivity of boron neutrinos to the microscopic physics included in solar
models. We confront the neutrino predictions of the seismic model to all the
detected neutrino fluxes. Then we compute new models of the Sun including a
detailed transport of angular momentum and chemicals due to internal rotation
that includes meridional circulation and shear induced turbulence. We use two
stellar evolution codes: CESAM and STAREVOL to estimate the different terms. We
follow three temporal evolutions of the internal rotation differing by their
initial conditions: very slow, moderate and fast rotation, with magnetic
braking at the arrival on the main sequence for the last two. We find that the
meridional velocity in the present solar radiative zone is extremely small in
comparison with those of the convective zone, smaller than 10^-6 cm/s instead
of m/s. All models lead to a radial differential rotation profile but with a
significantly different contrast. We compare these profiles to the presumed
solar internal rotation and show that if meridional circulation and shear
turbulence were the only mechanisms transporting angular momentum within the
Sun, a rather slow rotation in the young Sun is favored. The transport by
rotation slightly influence the sound speed profile but its potential impact on
the chemicals in the transition region between radiation and convective zones.
This work pushes us to pursue the inclusion of the other dynamical processes to
better reproduce the present observable and to describe the young active Sun.
We also need to get a better knowledge of solar gravity mode splittings to use
their constraints.
