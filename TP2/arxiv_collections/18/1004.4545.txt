Some established views of the solar magnetic cycle are discussed critically,
with focus on two aspects at the core of most models: the role of convective
turbulence, and the role of the `tachocline' at the base of the convection
zone. The standard view which treats the solar cycle as a manifestation of the
interaction between convection and magnetic fields is shown to be misplaced.
The main ingredient of the solar cycle, apart from differential rotation, is
instead buoyant instability of the magnetic field itself. This view of the
physics of the solar cycle was already established in the 1950s, but has been
eclipsed mathematically by mean field turbulence formalisms which make poor
contact with observations and have serious theoretical problems. The history of
this development in the literature is discussed critically. The source of the
magnetic field of the solar cycle is currently assumed to be located in the
`tachocline': the shear zone at the base of the convection zone. While the
azimuthal field of the cycle is indeed most likely located at the base of the
convection zone, it cannot be powered by the radial shear of the tachocline as
assumed in these models, since the radiative interior does not support
significant shear stresses. Instead, it must be the powered by the latitudinal
gradient in rotation rate in the convection zone, as in early models of the
solar cycle. Possible future directions for research are briefly discussed.
