The current through nanostructures like quantum dots can be stabilized by a
feedback loop that continuously adjusts system parameters as a function of the
number of tunnelled particles $n$. At large times, the feedback loop freezes
the fluctuations of $n$ which leads to highly accurate, continuous single
particle transfers. For the simplest case of feedback acting simultaneously on
all system parameters, we show how to reconstruct the original full counting
statistics from the frozen distribution.
