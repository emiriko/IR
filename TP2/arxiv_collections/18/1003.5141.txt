We study toric varieties over a field k that split in a Galois extension K/k
using Galois cohomology with coefficients in the toric automorphism group. Part
of this Galois cohomology fits into an exact sequence induced by the
presentation of the class group of the toric variety. This perspective helps to
compute the Galois cohomology, particularly for cyclic Galois groups. We use
Galois cohomology to classify k-forms of projective spaces when K/k is cyclic,
and we also study k-forms of surfaces.
