Characterization and quantification of multipartite entanglement is one of
the challenges in state-of-the-art experiments in quantum information
processing. According to theory, this is achieved via entanglement monotones,
that is, functions that do not increase under stochastic local operations and
classical communication (SLOCC). Typically such monotones include the wave
function and its time-reversal (antilinear-operator formalism) or they are
based on not completely positive maps (e.g., partial transpose). Therefore,
they are not directly accessible to experimental observations. We show how
entanglement monotones derived from polynomial local SL$(2,\CC)$ invariants can
be re-written in terms of expectation values of observables. Consequently, the
amount of entanglement---of specific SLOCC classes---in a given state can be
extracted from the measurement of correlation functions of local operators.
