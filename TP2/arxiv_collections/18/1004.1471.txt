Experiments and computer simulation studies have revealed existence of rich
dynamics in the orientational relaxation of molecules in confined systems such
as water in reverse micelles, cyclodextrin cavities and nano-tubes. Here we
introduce a novel finite length one dimensional Ising model to investigate the
propagation and the annihilation of dynamical correlations in finite systems
and to understand the intriguing shortening of the orientational relaxation
time that has been reported for small sized reverse micelles. In our finite
sized model, the two spins at the two end cells are oriented in the opposite
directions, to mimic the effects of surface that in real system fixes water
orientation in the opposite directions. This produces opposite polarizations to
propagate inside from the surface and to produce bulk-like condition at the
centre. This model can be solved analytically for short chains. For long chains
we solve the model numerically with Glauber spin flip dynamics (and also with
Metropolis single-spin flip Monte Carlo algorithm). We show that model nicely
reproduces many of the features observed in experiments. Due to the destructive
interference among correlations that propagate from the surface to the core,
one of the rotational relaxation time components decays faster than the bulk.
In general, the relaxation of spins is non-exponential due to the interplay
between various interactions. In the limit of strong coupling between the spins
or in the limit of low temperature, the nature of relaxation of the spins
undergoes a qualitative change with the emergence of a homogeneous dynamics
where decay is predominantly exponential, again in agreement with experiments.
