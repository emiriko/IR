We propose in this paper an exploratory analysis algorithm for functional
data. The method partitions a set of functions into $K$ clusters and represents
each cluster by a simple prototype (e.g., piecewise constant). The total number
of segments in the prototypes, $P$, is chosen by the user and optimally
distributed among the clusters via two dynamic programming algorithms. The
practical relevance of the method is shown on two real world datasets.
