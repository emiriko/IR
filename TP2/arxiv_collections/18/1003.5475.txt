To understand the formation and evolution of galaxies, it is important to
have a full comprehension of the role played by the metallicity, star formation
rate (SFR), morphology, and color. The interplay of these parameters at
different redshifts will substantially affect the evolution of galaxies and, as
a consequence, the evolution of them will provide important clues and
constraints on the galaxy evolution models. In this work we focus on the
evolution of the SFR, metallicity of the gas, and morphology of galaxies at low
redshift in search of signs of evolution. We use the S2N2 diagnostic diagram as
a tool to classify star--forming, composite, and AGN galaxies. We analyzed the
evolution of the three principal BPT diagrams, estimating the SFR and specific
SFR (SSFR) for our samples of galaxies, studying the luminosity and
mass-metallicity relations, and analyzing the morphology of our sample of
galaxies through the g-r color, concentration index, and SSFR. We found that
the S2N2 is a reliable diagram to classify star--forming, composite, and AGNs
galaxies. We demonstrate that the three principal BPT diagrams show an
evolution toward higher values of [OIII]5007/Hb due to a metallicity decrement.
We found an evolution in the mass-metallicity relation of ~ 0.2 dex for the
redshift range 0.3 < z < 0.4 compared to our local one. From the analysis of
the evolution of the SFR and SSFR as a function of the stellar mass and
metallicity, we discovered a group of galaxies with higher SFR and SSFR at all
redshift samples, whose morphology is consistent with those of late-type
galaxies. Finally, the comparison of our local (0.04<z<0.1) with our higher
redshift sample (0.3<z<0.4), show that the metallicity, the SFR and morphology,
evolve toward lower values of metallicity, higher SFRs, and late--type
morphologies for the redshift range 0.3<z<0.4
