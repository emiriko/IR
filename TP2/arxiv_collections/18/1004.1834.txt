We analyze the time evolution of quantum entanglement in a model consisting
of two two-level atoms interacting with a two-mode electromagnetic field for a
variety of initial states. We study two different coupling schemes motivated by
the forms that can arise due to atomic separation. We observe a variety of
qualitative features such as entanglement sudden death, dynamical generation,
protection, and transfer between subsystems. Our quantitative analysis shows
that these cases with different couplings and initial states differ
significantly in these qualitative features. The multifarious behaviors in
these two-mode cases suggest the importance of considering atomic separation
carefully for any model where two atoms interact with a common field.
