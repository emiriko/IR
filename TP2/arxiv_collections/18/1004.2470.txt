In a recent paper we have deduced the basic equations that predict the
emission of gravitational waves (GW) according to the Einstein gravitation
theory. In a subsequent paper these equations have been used to calculate the
luminosities and the amplitudes of the waves generated by binary stars,
pulsations of neutron stars, wobbling of deformed neutron stars, oscillating
quadrupoles, rotating bars and collapsing and bouncing cores of supernovas. We
show here how the GW could be detected in our laboratories. This paper, like
the preceding ones, was written to graduate and postgraduate students of
Physics.
