We demonstrate that it is possible to calculate not only the mean of an
underlying population but also its dispersion, given only a single observation
and physically reasonable constraints (i.e., that the quantities under
consideration are non-negative and bounded). We suggest that this
counter-intuitive conclusion is in fact at the heart of most modeling of
astronomical data.
