This is an account of the computation of X-ray microstrain in a polycrystal
with anisotropic elasticity under uniaxial external load. The results have been
published in the article "Microstrain in nanocrystalline solids under load by
virtual diffraction", at Europhysics Letters 89, 66002 (2010). The present
information was submitted to Europhysics Letters as part of the manuscript
package, and was available to the reviewers who recommended the paper for
publication.
