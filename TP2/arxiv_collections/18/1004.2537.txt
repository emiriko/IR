The current status of the scientific results of the Auger Observatory will be
discussed which include spectrum, anisotropy in arrival directions, chemical
composition analyses, and limits on neutrino and photon fluxes. A review of the
Observatory detection systems will be presented. Auger has started the
construction of its second phase which encompasses antennae for radio detection
of cosmic rays, high-elevation telescopes, and surface plus muon detectors.
Details will be presented on the latter, AMIGA (Auger Muons and Infill for the
Ground Array), an Auger project consisting of 85 detector pairs each one
composed of a surface water-Cherenkov detector and a buried muon counter. The
detector pairs are arranged in an array with spacings of 433 and 750 m in order
to perform a detailed study of the 10^17 eV to 10^19 eV spectrum region.
Preliminary results on the performance of the 750 m array of surface detectors
and the first muon counter prototype will be presented.
