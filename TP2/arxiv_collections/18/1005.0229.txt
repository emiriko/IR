We report on observation of coherent electron transport in suspended
high-quality InAs nanowire-based devices. The InAs nanowires were grown by
low-temperature gold-assisted vapor-liquid-solid molecular-beam-epitaxy. The
high quality of the nanowires was achieved by removing the typically found
stacking-faults and reducing possible Au incorporation. Minimizing
substrate-induced scattering in the device was achieved by suspending the
nanowires over predefined grooves. Coherent transport involving more than a
single one-dimensional mode transport, was observed in the experiment,
manifested by Fabry-P\'erot conductance oscillations. The length of the
Fabry-P\'erot interferometer, deduced from the period of the conductance
oscillations, was found to be close to the physical length of the device. The
high oscillations visibility imply nearly ballistic electron transport through
the nanowire.
