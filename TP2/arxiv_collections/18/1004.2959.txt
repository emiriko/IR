For any Lie algebroid A, its 1-jet bundle JA is a Lie algebroid naturally and
there is a representation \pi: JA ->DA. Denote by dJ the corresponding
coboundary operator. In this paper, we realize the deformation cohomology of a
Lie algebroid A introduced by M. Crainic and I. Moerdijk as the cohomology of a
subcomplex (\Gamma(Hom(^\bulletJA,A)DA), dJ) of the cochain complex
(\Gamma(Hom(^\bulletJA,A)), dJ).
