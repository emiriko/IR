The iron chalcogenide Fe1+y(Te1-xSex) is structurally the simplest of the
Fe-based superconductors. Although the Fermi surface is similar to iron
pnictides, the parent compound Fe1+yTe exhibits antiferromagnetic order with
in-plane magnetic wave-vector (pi, 0). This contrasts the pnictide parent
compounds where the magnetic order has an in-plane magnetic wave-vector (pi,
pi) that connects hole and electron parts of the Fermi surface. Despite these
differences, both the pnictide and chalcogenide Fe-superconductors exhibit
superconducting spin resonances around (pi, pi), suggesting a common symmetry
for their superconducting order parameter. A central question in this
burgeoning field is therefore how (pi, pi) superconductivity can emerge from a
(pi, 0) magnetic instability. Here, we report that the magnetic soft mode
evolving from the (pi, 0)-type magnetic long-range order is associated with
weak charge carrier localization. Bulk superconductivity occurs only as the
magnetic mode at (pi, pi) becomes dominant upon doping. Our results suggest a
common magnetic origin for superconductivity in iron chalcogenide and pnictide
superconductors.
