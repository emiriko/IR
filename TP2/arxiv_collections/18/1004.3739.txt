We report a theoretical study of Anderson localization of nonclassical light
with emphasis on the quantum statistical aspects of localized light. We
demonstrate, from the variance in mean intensity of localized light, as well as
site-to-site correlations, that the localized light carries signatures of
quantum statistics of input light. For comparison, we also present results for
input light with coherent field statistics and thermal field statistics. Our
results show that there is an enhancement in fluctuations of localized light
due to the medium's disorder. We also find superbunching of the localized
light, which may be useful for enhancing the interaction between radiation and
matter. Another important consequence of sub-Poissonian statistics of the
incoming light is to quench the total fluctuations at the output. Finally, we
compare the effects of Gaussian and Rectangular distributions for the disorder,
and show that Gaussian disorder accelerates the localization of light.
