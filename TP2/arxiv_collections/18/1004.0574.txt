Genetic algorithms are a population-based Meta heuristics. They have been
successfully applied to many optimization problems. However, premature
convergence is an inherent characteristic of such classical genetic algorithms
that makes them incapable of searching numerous solutions of the problem
domain. A memetic algorithm is an extension of the traditional genetic
algorithm. It uses a local search technique to reduce the likelihood of the
premature convergence. The cryptanalysis of simplified data encryption standard
can be formulated as NP-Hard combinatorial problem. In this paper, a comparison
between memetic algorithm and genetic algorithm were made in order to
investigate the performance for the cryptanalysis on simplified data encryption
standard problems(SDES). The methods were tested and various experimental
results show that memetic algorithm performs better than the genetic algorithms
for such type of NP-Hard combinatorial problem. This paper represents our first
effort toward efficient memetic algorithm for the cryptanalysis of SDES.
