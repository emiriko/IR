We study the ground-state correlation energy $E_{\rm c}$ of two electrons of
opposite spin confined within a $D$-dimensional ball ($D \ge 2$) of radius $R$.
In the high-density regime, we report accurate results for the exact and
restricted Hartree-Fock energy, using a Hylleraas-type expansion for the former
and a simple polynomial basis set for the latter. By investigating the exact
limiting correlation energy $E_{\rm c}^{(0)} = \lim_{R \to 0} \Ec$ for various
values of $D$, we test our recent conjecture [J. Chem. Phys. {\bf 131} (2009)
241101] that, in the large-$D$ limit, $E_{\rm c}^{(0)} \sim -\delta^2/8$ for
any spherically-symmetric confining external potential, where $\delta=1/(D-1)$.
