We investigate theoretically the coupling between a cavity resonator and the
cyclotron transition of a two dimensional electron gas under an applied
perpendicular magnetic field. We derive and diagonalize an effective quantum
Hamiltonian describing the magnetopolariton excitations of the two dimensional
electron gas for the case of integer filling factors. The limits of validity of
the present approach are critically discussed. The dimensionless vacuum Rabi
frequency $\Omega_0/\omega_0$ (i.e., normalized to the cyclotron frequency
$\omega_0$) is shown to scale as $\sqrt{\alpha\: n_{QW} \nu}$, where $\alpha$
is the fine structure constant, $n_{QW}$ is the number of quantum wells and
$\nu$ is the filling factor in each well. We show that with realistic
parameters of a high-mobility semiconductor two dimensional electron gas, the
dimensionless coupling $\Omega_0/\omega_0$ can be much larger than 1 in the
case of $\nu \gg 1$, the latter condition being typically realized for
cyclotron transitions in the microwave range. Implications of such ultrastrong
coupling regime are discussed.
