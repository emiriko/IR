We show that the sensitivity of an atomic clock can be enhanced below the
shot-noise level by initially squeezing, and then measuring in output, the
population of a single atomic level. This can simplify current experimental
protocols which requires squeezing of the relative number of particles of the
two populated states. We finally study, as a specific application, the clock
sensitivity obtained with a single mode quantum non-demolition measurement.
