In this paper, we study irregular singular solution to Hitchin's equation and
use it to describe four dimensional $N=2$ asymptotically free gauge theories.
For $SU(2)$ $A$ type quiver, two kinds of irregular singularities besides one
regular singularity are needed for the solution of Hitchin's equation; We then
classify irregular singularities needed for the general $SU(N)$ $A$ type
quiver.
