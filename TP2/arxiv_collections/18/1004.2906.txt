Using the conventional gravastar model, that is, an object constituted by two
components where one of them is a massive infinitely thin shell and the other
one is a de Sitter interior spacetime, we physically interpret a solution
characterized by a zero Schwarzschild mass. No stable gravastar is formed and
it collapses without forming an event horizon, originating what we call a
massive non-gravitational object. The most surprise here is that the collapse
occurs with an exterior de Sitter vacuum spacetime. This creates an object
which does not interact gravitationally with an outside test particle and it
may evolve to a point-like topological defect.
