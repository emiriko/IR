The emergence of local phases in a trapped two-component Fermi gas in an
optical lattice is studied using quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We treat
temperatures that are comparable or lower than those presently achievable in
experiments and large enough systems that both magnetic and paired phases can
be detected by inspection of the behavior of suitable short-range correlations.
We use the latter to suggest the interaction strength and temperature range at
which experimental observation of incipient magnetism and d-wave pairing are
more likely and evaluate the relation between entropy and temperature in
two-dimensional confined fermionic systems.
