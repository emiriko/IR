The paper examines questions of local asymptotic stability of random
dynamical systems. Results concerning stochastic dynamics in general metric
spaces, as well as in Banach spaces, are obtained. The results pertaining to
Banach spaces are based on the linearization of the systems under study. The
general theory is motivated (and illustrated in this paper) by applications in
mathematical finance.
