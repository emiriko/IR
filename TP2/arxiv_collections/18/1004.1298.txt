Deterministic finite automata (DFAs) are constructed for various purposes in
computational biology. Little attention, however, has been given to the
efficient construction of minimal DFAs. In this article, we define simple
non-deterministic finite automata (NFAs) and prove that the standard subset
construction transforms NFAs of this type into minimal DFAs. Furthermore, we
show how simple NFAs can be constructed from two types of patterns popular in
bioinformatics, namely (sets of) generalized strings and (generalized) strings
with a Hamming neighborhood.
