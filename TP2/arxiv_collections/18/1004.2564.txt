Investigation of the eigenvalue spectra of dynamo solutions, has been proved
fundamental for the knowledge of dynamo physics. Earlier, curvature-folding
relation on dynamos in Riemannian spaces has been investigated [PPL 2008].
Here, analytical solutions representing general turbulent dynamo filaments are
obtained in resistive plasmas. Turbulent diffusivity with vanishing kinetic
helicity yields a fast mode for a steady dynamo eigenvalue. The magnetic field
lays down on a local frame 2 plane along the filaments embedded in a 3D plasma.
Curvature effects plays the role of folding in fast magnetic dynamos. In the
present examples, plasma equipartition between normal and binormal components
of the magnetic field components is considered. In the opposite case,
oscillatory, purely imaginary, branches of the spectrum are found in dynamo
manifold. Degenerate eigenvalues, are obtained when the dynamo growth rate
coincides with the filaments curvature. Spectra of dynamo obtained are similar
to the fast dynamo solution obtained by Arnold on a compact torus. Dynamo
experiments making use of this kind of solution have been investigated by
Shukurov et al [Phys Rev E, 2008] with Perm liquid sodium experiments on a
circular torus implications. Another example of dynamo plasma is given by the
Arnold-Beltrami-Childress [ABC] twisted magnetic flux tubes with stagnation
points.
