Recent developments in non-perturbative renormalization for lattice QCD are
reviewed with a particular emphasis on RI/MOM scheme and its variants, RI/SMOM
schemes. Summary of recent developments in Schroedinger functional scheme, as
well as the summary of related topics are presented. Comparison of strong
coupling constant and the strange quark mass from various methods are made.
