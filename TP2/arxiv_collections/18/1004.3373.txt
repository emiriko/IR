Graphene is a model system for the study of electrons confined to a strictly
two-dimensional layer1 and a large number of electronic phenomena have been
demonstrated in graphene, from the fractional2, 3 quantum Hall effect to
superconductivity4. However, the coupling of conduction electrons to local
magnetic moments5, 6, a central problem of condensed matter physics, has not
been realized in graphene, and, given carbon's lack of d or f electrons,
magnetism in graphene would seem unlikely. Nonetheless, magnetism in graphitic
carbon in the absence of transition-metal elements has been reported7-10, with
explanations ranging from lattice defects11 to edge structures12, 13 to
negative curvature regions of the graphene sheet14. Recent experiments suggest
that correlated defects in highly-ordered pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) induced by
proton irradiation9 or native to grain boundaries7, can give rise to
ferromagnetism. Here we show that point defects (vacancies) in graphene15 are
local moments which interact strongly with the conduction electrons through the
Kondo effect6, 16-18 providing strong evidence that defects in graphene are
indeed magnetic. The Kondo temperature TK is tunable with carrier density from
30-90 K; the high TK is a direct consequence of strong coupling of defects to
conduction electrons in a Dirac material18. The results indicate that defect
engineering in graphene could be used to generate and control carrier-mediated
magnetism, and realize all-carbon spintronic devices. Furthermore, graphene
should be an ideal system in which to probe Kondo physics in a widely tunable
electron system.
