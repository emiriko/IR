In this paper we continue our study on the accretion process onto
super-spinning Kerr objects with no event horizon (super-spinars). We discuss
the counterpart of the Bondi accretion onto black holes. We first report the
results of our numerical simulations. We found a quasi steady-state
configuration for any choice of the parameters of our model. The most
interesting feature is the presence of hot outflows. Unlike jets and outflows
produced around black holes, which are thought to be powered by magnetic fields
and emitted from the poles, here the outflows are produced by the repulsive
gravitational force at a small distance from the super-spinar and are ejected
around the equatorial plane. In some circumstances, the amount of matter in the
outflow is considerable, which can indeed significantly reduce the gas mass
accretion rate. Finally, we discuss a possible scenario of the accretion
process in more realistic situations, which cannot be simulated by our code.
