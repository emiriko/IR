Using magnetic torque measurement on a NaNiO2 single crystal, we have
established the magnetic phase diagram of this triangular compound. It presents
5 different phases depending on the temperature (4 K - 300 K) and magnetic
field (0 - 22 T) revealing several spin reorientations coupled to different
magnetic anisotropies.
