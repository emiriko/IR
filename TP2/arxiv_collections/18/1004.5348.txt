We experimentally demonstrate the elementary case of electromagnetically
induced transparency (EIT) with a single atom inside an optical cavity probed
by a weak field. We observe the modification of the dispersive and absorptive
properties of the atom by changing the frequency of a control light field.
Moreover, a strong cooling effect has been observed at two-photon resonance,
increasing the storage time of our atoms twenty-fold to about 16 seconds. Our
result points towards all-optical switching with single photons.
