In this paper, new inner and outer bounds on the achievable
compression-equivocation rate region for generalized secure data compression
with side information are given that do not match in general. In this setup,
two senders, Alice and Charlie intend to transmit information to Bob via
channels with limited capacity so that he can reliably reconstruct their
observations. The eavesdropper, Eve, has access to one of the channels at each
instant and is interested in the source of the same channel at the time. Bob
and Eve also have their own observations which are correlated with Alice's and
Charlie's observations. In this model, two equivocation and compression rates
are defined with respect to the sources of Alice and Charlie. Furthermore,
different special cases are discussed where the inner and outer bounds match.
Our model covers the previously obtained results as well.
