We investigate convergence of Lagrangian Perturbation Theory (LPT) by
analyzing the model problem of a spherical homogeneous top-hat in an
Einstein-deSitter background cosmology. We derive the formal structure of the
LPT series expansion, working to arbitrary order in the initial perturbation
amplitude. The factors that regulate LPT convergence are identified by studying
the exact, analytic solution expanded according to this formal structure. The
key methodology is to complexify the exact solution, demonstrate that it is
analytic and apply well-known convergence criteria for power series expansions
of analytic functions.This analysis fully explains the previously reported
observation that LPT fails to predict the evolution of an underdense, open
region beyond a certain time. It also implies the existence of other examples,
including overdense, closed regions, for which LPT predictions should also
fail. We show that this is indeed the case by numerically computing the LPT
expansion in these problematic cases. The formal limitations to the validity of
LPT expansion are considerably more complicated than simply the first
occurrence of orbit crossings as is often assumed. Evolution to a future time
generically requires re-expanding the solution in overlapping domains that
ultimately link the initial and final times, each domain subject to its own
convergence criterion. We demonstrate that it is possible to handle all the
problematic cases by taking multiple steps (LPT re-expansion). We characterize
how the leading order numerical error for a solution generated by LPT re-
expansion varies with the choice of Lagrangian order and of time step size.
Convergence occurs when the Lagrangian order increases and/or the time step
size decreases in a simple, well-defined manner. We develop a recipe for time
step control for LPT re-expansion based on these results.
