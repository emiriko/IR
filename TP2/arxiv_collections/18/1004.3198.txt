A review is given of quantum network models in class C which, on a suitable
2d lattice, describe the spin quantum Hall plateau transition. On a general
class of graphs, however, many observables of such models can be mapped to
those of a classical walk in a random environment, thus relating questions of
quantum and classical localization. In many cases it is possible to make
rigorous statements about the latter through the relation to associated
percolation problems, in both two and three dimensions.
