We consider jet-shape observables of the type proposed recently, where the
shapes of one or more high-pT jets, produced in a multi-jet event with definite
jet multiplicity, may be measured leaving other jets in the event unmeasured.
We point out the structure of the full next-to-leading logarithmic resummation
specifically including resummation of non-global logarithms in the leading-Nc
limit and emphasising their properties. We also point out differences between
jet algorithms in the context of soft gluon resummation for such observables.
