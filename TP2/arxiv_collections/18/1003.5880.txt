The spectrum of strange multibaryons is considered within the chiral soliton
model using one of several possible SU(3$ quantization models (the bound state
rigid oscillator version). The states with energy below that of antikaon and
corresponding nucleus can be interpreted as antikaon-nucleus bound states. In
the formal limit of small kaon mass the number of such states becomes large,
for real value of this mass there are at least several states. For large values
of binding energies interpretation of such states just as antikaon-nuclear
bound states becomes more ambiguous.
