The Holevo quantity provides an upper bound for the mutual information
between the sender of a classical message encoded in quantum carriers and the
receiver. Applying the strong sub-additivity of entropy we prove that the
Holevo quantity associated with an initial state and a given quantum operation
represented in its Kraus form is not larger than the exchange entropy. This
implies upper bounds for the coherent information and for the quantum
Jensen--Shannon divergence. Restricting our attention to classical information
we bound the transmission distance between any two probability distributions by
the entropic distance, which is a concave function of the Hellinger distance.
