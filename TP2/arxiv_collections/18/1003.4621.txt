Counterfactual quantum key distribution provides natural advantage against
the eavesdropping on the actual signal particles. It can prevent the
photon-number-splitting attack when a weak coherent light source is used for
the practical implementation. We realized the counterfactual quantum key
distribution in an unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometer of 12.5-km-long
quantum channel with a high-fringe visibility of 96:4%. As a result, we
obtained secure keys against the noise-induced attack (eg. the vacuum attack)
and passive photon-number-splitting attack.
