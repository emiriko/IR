We present a visual determination of the number of bright points (BPs)
existing in the quiet Sun, which are structures though to trace intense kG
magnetic concentrations. The measurement is based on a 0.1 arcsec angular
resolution G-band movie obtained with the Swedish Solar Telescope at the solar
disk center. We find 0.97 BPs/Mm^2, which is a factor three larger than any
previous estimate. It corresponds to 1.2 BPs per solar granule. Depending on
the details of the segmentation, the BPs cover between 0.9% and 2.2% of the
solar surface. Assuming their field strength to be 1.5 kG, the detected BPs
contribute to the solar magnetic flux with an unsigned flux density between 13
G and 33 G. If network and inter-network regions are counted separately, they
contain 2.2 BPs/Mm^2 and 0.85 BPs/Mm^2, respectively.
