This letter focus on the effect of repulsive interactions on the adoption of
an external message in an opinion model. With a simple change in the rules, we
modify the Deffuant \emph{et al.} model to incorporate the presence of
repulsive interactions. We will show that information receptiveness is optimal
for an intermediate fraction of repulsive links. Using the master equation as
well as Monte Carlo simulations of the message-free model, we identify the
point where the system becomes optimally permeable to external influence with
an order-disorder transition.
