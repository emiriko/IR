The mean-field triplon analysis is developed for spin-S quantum
antiferromagnets with dimerized ground states. For the spin-1/2 case, it
reduces to the well known bond-operator mean-field theory. It is applied to a
coupled-dimer model on square lattice, and to a model on honeycomb lattice with
spontaneous dimerization in the ground state. Different phases in the ground
state are investigated as a function of spin. It is found that under suitable
conditions (such as strong frustration) a quantum ground state (dimerized
singlet phase in the present study) can survive even in the limit $S\rightarrow
\infty$. Two quick extensions of this representation are also presented. In one
case, it is extended to include the quintet states. In another, a similar
representation is worked out on a square plaquette. A convenient procedure for
evaluating the total-spin eigenstates for a pair of quantum spins is presented
in the appendix.
