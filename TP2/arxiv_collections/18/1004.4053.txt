We have derived a fractional Fokker-Planck equation for subdiffusion in a
general space-and- time-dependent force field from power law waiting time
continuous time random walks biased by Boltzmann weights. The governing
equation is derived from a generalized master equation and is shown to be
equivalent to a subordinated stochastic Langevin equation.
