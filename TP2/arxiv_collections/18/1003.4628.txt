In this paper, we consider methods to compute the coefficients of
interpolants relative to a basis of polynomials satisfying a three-term
recurrence relation. Two new algorithms are presented: the first constructs the
coefficients of the interpolation incrementally and can be used to update the
coefficients whenever a nodes is added to or removed from the interpolation.
The second algorithm, which constructs the interpolation coefficients by
decomposing the Vandermonde-like matrix iteratively, can not be used to update
or downdate an interpolation, yet is more numerically stable than the first
algorithm and is more efficient when the coefficients of multiple
interpolations are to be computed over the same set of nodes.
