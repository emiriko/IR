To investigate the formation and the propagation of relativistic shock waves
in viscous gluon matter we solve the relativistic Riemann problem using a
microscopic parton cascade. We demonstrate the transition from ideal to viscous
shock waves by varying the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio $\eta/s$.
Furthermore we compare our results with those obtained by solving the
relativistic causal dissipative fluid equations of Israel and Stewart (IS), in
order to show the validity of the IS hydrodynamics. Employing the parton
cascade we also investigate the formation of Mach shocks induced by a
high-energy gluon traversing viscous gluon matter. For $\eta/s = 0.08$ a Mach
cone structure is observed, whereas the signal smears out for $\eta/s \geq
0.32$.
