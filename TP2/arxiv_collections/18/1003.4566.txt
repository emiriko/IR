We analize the dipole spectrum of a two-level atom excited by a non-resonant
intense monochromatic field, under the electric dipole approximation and beyond
the rotating wave approximation. We show that the apparently complex spectral
structure can be completely described by two families: harmonic frequencies of
the driving field and field-induced nonlinear fluorescence. Our formulation of
the problem provides quantitative laws for the most relevant spectral features:
harmonic ratios and phases, non-perturbative Stark shift, and frequency limits
of the harmonic plateau. In particular, we demonstrate the locking of the
harmonic phases at the wings of the plateau opening the possibility of
ultra-short pulse generation through harmonic filtering.
