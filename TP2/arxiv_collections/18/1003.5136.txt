Observers restricted to the observation of pointer states of apparatus cannot
conclusively demonstrate that the pointer of an apparatus A registers the state
of a system of interest S without perturbing S. Observers cannot, therefore,
conclusively demonstrate that the states of a system S are redundantly encoded
by pointer states of multiple independent apparatus without destroying the
redundancy of encoding. The redundancy of encoding required by quantum
Darwinism must, therefore, be assumed from outside the quantum-mechanical
formalism and without the possibility of experimental demonstration.
