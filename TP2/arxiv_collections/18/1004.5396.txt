We discuss the physics capabilities of basic types of future atmospheric
detectors being considered at present, with their strengths and limitations,
and compare them with those of long baseline (LBL) experiments. We also argue
that recent studies signal the importance of synergistically combining
complementary features of both these classes of experiments in order to accrue
maximum benefit towards furthering our goal of building a complete picture of
neutrino properties and parameters.
