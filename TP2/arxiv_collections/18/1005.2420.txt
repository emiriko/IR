In the paper with the above-noted title, T. C. Wallstrom claims that the
description of the particle's motion as a certain "conservative" diffusion is
not equivalent to quantum mechanics in spite of the fact that the Madelung
"hydrodynamic" equations, which provide the description of such a diffusion,
can be converted to the Schroedinger equation. He pointed out that such a
stochastic theory can be regarded as equivalent to conventional quantum
mechanics only if they can derive from it not just the Madelung equations but
also the condition that the circulation of the "probability fluid" is always
quantized, which is equivalent the condition for the single-valuedness of the
wave function. We, however, show that the single-valuedness of the wave
function required in quantum mechanics, is not an auxiliary condition but a
property of all local solutions of the Schrodinger equation. Based on the
one-to-one correspondence between local solutions of the Schroedinger and the
Madelung equations this means that the quantization of the circulation of the
"probability fluid" is a property of all solutions of the Madelung equations.
