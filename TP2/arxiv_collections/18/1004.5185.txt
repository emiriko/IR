Kitaev honeycomb model with topological phase transition at zero temperature
is studied using quantum information method. Based on the exact solution of the
ground state, the mutual information between two nearest sites and between two
bonds with longest distance are obtained. It is found that the mutual
information show some singularities at the critical point where the ground
state of the system transits from gapless phase to gapped phase. The
finite-size effects and scalar behavior are also studied. The mutual
information can serve as good indicators of the topological phase transition,
since the mutual information catches some global correlation properties of the
system. Meanwhile, this method has other advantages such that the phase
transition can be determined easily and the order parameters are not required
previously, for the order parameters of some topological phase transitions are
hard to know.
