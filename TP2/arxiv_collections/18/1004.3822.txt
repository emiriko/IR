We continue the study of the closures of $GL(V)$-orbits in the enhanced
nilpotent cone $V\times\cN$ begun by the first two authors. We prove that each
closure is an invariant-theoretic quotient of a suitably-defined enhanced
quiver variety. We conjecture, and prove in special cases, that these enhanced
quiver varieties are normal complete intersections, implying that the enhanced
nilpotent orbit closures are also normal.
