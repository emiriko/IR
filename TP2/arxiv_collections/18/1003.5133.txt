A series of electron spin resonance (ESR) experiments were performed on a
single crystal of the heavy fermion metal YbIr2Si2 to map out the anisotropy of
the ESR-intensity I_ESR which is governed by the microwave field component of
the g-factor. The temperature dependencies of I_ESR(T) and g(T) were measured
for different orientations and compared within the range 2.6K \le T \le 16K.
The analysis of the intensity dependence on the crystal orientation with
respect to both the direction of the microwave field and the static magnetic
field revealed remarkable features: The intensity variation with respect to the
direction of the microwave field was found to be one order of magnitude smaller
than expected from the g-factor anisotropy. Furthermore, we observed a weak
basal plane anisotropy of the ESR parameters which we interpret to be an
intrinsic sample property.
