We consider a model of strong electroweak symmetry breaking in which the
expectation value of an additional, possibly composite, scalar field is
responsible for the generation of fermion masses. The dynamics of the strongly
coupled sector is defined and studied via its holographic dual, and does not
correspond to a simple, scaled-up version of QCD. We consider the bounds from
perturbative unitarity, the S parameter, and the mass of the Higgs-like scalar.
We show that the combination of these constraints leaves a relatively limited
region of parameter space viable, and suggests the qualitative features of the
model that might be probed at the LHC.
