A class of Brownian dynamics algorithms for stochastic reaction-diffusion
models which include reversible bimolecular reactions is presented and
analyzed. The method is a generalization of the $\lambda$--$\newrho$ model for
irreversible bimolecular reactions which was introduced in [arXiv:0903.1298].
The formulae relating the experimentally measurable quantities (reaction rate
constants and diffusion constants) with the algorithm parameters are derived.
The probability of geminate recombination is also investigated.
