We present the results of a pilot wide-field radial velocity and metal
abundance survey of red giants in ten fields in the Small Magellanic Cloud
(SMC). The targets lie at projected distances of 0.9 and 1.9 kpc from the SMC
centre ($m-M=18.79$) to the North, East, South and West. Two more fields are to
the East at distances of 3.9 and 5.1 kpc. In this last field we find only a few
to no SMC giants, suggesting that the edge of the SMC in this direction lies
approximately at 6 kpc from its centre. In all eastern fields we observe a
double peak in the radial velocities of stars, with a component at the
classical SMC recession velocity of $\sim 160$ km s$^{-1}$ and a high velocity
component at about 200 km s$^{-1}$, similar to observations in H{\small I}. In
the most distant field (3.9 kpc) the low velocity component is at 106 km
s$^{-1}$. The metal abundance distribution in all fields is broad and centred
at about [Fe/H] $\sim -1.25$, reaching to solar and possibly slightly
supersolar values and down to [Fe/H] of about -2.5. In the two innermost (0.9
kpc) Northern and Southern fields we observe a secondary peak at metallicities
of about $\sim -0.6$. This may be evidence of a second episode of star
formation in the centre, possibly triggered by the interactions that created
the Stream and Bridge.
