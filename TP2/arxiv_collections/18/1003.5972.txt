The one-dimensional effective Hamiltonian for a planar curvilinear quantum
wire with arbitrary shape is proposed in the presence of the Rashba spin-orbit
interaction. Single electron propagation through a device of two straight lines
conjugated with an arc has been investigated and the analytic expressions of
the reflection and transmission probabilities have been derived. The effects of
the device geometry and the spin-orbit coupling strength $\alpha$ on the
reflection and transmission probabilities and the conductance are investigated
in the case of spin polarized electron incidence. We find that no spin-flip
exists in the reflection of the first junction. The reflection probabilities
are mainly influenced by the arc angle and the radius, while the transmission
probabilities are affected by both spin-orbit coupling and the device geometry.
The probabilities and the conductance take the general behavior of oscillation
versus the device geometry parameters and $\alpha $. Especially the electron
transportation varies periodically versus the arc angle $\theta_{w}$. We also
investigate the relationship between the conductance and the electron energy,
and find that electron resonant transmission occurs for certain energy.
Finally, the electron transmission for the incoming electron with arbitrary
state is considered. For the outgoing electron, the polarization ratio is
obtained and the effects of the incoming electron state are discussed. We find
that the outgoing electron state can be spin polarization and reveal the
polarized conditions.
