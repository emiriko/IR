Let $u\in\mathrm{End}(\mathbb{C}^n)$ be nilpotent. The variety of $u$-stable
complete flags is called the Springer fiber over $u$. Its irreducible
components are parameterized by a set of standard Young tableaux. The
Richardson (resp. Bala-Carter) components of Springer fibers correspond to the
Richardson (resp. Bala-Carter) elements of the symmetric group, through
Robinson-Schensted correspondence. Every Richardson component is isomorphic to
a product of standard flag varieties. On the contrary, the Bala-Carter
components are very susceptible to be singular. First, we characterize the
singular Bala-Carter components in terms of two minimal forbidden
configurations. Next, we introduce two new families of components, wider than
the families of Bala-Carter components and Richardson components, and both in
duality via the tableau transposition. The components in the first family are
characterized by the fact that they have a dense orbit of special type under
the action of the stabilizer of $u$, whereas all components in the second
family are iterated fiber bundles over projective spaces.
