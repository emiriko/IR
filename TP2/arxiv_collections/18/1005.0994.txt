We study the possible heavy molecular states composed of a pair of charm
mesons in the H and S doublets. Since the P-wave charm-strange mesons
$D_{s0}(2317)$ and $D_{s1}(2460)$ are extremely narrow, the future experimental
observation of the possible heavy molecular states composed of $D_s/D_s^\ast$
and $D_{s0}(2317)/D_{s1}(2460)$ may be feasible if they really exist.
Especially the possible $J^{PC}=1^{--}$ states may be searched for via the
initial state radiation technique.
