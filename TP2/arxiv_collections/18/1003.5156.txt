We classify spin structures on the noncommutative torus, and find that the
noncommutative n-torus has 2^n spin structures, corresponding to isospectral
deformations of spin structures on the commutative n-torus. For n>3 the
classification depends on Connes' spin manifold theorem. In addition, we study
unitary equivalences of these spin structures.
