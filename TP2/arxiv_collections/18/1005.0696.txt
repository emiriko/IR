Vinzenz von Tscharner (2000) has presented an interesting mathematical method
for analyzing EMG-data called "intensity analysis" (EMG = electromyography).
Basically the method is a sort of bandpassing of the signal. The central idea
of the method is to describe the "power" (or "intensity") of a non-stationary
EMG signal as a function both of time and of frequency. The connection with
wavelet theory is that the filter is constructed by rescaling a given mother
wavelet using a special array of scales (center frequencies) with non-constant
relative bandwidth. Some aspects of the method may seem a bit ad hoc and we
have therefore undertaken a closer mathematical investigation, showing the
connection with the conventional wavelet analysis and giving a somewhat
simplified formulation of the method using Morlet wavelets. It is pointed out
that the "intensity analysis" method is related to the concept of an equalizer.
In order to illustrate the method we apply it to nonstationary EMG-signals of a
dynamic leg-extension force-velcity tests. (Data provided by Taija Finni,
