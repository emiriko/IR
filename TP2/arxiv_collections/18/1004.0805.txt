We present a realistic treatment of the hydrodynamic evolution of
ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions, based on the following features:
initial conditions obtained from a flux tube approach, compatible with the
string model and the color glass condensate picture; event-by-event procedure,
taking into the account the highly irregular space structure of single events,
being experimentally visible via so-called ridge structures in two-particle
correlations; use of an efficient code for solving the hydrodynamic equations
in 3+1 dimensions, including the conservation of baryon number, strangeness,
and electric charge; employment of a realistic equation-of-state, compatible
with lattice gauge results; use of a complete hadron resonance table, making
our calculations compatible with the results from statistical models; hadronic
cascade procedure after an hadronization from the thermal matter at an early
time.
