We discuss improvements to the short-term performance of tunnel diode
oscillator transducers with an emphasis on frequencies from 30 MHz to 1.2 GHz
using LC type tank circuits. We specifically consider the TDO in pulsed high
magnetic fields with fast digital acquisition. Since overdriven oscillators are
necessary in pulsed fields to maintain oscillations, we examine the circuit
using SPICE simulation during the design process and to gain insight into its
behavior. We also discuss a numerical technique for demodulating the
oscillations into frequency and amplitude.
