We have formulated a generating function for the Hermite polynomials by
comparing two expressions of the same coherent states attached to planar Landau
levels. A first expression is obtained by generalizing the canonical coherent
states when written as series expansion in the basis of number states. While
the second expression is established by following a construction based on group
representation theory.
