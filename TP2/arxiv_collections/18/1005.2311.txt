The formation of liquid bridges between a planar and conical substrates is
analyzed macroscopically taking into account the line tension. Depending on the
value of the line tension coefficient \tau and geometric parameters of the
system one observes two different scenarios of liquid bridge formation upon
changing the fluid state along the bulk liquid-vapor coexistence. For \tau >
\tau * (\tau * < 0) there is a first-order transition to a state with
infinitely thick liquid bridge. For \tau < \tau * the scenario consists of two
steps: first there is a first-order transition to a state with liquid bridge of
finite thickness which upon further increase of temperature is followed by
continuous growth of the thickness of the bridge to infinity. In addition to
constructing the relevant phase diagram we examine the dependence of the width
of the bridge on thermodynamic and geometric parameters of the system.
