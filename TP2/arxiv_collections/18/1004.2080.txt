It is observed that the category of n-ary Hom-Nambu(-Lie) algebras is closed
under twisting by self-weak morphisms. Constructions of ternary Hom-Nambu
algebras from Hom-associative algebras, Hom-Lie algebras, ternary totally
Hom-associative algebras, and Hom-Jordan triple systems are given. Every
multiplicative n-ary Hom-Nambu algebra gives rise to a sequence of Hom-Nambu
algebras of exponentially higher arities. Under some conditions, an n-ary
Hom-Nambu(-Lie) algebra gives rise to an (n-1)-ary Hom-Nambu(-Lie) algebra.
