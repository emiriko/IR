In this paper we present simulated observations of massive self-gravitating
circumstellar discs using the Atacama Large Millimetre/sub-millimetre Array
(ALMA). Using a smoothed particle hydrodynamics model of a $0.2M_{\odot}$ disc
orbiting a $1M_{\odot}$ protostar, with a cooling model appropriate for discs
at temperatures below $\sim 160$K and representative dust opacities, we have
constructed maps of the expected emission at sub-mm wavelengths. We have then
used the CASA ALMA simulator to generate simulated images and visibilities with
various array configurations and observation frequencies, taking into account
the expected thermal noise and atmospheric opacities. We find that at 345 GHz
(870 $\mu$m) spiral structures at a resolution of a few AU should be readily
detectable in approximately face-on discs out to distances of the Taurus-Auriga
star-forming complex.
