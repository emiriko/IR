The ground state of an impurity immersed in a Fermi sea changes from a
polaron to a molecule as the interaction strength is increased.
  We show here that the coupling between these two states is strongly
suppressed due to a combination of phase space effects and Fermi statistics,
and that it vanishes much faster than the energy difference between the two
states, thereby confirming the first order nature of the polaron-molecule
transition. In the regime where each state is metastable, we find quasiparticle
lifetimes which are much longer than what is expected for a usual Fermi liquid.
Our analysis indicates that the decay rates are sufficiently slow to be
experimentally observable.
