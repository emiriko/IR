This paper deals with decision support systems resting on multidimensional
modelling of data. Moreover, we intend to offer a set of concepts and
mechanisms for personalized multidimensional database specifications. This
personalization consists in associating weights to different components of a
multidimensional schema. Personalization specifications are specified through
the use of a language based on the principle of Event Condition Action. This
personalisation determines multidimensional data display as well as their
analyses (with the use of drilling or rotating operations).
