We have used the Extreme Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) on the Hinode
spacecraft to observe large areas of outflow near an active region. These
outflows are seen to persist for at least 6 days. The emission line profiles
suggest that the outflow region is composed of multiple outflowing components,
Doppler-shifted with respect to each other. We have modeled this scenario by
imposing a double-Gaussian fit to the line profiles. These fits represent the
profile markedly better than a single Gaussian fit for Fe XII and XIII emission
lines. For the fastest outflowing components, we find velocities as high as 200
km/s. However, there remains a correlation between the fitted line velocities
and widths, suggesting that the outflows are not fully resolved by the
double-Gaussian fit and that the outflow may be comprised of further
components.
