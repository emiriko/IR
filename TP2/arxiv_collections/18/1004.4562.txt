In this work Gamma Ray Burst (GRB) data is used to place constraints on a
putative coupling between dark energy and dark matter. Type Ia supernovae (SNe
Ia) constraints from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey II (SDSS-II) first-year
results, the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) shift parameter from
WMAP seven year results and the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) peak from the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) are also discussed. The prospects for the field
are assessed, as more GRB events become available.
