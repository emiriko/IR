We present a detailed study of the F-type detached eclipsing binary BK Peg,
based on new photometric and spectroscopic observations. The two components,
which have evolved to the upper half of the main-sequence band, are quite
different with masses and radii of (1.414 +/- 0.007 Msun, 1.988 +/- 0.008 Rsun)
and (1.257 +/- 0.005 Msun, 1.474 +/- 0.017 Rsun), respectively. The 5.49 day
period orbit of BK Peg is slightly eccentric (e = 0.053). The measured
rotational velocities are 16.6 +/- 0.2 (primary) and 13.4 +/- 0.2 (secondary)
km/s. For the secondary component this corresponds to (pseudo)synchronous
rotation, whereas the primary component seems to rotate at a slightly lower
rate. We derive an iron abundance of [Fe/H] =-0.12 +/- 0.07 and similar
abundances for Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, Cr and Ni. Yonsei-Yale and Victoria-Regina
evolutionary models for the observed metal abundance reproduce BK Peg at ages
of 2.75 and 2.50 Gyr, respectively, but tend to predict a lower age for the
more massive primary component than for the secondary. We find the same age
trend for three other upper main-sequence systems in a sample of well studied
eclipsing binaries with components in the 1.15-1.70 Msun range, where
convective core overshoot is gradually ramped up in the models. We also find
that the Yonsei-Yale models systematically predict higher ages than the
Victoria-Regina models. The sample includes BW Aqr, and as a supplement we have
determined a [Fe/H] abundance of -0.07 +/- 0.11 for this late F-type binary. We
propose to use BK Peg, BW Aqr, and other well-studied 1.15-1.70 Msun eclipsing
binaries to fine-tune convective core overshoot, diffusion, and possibly other
ingredients of modern theoretical evolutionary models.
