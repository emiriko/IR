Casualties due to traffic accidents are increasing day by day. Think of this
message being displayed on your computer screen while you were driving "there's
a possibility of collision with a car in the next few minutes if you go on
driving with this speed and direction". Our research is intended towards
developing collision avoidance architecture for the latest Intelligent
Transport System. The exchange of safety messages among vehicles and with
infrastructure devices poses major challenges. Specially, safety messages have
to be adaptively distributed within a certain range of a basically unbounded
system. These messages are to be well coordinated and processed via different
algorithms. The purpose of the paper is to discuss the ITWS (intelligent
transportation warning system), we have discussed the Assisted Global
Positioning System(AGPS) system providing additional positioning information at
variable conditions. We have also discussed study the Data fusion and kalaman
filter in details. The performance of kalman filter and output are discussed.
Hardware realization of this model is achieved through software defined radio
(SDR).
