We describe in this paper the design of a miniature shock tube (smaller than
1 cm3) that can be placed in a vacuum vessel and allows transverse optical
probing and longitudinal backside XUV emission spectroscopy. Typical
application is the study of laser launched radiative shocks, in the framework
of what is called "laboratory Astrophysics".
