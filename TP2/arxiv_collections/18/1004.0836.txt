We present a comparative study of the thermal emission of the transiting
exoplanets WASP-1b and WASP-2b using the Spitzer Space Telescope. The two
planets have very similar masses but suffer different levels of irradiation and
are predicted to fall either side of a sharp transition between planets with
and without hot stratospheres. WASP-1b is one of the most highly irradiated
planets studied to date. We measure planet/star contrast ratios in all four of
the IRAC bands for both planets (3.6-8.0um), and our results indicate the
presence of a strong temperature inversion in the atmosphere of WASP-1b,
particularly apparent at 8um, and no inversion in WASP-2b. In both cases the
measured eclipse depths favor models in which incident energy is not
redistributed efficiently from the day side to the night side of the planet. We
fit the Spitzer light curves simultaneously with the best available radial
velocity curves and transit photometry in order to provide updated measurements
of system parameters. We do not find significant eccentricity in the orbit of
either planet, suggesting that the inflated radius of WASP-1b is unlikely to be
the result of tidal heating. Finally, by plotting ratios of secondary eclipse
depths at 8um and 4.5um against irradiation for all available planets, we find
evidence for a sharp transition in the emission spectra of hot Jupiters at an
irradiation level of 2 x 10^9 erg/s/cm^2. We suggest this transition may be due
to the presence of TiO in the upper atmospheres of the most strongly irradiated
hot Jupiters.
