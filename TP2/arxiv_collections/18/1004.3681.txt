In this paper we propose to perform the scintigraphy of small organ using a
rotating-slit collimator and a bundle of scintillating glass fibers, put in
parallel with the slit and rotating with it. An intensified CCD, coupled to the
end of the fibers, acquires an integrated image of the events per each rotation
angle. The final image is computed by a back-projection procedure. The
advantages of this method, with respect to conventional scintigraphy, are the
improvement of the detection efficiency of one-two order of magnitude without
counting rate limitations, the improvement of the spatial resolution, the
elimination of the parallax error and the rejection of the spurious events,
without energy analysis. Simulations and first experimental results are showed.
