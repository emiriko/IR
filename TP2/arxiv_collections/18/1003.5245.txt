In this work we show that the spin pendulum techniques developed by the
E\:{o}t-Wash group could be used to put very stringent bounds on the free
parameters of a Lorentz invariant phenomenological model of quantum gravity.
The model is briefly described as well as the experimental setup that we have
in mind.
