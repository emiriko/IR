The problem Hamiltonian of the adiabatic quantum algorithm for the
maximum-weight independent set problem (MIS) that is based on the reduction to
the Ising problem (as described in [Choi08]) has flexible parameters. We show
that by choosing the parameters appropriately in the problem Hamiltonian
(without changing the problem to be solved) for MIS on CK graphs, we can
prevent the first order quantum phase transition and significantly change the
minimum spectral gap. We raise the basic question about what the appropriate
formulation of adiabatic running time should be. We also describe adiabatic
quantum algorithms for Exact Cover and 3SAT in which the problem Hamiltonians
are based on the reduction to MIS. We point out that the argument in Altshuler
et al.(arXiv:0908.2782 [quant-ph]) that their adiabatic quantum algorithm
failed with high probability for randomly generated instances of Exact Cover
does not carry over to this new algorithm.
