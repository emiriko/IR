Here, we peruse cosmological usage of the most promising candidates of dark
energy in the framework of f(R) theory. We reconstruct the different f(R)
modified gravity models in the spatially flat FRW universe according to the
ordinary and entropy-corrected versions of the holographic and new agegraphic
dark energy models, which describe accelerated expansion of the universe. We
also obtain the equation of state parameter of the corresponding f(R)-gravity
models. We conclude that the holographic and new agegraphic f(R)-gravity models
can behave like phantom or quintessence models. Whereas the equation of state
parameter of the entropy-corrected models can transit from quintessence state
to phantom regime as indicated by recent observations.
