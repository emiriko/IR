By numerical simulation of the time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equation we
show that a weakly interacting or noninteracting Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC)
vortex can be localized in a three-dimensional bichromatic quasi-periodic
optical-lattice (OL) potential generated by the superposition of two
standing-wave polarized laser beams with incommensurate wavelengths. This is a
generalization of the localization of a BEC in a one-dimensional bichromatic OL
as studied in a recent experiment [Roati et al., Nature 453, 895 (2008)]. We
demonstrate the stability of the localized state by considering its time
evolution in the form of a stable breathing oscillation in a slightly altered
potential for a large period of time. {Finally, we consider the localization of
a BEC in a random 1D potential in the form of several identical repulsive
spikes arbitrarily distributed in space.
