We present an algorithm for computing line bundle valued cohomology classes
over toric varieties. This is the basic starting point for computing massless
modes in both heterotic and Type IIB/F-theory compactifications, where the
manifolds of interest are complete intersections of hypersurfaces in toric
varieties supporting additional vector bundles.
