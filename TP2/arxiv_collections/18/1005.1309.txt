We study density profiles of an ideal Fermi gas and observe Pauli suppression
of density fluctuations (atom shot noise) for cold clouds deep in the quantum
degenerate regime. Strong suppression is observed for probe volumes containing
more than 10,000 atoms. Measuring the level of suppression provides sensitive
thermometry at low temperatures. After this method of sensitive noise
measurements has been validated with an ideal Fermi gas, it can now be applied
to characterize phase transitions in strongly correlated many-body systems.
