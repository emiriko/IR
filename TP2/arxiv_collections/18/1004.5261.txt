We review an approach to non-commutative geometry, where models are
constructed by quantisation of the coordinates. In particular we focus on the
full DFR model and its irreducible components; the (arbitrary) restriction to a
particular irreducible component is often referred to as the "canonical quantum
spacetime". The aim is to distinguish and compare the approaches under various
points of view, including motivations, prescriptions for quantisation, the
choice of mathematical objects and concepts, approaches to dynamics and to
covariance.
