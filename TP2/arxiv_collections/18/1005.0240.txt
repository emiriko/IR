We report combined optical birefringence and neutron scattering measurements
on the liquid crystal 12CB nanoconfined in mesoporous silicon layers. This
liquid crystal exhibits strong nematic-smectic coupling responsible for a
discontinuous isotropic-to-smectic phase transition in the bulk state. Confined
in porous silicon, 12CB is subjected to strong anisotropic quenched disorder: a
short-ranged smectic state evolves out of a paranematic phase. This
transformation appears continuous, losing its bulk first order character. This
contrasts with previously reported observations on liquid crystals under
isotropic quenched disorder. In the low temperature phase, both orientational
and translational order parameters obey the same power-law.
