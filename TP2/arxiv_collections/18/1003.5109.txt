(abridged) Recent work on several beta Cephei stars has succeeded in
constraining both their interior rotation profile and their convective core
overshoot. In particular, a recent study focusing on theta$ Oph has shown that
a convective core overshoot parameter of alpha = 0.44 is required to model the
observed pulsation frequencies, significantly higher than for other stars of
this type. We investigate the effects of rotation and overshoot in early type
main sequence pulsators, and attempt to use the low order pulsation frequencies
to constrain these parameters. This will be applied to a few test models and
theta Oph. We use a 2D stellar evolution code and a 2D linear adiabatic
pulsation code to calculate pulsation frequencies for 9.5 Msun models. We
calculate low order p-modes for models with a range of rotation rates and
convective core overshoot parameters. Using these models, we find that the
convective core overshoot has a larger effect on the pulsation frequencies than
the rotation, except in the most rapidly rotating models considered. When the
differences in radii are accounted for by scaling the frequencies, the effects
of rotation diminish, but are not entirely accounted for. We find that
increasing the convective core overshoot decreases the large separation, while
producing a slight increase in the small separations. We created a model
frequency grid which spanned several rotation rates and convective core
overshoot values. Using a modified chi^2 statistic, we are able to recover the
rotation velocity and core overshoot for a few test models. Finally, we discuss
the case of the beta Cephei star theta Oph. Using the observed frequencies and
a fixed mass and metallicity, we find a lower overshoot than previously
determined, with alpha = 0.28 +/- 0.05. Our determination of the rotation rate
agrees well with both previous work and observations, around 30 km/s.
