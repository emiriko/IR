We embed multidimensional Farey fractions in large horospheres and explain
under which conditions they become uniformly distributed in the ambient
homogeneous space. This question has recently been investigated in the case of
SL(d,Z) to prove the asymptotic distribution of Frobenius numbers. The present
paper extends these studies to general lattices in SL(d,R).
