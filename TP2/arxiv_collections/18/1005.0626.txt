Interacting binaries typically have separations in the milli-arcsecond regime
and hence it has been challenging to resolve them at any wavelength. However,
recent advances in optical interferometry have improved our ability to discern
the components in these systems and have now enabled the direct determination
of physical parameters. We used the Navy Prototype Optical Interferometer to
produce for the first time images resolving all three components in the
well-known Algol triple system. Specifically, we have separated the tertiary
component from the binary and simultaneously resolved the eclipsing binary
pair, which represents the nearest and brightest eclipsing binary in the sky.
We present revised orbital elements for the triple system, and we have
rectified the 180-degree ambiguity in the position angle of Algol C. Our
directly determined magnitude differences and masses for this triple star
system are consistent with earlier light curve modeling results.
