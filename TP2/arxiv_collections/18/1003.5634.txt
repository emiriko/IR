We present measurements of carbon monoxide emission in the central region of
the nearby starburst NGC 6000 taken with the Submillimeter Array. The J=2-1
transition of 12CO, 13CO, and C18O were imaged at a resolution of ~3''x2''
(450x300 pc). We accurately determine the dynamical center of NGC 6000 at
R.A(J2000.0)=15h49m49.5s and dec(J2000.0)=-29d23'13'' which agrees with the
peak of molecular emission position. The observed CO dynamics could be
explained in the context of the presence of a bar potential affecting the
molecular material, likely responsible for the strong nuclear concentration
where more than 85% of the gas is located. We detect a kinematically detached
component of dense molecular gas at relatively high velocity which might be
fueling the star formation. A total nuclear dynamical mass of 7x10^9 Msun is
derived and a total mass of gas of 4.6x10^8 Msun, yielding a Mgas/Mdyn~6%,
similar to other previously studied barred galaxies with central starbursts. We
determined the mass of molecular gas with the optically thin isotopologue C18O
and we estimate a CO-to-H2 conversion factor X(CO)=0.4x10^20 cm-2/(K km s-1) in
agreement with that determined in other starburst galaxies.
