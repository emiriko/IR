We demonstrate that a tensor product structure could be obtained by
introducing pseudorandom phase sequences into classical fields with two
orthogonal modes. Using classical fields modulated with pseudorandom phase
sequences, we discuss efficient simulation of several typical quantum states,
including product state, Bell states, GHZ state, and W state. By performing
quadrature demodulation scheme, we could obtain the mode status matrix of the
simulating classical fields, based on which we propose a sequence permutation
mechanism to reconstruct the simulated quantum states. The research on
classical simulation of quantum states is important, for it not only enables
potential practical applications in quantum computation, but also provides
useful insights into fundamental concepts of quantum mechanics.
