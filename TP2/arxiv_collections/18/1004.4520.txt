This paper is a first study on the topic of achieving physical layer security
by exploiting non-systematic channel codes. The chance of implementing
transmission security at the physical layer is known since many years in
information theory, but it is now gaining an increasing interest due to its
many possible applications. It has been shown that channel coding techniques
can be effectively exploited for designing physical layer security schemes,
able to ensure that an unauthorized receiver, experiencing a channel different
from that of the the authorized receiver, is not able to gather any
information. Recently, it has been proposed to exploit puncturing techniques in
order to reduce the security gap between the authorized and unauthorized
channels. In this paper, we show that the same target can also be achieved by
using non-systematic codes, able to scramble information bits within the
transmitted codeword.
