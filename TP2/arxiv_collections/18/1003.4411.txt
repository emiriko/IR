In this paper, we study a scalar conservation law that models a highly
re-entrant manufacturing system as encountered in semi-conductor production. As
a generalization of \cite{CKWang}, the velocity function possesses both the
local and nonlocal character. We prove the existence and uniqueness of the weak
solution to the Cauchy problem with initial and boundary data in $L^{\infty}$.
We also obtain the stability (continuous dependence) of both the solution and
the out-flux with respect to the initial and boundary data. Finally, we prove
the existence of an optimal control that minimizes, in the $L^p$-sense with
$p\in [1,\infty)$, the difference between the actual out-flux and a forecast
demand over a fixed time period.
