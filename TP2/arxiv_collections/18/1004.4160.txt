The fundamental properties of the lepton sector include the neutrino masses
and flavor mixings. Both are difficult to observe because of the extremely
small neutrino masses and neutrino-matter cross sections. In these lectures, we
focus on the basic concepts for the determination of neutrino properties. We
introduce neutrino oscillations as standard mechanism for neutrino flavor
changes, and we discuss methods to measure the neutrino mass. Furthermore, we
illustrate how precision measurements in neutrino oscillations will be
performed in the future, and may even open a window to new physics properties,
such as motivated by LHC physics. Finally, we discuss some applications of
neutrinos in astrophysics, such as neutrino oscillations in the Sun. We also
illustrate how neutrinos from extragalactic cosmic accelerators may be used for
the determination of neutrino properties.
