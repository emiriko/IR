The CALICE collaboration has constructed highly granular electromagnetic and
hadronic calorimeter prototypes to evaluate technologies for the use in
detector systems at a future Linear Collider. The hadron calorimeter uses small
scintillator cells individually read out with silicon photomultipliers. The
system with 7608 channels has been successfully operated in beam tests at DESY,
CERN and Fermilab since 2006, and represents the first large scale tests of
these devices in high energy physics experiments. The unprecedented granularity
of the detector provides detailed information of the properties of hadronic
showers, which helps to constrain hadronic shower models through comparisons
with model calculations. Results on longitudinal and lateral shower profiles,
compared to a variety of hadronic shower models, first results with a software
compensation technique for the energy resolution and an outlook on the next
generation detector prototype are presented.
