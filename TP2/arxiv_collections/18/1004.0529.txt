We present UV broadband photometry and optical emission-line measurements for
a sample of 32 Brightest Cluster Galaxies (BCGs) in clusters of the
Representative XMM-Newton Cluster Structure Survey (REXCESS) with z =
0.06-0.18. The REXCESS clusters, chosen to study scaling relations in clusters
of galaxies, have X-ray measurements of high quality. The trends of star
formation and BCG colors with BCG and host properties can be investigated with
this sample. The UV photometry comes from the XMM Optical Monitor, supplemented
by existing archival GALEX photometry. We detected H\alpha and forbidden line
emission in 7 (22%) of these BCGs, in optical spectra. All of the emission-line
BCGs occupy clusters classified as cool cores, for an emission-line incidence
rate of 70% for BCGs in cool core clusters. Significant correlations between
the H\alpha equivalent widths, excess UV production in the BCG, and the
presence of dense, X-ray bright intracluster gas with a short cooling time are
seen, including the fact that all of the H\alpha emitters inhabit systems with
short central cooling times and high central ICM densities. Estimates of the
star formation rates based on H\alpha and UV excesses are consistent with each
other in these 7 systems, ranging from 0.1-8 solar masses per year. The
incidence of emission-line BCGs in the REXCESS sample is intermediate, somewhat
lower than in other X-ray selected samples (-35%), and somewhat higher than but
statistically consistent with optically selected, slightly lower redshift BCG
samples (-10-15%). The UV-optical colors (UVW1-R-4.7\pm0.3) of REXCESS BCGs
without strong optical emission lines are consistent with those predicted from
templates and observations of ellipticals dominated by old stellar populations.
We see no trend in UV-optical colors with optical luminosity, R-K color, X-ray
temperature, redshift, or offset between X-ray centroid and X-ray peak (<w>).
