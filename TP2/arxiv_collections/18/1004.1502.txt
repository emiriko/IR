It is shown that experimental values of the cross sections of inelastic
low-energy neutron scattering on even-even nuclei together with the description
of these cross sections in the framework of the coupled channel optical model
may be considered as a reliable method for finding nuclei with a semimagic
number (or numbers) of nucleons. Some examples of the application of this
method are considered.
