Plutonium dioxide is of high technological importance in nuclear fuel cycle
and is particularly crucial in long-term storage of Pu-based radioactive waste.
Using first-principles density-functional theory, in this paper we
systematically study the structural, electronic, mechanical, thermodynamic
properties, and pressure induced structural transition of PuO$_{2}$. To
properly describe the strong correlation in the Pu $5f$ electrons, the local
density approximation$+U$ and the generalized gradient approximation$+U$
theoretical formalisms have been employed. We optimize the $U$ parameter in
calculating the total energy, lattice parameters, and bulk modulus at the
nonmagnetic, ferromagnetic, and antiferromagnetic configurations for both
ground state fluorite structure and high pressure cotunnite structure. The best
agreement with experiments is obtained by tuning the effective Hubbard
parameter $U$ at around 4 eV within the LDA$+U$ approach. After carefully
testing the validity of the ground state, we further investigate the bonding
nature, elastic constants, various moduli, Debye temperature, hardness, ideal
tensile strength, and phonon dispersion for fluorite PuO$_{2}$. Some
thermodynamic properties, e.g., the Gibbs free energy, volume thermal
expansion, and specific heat, are also calculated. As for cotunnite phase,
besides the elastic constants, various moduli, and Debye temperature at 0 GPa,
we have further presented our calculated electronic, structural, and magnetic
properties for PuO$_{2}$ under pressure up to 280 GPa. A metallic transition at
around 133 GPa and an isostructural transition in pressure range of 75-133 GPa
are predicted.
