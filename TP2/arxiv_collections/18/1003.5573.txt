The thermoluminescence (TL) method is used for the investigation of the
energy spectrum of traps in KCl and NaI crystals in the temperature range
80-500 K. It is shown that the thermal activation energies of traps in KCl and
NaI form one oscillatory series E=hwn with vibrational quantum energies of
0.121 eV in KCl and 0.061 eV in NaI. In this case, the quantum number n assumes
half-integer and integer values. Based on the generalized data on the
investigated alkali-halide crystals (AHC), we confirmed the earlier proposed
model of TL in AHCs. It is assumed that, in addition to the nonradiative H-F
recombination, there exists the two-stage recombination of H-centers at anion
vacancies resulting in the radiative recombination of a hole at an F-center.
The energy of a quantum in the oscillatory rule corresponds to a local
vibrational mode of an X2 halide molecule.
