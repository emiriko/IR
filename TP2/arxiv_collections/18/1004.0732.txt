We consider symmetric pairs of Lie superalgebras which are strongly reductive
and of even type, and introduce a graded Harish-Chandra homomorphism. We prove
that its image is a certain explicit filtered subalgebra of the Weyl invariants
on a Cartan subspace whose associated graded is the image of Chevalley's
restriction map on symmetric invariants. This generalises results of
Harish-Chandra and V. Kac, M. Gorelik.
