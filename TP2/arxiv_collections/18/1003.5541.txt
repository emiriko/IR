Source confusion defines a practical depth to which to take large-area
extragalactic surveys. 3D imaging spectrometers with positional as well as
spectral information, however, potentially provide a means by which to use line
emission to break the traditional confusion limit. In this paper we present the
results of our investigation into the effectiveness of mid/far infrared,
wide-area spectroscopic surveys in breaking the confusion limit. We use SAFARI,
a FIR imaging Fourier Transform Spectrometer concept for the proposed JAXA-led
SPICA mission, as a test case. We generate artificial skies representative of
100 SAFARI footprints and use a fully-automated redshift determination method
to retrieve redshifts for both spatially and spectrally confused sources for
bright-end and burst mode galaxy evolution models. We find we are able to
retrieve accurate redshifts for 38/54% of the brightest spectrally confused
sources, with continuum fluxes as much as an order of magnitude below the 120
$\mu$m photometric confusion limit. In addition we also recover accurate
redshifts for 38/29% of the second brightest spectrally confused sources. Our
results suggest that deep, spectral line surveys with SAFARI can break the
traditional photometric confusion limit, and will also not only resolve, but
provide redshifts for, a large number of previously inaccessible galaxies. To
conclude we discuss some of the limitations of the technique, as well as
further work.
