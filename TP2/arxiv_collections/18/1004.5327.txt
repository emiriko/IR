The Maskin's theorem is a fundamental work in the theory of mechanism design.
In this paper, we will propose a self-enforcing agreement by which agents can
fight a bad social choice rule which satisfies monotonicity and no-veto if an
additional condition is satisfied. The agreement is based on complex numbers
and is justified if the designer receives messages from the agents through some
communication channels (e.g., Internet). Under the assumption of complete
information among agents, the designer cannot prevent the agents from signing
such agreement. Thereby, the Maskin's sufficiency theorem is amended.
