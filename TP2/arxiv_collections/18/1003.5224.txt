We reinvestigate the behavior of the conductivity of several disordered
quantum lattice models at infinite temperature using exact diagonalization.
Contrary to the conclusion drawn in a recent investigation of similar
quantities in identical systems, we find evidence of a localized regime for
strong random fields. We estimate the location of the critical field for the
many-body localization transition for the random-field XXZ spin chain, and
compare our findings with recent investigations in related systems.
