I describe here some features of a non-geometrical approach to quantum
gravity which leads to another picture of ties of gravitation and cosmology.
The role of taking into account the effect of time dilation of the standard
cosmological model is considered. It is shown that the correction for no time
dilation leads to a good accordance of Supernovae 1a data and predictions of
the considered model. The distributions of stretch factor values of Supernovae
1a for the cases of time dilation and no time dilation are discussed.
