We propose a supersymmetric A4 x SU(5) model of quasi-degenerate neutrinos
which predicts the effective neutrino mass m_ee relevant for neutrinoless
double beta decay to be proportional to the neutrino mass scale, thereby
allowing its determination approximately independently of unknown Majorana
phases. Such a natural quasi-degeneracy is achieved by using the A4 (as an
example of a non-Abelian family symmetry with real triplet representations) to
enforce a type II seesaw contribution to the neutrino mass matrix proportional
to the identity. Tri-bimaximal neutrino mixing arises from a type I seesaw
contribution via A4 family symmetry and constrained sequential dominance. We
perform a numerical fit to the quark and lepton masses and quark mixing where a
simple ansatz describing quark CP violation with alpha approximately 90 degrees
also leads to the leptonic phase prediction delta_MNS approximately 90 degrees.
