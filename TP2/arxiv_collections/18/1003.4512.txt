We present new radial-velocity measurements of HAT-P-13, a star with two
previously known companions: a transiting giant planet "b" with an orbital
period of 3 days, and a more massive object "c" on a 1.2 yr, highly eccentric
orbit. For this system, dynamical considerations would lead to constraints on
planet b's interior structure, if it could be shown that the orbits are
coplanar and apsidally locked. By modeling the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect, we
show that planet b's orbital angular momentum vector and the stellar spin
vector are well-aligned on the sky (lambda = -0.9 +/- 8.5 deg), suggesting that
the planetary orbits are also well-aligned. The refined orbital solution favors
a slightly eccentric orbit for planet b (e = 0.0142_{-0.0044}^{+0.0052}),
although it is not clear whether it is apsidally locked with c's orbit
(\Delta\omega = 48_{-38}^{+25} deg). We find a long-term trend in the star's
radial velocity and interpret it as evidence for an additional body "d", which
may be another planet or a low-mass star. The next inferior conjunction of c,
when a transit may happen, is expected on JD 2,455,315.2 +/- 1.9 (centered on
UT 17h 2010 April 28).
