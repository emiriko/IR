We demonstrate thermally tunable superconductor hole array with active
control over their resonant transmission induced by surface plasmon polaritons
. The array was lithographically fabricated on high temperature YBCO
superconductor and characterized by terahertz-time domain spectroscopy. We
observe a clear transition from the virtual excitation of the surface plasmon
mode to the real surface plasmon mode. The highly tunable superconducting
plasmonic hole arrays may have promising applications in the design of
low-loss, large dynamic range amplitude modulation, and surface plasmon based
terahertz devices.
