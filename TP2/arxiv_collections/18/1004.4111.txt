Plasma magnetosphere surrounding rotating magnetized neutron star in the
braneworld has been studied. For the simplicity of calculations
Goldreich-Julian charge density is analyzed for the aligned neutron star with
zero inclination between magnetic field and rotation axis. From the system of
Maxwell equations in spacetime of slowly rotating star in braneworld,
second-order differential equation for electrostatic potential is derived.
Analytical solution of this equation indicates the general relativistic
modification of an accelerating electric field and charge density along the
open field lines by brane tension. The implication of this effect to the
magnetospheric energy loss problem is underlined. It was found that for
initially zero potential and field on the surface of a neutron star, the
amplitude of the plasma mode created by Goldreich-Julian charge density will
increase in the presence of the negative brane charge. Finally we derive the
equations of motion of test particles in magnetosphere of slowly rotating star
in the braneworld. Then we analyze particle motion in the polar cap and show
that brane tension can significantly change conditions for particle
acceleration in the polar cap region of the neutron star.
