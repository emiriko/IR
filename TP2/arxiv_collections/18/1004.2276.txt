In this, the first of two companion papers, we present a method for finding
the gravitational self-force in a modified radiation gauge for a particle
moving on a geodesic in a Schwarzschild or Kerr spacetime. An extension of an
earlier result by Wald is used to show the spin-weight $\pm 2$ perturbed Weyl
scalar ($\psi_0$ or $\psi_4$) determines the metric perturbation outside the
particle up to a gauge transformation and an infinitesimal change in mass and
angular momentum. A Hertz potential is used to construct the part of the
retarded metric perturbation that involves no change in mass or angular
momentum from $\psi_0$ in a radiation gauge. The metric perturbation is
completed by adding changes in the mass and angular momentum of the background
spacetime outside the radial coordinate $r_0$ of the particle in any convenient
gauge. The resulting metric perturbation is singular on the trajectory of the
particle and discontinuous across the sphere $r=r_0$. A mode-sum method can be
used to renormalize the self-force, but the justification given in the
published version of this paper \cite{sf2} referred to work by Sam Gralla
\cite{gralla10} to justify the use of the renormalized self-force, and the
radiation gauge we use does not satisfy the regularity conditions required by
Gralla. Instead we show that the renormalized self-force, computed either from
the retarded field for $r>r_0$ or for $r<r_0$ gives the correct equations of
motion in a gauge smoothly related to a Lorenz gauge; and Pound et al.
\cite{pmb13} argue that the average of the self-force obtained in the way
described in our paper for $r>r_0$ and for $r<r_0$ gives the correct equation
of motion for our gauge (what Pound et al. call the no-string gauge).
