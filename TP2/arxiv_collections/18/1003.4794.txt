This paper presents a detailed analysis of the temporal and spectral
variability of the low-energy peaked BL Lac object S5 0716+714 with a long (~74
ks)X-ray observation performed by XMM-Newton on 2007 September 24-25. The
source experiences recurrent flares on timescales of hours. The soft X-ray
variations, up to a factor of ~4, are much stronger than the hard X-ray
variations. With higher energy, the variability amplitude increases in the soft
X-rays but decreases in the hard X-rays. The hard X-ray variability amplitude,
however, is effectively large. For the first time, we detect a soft lag of
~1000s between the soft and hard X-ray variations. The soft lags might become
larger with larger energy differences. The overall X-ray spectra exhibit a
softer-when-brighter trend, whereas the soft X-ray spectra appear to show a
harder-when-brighter trend. The concave X-ray spectra of the source can be
interpreted as the sum of the high-energy tail of the synchrotron emission,
dominating in the soft X rays, and the low-energy end of the inverse Compton
(IC) emission, contributing more in the hard X-rays. The synchrotron spectra
are steep (\Gamma~2.6), while the IC spectra are flat (\Gamma~1.2). The
synchrotron spectra appear to harden with larger synchrotron fluxes, while the
IC spectra seem to soften with larger IC fluxes. When the source brightens, the
synchrotron fluxes increase but the IC fluxes decrease. The synchrotron tail
exhibits larger flux variations but smaller spectral changes than the IC
component does. The crossing energies between the two components and the trough
energies of spectral energy distributions (SEDs) increase when the source
brightens. The X-ray spectral variability demonstrates that the synchrotron and
IC SED peaks of S5 0716+714 shift to higher energies when it brightens.
