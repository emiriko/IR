We calculate the screening of the ion-ion potential due to electrons in the
presence of a large background magnetic field, at densities of relevance to
neutron star crusts. Using the standard approach to incorporate electron
screening through the one-loop polarization function, we show that the magnetic
field produces important corrections both at short and long distances. In
extreme fields, realized in highly magnetized neutron stars called magnetars,
electrons occupy only the lowest Landau levels in the relatively low density
region of the crust. Here our results show that the screening length for
Coulomb interactions between ions can be smaller than the inter-ion spacing.
More interestingly, we find that the screening is anisotropic and the screened
potential between two static charges exhibits long range Friedel oscillations
parallel to the magnetic field. This long-range oscillatory behavior is likely
to affect the lattice structure of ions, and can possibly create rod-like
structures in the magnetar crusts. We also calculate the imaginary part of the
electron polarization function which determines the spectrum of electron-hole
excitations and plays a role in damping lattice phonon excitations. We
demonstrate that even for modest magnetic fields this damping is highly
anisotropic and will likely lead to anisotropic phonon heat transport in the
outer neutron star crust.
