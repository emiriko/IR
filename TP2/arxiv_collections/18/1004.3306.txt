Through the utilization of element-resolved polarized x-ray probes, the
electronic and magnetic state of an artificial La2FeCrO6 double perovskite were
explored. Applying unit-cell level control of thin film growth on SrTiO3 (111),
the rock salt double perovskite structure can be created for this system, which
does not have an ordered perovskite phase in the bulk. We find that the Fe and
Cr are in the proper 3+ valence state, but, contrary to previous studies, the
element-resolved magnetic studies find the moments in field are small and show
no evidence of a sizable magnetic moment in the remanent state.
