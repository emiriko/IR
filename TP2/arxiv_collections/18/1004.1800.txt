Using the deep fields of COSMOS, FDF, HUDF, and HDF-N as an example, we
discuss the prospects for and limitations on the method for searching for super
large structures in the spatial distribution of galaxies proposed in the
preceding article of this series. An analysis of the distribution N(z) of
photometric redshifts in a grid of the deep fields of HUDF-FDF-COSMOS-HDFN
reveals the possible existence of super large structures with a contrast
dN/N~50% and tangential and radial dimensions of about 1000 Mpc. The reality of
the detected candidate super large structures in the universe can be verified
by further observations with a finer grid of deep fields. The influence of
systematic errors can be reduced by observing the same deep fields with several
3-10 meter telescopes and utilizing different methods for determining the
photometric redshifts.
