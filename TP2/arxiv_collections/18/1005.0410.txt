The DHCAL collaboration is assembling a large scale prototype Digital Hadron
Calorimeter (DHCAL). The calorimeter utilizes Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs)
as active medium and features of the order of 400,000 1 \times 1 cm2 pads with
binary (or digital) electronic readout. The purpose of the prototype is to
provide detailed measurements of hadronic showers and to prove the concept of a
DHCAL with RPCs as active elements.
