V. Golyshev conjectured that for any smooth polytope P of dimension at most
five, the roots $z\in\C$ of the Ehrhart polynomial for P have real part equal
to -1/2. An elementary proof is given, and in each dimension the roots are
described explicitly. We also present examples which demonstrate that this
result cannot be extended to dimension six.
