By self-consistent renormalization (SCR) it is meant that all formal
relations between UV-divergent Feynman amplitudes are automatically retained as
well as between their regular values obtained in the framework of the SCR. The
SCR is efficiently applicable on equal grounds both to renormalizable and
nonrenormalizable theories. SCR furnishes new means for the constructive
treatment of new subjects: i) UV-divergence problems associated with
symmetries, Ward identities, and quantum anomalies; ii) new relations between
finite bare and finite physical parameters of quantum field theories. The aim
of this paper is to describe main ideas and properties of the SCR and clearly
to describe three mutually complementary algorithms of the SCR that are
presented in the form maximally suited for practical applications.
