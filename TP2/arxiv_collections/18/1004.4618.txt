The dielectric relaxation of water in glassy aqueous binary mixtures exhibits
an Arrhenius behaviour with a nearly universal activation energy. We here
demonstrate that its characteristic relaxation time follows a remarkably
general functional dependence on the weight fraction of water for a wide range
of molecular systems.
