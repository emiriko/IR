The angle dependent magnetoresistance study on [001] and [110] La$_{2 /
3}$Sr$_{1 / 3}$MnO$_{3}$ thin films show that the anisotropy energy of [110]
films is higher when compared with a [001] oriented La$_{2 / 3}$Sr$_{1 /
3}$MnO$_{3}$ film of similar thickness. The data has been analyzed in the light
of multidomain model and it is seen that this model correctly explains the
observed behavior.
