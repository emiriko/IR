We construct a systematic survey of extragalactic \gamma-ray sky at the
energies above 100 GeV using the data of Fermi telescope. Such survey has not
been previously done by the ground-based Cherenkov gamma-ray telescopes which
have, contrary to Fermi, narrow field of view. We study a map of arrival
directions of the highest energy photons detected by Fermi at Galactic
latitudes |b| > 10 degrees and search for significant point source like
excesses above the diffuse Galactic and extragalactic \gamma-ray backgrounds.
We identify eight significant point source like excesses in this map. Seven of
the eight sources are known TeV blazars. The previously unknown source is
identified with a head-tail radio galaxy IC 310, situated in Perseus cluster of
galaxies. The source is detected with significance 6 sigma above 30 GeV. We
identify two possible scenaria for gamma-ray emission from this source. One
possibility is that emission originates from the base of relativistic outflow
from the active nucleus, as in the BL Lacs and FR I type radio galaxies.
Otherwise gamma-ray photons could be produced at the bow shock formed in result
of fast motion of the galaxy through the intracluster medium. The two models
could be distinguished via the study of variability of the \gamma-ray signal.
