Dynamical algebra notion of quantum degrees of freedom is utilized to study
the relation between quantum dynamical integrability and generalized
entanglement. It is argued that a quantum dynamical system generates
generalized entanglement by internal dynamics if and only if it is quantum
non-integrable. Several examples are used to illustrate the relation.
