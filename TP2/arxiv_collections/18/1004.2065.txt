We study a nonequilibrium Ising model that stochastically evolves under the
simultaneous operation of several spin-flip mechanisms. In other words, the
local magnetic fields change sign randomly with time due to competing kinetics.
This dynamics models a fast and random diffusion of disorder that takes place
in dilute metallic alloys when magnetic ions diffuse. We performe Monte Carlo
simulations on cubic lattices up to L=60. The system exhibits ferromagnetic and
paramagnetic steady states. Our results predict first-order transitions at low
temperatures and large disorder strengths, which correspond to the existence of
a nonequilibrium tricritical point at finite temperature. By means of standard
finite-size scaling equations, we estimate the critical exponents in the
low-field region, for which our simulations uphold continuous phase
transitions.
