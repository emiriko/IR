A simple effective model of charge ordered insulators is studied. The tight
binding Hamiltonian consists of the effective on-site interaction U and the
intersite density-density interactions Wij (both: nearest-neighbour and
next-nearest-neighbour). In the analysis of the phase diagrams we have adopted
the variational approach, which treats the on-site interaction term exactly and
the intersite interactions within the mean-field approximation. The phase
separated states have not been taken into account in previous analyses. Our
investigations of two cases of the on-site interaction: attraction
(U/(-W_Q)=-10) and repulsion (U/(-W_Q)=1.1) show that, depending on the values
of the next-nearest-neighbour attraction, the system can exhibit not only
homogeneous phases: charge ordered (CO) and nonordered (NO), but also various
phase separated states (CO--NO, CO--CO).
