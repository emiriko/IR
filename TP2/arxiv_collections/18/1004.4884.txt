The STAR experiment at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider at Brookhaven
National Laboratory is carrying out a spin physics program in high-energy
polarized $\vec{p}+\vec{p}$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=200-500\,$GeV to gain a
deeper insight into the spin structure and dynamics of the proton.
  One of the main objectives of the spin physics program at RHIC is the
extraction of the polarized gluon distribution function based on measurements
of gluon initiated processes, such as hadron and jet production. The STAR
detector is well suited for the reconstruction of various final states
involving jets, $\pi^{0}$, $\pi^{\pm}$, e$^{\pm}$ and $\gamma$, which allows to
measure several different processes. Recent results will be shown on the
measurement of jet production and hadron production at $\sqrt{s}=200\,$GeV. The
RHIC spin physics program has recently completed the first data taking period
in 2009 of polarized $\vec{p}+\vec{p}$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=500\,$GeV. This
opens a new era in the study of the spin-flavor structure of the proton based
on the production of $W^{-(+)}$ bosons. Recent STAR results on the first
measurement of $W$ boson production in polarized $\vec{p}+\vec{p}$ collisions
will be shown.
