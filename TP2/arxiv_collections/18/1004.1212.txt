Statistical consistency in phylogenetics has traditionally referred to the
accuracy of estimating phylogenetic parameters for a fixed number of species as
we increase the number of characters. However, as sequences are often of fixed
length (e.g. for a gene) although we are often able to sample more taxa, it is
useful to consider a dual type of statistical consistency where we increase the
number of species, rather than characters. This raises some basic questions:
what can we learn about the evolutionary process as we increase the number of
species? In particular, does having more species allow us to infer the
ancestral state of characters accurately? This question is particularly
relevant when sequence site evolution varies in a complex way from character to
character, as well as for reconstructing ancestral sequences. In this paper, we
assemble a collection of results to analyse various approaches for inferring
ancestral information with increasing accuracy as the number of taxa increases.
