We present X-ray emission characteristics of the massive O-type stars DH Cep
and HD 97434 using archival XMM-Newton observations. There is no convincing
evidence for short term variability in the X-ray intensity during the
observations. However, the analysis of their spectra reveals X-ray structure
being consistent with two-temperature plasma model. The hydrogen column
densities derived from X-ray spectra of DH Cep and HD 97434 are in agreement
with the reddening measurements for their corresponding host clusters NGC 7380
and Trumpler 18, indicating that the absorption by stellar wind is negligible.
The X-ray emission from these hot stars is interpreted in terms of the standard
instability-driven wind shock model.
