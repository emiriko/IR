Single-crystal neutron diffraction has been used to determine the
incommensurate magnetic structure of NaCu2O2, a compound built up of chains of
edge-sharing CuO4 plaquettes. Magnetic structures compatible with the lattice
symmetry were identified by a group-theoretical analysis, and their magnetic
structure factors were compared to the experimentally observed Bragg
intensities. In conjunction with other experimental data, this analysis yields
an elliptical helix structure in which both the helicity and the polarization
plane alternate among copper-oxide chains. This magnetic ground state is
discussed in the context of the recently reported multiferroic properties of
other copper-oxide chain compounds.
