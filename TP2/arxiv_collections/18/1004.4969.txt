With our knowledge of the universe, we have sent men to the moon. We know
microscopic details of objects around us and within us. And yet we know
relatively little about how our society works and how it reacts to changes
brought upon it. Humankind is now facing serious crises for which we must
develop new ways to tackle the global challenges of humanity in the 21st
century. With connectivity between people rapidly increasing, we are now able
to exploit information and communication technologies to achieve major
breakthroughs that go beyond the step-wise improvements in other areas.
  The need of a socio-economic knowledge collider was first pointed out in the
OECD Global Science Forum on Applications of Complexity Science for Public
Policy in Erice from October 5 to 7, 2008. Since then, many scientists have
called for a large-scale ICT-based research initiative on
techno-socialeconomic- environmental issues, sometimes phrased as a Manhattan-,
Apollo-, or CERN-like project to study the way our living planet works in a
social dimension. Due to the connotations, we use the term knowledge
accelerator, here.
