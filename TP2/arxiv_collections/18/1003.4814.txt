We explore Majorana zero modes bound to a vortex line in a three dimensional
topological superconductor model, focusing our attention on the validity of the
index theorem previously derived. We first solve the Bogoliubov-de Gennes
equation at the zero energy to obtain the analytical index. We next calculate
the topological index given by the order parameters. It turns out that they
indeed coincide and that index theorem, which has been derived on the implicit
assumption that a defect is point-like, is also valid for a line defect.
