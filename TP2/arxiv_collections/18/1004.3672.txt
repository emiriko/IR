We discuss how to construct stable multidimensional extensions of
one-dimensional dark solitons, the so-called soliton stripes, in two-species
Bose-Einstein condensates in the immiscible regime. We show how using a second
component to fill the core a dark soliton stripe leads to reduced instabilities
while propagating in homogeneous media. We also discuss how in the presence of
a trap arbitrarily long-lived dark soliton stripes can be constructed by
increasing the filling of the dark stripe core. Numerical evidences of the
robustness of the dark soliton stripes in collision scenarios are also
provided.
