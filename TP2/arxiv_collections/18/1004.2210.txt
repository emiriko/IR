Most of atoms and molecule found in nature are capable of evolving towards
and staying at their ground states, the lowest energy states. This paper offers
a global optimization approach to understand the ground state as the
equilibrium point of an $n$-player game under cooperation. With the same
approach, Nash equilibrium can be viewed as the equilibrium point under
competition. The former can offer higher payoffs and stability of game playing
than the later. It is truly an inspiration from nature for us to build
societies for quality and stability under cooperation rather than competition.
