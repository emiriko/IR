We investigate which polynomials can possibly occur as factors in the
denominators of rational solutions of a given partial linear difference
equation (PLDE). Two kinds of polynomials are to be distinguished, we call them
/periodic/ and /aperiodic/. The main result is a generalization of a well-known
denominator bounding technique for univariate equations to PLDEs. This
generalization is able to find all the aperiodic factors of the denominators
for a given PLDE.
