In this paper a general definition of quantum conditional entropy for
infinite-dimensional systems is given based on recent work of Holevo and
Shirokov arXiv:1004.2495 devoted to quantum mutual and coherent informations in
the infinite-dimensional case. The properties of the conditional entropy such
as monotonicity, concavity and subadditivity are also generalized to the
infinite-dimensional case.
