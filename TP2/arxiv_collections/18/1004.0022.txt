The existence of quantum correlation (as revealed by quantum discord), other
than entanglement and its role in quantum-information processing (QIP), is a
current subject for discussion. In particular, it has been suggested that this
nonclassical correlation may provide computational speedup for some quantum
algorithms. In this regard, bulk nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) has been
successfully used as a test bench for many QIP implementations, although it has
also been continuously criticized for not presenting entanglement in most of
the systems used so far. In this paper, we report a theoretical and
experimental study on the dynamics of quantum and classical correlations in an
NMR quadrupolar system. We present a method for computing the correlations from
experimental NMR deviation-density matrices and show that, given the action of
the nuclear-spin environment, the relaxation produces a monotonic time decay in
the correlations. Although the experimental realizations were performed in a
specific quadrupolar system, the main results presented here can be applied to
whichever system uses a deviation-density matrix formalism.
