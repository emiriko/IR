Noise is the price to pay when trying to clone or amplify arbitrary quantum
states. The quantum noise associated to linear phase-insensitive amplifiers can
only be avoided by relaxing the requirement of a deterministic operation. Here
we present the experimental realization of a probabilistic noiseless linear
amplifier that is able to amplify coherent states at the highest level of
effective gain and final state fidelity ever reached. Based on a sequence of
photon addition and subtraction, and characterized by a significant
amplification and low distortions, this high-fidelity amplification scheme may
become an essential tool for quantum communications and metrology, by enhancing
the discrimination between partially overlapping quantum states or by
recovering the information transmitted over lossy channels.
