To every product of $2\times2$ matrices, there corresponds a one-dimensional
Schr\"{o}dinger equation whose potential consists of generalised point
scatterers. Products of {\em random} matrices are obtained by making these
interactions and their positions random. We exhibit a simple one-dimensional
quantum model corresponding to the most general product of matrices in
$\text{SL}(2, {\mathbb R})$. We use this correspondence to find new examples of
products of random matrices for which the invariant measure can be expressed in
simple analytical terms.
