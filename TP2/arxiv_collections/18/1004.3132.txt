We investigate the dynamics of electron-electron recollisions in the double
ionization of atoms in strong laser fields. The statistics of recollisions can
be reformulated in terms of an area-preserving map from the observation that
the outer electron is driven by the laser field to kick the remaining core
electrons periodically. The phase portraits of this map reveals the dynamics of
these recollisions in terms of their probability and efficiency.
