We study the existence and stability of synchronous solutions in a continuum
field of non-locally coupled identical phase oscillators with
distance-dependent propagation delays. We present a comprehensive stability
diagram in the parameter space of the system. From the numerical results a
heuristic synchronization condition is suggested, and an analytic relation for
the marginal stability curve is obtained. We also provide an expression in the
form of a scaling relation that closely follows the marginal stability curve
over the complete range of the non-locality parameter.
