We present angular-resolved correlation measurements between photons after
propagation through a three-dimensional disordered medium. The multiple
scattering process induces photon correlations that are directly measured for
light sources with different photon statistics. We find that multiple scattered
photons between different angular directions with angles much larger than the
average speckle width are strongly correlated. The time dependence of the
angular photon correlation function is investigated and the coherence time of
the light source is determined. Our results are found to be in excellent
agreement with the continuous mode quantum theory of multiple scattering of
light. The presented experimental technique is essential in order to study
quantum phenomena in multiple scattering random media such as quantum
interference and quantum entanglement of photons.
