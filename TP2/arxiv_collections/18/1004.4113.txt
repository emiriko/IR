We have analyzed the electronic spectrum and wave function characteristics of
a strongly correlated two-electron quantum ring with model parameters close to
those observed in experiments. The analysis is based on an exact
diagonalization of the Hamiltonian in a large B-spline basis. We propose a new
qubit pair for storing quantum information, where one component is stored in
the total electron spin and one multivalued "quMbit" is represented by the
total angular momentum. In this scheme the controlled NOT (CNOT) quantum gate
is demonstrated with near 100% fidelity for a realistic far infrared
electromagnetic pulse.
