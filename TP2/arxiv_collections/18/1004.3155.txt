We consider groups of interacting nodes engaged in an activity as many-body,
complex systems and analyse their cooperative behaviour from a mean-field point
of view. We show that inter-nodal interactions rather than accumulated
individual node strengths dominate the quality of group activity, and give rise
to phenomena akin to phase transitions, where the extensive relationship
between group quality and quantity reduces. The theory is tested using
empirical data on quantity and quality of scientific research groups, for which
critical masses are determined.
