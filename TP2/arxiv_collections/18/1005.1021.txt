If electroweak symmetry breaking arises via strong dynamics, electroweak
precision tests and flavour physics experiments suggest that the minimal model
should closely resemble the Standard Model at the LHC. I describe two
directions going beyond the minimal model that result in radically different
physics at the LHC. One direction extends the Higgs sector and the other
involves composite leptoquark states.
