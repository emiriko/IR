New to neuroscience with implications for AI, the exclusive OR, or any other
Boolean gate may be biologically accomplished within a single region where
active dendrites merge. This is demonstrated below using dynamic circuit
analysis. Medical knowledge aside, this observation points to the possibility
of specially coated conductors to accomplish artificial dendrites.
