Asymmetric Dark Matter (ADM) models relate the dark matter density to the
baryon asymmetry, so that a natural mass scale for ADM is around a few GeV. In
existing models of ADM, this mass scale is unexplained; here we generate this
GeV scale for dark matter (DM) from the weak scale via gauge kinetic mixing
with a new Abelian dark force. In addition, this dark sector provides an
efficient mechanism for suppressing the symmetric abundance of DM through
annihilations to the dark photon. We augment this sector with a higher
dimensional operator responsible for communicating the baryon asymmetry to the
dark sector. Our framework also provides DM candidate for gauge mediation
models. It results in a direct detection cross section of interest for current
experiments: sigma less than or similar to 10^{-42} cm^2 for DM masses in the
range 1 - 15 GeV.
