Numerical simulations are performed of a test scalar field in a spacetime
undergoing gravitational collapse. The behavior of the scalar field near the
singularity is examined and implications for generic singularities are
discussed. In particular, our example is the first confirmation of the BKL
conjecture for an asymptotically flat spacetime.
