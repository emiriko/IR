The conductivity of doped graphene is considered taking into account
scattering by short-range nonsymmetric defects, when the longitudinal and
transverse components of conductivity tensor appear to be different. The
calculations of the anisotropic conductivity tensor are based on the
quasiclassical kinetic equation for the case of monopolar transport at low
temperatures. The effective longitudinal conductivity and the transverse
voltage, which are controlled by orientation of sample and by gate voltage
(i.e. doping level), are presented.
