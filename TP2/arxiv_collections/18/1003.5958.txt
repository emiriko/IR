In the present letter a method to find a proper expression for the force
distribution inside a granular sample in static equilibrium is proposed. The
method is based in statistical mechanics and the force distribution is obtained
by studying how the potential elastic energy is divided among the different
contacts between grains. It is found with DEM simulations with spheres that the
elastic potential energy distribution follows a Bose Einstein law from which
the force distribution is deduced. The present letter open a way in which
granular materials can be studied with the tools provided by statistical
mechanics.
