Networks have attracted a burst of attention in the last decade, with
applications to natural, social, and technological systems. While networks
provide a powerful abstraction for investigating relationships and
interactions, the preparation and analysis of complex real-world networks
nonetheless presents significant challenges. In particular social networks are
characterized by a large number of different properties and generation
mechanisms which require a rich set of indicators. The objective of the current
study is to analyze large social networks with respect to their community
structure and mechanisms of network formation. As a case study, we consider
networks derived from the European Union's Framework Programs for Research and
Technological Development using methods from statistical physics and economic
geography.
