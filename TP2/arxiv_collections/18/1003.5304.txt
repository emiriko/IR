This article presets a review of the achievements rapidly developing field of
cryptography - public-key cryptography based on the lattice theory. Paper
contains the necessary basic concepts and the major problems of the lattice
theory, as well as together with the description on the benefits of this
cryptography class - the properties of the reliability to quantum computers and
full homomorphism, the shortcomings of specific implementations.
