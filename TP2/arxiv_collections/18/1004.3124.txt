The WKB equations for dynamics of the surface plasmon polariton (SPP)
wavepacket are studied. The dispersion law for the SPP in the metal-dielectric
heterostructure with varying thickness of a perforated dielectric layer is
rigorously calculated and investigated using the scattering matrix method. Two
channels of the SPP wavepacket optical losses related to the absorption in a
metal and to the SPP leakage are analyzed. It is shown that change of the
dielectric layer thickness acts on the SPP as an external force leading to
evolution of its quasimomentum and to the wavepacket reversal or even to the
optical Bloch oscillations (BO). Properties of these phenomena are investigated
and discussed. Typical values of the BO amplitude are about tens of microns and
the period is around tens or hundreds of femtoseconds.
