LEXSYS, (Legume Expert System) was a project conceived at IITA (International
Institute of Tropical Agriculture) Ibadan Nigeria. It was initiated by the
COMBS (Collaborative Group on Maize-Based Systems Research in the 1990. It was
meant for a general framework for characterizing on-farm testing for technology
design for sustainable cereal-based cropping system. LEXSYS is not a true
expert system as the name would imply, but simply a user-friendly information
system. This work is an attempt to give a formal representation of the existing
system and then present areas where intelligent agent can be applied.
