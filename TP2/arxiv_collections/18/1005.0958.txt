Quasi-equilibrium sequences of binary neutron stars are constructed for a
variety of equations of state in general relativity. Einstein's constraint
equations in the Isenberg-Wilson-Mathews approximation are solved together with
the relativistic equations of hydrostationary equilibrium under the assumption
of irrotational flow. We focus on unequal-mass sequences as well as equal-mass
sequences, and compare those results. We investigate the behavior of the
binding energy and total angular momentum along a quasi-equilibrium sequence,
the endpoint of sequences, and the orbital angular velocity as a function of
time, changing the mass ratio, the total mass of the binary system, and the
equation of state of a neutron star. It is found that the orbital angular
velocity at the mass-shedding limit can be determined by an empirical formula
derived from an analytic estimation. We also provide tables for 160 sequences
which will be useful as a guideline of numerical simulations for the inspiral
and merger performed in the near future.
