Local electronic structures of nanometer-sized patches of epitaxial graphene
and its interface layer with SiC(0001) have been studied by atomically resolved
scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy. Localized states belonging to
the interface layer of a graphene/SiC system show to have an essential
influence on the electronic structure of graphene. Giant enhancement of
inelastic tunneling, reaching 50% of the total tunneling current, has been
observed at the localized states on a nanometer-sized graphene monolayer
surrounded by defects.
