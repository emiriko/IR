Long-distance contributions to the $D^0$-$\bar D^0$ mixing parameters $x$ and
$y$ are evaluated using latest data on hadronic $D^0$ decays. In particular, we
take on two-body $D \to PP$ and $VP$ decays to evaluate the contributions of
two-body intermediate states because they account for $\sim 50%$ of hadronic
$D^0$ decays. Use of the diagrammatic approach has been made to estimate
yet-observed decay modes. We find that $y$ is of order a few $\times 10^{-3}$
and $x$ of order $10^{-3}$ from hadronic $PP$ and $VP$ modes. These are in good
agreement with the latest direct measurement of $D^0$-$\bar D^0$ mixing
parameters using the $D^0 \to K_S \pi^+\pi^-$ and $K_S K^+ K^-$ decays by
BaBar. We estimate the contribution to $y$ from the $VV$ modes using the
factorization model and comment on the single-particle resonance effects and
contributions from other two-body modes involving even-parity states.
