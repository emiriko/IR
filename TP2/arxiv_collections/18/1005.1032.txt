The critical behavior of the three-dimensional n-vector model in the presence
of an external field is investigated. Mathematical description is performed
with the collective variables (CV) method in the framework of the $\rho^4$
model approximation at the microscopic level without any adjustable parameters.
The recurrence relations of the renormalization group (RG) as functions of the
external field and temperature were found. The analytical expression for the
free energy of the system for temperatures $T>T_c$ and different n was
obtained. The equation of state of the n-vector model for general case of small
and large external fields was written. The explicit form of the correspondent
scaling function for different values of the order parameter was derived. The
obtained results are in qualitative agreement with the data of Monte Carlo
simulations.
