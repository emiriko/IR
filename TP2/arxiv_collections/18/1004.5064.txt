Simple analytic solution to cubic Neveu-Schwarz String Field Theory including
the $GSO(-)$ sector is presented. This solution is an analog of the
Erler-Schnabl solution for bosonic case and one of the authors solution for the
pure $GSO(+)$ case. Gauge transformations of the new solution to others known
solutions for the $NS$ string tachyon condensation are constructed explicitly.
This gauge equivalence manifestly supports the early observed fact that these
solutions have the same value of the action density.
