We consider the optimal design of sequential transmission over broadcast
channel with nested feedback. Nested feedback means that the channel output of
the outer channel is also available at the decoder of the inner channel. We
model the communication system as a decentralized team with three decision
makers---the encoder and the two decoders. Structure of encoding and decoding
strategies that minimize a total distortion measure over a finite horizon are
determined. The results are applicable for real-time communication as well as
for the information theoretic setup.
