We consider nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equations, $i\partial_t \psi = H_0 \psi
+ \lambda |\psi|^2\psi$ in $\mathbb{R}^3 \times [0,\infty)$, where $H_0 =
-\Delta + V$, $\lambda=\pm 1$, the potential $V$ is radial and spatially
decaying, and the linear Hamiltonian $H_0$ has only two eigenvalues $e_0 < e_1
<0$, where $e_0$ is simple, and $e_1$ has multiplicity three. We show that
there exist two branches of small "nonlinear excited state" standing-wave
solutions, and in both the resonant ($e_0 < 2e_1$) and non-resonant ($e_0 >
2e_1$) cases, we construct certain finite-codimension regions of the phase
space consisting of solutions converging to these excited states at time
infinity ("stable directions").
