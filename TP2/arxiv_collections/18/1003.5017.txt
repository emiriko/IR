We discuss the development of a sensitive electrometer that utilizes a
two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in the quantum Hall regime. As a
demonstration, we measure the evolution of the Landau levels in a second,
nearby 2DEG as the applied perpendicular magnetic field is changed, and extract
an effective mass for electrons in GaAs that agrees within experimental error
with previous measurements.
