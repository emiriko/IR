This is a study of induced nonlinear realizations of a Lie group G in which
the presence of one field induces nonlinear transformations on another field.
The covariant derivative structure is similar in form to that for local gauge
theory. For an arbitrary Lie group, basic equations and non standard invariant
Lagrangian forms are described. Covariant constraint equations that place
restrictions on field components are presented. With G = SU(2), a detail
application to the electroweak model is discussed. We first show that the
standard Lagrangian for the gauge $SU(2) \times U(1)$ electroweak model is
invariant. We then show that an alternate invariant Lagrangian is also
possible. In it, the intermediate boson masses arise from the adjoint field
rather than from the Higgs doublet. An alternate invariant lepton Lagrangian is
presented. Covariant constraints on the right-handed lepton field lead to two
right-handed neutrino fields. One vanishes at the point where we obtain a
massless (photon) field and the second one has no interaction. This provides a
clear explanation why weak interactions do not involve right-handed neutrinos,
while permitting neutrinos with mass. This model also indicates a different
region of matter involving coupled leptons that are "blind" to the massless
electromagnetic field but "see" four massive potentials that are themselves
blind to the electromagnetic field. We argue that these more difficult to
detect "dark" fields provide a possible contribution to the missing mass.
