We study reflection of optically spin-oriented hot electrons as a means to
probe the semiconductor crystal symmetry and its intimate relation with the
spin-orbit coupling. The symmetry breaking by reflection manifests itself by
tipping the net-spin vector of the photoexcited electrons out of the light
propagation direction. The tipping angle and the pointing direction of the
net-spin vector are set by the crystal-induced spin precession, momentum
alignment and spin-momentum correlation of the initial photoexcited electron
population. We examine non-magnetic semiconductor heterostructures and
semiconductor/ferromagnet systems and show the unique signatures of these
effects.
