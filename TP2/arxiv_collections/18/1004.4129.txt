We propose a method to be able to decide whether the planets of CoRoT-7 are
moving on mutually inclined orbits in the order of i > 10 degrees. The
extrasolar system CoRoT-7 is very special with respect to the closeness of the
planets to the host star, which results in a fast dynamical development. It
would therefore be possible to determine the inclination of the innermost
planet CoRoT-7b with respect to the observer after an observation of at least
three years from space with the satellite CoRoT with sufficient precision.
Different inclinations would cause different duration of the transit times of a
planet in front of the star and would therefore give us a better knowledge of
the architecture of this system.With the aid of numerical integrations and
analytical estimations we checked how inclined orbits of additional planets
would change the transit duration of CoRoT-7b. After 3 years of observations
when an additional planet would be on a inclined orbit with respect to CoRoT-7b
(I_mutual > 10 degrees) an increase of the order of minutes could be observed
for the transit duration.
