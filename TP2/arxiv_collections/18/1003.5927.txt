An overview of some recent progress on magnetohydrodynamic stability and
current sheet formation in a line-tied system is given. Key results on the
linear stability of the ideal internal kink mode and resistive tearing mode are
summarized. For nonlinear problems, a counterexample to the recent
demonstration of current sheet formation by Low \emph{et al}. [B. C. Low and
\AA. M. Janse, Astrophys. J. \textbf{696}, 821 (2009)] is presented, and the
governing equations for quasi-static evolution of a boundary driven, line-tied
magnetic field are derived. Some open questions and possible strategies to
resolve them are discussed.
