We discuss the computation of the mass of the K and D mesons within the
framework of N_f = 2+1+1 twisted mass lattice QCD from a technical point of
view. These quantities are essential, already at the level of generating gauge
configurations, being obvious candidates to tune the strange and charm quark
masses to their physical values. In particular, we address the problems related
to the twisted mass flavor and parity symmetry breaking, which arise when
considering a non-degenerate (c,s) doublet. We propose and verify the
consistency of three methods to extract the K and D meson masses in this
framework.
