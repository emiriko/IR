The phase transitions at finite temperatures in the systems described by the
Bose-Fermi-Hubbard model are investigated in this work in the framework of the
selfconsistent random phase approximation. The case of the hard-core bosons is
considered and pseudospin formalism is used.
  The density-density correlator is calculated in the random phase
approximation and the possibilities of transitions from superfluid to
supersolid phases are investigated. It is shown that the transitions between
uniform and charge ordered phases can be of the second or the first order,
depending on the system parameters.
