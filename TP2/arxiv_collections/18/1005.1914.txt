Let G be an infinite discrete group of type FP-infinity and let p>1 be a real
number. We prove that the l^p-homology and cohomology groups of G are either 0
or infinite dimensional. We also show that the cardinality of the p-harmonic
boundary of a finitely generated group is either 0, 1, or infinity.
