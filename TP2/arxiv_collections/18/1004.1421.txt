The discovery of multi-planet extrasolar systems has kindled interest in
using their orbital evolution as a probe of planet formation. Accurate
descriptions of planetary orbits identify systems which could hide additional
planets or be in a special dynamical state, and inform targeted follow-up
observations. We combine published radial velocity data with Markov Chain Monte
Carlo analyses in order to obtain an ensemble of masses, semimajor axes,
eccentricities and orbital angles for each of 5 dynamically active multi-planet
systems: HD 11964, HD 38529, HD 108874, HD 168443, and HD 190360. We
dynamically evolve these systems using 52,000 long-term N-body integrations
that sample the full range of possible line-of-sight and relative inclinations,
and we report on the system stability, secular evolution and the extent of the
resonant interactions. We find that planetary orbits in hierarchical systems
exhibit complex dynamics and can become highly eccentric and maybe
significantly inclined. Additionally we incorporate the effects of general
relativity in the long-term simulations and demonstrate that can qualitatively
affect the dynamics of some systems with high relative inclinations. The
simulations quantify the likelihood of different dynamical regimes for each
system and highlight the dangers of restricting simulation phase space to a
single set of initial conditions or coplanar orbits.
