Cherenkov radiation in uniformly moving homogenous isotropic medium without
dispersion is studied. Formula for the spectrum of Cherenkov radiation of
fermion was derived for the case when the speed of the medium is less than the
speed of light in this medium at rest. The properties of Cherenkov spectrum are
investigated.
