We report a systematic study of structural and transport properties in single
crystals of Ba(Fe_(1-x)Ru_x)_2As_2 for x ranging from 0 to 0.5. The isovalent
substitution of Fe by Ru leads to an increase of the a parameter and a decrease
of the c parameter, resulting in a strong increase of the AsFeAs angle and a
decrease of the As height above the Fe planes. Upon Ru substitution, the
magnetic order is progressively suppressed and superconductivity emerges for x
> 0.15, with an optimal Tc ~ 20K at x = 0.35 and coexistence of magnetism and
superconductivity between these two Ru contents. Moreover, the Hall coefficient
RH which is always negative and decreases with temperature in BaFe2As2, is
found to increase here with decreasing T and even change sign for x > 0.15. For
x_Ru = 0.35, photo-emission studies have shown that the number of holes and
electrons are similar with n_e = n_h ~ 0.11, that is twice larger than found in
BaFe2As2 [1]. Using this estimate, we find that the transport properties of
Ba(Fe_0.65Ru_0.35)_2As_2 can be accounted for by the conventional multiband
description for a compensated semi-metal. In particular, our results show that
the mobility of holes is strongly enhanced upon Ru addition and overcomes that
of electrons at low temperature when x_Ru > 0.15.
