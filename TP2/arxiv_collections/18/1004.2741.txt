Inflation can occur near a point of inflection in the potential of flat
directions of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. In this paper we
elaborate on the complementarity between the bounds from Cosmic Microwave
Background measurements, dark matter and particle physics phenomenology in
determining the underlying parameters of MSSM inflation by specializing to the
Minimal Supergravity scenario. We show that the future measurements from the
Large Hadron Collider in tandem with all these constraints will significantly
restrict the allowed parameter space. We also suggest a new perspective on the
fine tuning issue of MSSM inflation. With quantum corrections taken into
account, the necessary condition between the soft supersymmetry breaking
parameters in the inflaton potential can be satisfied at scales of interest
without a fine tuning of their boundary values at a high scale. The requirement
that this happens at the inflection point determines a dimensionless coupling,
which is associated with a non-renormalizable interaction term in the
Lagrangian and has no bearing for phenomenology, to very high accuracy.
