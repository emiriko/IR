We formulate a theory of nonrelativistic scattering in one dimension based on
the J-matrix method. The scattering potential is assumed to have a finite range
such that it is well represented by its matrix elements in a finite subset of a
basis that supports a tridiagonal matrix representation for the reference wave
operator. Contrary to our expectation, the 1D formulation reveals a rich and
highly non-trivial structure compared to the 3D formulation. Examples are given
to demonstrate the utility and accuracy of the method. It is hoped that this
formulation constitutes a viable alternative to the classical treatment of 1D
scattering problem and that it will help unveil new and interesting
applications.
