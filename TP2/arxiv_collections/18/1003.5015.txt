These lecture notes are intended to introduce the theory of rotating stars in
general relativity. The focus is put on the theoretical foundations, with a
detailed discussion of the spacetime symmetries, the choice of coordinates and
the derivation of the equations of structure from the Einstein equation. The
global properties of rotating stars (mass, angular momentum, redshifts, orbits,
etc.) are also introduced.
