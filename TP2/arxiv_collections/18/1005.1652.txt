We present multi-wavelengths observations and a radiative transfer model of a
newly discovered massive circumstellar disk of gas and dust which is one of the
largest disks known today. Seen almost edge-on, the disk is resolved in
high-resolution near-infrared (NIR) images and appears as a dark lane of high
opacity intersecting a bipolar reflection nebula. Based on molecular line
observations we estimate the distance to the object to be 3.5 kpc. This leads
to a size for the dark lane of ~10500 AU but due to shadowing effects the true
disk size could be smaller. In Spitzer/IRAC 3.6 micron images the elongated
shape of the bipolar reflection nebula is still preserved and the bulk of the
flux seems to come from disk regions that can be detected due to the slight
inclination of the disk. At longer IRAC wavelengths, the flux is mainly coming
from the central regions penetrating directly through the dust lane.
Interferometric observations of the dust continuum emission at millimeter
wavelengths with the SMA confirm this finding as the peak of the unresolved
mm-emission coincides perfectly with the peak of the Spitzer/IRAC 5.8 micron
flux and the center of the dark lane seen in the NIR images. Simultaneously
acquired CO data reveal a molecular outflow along the northern part of the
reflection nebula which seems to be the outflow cavity. An elongated gaseous
disk component is also detected and shows signs of rotation. The emission is
perpendicular to the molecular outflow and thus parallel to but even more
extended than the dark lane in the NIR images. Based on the dust continuum and
the CO observations we estimate a disk mass of up to a few solar masses
depending on the underlying assumptions. Whether the disk-like structure is an
actual accretion disk or rather a larger-scale flattened envelope or pseudodisk
is difficult to discriminate with the current dataset (abridged).
