In this work, we consider the interacting agegraphic dark energy models with
entropy correction terms due to loop quantum gravity. We study the
correspondence between the Chaplygin gas energy density with the interacting
entropy-corrected agegraphic dark energy models in non-flat FRW universe. We
reconstruct the potentials and the dynamics of the interacting
entropy-corrected agegraphic scalar field models. This model is also extended
to the interacting entropy-corrected agegraphic generalized Chaplygin gas dark
energy.
