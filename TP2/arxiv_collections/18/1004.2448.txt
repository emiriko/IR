The Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope (UVOT) is one of three instruments onboard
the Swift observatory. The photometric calibration has been published, and this
paper follows up with details on other aspects of the calibration including a
measurement of the point spread function with an assessment of the orbital
variation and the effect on photometry. A correction for large scale variations
in sensitivity over the field of view is described, as well as a model of the
coincidence loss which is used to assess the coincidence correction in extended
regions. We have provided a correction for the detector distortion and measured
the resulting internal astrometric accuracy of the UVOT, also giving the
absolute accuracy with respect to the International Celestial Reference System.
We have compiled statistics on the background count rates, and discuss the
sources of the background, including instrumental scattered light. In each case
we describe any impact on UVOT measurements, whether any correction is applied
in the standard pipeline data processing or whether further steps are
recommended.
