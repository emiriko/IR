State readout is a key requirement for a quantum computer. For
semiconductor-based qubit devices it is usually accomplished using a separate
mesoscopic electrometer. Here we demonstrate a simple detection scheme in which
a radio-frequency resonant circuit coupled to a semiconductor double quantum
dot is used to probe its charge and spin states. These results demonstrate a
new non-invasive technique for measuring charge and spin states in quantum dot
systems without requiring a separate mesoscopic detector.
