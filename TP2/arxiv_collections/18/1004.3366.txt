Lenstra's integer factorization algorithm is asymptotically one of the
fastest known algorithms, and is ideally suited for parallel computation. We
suggest a way in which the algorithm can be speeded up by the addition of a
second phase. Under some plausible assumptions, the speedup is of order log(p),
where p is the factor which is found. In practice the speedup is significant.
We mention some refinements which give greater speedup, an alternative way of
implementing a second phase, and the connection with Pollard's "p-1"
factorization algorithm.
