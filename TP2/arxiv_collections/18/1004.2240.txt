We present a scheme for the deterministic generation of entangled photon
pairs in a superconducting resonator array. The resonators form a
Jaynes-Cummings lattice via the coupling to superconducting qubits, and the
Kerr-like nonlinearity arises due to the coupling.We show that entangled
photons can be generated on demand by applying spectroscopic techniques and
exploiting the nonlinearity and symmetry in the resonators. The scheme is
robust against small parameter spreads due to fabrication errors. Our findings
can be used as a key element for quantum information processing in
superconducting quantum circuits.
