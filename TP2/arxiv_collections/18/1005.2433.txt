The analysis of the penguin decay Bd->K*MuMu at LHCb can act as a laboratory
for the discovery and understanding of new physics. Through the Operator
Product Expansion, the decay kinematics are well understood in both the
Standard Model and in a large range of new physics scenarios. The theoretical
errors from QCD effects can be characterized and a set of observables have been
derived which minimise their influence in measurements. We will describe how
these measurements can be made in LHCb with special emphasis on what can be
done with a first run of the LHC with a few hundred pb-1 of integrated
luminosity.
