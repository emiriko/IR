The STAR Collaboration at RHIC has measured two-pion correlation functions
from p+p collisions at sqrt(s)=200 GeV. Spatial scales are extracted via a
femtoscopic analysis of the correlations, though this analysis is complicated
by the presence of strong non-femtoscopic effects. Our results are put into the
context of the world dataset of femtoscopy in hadron-hadron collisions. We
present the first direct comparison of femtoscopy in p+p and heavy ion
collisions, under identical analysis and detector conditions.
