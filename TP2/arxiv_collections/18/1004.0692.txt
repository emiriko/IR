We present new spectroscopic and photometric observations of the transiting
exoplanetary system WASP-3. Spectra obtained during two separate transits
exhibit the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect and allow us to estimate the
sky-projected angle between the planetary orbital axis and the stellar rotation
axis, lambda = 3.3^{+2.5}_{-4.4} degrees. This alignment between the axes
suggests that WASP-3b has a low orbital inclination relative to the equatorial
plane of its parent star. During our first night of spectroscopic measurements,
we observed an unexpected redshift briefly exceeding the expected sum of the
orbital and RM velocities by 140 m/s. This anomaly could represent the
occultation of material erupting from the stellar photosphere, although it is
more likely to be an artifact caused by moonlight scattered into the
spectrograph.
