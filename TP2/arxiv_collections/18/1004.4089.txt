The premise of automated alert correlation is to accept that false alerts
from a low level intrusion detection system are inevitable and use attack
models to explain the output in an understandable way. Several algorithms exist
for this purpose which use attack graphs to model the ways in which attacks can
be combined. These algorithms can be classified in to two broad categories
namely scenario-graph approaches, which create an attack model starting from a
vulnerability assessment and type-graph approaches which rely on an abstract
model of the relations between attack types. Some research in to improving the
efficiency of type-graph correlation has been carried out but this research has
ignored the hypothesizing of missing alerts. Our work is to present a novel
type-graph algorithm which unifies correlation and hypothesizing in to a single
operation. Our experimental results indicate that the approach is extremely
efficient in the face of intensive alerts and produces compact output graphs
comparable to other techniques.
