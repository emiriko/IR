Historically, the discovery of symmetries has played an important role in the
progress of our fundamental understanding of nature. This paper will
demonstrate that there exists in Newtonian theory in a spherical gravitational
field a formal symmetry between the kinetic (KE) and gravitational potential
energy (GPE) of a test mass. Put differently, there exists a way of expressing
GPE such that the form of the mathematical expression remains invariant under
an interchange of KE and GPE. When extended to relativity by a suitable
assumption, it leads to a framework that bridges the general relativistic and
Newtonian conceptions of gravitational energy, even though the symmetry is
broken except in the infinitesimal limit. Recognizing this symmetry at
infinitesimal scales makes it possible to write a relativistic equation of an
individual graviton, the properties of which under under one interpretation may
be unexpected.
