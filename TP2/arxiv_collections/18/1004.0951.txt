A dynamical map is a map which takes one density operator to another. Such a
map can be written in an operator-sum representation (OSR) using a spectral
decomposition. The method of the construction applies to more general maps
which need not be completely positive. The OSR not unique; there is a freedom
to choose the set of operators in the OSR differently, yet still obtain the
same map. Here we identify all maps which are equivalent to a given map.
Whereas the freedom for completely positive maps is unitary, the freedom for
maps which are not necessarily completely positive is pseudo-unitary.
