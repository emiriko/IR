The article introduces a new mechanism for selecting individuals to a Pareto
archive. It was combined with a micro-genetic algorithm and tested on several
problems. The ability of this approach to produce individuals uniformly
distributed along the Pareto set without negative impact on convergence is
demonstrated on presented results. The new concept was confronted with NSGA-II,
SPEA2, and IBEA algorithms from the PISA package. Another studied effect is the
size of population versus number of generations for small populations.
