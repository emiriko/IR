Changing the spheroidal wave equations into new Schro$dinger's form, the
super-potential expanded in the series form of the parameter $\alpha$are
obtained in the paper. This general form of the super-potential makes it easy
to get the ground eigenfunctions of the spheroidal equations. But the
shape-invariance property is not retained and the corresponding recurrence
relations of the form (4) could not be extended from the associated Legendre
functions to the case of the spheroidal functions.
