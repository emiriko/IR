The results of experimental researches of electroconductivity of PVC films,
plasticized by patented modifier, at fields below the breakdown level are
described. A possibility of management of the repeated transitions between two
states with high and relatively low conductivity with conservation of
reversibility is found out. A simple qualitative model of abnormal conductivity
based on representation of polymer film as a sequence p-n of transitions is
offered. For samples of plasticized PVC films with thickness 30-50 microns
specific volume resistance of steady states was of an order of 10E4 Om*m \times
10E6 Om*m, accordingly. A simple qualitative model describing abnormal
character of conductivity of polymeric films is offered. The model considers
the presence of known non-uniform plasticized polymer structure with discrete
domains in which quasi-free moving of charges can occur. At imposing of an
external field semi-condictive domains form sequence of p-n transitions which
provides presence of two states of conductivity, in analogy with dinistors.
