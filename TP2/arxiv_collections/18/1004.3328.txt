A classical one-time pad allows two parties to send private messages over a
public classical channel -- an eavesdropper who intercepts the communication
learns nothing about the message. A quantum one-time pad is a shared quantum
state which allows two parties to send private messages or private quantum
states over a public quantum channel. If the eavesdropper intercepts the
quantum communication she learns nothing about the message. In the classical
case, a one-time pad can be created using shared and partially private
correlations. Here we consider the quantum case in the presence of an
eavesdropper, and find the single letter formula for the rate at which the two
parties can send messages using a quantum one-time pad.
