This work initiates an analysis of several cryptographic protocols from a
rational point of view using a game-theoretical approach, which allows us to
represent not only the protocols but also possible misbehaviours of parties.
Concretely, several concepts of two-person games and of two-party cryptographic
protocols are here combined in order to model the latters as the formers. One
of the main advantages of analysing a cryptographic protocol in the game-theory
setting is the possibility of describing improved and stronger cryptographic
solutions because possible adversarial behaviours may be taken into account
directly. With those tools, protocols can be studied in a malicious model in
order to find equilibrium conditions that make possible to protect honest
parties against all possible strategies of adversaries.
