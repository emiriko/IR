In this paper, pilot-symbol-assisted transmission in cognitive radio systems
over time selective flat fading channels is studied. It is assumed that causal
and noncausal Wiener filter estimators are used at the secondary receiver with
the aid of training symbols to obtain the channel side information (CSI) under
an interference power constraint. Cognitive radio model is described together
with detection and false alarm probabilities determined by using a
Neyman-Person detector for channel sensing. Subsequently, for both filters, the
variances of estimate errors are calculated from the Doppler power spectrum of
the channel, and achievable rate expressions are provided considering the
scenarios which are results of channel sensing. Numerical results are obtained
in Gauss-Markov modeled channels, and achievable rates obtained by using causal
and noncausal filters are compared and it is shown that the difference is
decreasing with increasing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Moreover, the optimal
probability of detection and false alarm values are shown, and the tradeoff
between these two parameters is discussed. Finally, optimal power distributions
are provided.
