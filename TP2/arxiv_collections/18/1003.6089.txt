We present the ground-based activities within the different working groups of
the Kepler Asteroseismic Science Consortium (KASC). The activities aim at the
systematic characterization of the 5000+ KASC targets, and at the collection of
ground-based follow-up time-series data of selected promising Kepler pulsators.
So far, 36 different instruments at 31 telescopes on 23 different observatories
in 12 countries are in use, and a total of more than 530 observing nights has
been awarded.
