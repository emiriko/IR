In two recent works \cite{BMM,BK}, it has been shown that the counting
generating functions (CGF) for the 23 walks with small steps confined in a
quadrant and associated with a finite group of birational transformations are
holonomic, and even algebraic in 4 cases -- in particular for the so-called
Gessel's walk. It turns out that the type of functional equations satisfied by
these CGF appeared in a probabilistic context almost 40 years ago. Then a
method of resolution was proposed in \cite{FIM}, involving at once algebraic
tools and a reduction to boundary value problems. Recently this method has been
developed in a combinatorics framework in \cite{Ra}, where a thorough study of
the explicit expressions for the CGF is proposed. The aim of this paper is to
derive the nature of the bivariate CGF by a direct use of some general theorems
given in \cite{FIM}.
