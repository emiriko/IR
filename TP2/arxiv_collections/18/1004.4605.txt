This paper focus on the study of the motion activity descriptor for shot
boundary detection in video sequences. We interest in the validation of this
descriptor in the aim of its real time implementation with reasonable high
performances in shot boundary detection. The motion activity information is
extracted in uncompressed domain based on adaptive rood pattern search (ARPS)
algorithm. In this context, the motion activity descriptor was applied for
different video sequence.
