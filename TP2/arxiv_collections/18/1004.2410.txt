Cosmic Microwave Background satellite missions as the on-going Planck
experiment are expected to provide the strongest constraints on a wide set of
cosmological parameters. Those constraints, however, could be weakened when the
assumption of a cosmological constant as the dark energy component is removed.
Here we show that it will indeed be the case when there exists a coupling among
the dark energy and the dark matter fluids. In particular, the expected errors
on key parameters as the cold dark matter density and the angular diameter
distance at decoupling are significantly larger when a dark coupling is
introduced. We show that it will be the case also for future satellite missions
as EPIC, unless CMB lensing extraction is performed.
