Just about all the newest living room audio-video electronics and PC
multimedia products being designed today will incorporate some form of
compressed digitized-audio processing capability. Audio compression reduces the
bit rate required to represent an analog audio signal while maintaining the
perceived audio quality. Discarding inaudible data reduces the storage,
transmission and compute requirements of handling high-quality audio files.
This paper covers wave audio file format & algorithm of silence compression
method and companding method to compress and decompress wave audio file. Then
it compares the result of these two methods.
