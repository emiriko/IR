We present a catalog of 5324 massive stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud
(SMC), with accurate spectral types compiled from the literature, and a
photometric catalog for a subset of 3654 of these stars, with the goal of
exploring their infrared properties. The photometric catalog consists of stars
with infrared counterparts in the Spitzer, SAGE-SMC survey database, for which
we present uniform photometry from 0.3-24 um in the UBVIJHKs+IRAC+MIPS24 bands.
We compare the color magnitude diagrams and color-color diagrams to those of
the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), finding that the brightest infrared sources
in the SMC are also the red supergiants, supergiant B[e] (sgB[e]) stars,
luminous blue variables, and Wolf-Rayet stars, with the latter exhibiting less
infrared excess, the red supergiants being less dusty and the sgB[e] stars
being on average less luminous. Among the objects detected at 24 um are a few
very luminous hypergiants, 4 B-type stars with peculiar, flat spectral energy
distributions, and all 3 known luminous blue variables. We detect a distinct Be
star sequence, displaced to the red, and suggest a novel method of confirming
Be star candidates photometrically. We find a higher fraction of Oe and Be
stars among O and early-B stars in the SMC, respectively, when compared to the
LMC, and that the SMC Be stars occur at higher luminosities. We estimate
mass-loss rates for the red supergiants, confirming the correlation with
luminosity even at the metallicity of the SMC. Finally, we confirm the new
class of stars displaying composite A & F type spectra, the sgB[e] nature of
2dFS1804 and find the F0 supergiant 2dFS3528 to be a candidate luminous blue
variable with cold dust.
