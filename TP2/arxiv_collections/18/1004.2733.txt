We propose a method of achieving large temperature sensitivity in the Casimir
force that involves measuring the stable separation between dielectric objects
immersed in fluid. We study the Casimir force between slabs and spheres using
realistic material models, and find large > 2nm/K variations in their stable
separations (hundreds of nanometers) near room temperature. In addition, we
analyze the effects of Brownian motion on suspended objects, and show that the
average separation is also sensitive to changes in temperature . Finally, this
approach also leads to rich qualitative phenomena, such as irreversible
transitions, from suspension to stiction, as the temperature is varied.
