Patterned surfaces with large effective slip lengths, such as
super-hydrophobic surfaces containing trapped gas bubbles, have the potential
to reduce hydrodynamic drag. Based on lubrication theory, we analyze an
approach of a hydrophilic disk to such a surface. The drag force is predicted
analytically and formulated in terms of a correction function to the Reynolds
equation, which is shown to be the harmonic mean of corrections expressed
through effective slip lengths in the two principal (fastest and slowest)
orthogonal directions. The reduction of drag is especially pronounced for a
thin (compared to texture period) gap. It is not really sensitive to the
pattern geometry, but depends strongly on the fraction of the gas phase and
local slip length at the gas area.
