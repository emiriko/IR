When epitaxial graphene layers are formed on SiC(0001), the first carbon
layer (known as the "buffer layer"), while relatively easy to synthesize, does
not have the desirable electrical properties of graphene. The conductivity is
poor due to a disruption of the graphene pi-bands by covalent bonding to the
SiC substrate. Here we show that it is possible to restore the graphene
pi-bands by inserting a thin oxide layer between the buffer layer and SiC
substrate using a low temperature, CMOS-compatible process that does not damage
the graphene layer.
