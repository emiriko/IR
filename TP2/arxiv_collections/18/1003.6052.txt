Integrated Traffic Management Systems (ITMS) are now implemented in different
cities in India to primarily address the concerns of road-safety and security.
An automated Red Light Violation Detection System (RLVDS) is an integral part
of the ITMS. In our present work we have designed and developed a complete
system for generating the list of all stop-line violating vehicle images
automatically from video snapshots of road-side surveillance cameras. The
system first generates adaptive background images for each camera view,
subtracts captured images from the corresponding background images and analyses
potential occlusions over the stop-line in a traffic signal. Considering
round-the-clock operations in a real-life test environment, the developed
system could successfully track 92% images of vehicles with violations on the
stop-line in a "Red" traffic signal.
