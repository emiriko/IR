Based on compressive sampling techniques and short exposure imaging,
super-resolution imaging with thermal light is experimentally demonstrated
exploiting the sparse prior property of images for standard conventional
imaging system. Differences between super-resolution imaging demonstrated in
this letter and super-resolution ghost imaging via compressive sampling (arXiv.
Quant-ph/0911.4750v1 (2009)), and methods to further improve the imaging
quality are also discussed.
