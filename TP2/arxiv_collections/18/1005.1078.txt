It is demonstrated that the strong power-like scaling violation in the
transverse momentum distribution of inclusive hadron production, observed by
CDF Collaboration in $\bar{p}p$ collisions at Tevatron is caused by
contribution of weak interaction. The contribution of weak interaction is
increasing with energy at high energies.
