We show that models with deformations of special relativity that have an
energy-dependent speed of light have non-local effects. The requirement that
the arising non-locality is not in conflict with known particle physics allows
us to derive strong bounds on deformations of special relativity and rule out a
modification to first order in energy over the Planck mass.
