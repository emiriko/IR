Using an advanced version of the renormalized mean-field theory (RMFT) for
the t-J model, we examine spin-singlet superconducting (SC) state of $d_{x^2 -
y^2}$-symmetry. Overall doping dependence of the SC gap magnitude is in good
agreement with experimental results for $\text{Bi}_{2}\text{Sr}_{2}\text{Ca}
\text{Cu}_2 \text{O}_{8 + \delta}$ (BSCCO) and
$\text{La}_{2-x}\text{Sr}_{x}\text{Cu} \text{O}_{4}$ (LSCO) compounds at the
optimal doping and in the overdoped regime. We also calculate the dispersion
relation for the Bogoliubov quasiparticles and compare our findings both with
the angle resolved photoemission data for the cuprates, as well as with the
variational Monte Carlo and other mean-field studies. Within the method
proposed by Fukushima [cf. Phys. Rev. B \textbf{78}, 115105 (2008)], we analyze
different forms of the t-J Hamiltonian, i.e. modifications caused by the form
of exchange interaction, and by the presence of three-site terms. It is shown
that although the former has a small influence, the latter suppresses strongly
the superconductivity. We also analyze the temperature dependence of the gap
magnitude and compare the results with those of the recently introduced
finite-temperature renormalized mean-field theory (TRMFT) of Wang et al. [cf.
Phys. Rev. B \textbf{82}, 125105 (2010)].
