By subjecting a dynamical system to a series of short pulses and varying
several time delays we can obtain multidimensional characteristic measures of
the system. Multidimensional Kullback-Leibler response function (KLRF), which
are based on the Kullback-Leibler distance between the initial and final
states, are defined. We compare the KLRF, which are nonlinear in the
probability density, with ordinary response functions (ORF) obtained from the
expectation value of a dynamical variable, which are linear. We show that the
KLRF encode different level of information regarding the system's dynamics. For
overdamped stochastic dynamics two dimensional KLRF shows a qualitatively
different variation with the time delays between pulses, depending on whether
the system is initially in a steady state, or in thermal equilibrium.
