In this brief report an attempt is made for a 'mise-a-point' of the subject
of the phase fluctuations of the superconducting order parameter above Tc in
cuprates, particularly as they appear in underdoped compounds. Measurements of
torque magnetometry, Nernst effect and isothermal diamagnetic magnetization
curves published in the last years are taken into consideration. Although by
different experimental approaches and in different magnetic field ranges it can
be stated that vortex-antivortex excitations and phase fluctuations among
islands of local non-zero order parameter lacking of long range coherence do
occur in a relevant temperature range above Tc, particularly in underdoped
compounds. The role of the diamagnetic magnetization curves on approaching Tc
from above in opening the field with clear signature is remarked, while
enlightening comparison with other approaches appear possible.
