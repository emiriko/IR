In recent years a large number of Hot Jupiters orbiting in a very close orbit
around the parent stars have been explored with the transit and doppler effect
methods. Here in this work we study the gravitational microlensing effect of a
binary lens on a parent star with a Hot Jupiter revolving around it. Caustic
crossing of the planet makes enhancements on the light curve of the parent star
in which the signature of the planet can be detected by high precision
photometric observations. We use the inverse ray shooting method with tree code
algorithm to generate the combined light curve of the parent star and the
planet. In order to investigate the probability of observing the planet signal,
we do a Monte-Carlo simulation and obtain the observational optical depth of
$\tau \sim 10^{-8}$. We show that about ten years observations of Galactic
Bulge with a network of telescopes will enable us detecting about ten Hot
Jupiter with this method. Finally we show that the observation of the
microlensing event in infra-red band will increase the probability for
detection of the exo-planets.
