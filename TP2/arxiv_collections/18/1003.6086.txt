Numerical data on the probability distribution of the equilibrium relaxation
time of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model are obtained by means of dynamical
Monte Carlo simulation, for several values of the system size $N$ and
temperature $T$. Proper care is taken that the thermal fluctuations on the
relaxation time estimates are totally negligible compared to the disorder
induced fluctuations. The probability distribution of
$\ln\tau-\overline{\ln\tau}$ scales with the scaling variable $N^{1/3} (T_c-T)$
strengthening the belief that $\overline{\ln\tau}\propto N^{1/3}$ in the whole
spin glass phase.
