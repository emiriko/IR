The study of high-dimensional differential equations is challenging and
difficult due to the analytical and computational intractability. Here, we
improve the speed of waveform relaxation (WR), a method to simulate
high-dimensional differential-algebraic equations. This new method termed
adaptive waveform relaxation (AWR) is tested on a communication network
example. Further we propose different heuristics for computing graph partitions
tailored to adaptive waveform relaxation. We find that AWR coupled with
appropriate graph partitioning methods provides a speedup by a factor between 3
and 16.
