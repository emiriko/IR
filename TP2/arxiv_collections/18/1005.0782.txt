We show that pairs of generators for the family Sz(q) of Suzuki groups may be
selected so that the corresponding Cayley graphs are expanders. By combining
this with several deep works of Kassabov, Lubotzky and Nikolov, this
establishes that the family of all non-abelian finite simple groups can be made
into expanders in a uniform fashion.
