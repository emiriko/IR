A compactification of the E_8 x E_8 heterotic string on a Z_2 x Z_2 orbifold
equipped with an additional freely acting involution is presented. This model
reproduces the exact chiral MSSM spectrum with matter parity and a non-trivial
Yukawa structure. The key ingredient is a freely acting Wilson line associated
to the involution, breaking SU(5) to SU(3) x SU(2) x U(1)_Y. This work is based
on a talk given at the "9th Hellenic School and Workshop on Elementary Particle
Physics and Gravity" and reviews the results of a collaboration with M.
Blaszczyk, S. Groot Nibbelink, M. Ratz, F. Ruehle and M. Trapletti.
