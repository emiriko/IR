We undertake a quantitative comparison of multi-fragmentation reactions, as
modeled by two different approaches: the Antisymmetrized Molecular Dynamics
(AMD) and the momentum-dependent stochastic mean-field (SMF) model. Fragment
observables and pre-equilibrium (nucleon and light cluster) emission are
analyzed, in connection to the underlying compression-expansion dynamics in
each model. Considering reactions between neutron-rich systems, observables
related to the isotopic properties of emitted particles and fragments are also
discussed, as a function of the parametrization employed for the isovector part
of the nuclear interaction. We find that the reaction path, particularly the
mechanism of fragmentation, is different in the two models and reflects on some
properties of the reaction products, including their isospin content. This
should be taken into account in the study of the density dependence of the
symmetry energy from such collisions.
