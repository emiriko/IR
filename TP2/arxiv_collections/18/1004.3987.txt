Correlations are important tools in the characterization of quantum fields.
They can be used to describe statistical properties of the fields, such as
bunching and anti-bunching, as well as to perform field state tomography. Here
we analyse experiments by Bozyigit et al. [arXiv:1002.3738] where correlation
functions can be observed using the measurement records of linear detectors
(i.e. quadrature measurements), instead of relying on intensity or number
detectors. We also describe how large amplitude noise introduced by these
detectors can be quantified and subtracted from the data. This enables, in
particular, the observation of first- and second-order coherence functions of
microwave photon fields generated using circuit quantum-electrodynamics and
propagating in superconducting transmission lines under the condition that
noise is sufficiently low.
