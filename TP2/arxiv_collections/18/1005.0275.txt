CoRoT and Kepler missions are now providing high-quality asteroseismic data
for a large number of stars. Among intermediate-mass and massive stars, fast
rotators are common objects. Taking the rotation effects into account is needed
to correctly understand, identify, and interpret the observed oscillation
frequencies of these stars. A classical approach is to consider the rotation as
a perturbation. In this paper, we focus on gravity modes, such as those
occurring in gamma Doradus, slowly pulsating B (SPB), or Be stars. We aim to
define the suitability of perturbative methods. With the two-dimensional
oscillation program (TOP), we performed complete computations of gravity modes
-including the Coriolis force, the centrifugal distortion, and compressible
effects- in 2-D distorted polytropic models of stars. We started with the modes
l=1, n=1-14, and l=2-3, n=1-5,16-20 of a nonrotating star, and followed these
modes by increasing the rotation rate up to 70% of the break-up rotation rate.
We then derived perturbative coefficients and determined the domains of
validity of the perturbative methods. Second-order perturbative methods are
suited to computing low-order, low-degree mode frequencies up to rotation
speeds ~100 km/s for typical gamma Dor stars or ~150 km/s for B stars. The
domains of validity can be extended by a few tens of km/s thanks to the
third-order terms. For higher order modes, the domains of validity are
noticeably reduced. Moreover, perturbative methods are inefficient for modes
with frequencies lower than the Coriolis frequency 2Omega. We interpret this
failure as a consequence of a modification in the shape of the resonant cavity
that is not taken into account in the perturbative approach.
