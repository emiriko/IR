The innumerable shapes of plant leaves present a challenge to the explanatory
power of biophysical theory. A model is needed that can produce these shapes
with a small set of parameters. This paper presents a simple model of leaf
shape based on a growth algorithm, which governs the growth rate of leaf tissue
in two dimensions and hence the outline of the leaf. The growth of leaf lobes
is governed by the position of leaf veins. This model gives an approximation to
a wide variety of higher plant leaf shapes. The variation of leaf shapes found
in closely related plants is discussed in terms of variability in the growth
algorithms. The model can be extended to more complex leaf types.
