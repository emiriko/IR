As the multimedia and internet technologies are growing fast, the
transmission of digital media plays an important role in communication. The
various digital media like audio, video and images are being transferred
through internet. There are a lot of threats for the digital data that are
transferred through internet. Also, a number of security techniques have been
employed to protect the data that is transferred through internet. This paper
proposes a new technique for sending secret messages securely, using
steganographic technique. Since the proposed system uses multiple level of
security for data hiding, where the data is hidden in an image file and the
stego file is again concealed in another image. Previously, the secret message
is being encrypted with the encryption algorithm which ensures the achievement
of high security enabled data transfer through internet.
