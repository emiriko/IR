We report a novel aspect of the competition and coexistence between magnetism
and superconductivity in the high-$T_{c}$ cuprate La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_{4}$
(La214). With a modest magnetic field applied $H \parallel c$-axis, we
monitored the infrared signature of pair tunneling between the CuO$_2$ planes
and discovered the complete suppression of interlayer coupling in a series of
underdoped La214 single crystals. We find that the in-plane superconducting
properties remain intact, in spite of enhanced magnetism in the planes.
