We studied the question of parity breaking in a supersymmetric left-right
model, in which the left-right symmetry is broken with Higgs doublets (carrying
$B-L=\pm 1$). Unlike the left-right symmetric models with triplet Higgs scalars
(carrying $B-L=\pm 2$), in this model it is possible to break parity
spontaneously by adding a parity odd singlet. We then discussed how neutrino
mass of type III seesaw can be invoked in this model by adding extra fermion
singlets. We considered simple forms of the mass matrices that are consistent
with the unification scheme and demonstrate how they can reproduce the required
neutrino mixing matrix. In this model, the baryon asymmetry of the universe is
generated via leptogenesis. The required mass scales in the model is then found
to be consistent with the gauge coupling unification.
