We analyze a quantum dot strongly coupled to the conducting leads via quantum
point contacts - Fano regime of transport - and report a variety of resonant
states which demonstrate the dominance of the interacting resonances in the
scattering process in a low confining potential. There are resonant states
similar to the eigenstates of the isolated dot, whose widths increase with
increasing the coupling strength to the environment, and hybrid resonant
states. The last ones are approximatively obtained as a linear combination of
eigenstates with the same parity in the lateral direction, and the
corresponding resonances show the phenomena of resonance trapping or level
repulsion. The existence of the hybrid modes suggests that the open quantum dot
behaves in the Fano regime like an artificial molecule.
