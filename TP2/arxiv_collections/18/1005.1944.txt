We present results for the corrections of order alpha^2 (Z alpha) E_F to the
hyperfine splitting of muonium. We compute all the contributing Feynman
diagrams in dimensional regularization and a general covariant gauge using a
mixture of analytical and numerical methods. We improve the precision of
previous results.
