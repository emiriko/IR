In the recent years, the "Nice" model of solar system formation has attained
an unprecedented level of success in reproducing much of the observed orbital
architecture of the solar system by evolving the planets to their current
locations from a more compact configuration. Within the context of this model,
the formation of the classical Kuiper belt requires a phase during which the
ice giants have a high eccentricity. An outstanding question of this model is
the initial configuration from which the Solar System started out. Recent work
has shown that multi-resonant initial conditions can serve as good candidates,
as they naturally prevent vigorous type-II migration. In this paper, we use
analytical arguments, as well as self-consistent numerical N-body simulations
to identify fully-resonant initial conditions, whose dynamical evolution is
characterized by an eccentric phase of the ice-giants, as well as planetary
scattering. We find a total of eight such initial conditions. Four of these
primordial states are compatible with the canonical "Nice" model, while the
others imply slightly different evolutions. The results presented here should
prove useful in further development of a comprehensive model for solar system
formation.
