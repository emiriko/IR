Recent sub-millimetric observations at the Plateau de Bure interferometer
evidenced a cavity at ~ 46 AU in radius into the proto-planetary disk around
the T Tauri star LkCa15 (V1079 Tau), located in the Taurus molecular cloud.
Additional Spitzer observations have corroborated this result possibly
explained by the presence of a massive (>= 5 MJup) planetary mass, a brown
dwarf or a low mass star companion at about 30 AU from the star. We used the
most recent developments of high angular resolution and high contrast imaging
to search directly for the existence of this putative companion, and to bring
new constraints on its physical and orbital properties. The NACO adaptive
optics instrument at VLT was used to observe LkCa15 using a four quadrant phase
mask coronagraph to access small angular separations at relatively high
contrast. A reference star at the same parallactic angle was carefully observed
to optimize the quasi-static speckles subtraction (limiting our sensitivity at
less than 1.0). Although we do not report any positive detection of a faint
companion that would be responsible for the observed gap in LkCa15's disk
(25-30 AU), our detection limits start constraining its probable mass,
semi-major axis and eccentricity. Using evolutionary model predictions, Monte
Carlo simulations exclude the presence of low eccentric companions with masses
M >= 6 M Jup and orbiting at a >= 100 AU with significant level of confidence.
For closer orbits, brown dwarf companions can be rejected with a detection
probability of 90% down to 80 AU (at 80% down to 60 AU). Our detection limits
do not access the star environment close enough to fully exclude the presence
of a brown dwarf or a massive planet within the disk inner activity (i.e at
less than 30 AU). Only, further and higher contrast observations should unveil
the existence of this putative companion inside the LkCa15 disk.
