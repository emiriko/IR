The ground state energy and the extend of the wavefunction of a negatively
charged donor (D-) located near a semiconductor-metal or a
semiconductor-dielectric interface is obtained. We apply the effective mass
approximation and use a variational two-electron wavefunction that takes into
account the influence of all image charges that arise due to the presence of
the interface, as well as the correlation between the two electrons bound to
the donor. For a semiconductor-metal interface, the D- binding energy is
enhanced for donor positions d>1.5a_B (a_B is the effective Bohr radius) due to
the additional attraction of the electrons with their images. When the donor
approaches the interface (i.e. d<1.5a_B) the D- binding energy drops and
eventually it becomes unbound. For a semiconductor-dielectric (or a
semiconductor-vacuum) interface the D- binding energy is reduced for any donor
position as compared to the bulk case and the system becomes rapidly unbound
when the donor approaches the interface.
