We investigate the asymptotic symmetries of Rindler space at null infinity
and at the event horizon using both systematic and ad hoc methods. We find that
the approaches that yield infinite-dimensional asymptotic symmetry algebras in
the case of anti-de Sitter and flat spaces only give a finite-dimensional
algebra for Rindler space at null infinity. We calculate the charges
corresponding to these symmetries and confirm that they are finite, conserved,
and integrable, and that the algebra of charges gives a representation of the
asymptotic symmetry algebra. We also use relaxed boundary conditions to find
infinite-dimensional asymptotic symmetry algebras for Rindler space at null
infinity and at the event horizon. We compute the charges corresponding to
these symmetries and confirm that they are finite and integrable. We also
determine sufficient conditions for the charges to be conserved on-shell, and
for the charge algebra to give a representation of the asymptotic symmetry
algebra. In all cases, we find that the central extension of the charge algebra
is trivial.
