The influence of the spin-orbit interactions on the energy spectrum of
two-electron laterally coupled quantum dots is investigated. The effective
Hamiltonian for a spin qubit pair proposed in F. Baruffa et al., Phys. Rev.
Lett. 104, 126401 (2010) is confronted with exact numerical results in single
and double quantum dots in zero and finite magnetic field. The anisotropic
exchange Hamiltonian is found quantitatively reliable in double dots in
general. There are two findings of particular practical importance: i) The
model stays valid even for maximal possible interdot coupling (a single dot),
due to the absence of a coupling to the nearest excited level, a fact following
from the dot symmetry. ii) In a weak coupling regime, the Heitler-London
approximation gives quantitatively correct anisotropic exchange parameters even
in a finite magnetic field, although this method is known to fail for the
isotropic exchange. The small discrepancy between the analytical model (which
employes the linear Dresselhaus and Bychkov-Rashba spin-orbit terms) and the
numerical data for GaAs quantum dots is found to be mostly due to the cubic
Dresselhaus term.
