The key challenge in current research into electromagnetic cloaking is to
achieve invisibility over an extended bandwidth. There has been significant
progress towards this using the idea of cloaking by sweeping under the carpet
of Li and Pendry, with dielectric structures superposed on a mirror. Here, we
show that we can harness surface plasmon polaritons at a metal surface
structured with a dielectric material to obtain a unique control of their
propagation. We exploit this to control plasmonic coupling and demonstrate both
theoretically and experimentally cloaking over an unprecedented bandwidth
(650-900 nm). Our non-resonant plasmonic metamaterial allows a curved reflector
to mimic a flat mirror. Our theoretical predictions are validated by
experiments mapping the surface light intensity at the wavelength 800 nm.
