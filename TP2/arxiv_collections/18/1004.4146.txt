Finding all Bell inequalities for a given number of parties, measurement
settings, and measurement outcomes is in general a computationally hard task.
We show that all Bell inequalities which are symmetric under the exchange of
parties can be found by examining a symmetrized polytope which is simpler than
the full Bell polytope. As an illustration of our method, we generate 238885
new Bell inequalities and 1085 new Svetlichny inequalities. We find, in
particular, facet inequalities for Bell experiments involving two parties and
two measurement settings that are not of the
Collins-Gisin-Linden-Massar-Popescu type.
