The possibility to test quantum measurement theories is discussed in the more
phenomenological framework of the quantum nondemolition theory. A simple test
of the hypothesis of the state vector collapse is proposed by looking for
deviations from the Boltzmann distribution of the energy associated to only one
complex amplitude of a macroscopic harmonic oscillator.
