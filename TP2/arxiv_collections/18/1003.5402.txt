Online adaptive radiation therapy (ART) has great promise to significantly
reduce normal tissue toxicity and/or improve tumor control through real-time
treatment adaptations based on the current patient anatomy. However, the major
technical obstacle for clinical realization of online ART, namely the inability
to achieve real-time efficiency in treatment re-planning, has yet to be solved.
To overcome this challenge, this paper presents our work on the implementation
of an intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) direct aperture optimization
(DAO) algorithm on graphics processing unit (GPU) based on our previous work on
CPU. We formulate the DAO problem as a large-scale convex programming problem,
and use an exact method called column generation approach to deal with its
extremely large dimensionality on GPU. Five 9-field prostate and five 5-field
head-and-neck IMRT clinical cases with 5\times5 mm2 beamlet size and
2.5\times2.5\times2.5 mm3 voxel size were used to evaluate our algorithm on
GPU. It takes only 0.7~2.5 seconds for our implementation to generate optimal
treatment plans using 50 MLC apertures on an NVIDIA Tesla C1060 GPU card. Our
work has therefore solved a major problem in developing ultra-fast
(re-)planning technologies for online ART.
