This paper presents a variation of Apriori algorithm that includes the role
of domain expert to guide and speed up the overall knowledge discovery task.
Usually, the user is interested in finding relationships between certain
attributes instead of the whole dataset. Moreover, he can help the mining
algorithm to select the target database which in turn takes less time to find
the desired association rules. Variants of the standard Apriori and Interactive
Apriori algorithms have been run on artificial datasets. The results show that
incorporating user's preference in selection of target attribute helps to
search the association rules efficiently both in terms of space and time.
