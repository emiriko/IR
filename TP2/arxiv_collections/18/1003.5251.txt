We study the conditions required for $\chi_2 \to \chi + \tau^\pm \mu^\mp$
decays to yield observable tau flavour violation at the LHC, for cosmologically
interesting values of the neutralino relic density. These condition can be
achieved in the framework of a SU(5) model with a see-saw mechanism that allows
a possible coexistence of a LHC signal a low prediction for radiative LFV
decays.
