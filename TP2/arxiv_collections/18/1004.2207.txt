We present a formal analogy between the eigenvalue problem for guided scalar
modes in a low-contrast photonic bandgap fiber and quasi-stationary TM modes of
a two-dimensional (2D) photonic structure. Using this analogy, we numerically
study the confinement losses of disordered microstructured fibers through the
leakage rate of an open 2D system with high refractive index inclusions. Our
results show that for large values of the disorder, the confinement losses
increase. However, they also suggest that losses might be improved in strongly
disordered fibers by exploring ranges of physical parameters where Anderson
localization sets in.
