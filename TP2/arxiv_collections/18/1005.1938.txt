We consider different extensions of the standard model which can give rise to
the small active neutrino masses through seesaw mechanisms, and their mixing.
These tiny neutrino masses are generated at some high energy scale by the heavy
seesaw fields which then get sequentially decoupled to give an effective
dimension-5 operator. The renormalization group evolution of the masses and the
mixing parameters of the three active neutrinos in the high energy as well as
the low energy effective theory is reviewed in this article.
