We have developed a low-loss, ultra-small radio frequency $(RF)$ metamaterial
operating at $\sim$76 MHz. This miniaturized medium is made up of planar spiral
elements with diameter as small as $\sim$$\lambda$/658 ($\lambda$ is the free
space wavelength), fashioned from Nb thin films on quartz substrates. The
transmission data are examined below and above the superconducting transition
temperature of Nb for both a single spiral and a one dimensional array. The
validity of the design is tested through numerical simulations and good
agreement is found. We discuss how superconductors enable such a compact design
in the $RF$ with high loaded-quality factor (in excess of 5000), which is in
fact difficult to realize with ordinary metals.
