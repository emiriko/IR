The radial thermal expansion (ar) of bundles of single-walled carbon
nanotubes saturated with 4He impurities to the molar concentration 9.4% has
been investigated in the interval 2.5-9.5 K using the dilatometric method. In
the interval 2.1-3.7 K (ar) is negative and is several times higher than the
negative (ar) for pure nanotube bundles. This most likely points to 4He atom
tunneling between different positions in the nanotube bundle system. The excess
expansion was reduced with decreasing 4He concentration.
