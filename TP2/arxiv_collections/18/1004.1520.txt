In the previous paper, we studied the "Toy models for D. H. Lehmer's
conjecture". Namely, we showed that the m-th Fourier coefficient of the
weighted theta series of the $\mathbb{Z}^2$-lattice and the $A_{2}$-lattice
does not vanish, when the shell of norm $m$ of those lattices is not the empty
set. In other words, the spherical 4 (resp. 6)-design does not exist among the
nonempty shells in the $\mathbb{Z}^2$-lattice (resp. $A_{2}$-lattice). This
paper is the sequel to the previous paper. We take 2-dimensional lattices
associated to the algebraic integers of imaginary quadratic fields whose class
number is either 1 or 2, except for $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-1})$ and
$\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3})$, then, show that the $m$-th Fourier coefficient of the
weighted theta series of those lattices does not vanish, when the shell of norm
$m$ of those lattices is not the empty set. Equivalently, we show that the
corresponding spherical 2-design does not exist among the nonempty shells in
those lattices.
