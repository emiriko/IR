A new heuristic method for the evaluation of definite integrals is presented.
This method of brackets has its origin in methods developed for the evaluation
of Feynman diagrams. The operational rules are described and the method is
illustrated with several examples. The method of brackets reduces the
evaluation of a large class of definite integrals to the solution of a linear
system of equations.
