Balmer jump discontinuity of the peculiar star HD 215441 was measured on 14
continuous energy distributions obtained by S. J. Adelman at Kitt Peak National
and Palomar Observatories. The results show that the Balmer jump vary by about
0.05 dex over the cycle of the star. A comparison with new Kurucz model
atmospheres shown that the Balmer jump for the phase 0.5 corresponds to a 14750
K, log(g)=3.0 and for the phase 1.0 corresponds to a 15750 K, log(g)=3.0.
