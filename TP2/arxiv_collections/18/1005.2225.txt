NH3 and CH3OH are key molecules in astrochemical networks leading to the
formation of more complex N- and O-bearing molecules, such as CH3CN and
HCOOCH3. Despite a number of recent studies, little is known about their
abundances in the solid state. (...) In this work, we investigate the ~ 8-10
micron region in the Spitzer IRS (InfraRed Spectrograph) spectra of 41 low-mass
young stellar objects (YSOs). These data are part of a survey of interstellar
ices in a sample of low-mass YSOs studied in earlier papers in this series. We
used both an empirical and a local continuum method to correct for the
contribution from the 10 micron silicate absorption in the recorded spectra. In
addition, we conducted a systematic laboratory study of NH3- and
CH3OH-containing ices to help interpret the astronomical spectra. We clearly
detect a feature at ~9 micron in 24 low-mass YSOs. Within the uncertainty in
continuum determination, we identify this feature with the NH3 nu_2 umbrella
mode, and derive abundances with respect to water between ~2 and 15%.
Simultaneously, we also revisited the case of CH3OH ice by studying the nu_4
C-O stretch mode of this molecule at ~9.7 micron in 16 objects, yielding
abundances consistent with those derived by Boogert et al. 2008 (hereafter
paper I) based on a simultaneous 9.75 and 3.53 micron data analysis. Our study
indicates that NH3 is present primarily in H2O-rich ices, but that in some
cases, such ices are insufficient to explain the observed narrow FWHM. The
laboratory data point to CH3OH being in an almost pure methanol ice, or mixed
mainly with CO or CO2, consistent with its formation through hydrogenation on
grains. Finally, we use our derived NH3 abundances in combination with
previously published abundances of other solid N-bearing species to find that
up to 10-20 % of nitrogen is locked up in known ices.
