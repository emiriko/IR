We present a theory of quantum circuits based on logical qubits encoded in
chirality of electron spin complexes in lateral gated semiconductor triple
quantum dot molecules with one electron spin in each dot. Using microscopic
Hamiltonian we show how to initialize, coherently control and measure the
quantum state of a chirality based coded qubit using static in-plane magnetic
field and voltage tuning of individual dots. The microscopic model of two
interacting coded qubits is established and mapped to an Ising Hamiltonian,
resulting in conditional two-qubit phase gate.
