It is shown that the three-body forces in the $1f_{7/2}$ shell, for which
recently evidence was found on the basis of spectroscopic properties of the Ca
isotopes and $N=28$ isotones, can be most naturally explained as an effective
interaction due to excluded higher-lying shells, in particular the $2p_{3/2}$
orbit.}
