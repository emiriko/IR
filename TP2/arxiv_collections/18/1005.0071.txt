We present a mechanism to produce indistinguishable single-photon pulses on
demand from an optical cavity. The sequences of two laser pulses generate, at
the two Raman transitions of a four-level atom, the same cavity-mode photons
without repumping of the atom between photon generations. Photons are emitted
from the cavity with near-unit efficiency in well-defined temporal modes of
identical shapes controlled by the laser fields. The second order correlation
function reveals the single-photon nature of the proposed source. A realistic
setup for the experimental implementation is presented.
