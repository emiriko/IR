The X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) of Mn in a spin-crossover
compound, [Mn$^{\textrm{III}}$(taa)], was studied in pulsed high magnetic
fields up to 37T. By applying magnetic fields to the low-temperature low-spin
(LS) state, significant changes in the spectra were observed, suggesting a
magnetic-field-induced spin-crossover to the high-spin (HS) state. At low
temperatures, the magnetic field dependence of the changes in the spectra
exhibited hysteresis. Furthermore, when the magnetic field was set to zero, a
considerable remanent component was observed. The energy barrier of the HS
$\to$ LS transition was evaluated from the temperature dependence of the decay
time of the remanent signal. The energy barrier of the transition was found to
be 134K, which is notably lower than that for other spin-crossover compounds
reported previously. Since the fraction of the field-induced HS state was at
most 30% and the thermodynamic macroscopic field-induced phase transition was
expected to occur in fields higher than 55T, the observed field-induced
transition at low temperatures down to 17K could be understood as a localized
microscopic transition at the single-molecular level.
