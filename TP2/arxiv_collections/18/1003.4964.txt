The convention dependence of one-way light speed is explained in a manner
accessible to those unaccustomed to the concept. That logic is used to
challenge the claim by Greaves et al that their experiment detected one-way
light speed. The reason for the result obtained is then presented and followed
by an explanation of why the Romer experiment did not measure a convention
independent one-way light speed.
