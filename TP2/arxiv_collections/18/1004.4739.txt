We study the quantum correlations of the radiation emitted by three level
atoms (cascade type) interacting with two driving fields. In the linear regime,
and in the Weisskopf-Wigner approximation, we show that the atomic and the
two-photon density matrix are equivalent to each other. This facilitates the
tomography of the two mode state to be realized by measurements on either the
atomic system or the emitted fields. While, in general, one needs 4^N
measurements for the tomography of a N photon state, we show that one needs
(N+1)^2-1 observables for the tomography of photons emitted by an atomic
system.
  Thus there is an exponential reduction in the number of observables for the
reconstruction of the class of N photon states emitted by atoms.
  We show that the driving field strengths and detunings provide the {\it
control} parameters for the preparation of a specific target state. Finally, we
study the characterization of entanglement of the two photon state. We observe
that a characterization of entanglement in terms of a single parameter is not
possible when the system is in a mixed state; therefore, we provide a
description in terms of the newly introduced probability distribution for
entanglement, in various regimes of interest.
