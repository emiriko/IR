We advocate the extraterrestrial solar neutrino physics (etSNP) as a means of
investigating solar neutrino physics (SNP). As we already know, the dominant
and subdominant (vacuum) oscillation lengths would be approximately one
kilometer and one hundred kilometers. On the other hand, we know so far that
the matter-enhanced oscillations take place only in the core of the Sun. Thus,
the etSNP, i.e. solar neutrino physics that could be extracted outside the
Earth, would assume a special unique role. The etSNP experiments include (1) a
satellite (detector) around the Earth or around the Jupiter or others (to
provide the shadow, for the matter-enhanced neutrino oscillations), (2) during
the Sun-Venus-Earth eclipse or similar, and (3) the chemical compositions of
the geology type (as in the Jupiter or in the Venus, to study the origins of
these planets). To be specific, we note that the reactions induced by the ^8B
solar neutrinos, in view of the sole high energy nature (E_\nu^{max}=14.03
MeV), would be most interesting in the solar environment. Moreover, the
experiments such as the chemical compositions of the geology type (on the Venus
or Jupiter) and the matter-enhanced oscillations when the Sun-Venus-Earth
eclipse, or the Sun-Mercury-Earth eclipse, may also be interesting.
