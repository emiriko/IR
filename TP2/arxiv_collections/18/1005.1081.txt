The accretion-induced collapse (AIC) of a white dwarf to form a neutron star
can leave behind a rotationally supported disk with mass of up to ~ 0.1 M_sun.
The disk is initially composed of free nucleons but as it accretes and spreads
to larger radii, the free nucleons recombine to form helium, releasing
sufficient energy to unbind the remaining disk. Most of the ejected mass fuses
to form Ni56 and other iron group elements. We present spherically symmetric
radiative transfer calculations of the transient powered by the radioactive
heating of this ejecta. For an ejecta mass of 1e-2 M_sun (3e-3 M_sun), the
lightcurve peaks after <~ 1 day with a peak bolometric luminosity ~ 2e41 erg/s
(~ 5e40 erg/s), i.e., a "kilonova"; the decay time is ~ 4 (2) days. Overall,
the spectra redden with time reaching U-V ~ 4 after ~ 1 day; the optical colors
(B-V) are, however, somewhat blue. Near the peak in the lightcurve, the spectra
are dominated by Doppler broadened Nickel features, with no distinct spectral
lines present. At ~ 3-5 days, strong Calcium lines are present in the infrared,
although the Calcium mass fraction is only ~ 1e-4.5. If rotationally supported
disks are a common byproduct of AIC, current and upcoming transient surveys
such as the Palomar Transient Factory should detect a few AIC per year for an
AIC rate of ~ 1e-2 of the Type Ia rate. We discuss ways of distinguishing AIC
from other rapid, faint transients, including .Ia's and the ejecta from binary
neutron star mergers.
