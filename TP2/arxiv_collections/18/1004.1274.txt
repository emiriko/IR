Properties of quantum states have disclosed new technologies, ranging from
quantum information to quantum metrology. Among them a recent research field is
quantum imaging, addressed to overcome limits of classical imaging by
exploiting spatial properties of quantum states of light . In particular
quantum correlations between twin beams represent a fundamental resource for
these studies. One of the most interesting proposed scheme exploits spatial
quantum correlations between parametric down conversion light beams for
realizing sub-shot-noise imaging of the weak absorbing objects, leading ideally
to a noise-free imaging. Here we present the first experimental realisation of
this scheme, showing its capability to reach a larger signal to noise ratio
(SNR) with respect to classical imaging methods. This work represents the
starting point of this quantum technology that can have relevant applications,
especially whenever there is a need of a low photon flux illumination (e.g. as
with certain biological samples).
