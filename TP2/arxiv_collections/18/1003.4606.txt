In this follow-up to our recent Letter [F. Otto et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 104,
027005 (2010)], we present a more detailed account of the superconducting
transversal flux transformer effect (TFTE) in amorphous (a-)NbGe nanostructures
in the regime of strong nonequilibrium in local vortex motion. Emphasis is put
on the relation between the TFTE and local vortex dynamics, as the former turns
out to be a reliable tool for determining the microscopic mechanisms behind the
latter. By this method, a progression from electron heating at low temperatures
T to the Larkin-Ovchinnikov effect close to the transition temperature Tc is
traced over a range 0.26 < T/Tc < 0.95. This is represented by a number of
relevant parameters such as the vortex transport entropy related to the
Nernst-like effect at low T, and a nonequilibrium magnetization enhancement
close to Tc. At intermediate T, the Larkin-Ovchinnikov effect is at high
currents modified by electron heating, which is clearly observed only in the
TFTE.
