Taking into account the energy dissipation in the spin-flop phase transition
induced by magnetic field in an antiferromagnet with uni-axial anisotropy, the
following peculiarities of precessing ball solitons (PBS) are considered: a)
the states of equilibrium precessing solitons arising in the initial phase
during the phase transition; b) the states of "overcritical PBS" existing
outside the region of metastability. The "overcritical" PBS may originate
during disintegration of the initial phase.
