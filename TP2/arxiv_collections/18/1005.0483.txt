The multivariate central limit theorems (CLT) for the volumes of excursion
sets of stationary quasi-associated random fields on $\mathbb{R}^d$ are proved.
Special attention is paid to Gaussian and shot noise fields. Formulae for the
covariance matrix of the limiting distribution are provided. A statistical
version of the CLT is considered as well. Some numerical results are also
discussed.
