The results of a macro-scale experimental study performed on a hardened class
G cement paste [Ghabezloo et al. (2008) Cem. Con. Res. (38) 1424-1437] are used
in association with the micromechanics modelling and homogenization technique
for evaluation of the complete set of poroelastic parameters of the material.
The experimental study consisted in drained, undrained and unjacketed isotropic
compression tests. Analysis of the experimental results revealed that the
active porosity of the studied cement paste is smaller than its total porosity.
A multi-scale homogenization model, calibrated on the experimental results, is
used to extrapolate the poroelastic parameters to cement pastes prepared with
different water-to-cement ratio. The notion of cement paste active porosity is
discussed and the poroelastic parameters of hardened cement paste for an ideal,
perfectly drained condition are evaluated using the homogenization model.
