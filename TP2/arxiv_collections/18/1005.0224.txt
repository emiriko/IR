Multidimensional databases support efficiently on-line analytical processing
(OLAP). In this paper, we depict a model dedicated to multidimensional
databases. The approach we present designs decisional information through a
constellation of facts and dimensions. Each dimension is possibly shared
between several facts and it is organised according to multiple hierarchies. In
addition, we define a comprehensive query algebra regrouping the more popular
multidimensional operations in current commercial systems and research
approaches. We introduce new operators dedicated to a constellation. Finally,
we describe a prototype that allows managers to query constellations of facts,
dimensions and multiple hierarchies.
