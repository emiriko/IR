In this article, we calculate the branching ratios of $B \to K_0^*(1430) K$
decays by employing the perturbative QCD (pQCD) approach at leading order. We
perform the evaluations in the two scenarios for the scalar meson spectrum. We
find that (a) the leading order pQCD predictions for the branching ratio
$Br(B^+ \to K^+ \bar{K_0^*}(1430)^0)$ which is in good agreement with the
experimental upper limit in both scenarios, while the pQCD predictions for
other considered $B \to K_0^*(1430) K$ decay modes are also presented and will
be tested by the LHC experiments; (b) the annihilation contributions play an
important role in these considered decays, for $B^0 \to {K_0^*}(1430)^\pm
{K}^\mp$ decays, for example, which are found to be $(1-4) \times 10^{-6}$.
