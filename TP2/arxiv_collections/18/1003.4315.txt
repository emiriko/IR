Motivated by the recent discovery of massive planets on wide orbits, we
present a mechanism for the formation of such planets via disk fragmentation in
the embedded phase of star formation. In this phase, the forming disk
intensively accretes matter from the natal cloud core and undergoes several
fragmentation episodes. However, most fragments are either destroyed or driven
into the innermost regions (and probably onto the star) due to angular momentum
exchange with spiral arms, leading to multiple FU-Ori-like bursts and disk
expansion. Fragments that are sufficiently massive and form in the late
embedded phase (when the disk conditions are less extreme) may open a gap and
evolve into giant planets on typical orbits of several tens to several hundreds
of AU. For this mechanism to work, the natal cloud core must have sufficient
mass and angular momentum to trigger the burst mode and also form extended
disks of the order of several hundreds of AU. When mass loading from the natal
cloud core diminishes and the main fragmentation phase ends, such extended
disks undergo a transient episode of contraction and density increase, during
which they may give birth to a last and survivable set of giant planets on wide
and relatively stable orbits.
