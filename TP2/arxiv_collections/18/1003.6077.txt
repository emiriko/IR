We have developed a one-dimensional thermochemical kinetics and diffusion
model for Jupiter's atmosphere that accurately describes the transition from
the thermochemical regime in the deep troposphere (where chemical equilibrium
is established) to the quenched regime in the upper troposphere (where chemical
equilibrium is disrupted). The model is used to calculate chemical abundances
of tropospheric constituents and to identify important chemical pathways for
CO-CH4 interconversion in hydrogen-dominated atmospheres. In particular, the
observed mole fraction and chemical behavior of CO is used to indirectly
constrain the Jovian water inventory. Our model can reproduce the observed
tropospheric CO abundance provided that the water mole fraction lies in the
range (0.25-6.0) x 10^-3 in Jupiter's deep troposphere, corresponding to an
enrichment of 0.3 to 7.3 times the protosolar abundance (assumed to be H2O/H2 =
9.61 x 10^-4). Our results suggest that Jupiter's oxygen enrichment is roughly
similar to that for carbon, nitrogen, and other heavy elements, and we conclude
that formation scenarios that require very large (>8 times solar) enrichments
in water can be ruled out. We also evaluate and refine the simple time-constant
arguments currently used to predict the quenched CO abundance on Jupiter, other
giant planets, and brown dwarfs.
