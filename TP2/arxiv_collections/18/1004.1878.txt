We developed an Inverse Photometric method (IPM) to determine global physical
parameters of RR Lyrae stars exclusively from multicolor light curves (S\'odor,
Jurcsik & Szeidl, 2009, MNRAS, 394, 261). We showed that for good quality
photometric observations of unmodulated RRab stars, the IPM gives similarly
good results as direct Baade-Wesselink analyses do, but without the need for
spectroscopic measurements. In the course of the development, we payed special
attention to the applicability of the IPM for modulated RR Lyrae stars. Since
there is no simultaneous spectroscopic radial velocity and photometric
observations of any Blazhko star with good phase coverage both in pulsation and
modulation, which would allow spectroscopic Baade-Wesselink analysis, the IPM
is the only possibility today to study changes in the global physical
parameters of Blazhko RR Lyrae stars during the modulation cycle. With the IPM,
we have studied the extensive multicolor light curves of 4 Blazhko RRab stars
we observed with the 24-inch telescope of the Konkoly Observatory during the
past 5 years in the frame of the Konkoly Blazhko Survey. Small but unambiguous
changes in the pulsation-averaged mean temperature, mean radius and mean
luminosity have been detected in each star. Results on these Blazhko stars (SS
Cnc, DM Cyg, RR Gem, and MW Lyr) are shown in this paper.
