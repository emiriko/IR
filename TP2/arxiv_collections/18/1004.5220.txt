We performed the multipole decomposition analysis (MDA) for the ${}^{208}{\rm
Pb}(p,n)$ data in order to obtain the spin-dipole (SD) strengths separated into
each $\Delta J^{\pi}$ contribution $dB({\rm SD}_{\Delta
J^{\pi}};\omega)/d\omega$.
  The random phase approximation (RPA calculations reproduce the total SD
strength reasonably well, whereas some discrepancies are found for separated SD
strength.
  The centroids of the resonances are slightly lower and higher than the
theoretical predictions for $1^-$ and $2^-$, respectively.
  These softening and hardening effects observed in $1^-$ and $2^-$
distributions would be due to the tensor correlation effects not included in
the present RPA calculations.
