In this paper, we study some cohomology groups and quadratic twists of
elliptic curves, and apply Tate local duality and the results of Kramer-Tunnell
on local norm cokernel to give a refined version of Yu's formula in the case of
elliptic curves. Then, by using this refinement formula, we obtain explicit
orders of Shafarevich-Tate groups of some elliptic curves in quadratic number
fields, including a few unconditional cases.
