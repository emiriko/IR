Using Langevin dynamics simulations in three dimensions (3D), we investigate
the dynamics of polymer translocation into the regions between two parallel
plane walls with separation $R$ under a driving force $F$, respectively.
Compared with an unconfined environment, the translocation dynamics is greatly
changed due to the crowding effect of the partially translocated monomers.
Translocation time $\tau$ initially decreases rapidly with increasing $R$ and
then saturates for larger $R$, and the confined environment leads to a
nonuniversal dependence of $\tau$ on $F$.
