We consider a system of black holes -- a simplest substitute of a system of
point particles in the mechanics of general relativity -- and try to describe
their motion with the help of entropic action: a sum of the areas of black hole
horizons. We demonstrate that such description is indeed consistent with the
Newton's laws of motion and gravity, modulo numerical coefficients, which
coincide but seem different from unity. Since a large part of the modern
discussion of entropic reformulation of general relativity is actually based on
dimensional considerations, for making a next step it is crucially important to
modify the argument, so that these dimensionless parameters acquire correct
values.
