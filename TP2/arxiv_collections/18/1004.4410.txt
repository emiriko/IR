Momentum dependence of quantum corrections with higher-dimensional Lorentz
violation is examined in electrodynamics on orbifolds. It is shown that effects
of the Lorentz violation are not decoupled at high energy scales. Despite the
loss of the higher-dimensional Lorentz invariance, a higher-dimensional Ward
identity is found to be fulfilled for one-loop vacuum polarization. This
implies that gauge invariance may be prior to Lorentz invariance as a guiding
principle in higher-dimensional field theory. As a universal application of
electrodynamics, an extra-dimensional aspect for Furry's theorem is emphasized.
