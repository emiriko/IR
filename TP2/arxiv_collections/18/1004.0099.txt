The Tri-bimaximal (TBM) mixing is not accidental if structures of the
corresponding leptonic mass matrices follow immediately from certain (residual
or broken) flavor symmetry. We develop a simple formalism which allows one to
analyze effects of deviations of the lepton mixing from TBM on structure of the
neutrino mass matrix and on underlying flavor symmetry. We show that possible
deviations from the TBM mixing can lead to strong modifications of the mass
matrix and strong violation of the TBM mass relations. As a result, the mass
matrix may have an "anarchical" structure with random values of elements or it
may have some symmetry which differs from the TBM symmetry. Interesting
examples include matrices with texture zeros, matrices with certain "flavor
alignment" as well as hierarchical matrices with a two-component structure,
where the dominant and sub-dominant contributions have different symmetries.
This opens up new approaches to understand the lepton mixing.
