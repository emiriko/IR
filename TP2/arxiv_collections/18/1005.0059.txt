The SciBooNE Collaboration reports a measurement of neutral current coherent
neutral pion production on carbon by a muon neutrino beam with average energy
0.8 GeV. The separation of coherent from inclusive neutral pion production has
been improved by detecting recoil protons from resonant neutral pion
production. We measure the ratio of the neutral current coherent neutral pion
production to total charged current cross sections to be (1.16 +/- 0.24) x
10-2. The ratio of charged current coherent pion to neutral current coherent
pion production is calculated to be 0.14+0.30 -0.28, using our published
charged current coherent pion measurement.
