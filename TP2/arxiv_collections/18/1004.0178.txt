A strategy for the systematic design of polymeric superlattices with
tailor-made mini-bandgaps and carrier mini-effective masses is described and
computationally implemented by means of an envelope crystalline-orbital method,
which is a straightforward adaptation for molecules of the envelope-function
approximation widely used in solid-state physics. Such strategy relies on the
construction of pi-conjugated periodic block copolymers from well-characterized
parent polymers, in such a way that the above-mentioned electronic parameters
can be predicted from the lengths of the blocks. Illustrative calculations for
prototypical (PPP_x-PDA_y)_n superlattices demonstrate the plausibility of the
strategy and the advantages of the computational implementation employed.
