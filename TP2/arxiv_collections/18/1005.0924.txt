We give an estimation of the masses of light dark matter particle and dark
energy quasiparticle which can be extracted from the astrophysical data about
the contributions of baryon, dark matter, and dark energy densities to the
total matter-energy density budget in our universe. We use the quantum
cosmological model in which dark energy is a condensate of quantum oscillations
of primordial scalar field. The dark energy quasiparticle with the mass ~ 15
GeV is consistent with the 7-year WMAP and other data. The quasiparticles can
decay with violation of CP-invariance into baryons, leptons, and dark matter.
The WIMP mass ~ 5 GeV corresponds to observed values of baryon and dark matter
energy densities. Such a mass agrees with the observations of CoGeNT, DAMA, and
CDMS. Quasiparticles of dark energy can be registered as a constant background
of radiation with the frequency ~ 3.64 x 10^{24} 1/s. Dark matter particles
must exhibit themselves in the form of signals with the frequency ~ 1.21 x
10^{24} 1/s of radiation from galaxy clusters where the intensive gravitational
fields produced by dark matter exist.
