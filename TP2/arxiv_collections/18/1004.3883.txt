The rate of vacuum changing topological solutions of the gluon field,
sphalerons, is estimated to be large at the typical temperatures of heavy-ion
collisions, particularly at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. Such windings
in the gluon field are expected to produce parity-odd bubbles, which cause
separation of positively and negatively charged quarks along the axis of the
external magnetic field. This chiral magnetic effect can be mimicked by
Chern-Simons modified electromagnetism. Here we present a model of relativistic
hydrodynamics including the effects of axial anomalies via the Chern-Simons
term.
