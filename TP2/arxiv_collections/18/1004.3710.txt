This work deals with the presence of topological defects in k-field models,
where the dynamics is generalized to include higher order power in the kinetic
term. We investigate kinks in (1,1) dimensions and vortices in (2,1)
dimensions, focusing on some specific features of the solutions. In particular,
we show how the kinks and vortices change to compactlike solutions, controlled
by the parameter used to introduce the generalized models.
