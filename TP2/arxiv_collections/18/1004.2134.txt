This book encompasses both traditional and modern methods treating partial
differential equation (PDE) of first order and second order. There is a balance
in making a selfcontained mathematical text and introducing new subjects. The
Lie algebras of vector fields and their algebraic-geometric representations are
involved in solving overdetermined of PDE and getting integral representation
of stochastic differential equations (SDE). It is addressing to all scientists
using PDE in treating mathematical methods.
