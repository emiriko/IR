We present high-resolution 345 GHz interferometric observations of two
extreme luminous (L_{IR}>10^{13} L_sun), submillimetre-selected galaxies (SMGs)
in the COSMOS field with the Submillimeter Array (SMA). Both targets were
previously detected as unresolved point-sources by the SMA in its compact
configuration, also at 345 GHz. These new data, which provide a factor of ~3
improvement in resolution, allow us to measure the physical scale of the
far-infrared in the submillimetre directly. The visibility functions of both
targets show significant evidence for structure on 0.5-1 arcsec scales, which
at z=1.5 translates into a physical scale of 5-8 kpc. Our results are
consistent with the angular and physical scales of two comparably luminous
objects with high-resolution SMA followup, as well as radio continuum and CO
sizes. These relatively compact sizes (<5-10 kpc) argue strongly for
merger-driven starbursts, rather than extended gas-rich disks, as the preferred
channel for forming SMGs. For the most luminous objects, the derived sizes may
also have important physical consequences; under a series of simplifying
assumptions, we find that these two objects in particular are forming stars
close to or at the Eddington limit for a starburst.
