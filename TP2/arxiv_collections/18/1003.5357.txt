We construct a new gravitational action which includes cubic curvature
interactions and which provides a useful toy model for the holographic study of
a three parameter family of four- and higher-dimensional CFT's. We also
investigate the black hole solutions of this new gravity theory. Further we
examine the equations of motion of quasi-topological gravity. While the full
equations in a general background are fourth-order in derivatives, we show that
the linearized equations describing gravitons propagating in the AdS vacua
match precisely the second-order equations of Einstein gravity.
