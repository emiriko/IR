The unavoidable presence of noise is thought to be one of the major problems
to solve in order to pave the way for implementing quantum information
technologies in realistic physical platforms. However, here we show a clear
example in which noise, in terms of dephasing, may enhance the capability of
transmitting not only classical but also quantum information, encoded in
quantum systems, through communication networks. In particular, we find
analytically and numerically the quantum and classical capacities for a large
family of quantum channels and show that these information transmission rates
can be strongly enhanced by introducing dephasing noise in the complex network
dynamics.
