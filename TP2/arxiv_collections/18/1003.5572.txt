In multicellular organisms, patterns of gene expression are established in
response to gradients of signaling molecules. During fly development in early
Drosophila embryos, the Bicoid (Bcd) morphogen gradient is established within
the first hour after fertilization. Bcd acts as a transcription factor,
initiating the expression of a cascade of genes that determine the segmentation
pattern of the embryo, which serves as a blueprint for the future adult
organism. A robust understanding of the mechanisms that govern this
segmentation cascade is still lacking, and a new generation of quantitative
measurements of the spatio-temporal concentration dynamics of the individual
players of this cascade are necessary for further progress. Here we describe a
series of methods that are meant to represent a start of such a quantification
using Bcd as an example. We describe the generation of a transgenic fly line
expressing a Bcd-eGFP fusion protein, and we use this line to carefully analyze
the Bcd concentration dynamics and to measure absolute Bcd expression levels in
living fly embryos using two-photon microscopy. These experiments have proven
to be a fruitful tool generating new insights into the mechanisms that lead to
the establishment and the readout of the Bcd gradient. Generalization of these
methods to other genes in the Drosophila segmentation cascade is
straightforward and should further our understanding of the early patterning
processes and the architecture of the underlying genetic network structure.
