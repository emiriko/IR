We demonstrate that the valence energy-loss function of hexagonal boron
nitride (hBN) displays a strong anisotropy in shape, excitation energy and
dispersion for momentum transfer q parallel or perpendicular to the hBN layers.
This is manifested by e.g. an energy shift of 0.7 eV that cannot be captured by
single-particle approaches and is a demonstration of a strong anisotropy in the
two-body electron-hole interaction. Furthermore, for in-plane directions of q
we observe a splitting of the -plasmon in the M direction that is absent in the
K direction and this can be traced back to band-structure effects.
