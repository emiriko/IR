In order to test the Vibration-Transit (V-T) theory of liquid dynamics, ab
initio density functional theory (DFT) calculations of thermodynamic properties
of Na and Cu are performed and compared with experimental data. The
calculations are done for the crystal at T = 0 and T_m, and for the liquid at
T_m. The key theoretical quantities for crystal and liquid are the structural
potential and the dynamical matrix, both as function of volume. The theoretical
equations are presented, as well as details of the DFT computations. The
properties compared with experiment are the equilibrium volume, the isothermal
bulk modulus, the internal energy and the entropy. The agreement of theory with
experiment is uniformly good. Our primary conclusion is that the application of
DFT to V-T theory is feasible, and the resulting liquid calculations achieve
the same level of accuracy as does ab initio lattice dynamics for crystals.
Moreover, given the well established reliability of DFT, the present results
provide a significant confirmation of V-T theory itself.
