Recently, several papers have appeared that examine the process of capturing
dark-matter particles from the Galactic halo to orbits bound to the Solar
System. The authors of these papers predict large enhancements to the local
dark-matter density via gravitational three-body interactions with planets.
However, these conclusions are wrong; these papers do not include the inverse
process to capture, namely the ejection of dark-matter particles by three-body
gravitational encounters. We emphasize previous work that shows that by
including both capture and ejection of dark matter from the Solar System, the
density of dark matter bound to the Solar System is small compared to the local
Galactic dark-matter density.
