The main goal of this work is to propose the design of secret sharing schemes
based on hard-on-average problems. It includes the description of a new
multiparty protocol whose main application is key management in networks. Its
unconditionally perfect security relies on a discrete mathematics problem
classiffied as DistNP-Complete under the average-case analysis, the so-called
Distributional Matrix Representability Problem. Thanks to the use of the search
version of the mentioned decision problem, the security of the proposed scheme
is guaranteed. Although several secret sharing schemes connected with
combinatorial structures may be found in the bibliography, the main
contribution of this work is the proposal of a new secret sharing scheme based
on a hard-on-average problem, which allows to enlarge the set of tools for
designing more secure cryptographic applications.
