The German / British gravitational wave detector GEO 600 is in the process of
being upgraded. The upgrading process of GEO 600, called GEO-HF, will
concentrate on the improvement of the sensitivity for high frequency signals
and the demonstration of advanced technologies. In the years 2009 to 2011 the
detector will undergo a series of upgrade steps, which are described in this
paper.
