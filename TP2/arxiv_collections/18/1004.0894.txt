We study the different dynamical regimes of a vortex lattice driven by AC
forces in the presence of random pinning via numerical simulations. The
behaviour of the different observables is charaterized as a function of the
applied force amplitude for different frequencies. We discuss the
inconveniences of using the mean velocity to identify the depinnig transition
and we show that instead, the mean quadratic displacement of the lattice is the
relevant magnitude to characterize different AC regimes. We discuss how the
results depend on the initial configuration and we identify new hysteretic
effects which are absent in the DC driven systems.
