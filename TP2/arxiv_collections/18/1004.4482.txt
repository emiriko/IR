The ngdp framework advanced topics are described. Namely we consider work
with CAMAC hardware, "selfflow" nodes for the data acquisition systems with the
As-Soon-As-Possible policy, ng_mm(4) as alternative to ng_socket(4), the
control subsystem, user context utilities, events representation for the ROOT
package, test and debug nodes, possible advancements for netgraph(4), etc. It
is shown that the {\itshape ngdp} is suitable for building lightweight DAQ
systems to handle CAMAC. The investigation has been performed at the Veksler
and Baldin Laboratory of High Energy Physics, JINR.
