We consider large-scale collective motion of flat edge-on spiral galaxies
from the Revised Flat Galaxy Catalogue (RFGC) taking into account the curvature
of space-time in the Local Universe at the scale 100 Mpc/h. We analyse how the
relativistic model of collective motion should be modified to provide the best
possible values of parameters, the effects that impact these parameters and
ways to mitigate them. Evolution of galactic diameters, selection effects, and
difference between isophotal and angular diameter distances are inadequate to
explain this impact. At the same time, measurement error in HI line widths and
angular diameters can easily provide such an impact. This is illustrated in a
toy model, which allows analytical consideration, and then in the full model
using Monte Carlo simulations. The resulting velocity field is very close to
that provided by the non-relativistic model of motion. The obtained bulk flow
velocity is consistent with {\Lambda}CDM cosmology.
