In this paper, we study the complexity of computing locally optimal solutions
for weighted versions of standard set problems such as SetCover, SetPacking,
and many more. For our investigation, we use the framework of PLS, as defined
in Johnson et al., [JPY88]. We show that for most of these problems, computing
a locally optimal solution is already PLS-complete for a simple neighborhood of
size one. For the local search versions of weighted SetPacking and SetCover, we
derive tight bounds for a simple neighborhood of size two. To the best of our
knowledge, these are one of the very few PLS results about local search for
weighted standard set problems.
