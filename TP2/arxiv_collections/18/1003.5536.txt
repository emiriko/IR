We consider the problem of estimating filamentary structure from planar point
process data. We make some connections with computational geometry and we
develop nonparametric methods for estimating the filaments. We show that, under
weak conditions, the filaments have a simple geometric representation as the
medial axis of the data distribution's support. Our methods convert an
estimator of the support's boundary into an estimator of the filaments. We also
find the rates of convergence of our estimators.
