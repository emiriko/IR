A space for gauge theories is defined, using projective limits as subsets of
Cartesian products of homomorphisms from a lattice on the structure group. In
this space, non-interacting and interacting measures are defined as well as
functions and operators. From projective limits of test functions and
distributions on products of compact groups, a projective gauge triplet is
obtained, which provides a framework for the infinite-dimensional calculus in
gauge theories. The gauge measure behavior on nongeneric strata is also
obtained.
