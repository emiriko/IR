The dimensional reduction, in a form of transition from four to two
dimensions, was used in the 90s in a context of HE Regge scattering. Recently,
it got a new impetus in quantum gravity where it opens the way to
renormalizability and finite short-distance behavior. We consider a QFT model
$g\,\varphi^4\,$ with running coupling defined in both the two domains of
different dimensionality; the $\gbar(Q^2)\,$ evolutions being duly conjugated
at the reduction scale $\,Q\sim M.$ Beyond this scale, in the deep UV 2-dim
region, the running coupling does not increase any more. Instead, it {\it
slightly decreases} and tends to a finite value $\gbar_2(\infty) \,< \,
\gbar_2(M^2)\,$ from above. As a result, the global evolution picture looks
quite peculiar and can propose a base for the modified scenario of gauge
couplings behavior with UV fixed points provided by dimensional reduction
instead of leptoquarks.
