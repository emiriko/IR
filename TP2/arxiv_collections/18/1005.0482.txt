The discrete-time Toda equation arises as a universal equation for the
relevant Hankel determinants associated with one-variable orthogonal
polynomials through the mechanism of adjacency, which amounts to the inclusion
of shifted weight functions in the orthogonality condition. In this paper we
extend this mechanism to a new class of two-variable orthogonal polynomials
where the variables are related via an elliptic curve. This leads to a `Higher
order Analogue of the Discrete-time Toda' (HADT) equation for the associated
Hankel determinants, together with its Lax pair, which is derived from the
relevant recurrence relations for the orthogonal polynomials. In a similar way
as the quotient-difference (QD) algorithm is related to the discrete-time Toda
equation, a novel quotient-quotient-difference (QQD) scheme is presented for
the HADT equation. We show that for both the HADT equation and the QQD scheme,
there exists well-posed $s$-periodic initial value problems, for almost all
$\s\in\Z^2$. From the Lax-pairs we furthermore derive invariants for
corresponding reductions to dynamical mappings for some explicit examples.
