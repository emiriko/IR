Assessing gameplay experience for gaze interaction games is a challenging
task. For this study, a gaze interaction Half-Life 2 game modification was
created that allowed eye tracking control. The mod was deployed during an
experiment at Dreamhack 2007, where participants had to play with gaze
navigation and afterwards rate their gameplay experience. The results show low
tension and negative affects scores on the gameplay experience questionnaire as
well as high positive challenge, immersion and flow ratings. The correlation
between spatial presence and immersion for gaze interaction was high and yields
further investigation. It is concluded that gameplay experience can be
correctly assessed with the methodology presented in this paper.
