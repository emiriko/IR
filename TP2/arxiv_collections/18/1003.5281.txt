The distribution of the lifetime of Chinese dynasties (as well as that of the
British Isles and Japan) in a linear Zipf plot is found to consist of two
straight lines intersecting at a transition point. This two-section
piecewise-linear distribution is different from the power law or the stretched
exponent distribution, and is called the Bilinear Effect for short. With
assumptions mimicking the organization of ancient Chinese regimes, a 3-layer
network model is constructed. Numerical results of this model show the bilinear
effect, providing a plausible explanation of the historical data. Bilinear
effect in two other social systems is presented, indicating that such a
piecewise-linear effect is widespread in social systems.
