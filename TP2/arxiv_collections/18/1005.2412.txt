We present colour-colour diagrams of detected sources in the Herschel-ATLAS
Science Demonstration Field from 100 to 500 microns using both PACS and SPIRE.
We fit isothermal modified black bodies to the spectral energy distribution
(SED) to extract the dust temperature of sources with counterparts in Galaxy
And Mass Assembly (GAMA) or SDSS surveys with either a spectroscopic or a
photometric redshift. For a subsample of 330 sources detected in at least three
FIR bands with a significance greater than 3 $\sigma$, we find an average dust
temperature of $(28 \pm 8)$K. For sources with no known redshift, we populate
the colour-colour diagram with a large number of SEDs generated with a broad
range of dust temperatures and emissivity parameters, and compare to colours of
observed sources to establish the redshift distribution of this sample. For
another subsample of 1686 sources with fluxes above 35 mJy at 350 microns and
detected at 250 and 500 microns with a significance greater than 3$\sigma$, we
find an average redshift of $2.2 \pm 0.6$.
