We present an implementaion of interface between the full-potential
linearized augmented plane wave package Wien2k and the wannier90 code for the
construction of maximally localized Wannier functions. The FORTRAN code and a
documentation is made available and results are discussed for SrVO$_3$,
Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ (including spin-orbit coupling), LaFeAsO, and FeSb$_2$.
