A model of jet precession driven by a neutrino-cooled disc around a spinning
black hole is present in order to explain the temporal structure and spectral
evolution of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). The differential rotation of the outer
part of a neutrino dominated accretion disc may result in precession of the
inner part of the disc and the central black hole, hence drives a precessed jet
via neutrino annihilation around the inner part of the disc. Both analytic and
numeric results for our model are present. Our calculations show that a black
hole-accretion disk system with black hole mass $M \simeq 3.66 M_\odot$,
accretion rate $\dot{M} \simeq 0.54 M_\odot \rm s^{-1}$, spin parameter $a=0.9$
and viscosity parameter $\alpha=0.01$ may drive a precessed jet with period P=1
s and luminosity $L=10^{51}$ erg s$^{-1}$, corresponding to the scenario for
long GRBs. A precessed jet with $P=0.1$s and $L=10^{50}$ erg s$^{-1}$ may be
powered by a system with $M \simeq 5.59 M_\odot$, $\dot{M} \simeq 0.74 M_\odot
\rm s^{-1}$, $a=0.1$, and $\alpha=0.01$, possibly being responsible for the
short GRBs. Both the temporal and spectral evolution in GRB pulse may explained
with our model. GRB central engines likely power a precessed jet driven by a
neutrino-cooled disc. The global GRB lightcurves thus could be modulated by the
jet precession during the accretion timescale of the GRB central engine. Both
the temporal and spectral evolution in GRB pulse may be due to an viewing
effect due to the jet precession.
