We investigate the role of surface plasmons in the electromagnetic Casimir
effect at finite temperature, including situations out of global thermal
equilibrium. The free energy is calculated analytically and expanded for
different regimes of distances and temperatures. Similar to the
zero-temperature case, the interaction changes from attraction to repulsion
with distance. Thermal effects are shown to be negligible for small plate
separations and at room temperature, but become dominant and repulsive at large
values of these parameters. In configurations out of global thermal
equilibrium, we show that the selective excitation of surface plasmons can
create a repulsive Casimir force between metal plates.
