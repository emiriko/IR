Let g:{\mathbb R} --> {\mathbb C} be a C^{\infty}-function with all
derivatives bounded and let tr_n denote the normalized trace on the n x n
matrices. In the paper [EM] Ercolani and McLaughlin established asymptotic
expansions of the mean value E{tr_n(g(X_n))} for a rather general class of
random matrices X_n,including the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE). Using an
analytical approach, we provide in the present paper an alternative proof of
this asymptotic expansion in the GUE case. Specifically we derive for a GUE
random matrix X_n that
  E{tr_n(g(X_n))}= \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-2}^2 g(x)\sqrt{4-x^2} dx
+\sum_{j=1}^k\frac{\alpha_j(g)}{n^{2j}}+ O(n^{-2k-2}),
  where k is an arbitrary positive integer. Considered as mappings of g, we
determine the coefficients \alpha_j(g), j\in{\mathbb N}, as distributions (in
the sense of L. Schwarts). We derive a similar asymptotic expansion for the
covariance Cov{Tr_n[f(X_n)],Tr_n[g(X_n)]}, where f is a function of the same
kind as g, and Tr_n=n tr_n. Special focus is drawn to the case where
g(x)=1/(z-x) and f(x)=1/(w-x) for non-real complex numbers z and w. In this
case the mean and covariance considered above correspond to, respectively, the
one- and two-dimensional Cauchy (or Stieltjes) transform of the GUE(n,1/n).
