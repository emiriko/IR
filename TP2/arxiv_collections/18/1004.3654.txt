We consider an interacting system of massless scalar and electromagnetic
field, with the Lagrangian explicitly depending on the electromagnetic
potentials, i.e., interaction with broken gauge invariance. The Lagrangian for
interaction is chosen in such a way that the electromagnetic field equation
acquires an additional term, which in some cases is proportional to the vector
potential of the electromagnetic field. This equation can be interpreted as the
equation of motion of photon with induced nonzero rest-mass. This system of
interacting fields is considered within the scope of Bianchi type-I (BI)
cosmological model. It is shown that, as a result of interaction the
electromagnetic field vanishes at $t \to \infty$ and the isotropization process
of the expansion takes place.
