The classical dynamical model for reactions induced by weakly-bound nuclei at
near-barrier energies is developed further. It allows a quantitative study of
the role and importance of incomplete fusion dynamics in asymptotic
observables, such as the population of high-spin states in reaction products as
well as the angular distribution of direct alpha-production. Model calculations
indicate that incomplete fusion is an effective mechanism for populating
high-spin states, and its contribution to the direct alpha production yield
diminishes with decreasing energy towards the Coulomb barrier. It also becomes
notably separated in angles from the contribution of no-capture breakup events.
This should facilitate the experimental disentanglement of these competing
reaction processes.
