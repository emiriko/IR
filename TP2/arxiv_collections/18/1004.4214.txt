We present new measurements of dark matter distributions in 25 X-ray luminous
clusters by making a full use of the two-dimensional (2D) weak lensing signals
obtained from high-quality Subaru/Suprime-Cam imaging data. Our approach to
directly compare the measured lensing shear pattern with elliptical model
predictions allows us to extract new information on the mass distributions of
individual clusters, such as the halo ellipticity and mass centroid. We find
that these parameters on the cluster shape are little degenerate with cluster
mass and concentration parameters. By combining the 2D fitting results for a
subsample of 18 clusters, the elliptical shape of dark matter haloes is
detected at 7\sigma significance level. The mean ellipticity is found to be e =
0.46 \pm 0.04 (1\sigma), which is in excellent agreement with the standard
collisionless CDM model prediction. The mass centroid can be constrained with a
typical accuracy of ~20" (~50 kpc/h) in radius for each cluster with some
significant outliers, enabling to assess one of the most important systematic
errors inherent in the stacked cluster weak lensing technique, the mass
centroid uncertainty. In addition, the shape of the dark mass distribution is
found to be only weakly correlated with that of the member galaxy distribution.
We carefully examine possible sources of systematic errors in our measurements,
finding none of them to be significant. Our results demonstrate the power of
high-quality imaging data for exploring the detailed spatial distribution of
dark matter (Abridged).
