We present a calculation of the pi^- d scattering length with an accuracy of
a few percent using chiral perturbation theory. For the first time
isospin-violating corrections are included consistently. Using data on pionic
deuterium and pionic hydrogen atoms, we extract the isoscalar and isovector
pion-nucleon scattering lengths and obtain a^+=(7.6 +/- 3.1) x 10^{-3} mpi^{-1}
and a^-=(86.1 +/- 0.9) x 10^{-3} mpi^{-1}. Via the Goldberger-Miyazawa-Oehme
sum rule, this leads to a charged-pion-nucleon coupling constant g_c^2/4 pi =
13.69 +/- 0.20.
