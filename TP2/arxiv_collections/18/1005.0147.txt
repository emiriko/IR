We develop a space-time large-deviation point of view on Gibbs-non-Gibbs
transitions in spin systems subject to a stochastic spin-flip dynamics. Using
the general theory for large deviations of functionals of Markov processes
outlined in Feng and Kurtz [11], we show that the trajectory under the
spin-flip dynamics of the empirical measure of the spins in a large block in
Z^d satisfies a large deviation principle in the limit as the block size tends
to infinity. The associated rate function can be computed as the action
functional of a Lagrangian that is the Legendre transform of a certain
non-linear generator, playing a role analogous to the moment-generating
function in the Gartner-Ellis theorem of large deviation theory when this is
applied to finite-dimensional Markov processes. This rate function is used to
define the notion of "bad empirical measures", which are the discontinuity
points of the optimal trajectories (i.e., the trajectories minimizing the rate
function) given the empirical measure at the end of the trajectory. The
dynamical Gibbs-non-Gibbs transitions are linked to the occurrence of bad
empirical measures: for short times no bad empirical measures occur, while for
intermediate and large times bad empirical mea- sures are possible. A future
research program is proposed to classify the various possible scenarios behind
this crossover, which we refer to as a "nature-versus-nurture" transition.
