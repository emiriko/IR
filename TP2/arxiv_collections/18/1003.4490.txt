This paper reports on experiments with ultra-cold rubidium atoms confined in
microscopic magnetic traps created using a piece of periodically-magnetized
videotape mounted on an atom chip. The roughness of the confining potential is
studied with atomic clouds at temperatures of a few microKelvin and at
distances between 30 and 80 microns from the videotape-chip surface. The
inhomogeneities in the magnetic field created by the magnetized videotape close
to the central region of the chip are characterized in this way. In addition,
we demonstrate a novel transport mechanism whereby we convey cold atoms
confined in arrays of videotape magnetic micro-traps over distances as large as
~ 1 cm parallel to the chip surface. This conveying mechanism enables us to
survey the surface of the chip and observe potential-roughness effects across
different regions.
