The weak kaon production off the nucleon induced by neutrinos is studied at
the low and intermediate energies of interest for some ongoing and future
neutrino oscillation experiments. This process is also potentially important
for the analysis of proton decay experiments. We develop a microscopical model
based on the SU(3) chiral Lagrangians. The basic parameters of the model are
fpi, the pion decay constant, Cabibbo's angle, the proton and neutron magnetic
moments and the axial vector coupling constants for the baryons octet, D and F,
that are obtained from the analysis of the semileptonic decays of neutron and
hyperons. The studied mechanisms are the main source of kaon production for
neutrino energies up to 1.2 to 1.5 GeV for the various channels and the cross
sections are large enough to be amenable to be measured by experiments such as
Minerva and T2K.
