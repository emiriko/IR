Numerical simulations of dispersive turbulence in magnetized plasmas based on
the Hall-MHD description are presented, assuming spatial variations along a
unique direction making a prescribed angle with the ambient magnetic field.
Main observations concern the energy transfers among the different scales and
the various types of MHD waves, together with the conditions for the
establishment of pressure-balanced structures. For parallel propagation,
Alfv\'en-wave transfer to small scales is strongly inhibited and rather feeds
magnetosonic modes, unless the effect of dispersion is strong enough at the
energy injection scale. In oblique directions, the dominantly compressible
character of the turbulence is pointed out with, for quasi-transverse
propagation, the presence of conspicuous kinetic Alfv\'en waves. Preliminary
simulations of a Landau fluid model incorporating relevant linear kinetic
effects reveal the development of a significant plasma temperature anisotropy
leading to recurrent instabilities.
