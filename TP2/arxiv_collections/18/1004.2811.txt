In arXiv:0910.1727 we find certain finite homomorphic images of Artin braid
group into appropriate symmetric groups, which a posteriori are extensions of
the symmetric group on n letters by an abelian group. The main theorem of this
paper characterizes completely the extensions of this type that are split.
