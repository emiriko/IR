Local density fluctuations and density profiles of a Fermi gas are measured
in-situ and analyzed. In the quantum degenerate regime, the weakly interacting
$^6$Li gas shows a suppression of the density fluctuations compared to the
non-degenerate case, where atomic shot noise is observed. This manifestation of
antibunching is a direct result of the Pauli principle and constitutes a local
probe of quantum degeneracy. We analyze our data using the predictions of the
fluctuation-dissipation theorem and the local density approximation,
demonstrating a fluctuation-based temperature measurement.
