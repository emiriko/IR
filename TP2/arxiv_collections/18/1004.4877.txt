We study the resonance energy of the strange dibaryons using two models with
the energy-independent and energy-dependent potentials for the s-wave barKN
interaction, both of which are derived by certain reductions from the leading
order term of the effective chiral Lagrangian. These potential models produce
rather different off-shell behaviors of the two-body barKN - piSigma amplitudes
in I=0 channel, i.e., the model with energy-independent (energy-dependent)
potential predicts one (two) resonance pole in the Lambda(1405) region, while
they describe the available data equally well. We find that the
energy-independent potential model predicts one resonance pole of the strange
dibaryons, whereas the energy-dependent potential model predicts two resonance
poles: one is the shallow quasi-bound state of the barKNN, and another is the
resonance of the piYN with large width. An investigation of the binding energy
of the strange dibaryons will make a significant contribution to clarify
resonance structure of s-wave barKN - piSigma around the Lambda(1405) region.
