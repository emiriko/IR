Active particles contain internal degrees of freedom with the ability to take
in and dissipate energy and, in the process, execute systematic movement.
Examples include all living organisms and their motile constituents such as
molecular motors. This article reviews recent progress in applying the
principles of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics and hydrodynamics to form a
systematic theory of the behaviour of collections of active particles -- active
matter -- with only minimal regard to microscopic details. A unified view of
the many kinds of active matter is presented, encompassing not only living
systems but inanimate analogues. Theory and experiment are discussed side by
side.
