We present a new method for detecting and identifying bacteria by measuring
impedance fluctuations (impedance noise) caused by ion release by the bacteria
during phage infestation. This new method significantly increases the measured
signal strength and reduces the negative effects of drift, material aging,
surface imperfections, 1/f potential fluctuations, thermal noise, and amplifier
noise.
  Comparing BIPIF with another well-known method, bacteria detection by SEnsing
of Phage Triggered Ion Cascades (SEPTIC), we find that the BIPIF algorithm is
easier to implement, more stable and significantly more sensitive (by several
orders of magnitude). We project that by using the BIPIF method detection of a
single bacterium will be possible.
