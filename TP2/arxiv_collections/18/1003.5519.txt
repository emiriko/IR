In our double magneto-optical trap (MOT) setup containing a vapor chamber MOT
(VC-MOT) and an ultra high vacuum MOT (UHV-MOT) for $^{87}$Rb atoms, we find
that transfer of atoms from VC-MOT to UHV-MOT can be enhanced by employing a
pulsed VC-MOT loading followed by a pulsed push beam, as compared to that
obtained by focusing a continuous wave (CW) push beam on a continuously loaded
VC-MOT. By choosing appropriately the VC-MOT duration and push beam duration,
the number of atoms in UHV-MOT was $\sim$3-times the number obtained with a
continuous VC-MOT and a CW push beam of optimized power. The processes
affecting the pulsed transfer have been studied.
