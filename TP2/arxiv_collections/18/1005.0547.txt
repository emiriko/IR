We study the effect of squark-generation mixing on gluino decays in the
Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). We show that due to the effect
the quark-flavor violating (QFV) gluino decay branching ratio B(gluino -> c
bar{t} (t bar{c}) + neutralino_1) can be very large (up to ~50%) in a
significant part of the MSSM parameter space despite the very strong
experimental constraints on QFV from B meson observables. This could have an
important impact on the search for gluinos and the determination of the MSSM
parameters at LHC.
