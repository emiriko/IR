We study the gluon distribution in nucleus-nucleus collisions in the
framework of the Color-Glass-Condensate. Approximate analytical solutions are
compared to numerical solutions of the non-linear Yang-Mills equations. We find
that the full numerical solution can be well approximated by taking the full
initial condition of the fields in Coulomb gauge and using a linearized
solution for the time evolution. We also compare kt-factorized approximations
to the full solution.
