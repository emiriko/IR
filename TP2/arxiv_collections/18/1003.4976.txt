We uncover and characterize different chaotic transport scenarios on perfect
periodic surfaces by controlling the chaotic dynamics of particles subjected to
periodic external forces in the absence of a ratchet effect. After identifying
relevant {\it symmetries} of chaotic solutions, analytical estimates in
parameter space for the occurrence of different transport scenarios are
provided and confirmed by numerical simulations. These scenarios are highly
sensitive to variations of the system's asymmetry parameters, including the
eccentricity of the periodic surface and the direction of dc and ac forces,
which could be useful for particle sorting purposes in those cases where chaos
is unavoidable.
