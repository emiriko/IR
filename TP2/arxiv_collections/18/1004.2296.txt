We discuss problems posed by the quantitative study of time inhomogeneous
Markov chains. The two main notions for our purpose are merging and stability.
Merging (also called weak ergodicity) occurs when the chain asymptotically
forgets where it started. It is a loss of memory property. Stability relates to
the question of whether or not, despite temporary variations, there is a rough
shape describing the long time behavior of the chain. For instance, we will
discuss an example where the long time behavior is roughly described by a
binomial, with temporal variations.
