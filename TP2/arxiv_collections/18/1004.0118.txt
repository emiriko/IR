We have experimentally studied the role of thermoelectric effects in
nanoscale nonlocal spin valve devices. A finite element thermoelectric model is
developed to calculate the generated Seebeck voltages due to Peltier and Joule
heating in the devices. By measuring the first, second and third harmonic
voltage response non locally, the model is experimentally examined. The results
indicate that the combination of Peltier and Seebeck effects contributes
significantly to the nonlocal baseline resistance. Moreover, we found that the
second and third harmonic response signals can be attributed to Joule heating
and temperature dependencies of both Seebeck coefficient and resistivity.
