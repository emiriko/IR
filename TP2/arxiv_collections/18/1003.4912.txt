We investigate multi-boson interference. A Hamiltonian is presented that
treats pairs of bosons as a single composite boson. This Hamiltonian allows two
pairs of bosons to interact as if they were two single composite bosons. We
show that this leads to the composite bosons exhibiting novel interference
effects such as Hong-Ou-Mandel interference. We then investigate
generalizations of the formalism to the case of interference between two
general composite bosons. Finally, we show how one can realize interference
between composite bosons in the two atom Dicke model.
