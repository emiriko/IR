We have considered the possibility to describe the astrophysical S-factors of
some light atomic nuclei on the basis of the potential cluster model by taking
into account the supermultiplet symmetry of wave functions and splitting the
orbital states according to Young's schemes. Such an approach allows analyzing
the structure of inter-cluster interactions, to determine the presence of
allowed and forbidden states in the interaction potential and so the number of
nodes of the orbital wave function of cluster relative motion.
