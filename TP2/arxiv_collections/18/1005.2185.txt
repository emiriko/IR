We examine the prospects for LHC discovery of SU(2)_L singlet vector-like
quarks that obey Minimal Flavour Violation (MFV) and are consistent with lower
energy phenomenology. We study models where the vector-like quarks have the
same quantum numbers as u_R or d_R, allowing mixing, which generally leads to
significant low energy constraints. We find that there are two naturally
phenomenologically viable MFV models of this type when the Weyl spinor
components of the vector-like quarks are flavour triplets. We examine direct
production bounds, flavour and electroweak precision data constraints for these
models and determine the cross section for allowed values of the model
parameters at LHC. For the models we identify as naturally phenomenologically
viable, large amounts of parameter space afford a significant early discovery
reach at LHC while being consistent with lower energy phenomenology.
