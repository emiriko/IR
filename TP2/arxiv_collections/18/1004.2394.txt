This article provides a brief (non-exhaustive) overview of some possibilities
for recreating fundamental effects which are relevant for black holes (and
other gravitational scenarios) in the laboratory. Via suitable condensed matter
analogues and other laboratory systems, it might be possible to model the
Penrose process (superradiant scattering), the Unruh effect, Hawking radiation,
the Eardley instability, black-hole lasers, cosmological particle creation, the
Gibbons-Hawking effect, and the Schwinger mechanism. Apart from an experimental
verification of these yet unobserved phenomena, the study of these laboratory
systems might shed light onto the underlying ideas and problems and should
therefore be interesting from a (quantum) gravity point of view as well.
