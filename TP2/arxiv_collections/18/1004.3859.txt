We study the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) discovery potential for $Z^`$ models
with continuously distributed mass for $\sqrt{s} = 7, 10$ and 14 TeV
centre-of-mass energies. One of possible LHC signatures for such models is the
existence of broad resonance in Drell-Yan reaction $pp \to Z^` + ... \to l^+l^-
+ ...$.
