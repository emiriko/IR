We have studied entropy, redundancy, complexity, and first passage times to
notes for 804 pieces of 29 composers. The successful understanding of tonal
music calls for an experienced listener, as entropy dominates over redundancy
in musical messages. First passage times to notes resolve tonality and feature
a composer. We also discuss the possible distances in space of musical dice
games and introduced the geodesic distance based on the Riemann structure
associated to the probability vectors (rows of the transition matrices).
