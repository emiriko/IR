Whereas spintronics brings the spin degree of freedom to electronic devices,
molecular/organic electronics adds the opportunity to play with the chemical
versatility. Here we show how, as a contender to commonly used inorganic
materials, organic/molecular based spintronics devices can exhibit very large
magnetoresistance and lead to tailored spin polarizations. We report on giant
tunnel magnetoresistance of up to 300% in a (La,Sr)MnO3/Alq3/Co nanometer size
magnetic tunnel junction. Moreover, we propose a spin dependent transport model
giving a new understanding of spin injection into organic materials/molecules.
Our findings bring a new insight on how one could tune spin injection by
molecular engineering and paves the way to chemical tailoring of the properties
of spintronics devices.
