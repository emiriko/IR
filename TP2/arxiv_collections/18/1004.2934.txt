Using linear-response density-functional theory, magnetic excitations in the
striped phase of CaFe$_{2}$As$_{2}$ are studied as a function of local moment
amplitude. We find a new kind of excitation: sharp resonances of Stoner-like
(itinerant) excitations at energies comparable to the N{\'{e}}el temperature,
originating largely from a narrow band of Fe $d$ states near the Fermi level,
and coexist with more conventional (localized) spin waves. Both kinds of
excitations can show multiple branches, highlighting the inadequacy of a
description based on a localized spin model.
