We study the behaviour of the notion of "thema", introduced in our previous
article [B.09b], by a change of variable. We show not only that the fundamental
invariants of such a thema, corresponding to the Bernstein polynomial, are
stable by a change of variable, but also other numerical invariants called
principal parameters. \\ We show on a rank 3 example that nevertheless the
isomorphism class of a thema is not stable in general by a change of variable.
We conclude in proving that a change of variable transforms an holomorphic
family of thema in an holomorphic family. This implies that non principal
parameters change holomorphically.
