A resonant two level atom doped in one dimensional waveguide behaves as a
mirror, but this single-atom "mirror" can only reflect single photon perfectly
at a specific frequency. For a one dimensional coupled-resonator waveguide, we
propose to extend the perfect reflection region from a specific frequency to a
wide band by placing many atoms individually in the resonators in a finite
coordinate region of the waveguide. Such a doped resonator array promises us to
control the propagation of a practical photon wave packet with certain momentum
distribution instead of a single photon, which is ideally represented by a
plane wave with specific momentum. The studies based on the discrete-coordinate
scattering theory display that such hybrid structure indeed provides a
near-perfect reflection for single photon in a wide band. We also calculated
photon group velocity distribution, which shows that the perfect reflection
with wide band exactly corresponds to the stopping light region.
