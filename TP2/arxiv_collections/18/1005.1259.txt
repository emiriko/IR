We propose a scheme for state-insensitive trapping of neutral atoms by using
light with two independent wavelengths. In particular, we describe the use of
trapping and control lasers to minimize the variance of the potential
experienced by a trapped Rb atom in ground and excited states. We present
calculated values of wavelength pairs for which the 5s and 5p_{3/2} levels have
the same ac Stark shifts in the presence of two laser fields.
