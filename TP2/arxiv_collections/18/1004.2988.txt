This manuscript represents an investigation of structure, property and
electrochemical activity for commercially available RuO2 coated titanium
electrode, known as DSA. The investigation mainly aimed at XAS studies to
understand the hidden structural information for RuO2. Two different (150
micron) and a (6 micron) titanium metal coated with RuO2 was exposed at ex-situ
and in-situ XAS experiment to find out its electrocatalytic property and
corrosion during chlorine generation reaction. A detailed survey of XANES and
EXAFS showed that the stable RuO2 formed a nano cluster during chlorine
generation reaction and these clusters produced a distorted rutile structure
with an enhanced electrocatalytic activity. These nano clusters possibly the
cause of generating surface heterogeneity of the present ruthenium dioxide
material (active catalyst for DSA). With the help of electrochemical impedance
spectroscopy we are able to detect the surface heterogeneity, this surface
heterogeneity is having key role for outstanding electrochemical performance of
these DSA electrodes.
