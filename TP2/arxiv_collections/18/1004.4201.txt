We consider a four-dimensional theory in the z=3 Lifshitz context, with an
exponential (Liouville) potential. We determine the exact renormalized
potential of the theory and derive the non-perturbative relation between the
renormalized and bare couplings. In addition, we show that Lorentz symmetry is
naturally generated by quantum fluctuations in the infrared regime, and
conclude that the model can be relevant to High Energy Physics.
