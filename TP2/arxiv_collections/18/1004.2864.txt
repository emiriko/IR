The ratio of the $\psi'$ over the $J/\psi$ production cross section in the
dielectron channel has been measured in $\sqrt{s}=$ 200 GeV $p+p$ collisions
with the PHENIX detector at RHIC. The analysis is based on fitting of the
dielectron invariant mass spectra in the area around the $J/\psi$ and $\psi'$
signals in order to extract a ratio $\psi'$ over $J/\psi$ of 0.019$\pm
0.005($stat$)\pm 0.002($sys$)$ and a fractional feed-down contribution to
$J/\psi$ from $\psi^\prime$ of $8.6 \pm 2.5 %$.
