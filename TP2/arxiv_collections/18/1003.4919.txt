Due to implementation constraints the XOR operation is widely used in order
to combine plaintext and key bit-strings in secret-key block ciphers. This
choice directly induces the classical version of the differential attack by the
use of XOR-kind differences. While very natural, there are many alternatives to
the XOR. Each of them inducing a new form for its corresponding differential
attack (using the appropriate notion of difference) and therefore block-ciphers
need to use S-boxes that are resistant against these nonstandard differential
cryptanalysis. In this contribution we study the functions that offer the best
resistance against a differential attack based on a finite field
multiplication. We also show that in some particular cases, there are robust
permutations which offers the best resistant against both multiplication and
exponentiation base differential attacks. We call them doubly perfect nonlinear
permutations.
