The canonical view of heavy fermion quantum criticality assumes a single
quantum critical point separating the paramagnet from the antiferromagnet.
However, recent experiments on Yb-based heavy fermion compounds suggest the
presence of non-Fermi liquid behavior over a finite zero-temperature region.
Using detailed susceptibility and transport measurements we show that the
classic quantum critical system, Ge-substituted YbRh2Si2, also displays such
behavior. We advance arguments that this is not due to a disorder-smeared
quantum critical point, but represents a new class of metallic phase.
