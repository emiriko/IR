We searched for H2O 6(1,6)-5(2,3) maser emission at 22.235 GHz from several
Saturnian satellites with the Nobeyama 45m radio telescope in May 2009.
Observations were made for Titan, Hyperion, Enceladus and Atlas, for which
Pogrebenko et al. (2009) had reported detections of water masers at 22.235 GHz,
and in addition for Iapetus and other inner satellites. We detected no emission
of the water maser line for all the satellites observed, although sensitivities
of our observations were comparable or even better than those of Pogrebenko et
al.. We infer that the water maser emission from the Saturnian system is
extremely weak, or sporadic in nature. Monitoring over a long period and
obtaining statistical results must be made for the further understanding of the
water maser emission in the Saturnian system.
