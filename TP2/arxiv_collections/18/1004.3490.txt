It has been previously observed that narrow lanes of transverse and
longitudinal magnetic field with opposite polarity are the site of large solar
flares. We performed a comprehensive examination of the stokes asymmetries of
active region NOAA 10930. The active region was observed just before, during
and after an X-class flare, which occurred during December 13, 2006 from 02:20
to 06:18 UT. We observe a static fibril interacting with a rotating penumbra of
opposite polarity in the hours prior to the flare. Above the fibril were
several small sites of hot gas in the chromosphere. During and after the flare,
the fibril and its corresponding flow and profiles were much less pronounced.
We present a full analysis of magnetic and plasma properties of this active
region.
