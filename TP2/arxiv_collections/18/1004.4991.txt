We present some results of Monte Carlo simulations for the deposition of
particles of different sizes on a two-dimensional substrate. The particles are
linear, height one, and can be deposited randomly only in the two, $x$ and $y$
directions of the substrate, and occupy an integer number of cells of the
lattice. We show there are three different regimes for the temporal evolution
of the interface width. At the initial times we observe an uncorrelated growth,
with an exponent $\beta_{1}$ characteristic of the random deposition model. At
intermediate times, the interface width presents an unusual behavior, described
by a growing exponent $\beta_{2}$, which depends on the size of the particles
added to the substrate. If the linear size of the particle is two we have
$\beta_{2}<\beta_{1}$, otherwise we have $\beta_{2}>\beta_{1}$, for all other
particle sizes. After a long time the growth reaches the saturation regime
where the interface width becomes constant and is described by the roughness
exponent $\alpha$, which is nearly independent of the size of the particle.
Similar results are found in the surface growth due to the electrophoretic
deposition of polymer chains. Contrary to one-dimensional results the growth
exponents are non-universal.
