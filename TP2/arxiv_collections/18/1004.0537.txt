Under certain circumstances, the time behavior of a random walk is modulated
by logarithmic periodic oscillations. The goal of this paper is to present a
simple and pedagogical explanation of the origin of this modulation for
diffusion on a substrate with two properties: self-similarity and finite
ramification order. On these media, the time dependence of the mean-square
displacement shows log-periodic modulations around a leading power law, which
can be understood on the base of a hierarchical set of diffusion constants.
Both the random walk exponent and the period of oscillations are analytically
obtained for a pair of examples, one fractal, the other non-fractal, and
confirmed by Monte Carlo simulations.
