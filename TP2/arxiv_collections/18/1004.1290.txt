A polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography system based on
heterodyning and filtering techniques is built to perform Stokesmetric imaging
of different layers of depths in a porcine tendon sample. The complete 4\times4
backscattering Muellermetric images of one layer are acquired using such a
system. The images reveal information indiscernible from a conventional OCT
system.
