We explore the potential of double core hole electron spectroscopy for
chemical analysis in terms of x-ray two-photon photoelectron spectroscopy
(XTPPS). The creation of deep single and double core vacancies induces
significant reorganization of valence electrons. The corresponding relaxation
energies and the interatomic relaxation energies are evaluated by CASSCF
calculations. We propose a method how to experimentally extract these
quantities by the measurement of single and double core-hole ionization
potentials (IPs and DIPs). The influence of the chemical environment on these
DIPs is also discussed for states with two holes at the same atomic site and
states with two holes at two different atomic sites. Electron density
difference between the ground and double core-hole states clearly shows the
relaxations accompanying the double core-hole ionization. The effect is also
compared with the sensitivity of single core hole ionization potentials (IPs)
arising in single core hole electron spectroscopy. We have demonstrated the
method for a representative set of small molecules LiF, BeO, BF, CO, N2, C2H2,
C2H4, C2H6, CO2 and N2O. The scalar relativistic effect on IPs and on DIPs are
briefly addressed.
