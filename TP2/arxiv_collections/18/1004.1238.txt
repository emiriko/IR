The influence of the incompressible strips on the integer quantized Hall
effect (IQHE) is investigated, considering a cleaved-edge overgrown (CEO)
sample as an experimentally realizable sharp edge system. We propose a set of
experiments to clarify the distinction between the large-sample limit when bulk
disorder defines the IQHE plateau width and the small-sample limit smaller than
the disorder correlation length, when self-consistent edge electrostatics
define the IQHE plateau width. The large-sample or bulk QH regime is described
by the usual localization picture, whereas the small-sample or edge regime is
discussed within the compressible/incompressible strips picture, known as the
screening theory of QH edges. Utilizing the unusually sharp edge profiles of
the CEO samples, a Hall bar design is proposed to manipulate the edge potential
profile from smooth to extremely sharp. By making use of a side-gate
perpendicular to the two dimensional electron system, it is shown that the
plateau widths can be changed or even eliminated altogether. Hence, the
visibility of IQHE is strongly influenced when adjusting the edge potential
profile and/or changing the dc current direction under high currents in the
non-linear transport regime. As a second investigation, we consider two
different types of ohmic contacts, namely highly transmitting (ideal) and
highly reflecting (non-ideal) contacts. We show that if the injection contacts
are non-ideal, however still ohmic, it is possible to measure directly the
non-quantized transport taking place at the bulk of the CEO samples. The
results of the experiments we propose will clarify the influence of the edge
potential profile and the quality of the contacts, under quantized Hall
conditions.
