The objective of the paper is to recognize handwritten samples of basic
Bangla characters using Tesseract open source Optical Character Recognition
(OCR) engine under Apache License 2.0. Handwritten data samples containing
isolated Bangla basic characters and digits were collected from different
users. Tesseract is trained with user-specific data samples of document pages
to generate separate user-models representing a unique language-set. Each such
language-set recognizes isolated basic Bangla handwritten test samples
collected from the designated users. On a three user model, the system is
trained with 919, 928 and 648 isolated handwritten character and digit samples
and the performance is tested on 1527, 14116 and 1279 character and digit
samples, collected form the test datasets of the three users respectively. The
user specific character/digit recognition accuracies were obtained as 90.66%,
91.66% and 96.87% respectively. The overall basic character-level and digit
level accuracy of the system is observed as 92.15% and 97.37%. The system fails
to segment 12.33% characters and 15.96% digits and also erroneously classifies
7.85% characters and 2.63% on the overall dataset.
