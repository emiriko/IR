We present experimental NMR demonstration of a scheme of reversible
projective measurement, which allows extracting information on outcomes and
probabilities of a projective measurement in a non-destructive way, with a
minimal net effect on the quantum state of an ensemble. The scheme uses
reversible dynamics and weak measurement of the intermediate state. The
experimental system is an ensemble of 133Cs (S = 7/2) nuclei in a
liquid-crystalline matrix.
