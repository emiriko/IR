A zero temperature superfluid is arguably the simplest system in which to
study complex fluid dynamics, such as turbulence. We describe computer
simulations of such turbulence and compare the results directly with recent
experiments in superfluid 3He-B. We are able to follow the entire process of
the production, evolution, and decay of quantum turbulence. We find striking
agreement between simulation and experiment and gain new insights into the
mechanisms involved.
