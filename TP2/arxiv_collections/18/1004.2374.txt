Security of information transmitted through the Internet, against passive or
active attacks is an international concern. The use of a chaos-based
pseudo-random bit sequence to make it unrecognizable by an intruder, is a field
of research in full expansion. This mask of useful information by modulation or
encryption is a fundamental part of the TLS Internet exchange protocol. In this
paper, a new method using discrete chaotic iterations to generate pseudo-random
numbers is presented. This pseudo-random number generator has successfully
passed the NIST statistical test suite (NIST SP800-22). Security analysis shows
its good characteristics. The application for secure image transmission through
the Internet is proposed at the end of the paper.
