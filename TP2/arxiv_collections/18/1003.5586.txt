Differential measurements of the elliptic (v_2) and hexadecapole (v_4)
Fourier flow coefficients are reported for charged hadrons as a function of
transverse momentum (p_T) and collision centrality or the number of participant
nucleons (N_part) for Au+Au collisions at sqrt(s_NN)=200 GeV. The v_{2,4}
measurements at pseudorapidity |\eta|<=0.35 obtained with four separate
reaction plane detectors positioned in the range 1.0<|\eta|<3.9 show good
agreement, indicating the absence of significant \eta-dependent nonflow
perturbations. Sizable values for v_4(p_T) are observed with a ratio
v_4(p_T,N_part)/v_2^2(p_T,N_part)~0.8 for 50<N_part<200, which is compatible
with the combined effects of a finite viscosity and initial eccentricity
fluctuations. For N_part>200 this ratio increases up to 1.7 in the most central
collisions.
