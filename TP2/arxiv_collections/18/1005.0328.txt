We present a continuous-variable quantum key distribution protocol combining
a continuous but slightly non-Gaussian modulation together with a efficient
reverse reconciliation scheme. We establish the security of this protocol
against collective attacks which correspond to a linear quantum channel. In
particular, all Gaussian attacks are considered in our framework. We show that
this protocol outperforms all known practical protocols, even taking into
account finite size effects.
