We study the gravitational dynamics in the early inspiral phase of coalescing
compact binaries using Non-Relativistic General Relativity (NRGR) - an
effective field theory formalism based on the post-newtonian expansion, but
which provides a consistent lagrangian framework and a systematic way in which
to study binary dynamics and gravitational wave emission. We calculate in this
framework the spin-orbit correction to the newtonian potential at 2.5 PN.
