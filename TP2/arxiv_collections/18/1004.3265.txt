The Glottal Source is an important component of voice as it can be considered
as the excitation signal to the voice apparatus. Nowadays, new techniques of
speech processing such as speech recognition and speech synthesis use the
glottal closure and opening instants. Current models of the glottal waves
derive their shape from approximate information rather than from exactly
measured data. General method concentrate on assessment of the glottis opening
using optical, acoustical methods, or on visualization of the larynx position
using ultrasound, computer tomography or magnetic resonance imaging techniques.
In this work, circuit model of Human Glottis using MOS is designed by
exploiting fluid volume velocity to current, fluid pressure to voltage, and
linear and nonlinear mechanical impedances to linear and nonlinear electrical
impedances. The glottis modeled as current source includes linear, non-linear
impedances to represent laminar and turbulent flow respectively, in vocal
tract. The MOS modelling and simulation results of glottal circuit has been
carried out on BSIM 3v3 model in TSMC 0.18 micrometer technology using ELDO
simulator.
