Reparametrization invariance relations are determined for the inclusive decay
spectra of heavy hadrons. They connect the leading order result to the lambda_1
term, and the lambda_2 and rho_2 terms, and imply that the lambda_1 and rho_2
terms in the total rate occur in the combinations 1+lambda_1/(2m_Q^2) and
lambda_2-rho_2/m_Q. The relations are satisfied by the known results for the
hadronic decay tensors for B -> X e nu, B -> X gamma and B -> X e+ e- decays.
An interesting field-theory result, the connection between currents in full and
effective theories and the change in currents under field redefinitions, is
discussed. The hadron masses are given to order (Lambda_QCD)^3/m_Q^2 including
radiative corrections, and provide an example illustrating the relation between
renormalization and reparametrization invariance and mu-independence of 1/m_Q^3
corrections to physical quantities.
