Particle transport through an open, discrete 1-D channel against a mechanical
or chemical bias is analyzed within a master equation approach. The channel,
externally driven by time dependent site energies, allows multiple occupation
due to the coupling to reservoirs. Performance criteria and optimization of
active transport in a two-site channel are discussed as a function of reservoir
chemical potentials, the load potential, interparticle interaction strength,
driving mode and driving period. Our results, derived from exact rate
equations, are used in addition to test a previously developed time-dependent
density functional theory, suggesting a wider applicability of that method in
investigations of many particle systems far from equilibrium.
