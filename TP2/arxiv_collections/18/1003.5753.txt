The Cosmic Ray Energetics And Mass (CREAM) balloon experiment had two
successful flights in 2004/05 and 2005/06. It was designed to perform energy
measurements from a few GeV up to 1000 TeV, taking advantage of different
detection techniques. The first instrument, CREAM-1, combined a transition
radiation detector with a calorimeter to provide independent energy
measurements of cosmicraynuclei. Each detector was calibrated with particle
beams in a limited range of energies. In order to assess the absolute energy
scale of the instrument and to investigate the systematic effects of each
technique, a cross-calibration was performed by comparing the two independent
energy estimates on selected samples of oxygen and carbon nuclei.
