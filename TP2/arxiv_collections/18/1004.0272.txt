Pomeron loop effects (gluon number fluctuations) on deep inelastic scattering
(DIS) in the fixed coupling case are studied. We show that the description of
the HERA data for the inclusive structure function $F_2(x,Q^2)$ for
$x\leq10^{-2}$ and $0.045\leq Q^2\leq 45GeV^2$ is improved once pomeron loop
effects are included.
