We investigate the quantum information reclaim from the environment after
amplitude damping has occurred. In particular we address the question of
optimal measurement on the environment to perform the best possible correction
on two and three dimensional quantum systems. Depending on the dimension we
show that the entanglement fidelity (the measure quantifying the correction
performance) is or is not the same for all possible measurements and uncover
the optimal measurement leading to the maximum entanglement fidelity.
