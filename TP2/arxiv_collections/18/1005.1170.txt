By applying density functional theory, we find strong evidence for an
itinerant nature of magnetism in two families of iron pnictides. Furthermore,
by employing dynamical mean field theory with continuous time quantum Monte
Carlo as an impurity solver, we observe that the antiferromagnetic metal with
small magnetic moment naturally arises out of coupling between unfrustrated and
frustrated bands. Our results point to a possible scenario for magnetism in
iron pnictides where magnetism originates from a strong instability at the
momentum vector ($\pi$, $\pi$, $\pi$) while it is reduced by quantum
fluctuations due to the coupling between weakly and strongly frustrated bands.
