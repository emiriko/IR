This paper formulates and studies a stochastic maximum principle for
forward-backward stochastic Volterra integral equations (FBSVIEs in short),
while the control area is assumed to be convex. Then a linear quadratic (LQ in
short) problem for backward stochastic Volterra integral equations (BSVIEs in
short) is present to illustrate the aforementioned optimal control problem.
Motivated by the technical skills in solving above problem, a more convenient
and briefer method for the unique solvability of M-solution for BSVIEs is
proposed. At last, we will investigate a risk minimization problem by means of
the maximum principle for FBSVIEs. Closed-form optimal portfolio is obtained in
some special cases.
