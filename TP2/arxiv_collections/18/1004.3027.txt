A general discussion of graphene in external electromagnetic field is
provided. In general, the formulation is not Lorentz invariant because of
Zeeman energy. But it can be restored approxiamtely in the case of strong
magnetic field, the condition when quantum Hall effect is observed. Besides
obtaining the well-known Hall conductance $\frac{4q^2}{h}(L+1/2)$, we also
predict that the sequence of Hall conductance $\frac{4q^2}{h}L$,which contains
the newly observed Hall conductance $\frac{4q^2}{h}L$ for $L=0,1$, depending on
the filling of Zeeman levels. The energy levels are obtained for general
orthogonal constant electric and magnetic field. The second order Dirac
equation is derived in applied monochromatic electromagnetic wave, and the
major difference between graphene system and convetional Dirac electrons is
pointed out.
