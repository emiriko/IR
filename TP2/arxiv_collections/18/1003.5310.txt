We study accommodation of an excess charge carrier on long even-N polyynic
oligomers C_{N}H_{2} due to displacements of the underlying carbon lattice and
polarization of the surrounding solvent in the context of carrier
self-localization into a polaronic state. Spatial patterns of bond-length
alternation, excess charge and spin densities are compared as derived with
Hartree-Fock and two hybrid-DFT methods (BHandHLYP and B3LYP) in conjunction
with the polarizable continuum model. Quite distinct resulting pictures of
carrier accommodation are found when contributions from different interactions
are analyzed. Solvation robustly acts to promote excess charge localization.
