We perform a numeric study (Worm algorithm Monte Carlo simulations) of
ultracold two-component bosons in two-dimensional optical lattices. We study
how the Mott insulator to superfluid transition is affected by the presence of
a second superfluid bosonic species. We find that, at fixed interspecies
interaction, the upper and lower boundaries of the Mott lobe are differently
modified. The lower boundary is strongly renormalized even for relatively low
filling factor of the second component and moderate (interspecies) interaction.
The upper boundary, instead, is affected only for large enough filling of the
second component. Whereas boundaries are renormalized we find evidence of
polaron-like excitations. Our results are of interest for current experimental
setups.
