We calculate the total energy of an exact spherically symmetric solutions,
i.e., Schwarzschild and Reissner Nordstr$\ddot{o}$m, using the gravitational
energy-momentum 3-form within the tetrad formulation of general relativity. We
explain how the effect of the inertial makes the total energy unphysical!
Therefore, we use the covariant teleparallel approach which makes the energy
always physical one. We also show that the inertial has no effect on the
calculation of momentum.
