We present 70 and 160 micron Herschel science demonstration images of a field
in the Orion A molecular cloud that contains the prototypical Herbig-Haro
objects HH 1 and 2, obtained with the Photodetector Array Camera and
Spectrometer (PACS). These observations demonstrate Herschel's unprecedented
ability to study the rich population of protostars in the Orion molecular
clouds at the wavelengths where they emit most of their luminosity. The four
protostars previously identified by Spitzer 3.6-40 micron imaging and
spectroscopy are detected in the 70 micron band, and three are clearly detected
at 160 microns. We measure photometry of the protostars in the PACS bands and
assemble their spectral energy distributions (SEDs) from 1 to 870 microns with
these data, Spitzer spectra and photometry, 2MASS data, and APEX sub-mm data.
The SEDs are fit to models generated with radiative transfer codes. From these
fits we can constrain the fundamental properties of the protostars. We find
luminosities in the range 12-84 L_sun and envelope densities spanning over two
orders of magnitude. This implies that the four protostars have a wide range of
envelope infall rates and evolutionary states: two have dense, infalling
envelopes, while the other two have only residual envelopes. We also show the
highly irregular and filamentary structure of the cold dust and gas surrounding
the protostars as traced at 160 microns.
