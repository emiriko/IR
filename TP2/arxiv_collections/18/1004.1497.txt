We propose a scheme of strong and tunable coupling between a superconducting
phase qubit and nanomechanical torsional resonator. In our scheme the torsional
resonator directly modulates the largest energy scale (the Josephson coupling
energy) of the phase qubit, and the coupling strength is very large. We analyze
the quantum correlation effects in the torsional resonator as a result of the
strong coupling to the phase qubit.
