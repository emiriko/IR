Nilpotent quantum mechanics provides a powerful method of making efficient
calculations. More importantly, however, it provides insights into a number of
fundamental physical problems through its use of a dual vector space and its
explicit construction of vacuum. Physical interpretation of the nilpotent
formalism is discussed with respect to boson and baryon structures, the
mass-gap problem, zitterbewgung, Berry phase, renormalization, and related
issues.
