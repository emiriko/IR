We report the detection of Cd I (Z = 48), Lu II (Z = 71), and Os II (Z = 76)
in the metal-poor star BD+173248. These abundances are derived from an
ultraviolet spectrum obtained with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph on
the Hubble Space Telescope. This is the first detection of these
neutron-capture species in a metal-poor star enriched by the r-process. We
supplement these measurements with new abundances of Mo I, Ru I, and Rh I
derived from an optical spectrum obtained with the High Resolution Echelle
Spectrograph on Keck. Combined with previous abundance derivations, 32
neutron-capture elements have been detected in BD+173248, the most complete
neutron-capture abundance pattern in any metal-poor star to date. The light
neutron-capture elements (38 <= Z <= 48) show a more pronounced even-odd effect
than expected from current Solar system r-process abundance predictions. The
age for BD+173248 derived from the Th II/Os II chronometer is in better
agreement with the age derived from other chronometers than the age derived
from Th II/Os I. New Hf II abundance derivations from transitions in the
ultraviolet are lower than those derived from transitions in the optical, and
the lower Hf abundance is in better agreement with the scaled Solar system
r-process distribution.
