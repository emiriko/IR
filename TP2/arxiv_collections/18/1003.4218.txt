We present a new general design approach of a broad-band detector of
gravitational radiation that relies on two atom interferometers separated by a
distance L. In this scheme, only one arm and one laser will be used for
operating the two atom interferometers. We consider atoms in the atom
interferometers not only as perfect inertial reference sensors, but also as
highly stable clocks. Atomic coherence is intrinsically stable and can be many
orders of magnitude more stable than a laser. The unique one-laser
configuration allows us to then apply time-delay interferometry to the
responses of the two atom interferometers, thereby canceling the laser phase
fluctuations while preserving the gravitational wave signal in the resulting
data set. Our approach appears very promising. We plan to investigate further
its practicality and detailed sensitivity analysis.
