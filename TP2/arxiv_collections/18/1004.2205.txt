This paper introduces Quibbs v1.3, a Java application available for free.
(Source code included in the distribution.) Quibbs is a "code generator" for
quantum Gibbs sampling: after the user inputs some files that specify a
classical Bayesian network, Quibbs outputs a quantum circuit for performing
Gibbs sampling of that Bayesian network on a quantum computer. Quibbs
implements an algorithm described in earlier papers, that combines various
apple pie techniques such as: an adaptive fixed-point version of Grover's
algorithm, Szegedy operators, quantum phase estimation and quantum
multiplexors.
