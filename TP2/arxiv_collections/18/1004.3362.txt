Context: The identification of long-gamma-ray-bursts (LGRBs) is still
uncertain, although the collapsar engine of fast-rotating massive stars is
gaining a strong consensus. Aims: We propose that low-metallicity Be and Oe
stars, which are massive fast rotators, as potential LGRBs progenitors.
Methods: We checked this hypothesis by 1) testing the global specific angular
momentum of Oe/Be stars in the ZAMS with the SMC metallicity, 2) comparing the
ZAMS ($\Omega/\Omega_{\rm c},M/M_{\odot}$) parameters of these stars with the
area predicted theoretically for progenitors with metallicity $Z=0.002$, and 3)
calculating the expected rate of LGRBs/year/galaxy and comparing them with the
observed ones. To this end, we determined the ZAMS linear and angular
rotational velocities for SMC Be and Oe stars using the observed vsini
parameters, corrected from the underestimation induced by the gravitational
darkening effect. Results: The angular velocities of SMC Oe/Be stars are on
average $<\Omega/\Omega_{\rm c}>=0.95$ in the ZAMS. These velocities are in the
area theoretically predicted for the LGRBs progenitors. We estimated the yearly
rate per galaxy of LGRBs and the number of LGRBs produced in the local Universe
up to z=0.2. We have considered that the mass range of LGRB progenitors
corresponds to stars hotter than spectral types B0-B1 and used individual
beaming angles from 5 to 15\degr. We thus obtain $R^{\rm pred}_{\rm
LGRB}\sim10^{-7}$ to $\sim10^{-6}$ LGRBs/year/galaxy, which represents on
average 2 to 14 LGRB predicted events in the local Universe during the past 11
years. The predicted rates could widely surpass the observed ones
[(0.2-3)$\times10^{-7}$ LGRBs/year/galaxy; 8 LGRBs observed in the local
Universe during the last 11 years] if the stellar counts were made from the
spectral type B1-B2, in accordance with the expected apparent spectral types of
the appropriate massive fast rotators. Conclusion: We conclude that the massive
Be/Oe stars with SMC metallicity could be LGRBs progenitors. Nevertheless,
other SMC O/B stars without emission lines, which have high enough specific
angular momentum, can enhance the predicted $R_{\rm LGRB}$ rate.
