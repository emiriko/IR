The kinetics of chiral transitions in hot and dense quark matter is studied
via a microscopic framework (Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model) and a phenomenological
model (Ginzburg-Landau free energy). We focus on the far-from-equilibrium
ordering dynamics subsequent to a quench from the massless quark phase to the
massive quark phase. The morphology of the ordering system is characterized by
the scaling of the order-parameter correlation function. The domain growth
process obeys the Allen-Cahn growth law, $L(t)\sim t^{1/2}$. We also study the
growth of bubble of the stable massive phase in a background of the metastable
massive phase.
