Determination of design parameters based on electromagnetic simulations of
microwave circuits is an iterative and often time-consuming procedure. Space
mapping is a powerful technique to optimize such complex models by efficiently
substituting accurate but expensive electromagnetic models, fine models, with
fast and approximate models, coarse models. In this paper, we apply two space
mapping, an explicit space mapping as well as an implicit and response residual
space mapping, techniques to a case study application, a microstrip band-pass
filter. First, we model the case study application and optimize its design
parameters, using explicit space mapping modelling approach. Then, we use
implicit and response residual space mapping approach to optimize the filter's
design parameters. Finally, the performance of each design methods is
evaluated. It is shown that the use of above-mentioned techniques leads to
achieving satisfactory design solutions with a minimum number of
computationally expensive fine model evaluations.
