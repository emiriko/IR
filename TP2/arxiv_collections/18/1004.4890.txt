Supersymmetric scenarios incorporating thermal leptogenesis as the origin of
the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry generically predict abundances of the
primordial elements which are in conflict with observations. In this paper we
propose a simple way to circumvent this tension and accommodate naturally
thermal leptogenesis and primordial nucleosynthesis. We postulate the existence
of a light hidden sector, coupled very weakly to the Minimal Supersymmetric
Standard Model, which opens up new decay channels for the next-to-lightest
supersymmetric particle, thus diluting its abundance during nucleosynthesis. We
present a general model-independent analysis of this mechanism as well as two
concrete realizations, and describe the relevant cosmological and astrophysical
bounds and implications for this dark matter scenario. Possible experimental
signatures at colliders and in cosmic-ray observations are also discussed.
