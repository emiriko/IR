In the 52-page document, we describe our approach to the Software
Requirements Specification of the IUfA's UUIS prototype. This includes the
overall system description, functional requirements, non-functional
requirements, use cases, the corresponding data dictionary for all entities
involved, mock user interface (UI) design, and the overall projected cost
estimate. The design specification of UUIS can be found in arXiv:1005.0665.
