Nowadays there is a large availability of discrete event simulation software
that can be easily used in different domains: from industry to supply chain,
from healthcare to business management, from training to complex systems
design. Simulation engines of commercial discrete event simulation software use
specific rules and logics for simulation time and events management.
Difficulties and limitations come up when commercial discrete event simulation
software are used for modeling complex real world-systems (i.e. supply chains,
industrial plants). The objective of this paper is twofold: first a state of
the art on commercial discrete event simulation software and an overview on
discrete event simulation models development by using general purpose
programming languages are presented; then a Supply Chain Order Performance
Simulator (SCOPS, developed in C++) for investigating the inventory management
problem along the supply chain under different supply chain scenarios is
proposed to readers.
