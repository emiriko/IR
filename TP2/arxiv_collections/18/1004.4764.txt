We demonstrate 'differential dynamic microscopy' (DDM) for the fast, high
throughput characterization of the dynamics of active particles. Specifically,
we characterize the swimming speed distribution and the fraction of motile
cells in suspensions of Escherichia coli bacteria. By averaging over ~10^4
cells, our results are highly accurate compared to conventional tracking. The
diffusivity of non-motile cells is enhanced by an amount proportional to the
concentration of motile cells.
