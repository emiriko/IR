The program package for the work with the Evaluated Nuclear Structure Data
File is discussed. The program shell designed for the unification of the
process of the evaluation of the nuclear data is proposed. This program shell
may be used in the regular work of the nuclear data evaluator and for common
use by scientists and engineers who need the actual data about nuclear states
and transitions from the ENSDF database.
