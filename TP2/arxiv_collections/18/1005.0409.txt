In the context of developing a hadron calorimeter with extremely fine
granularity for the application of Particle Flow Algorithms to the measurement
of jet energies at a future lepton collider, we report on extensive tests of a
small scale prototype calorimeter. The calorimeter contained up to 10 layers of
Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs) with 2560 1 \times 1 cm2 readout pads,
interleaved with steel absorber plates. The tests included both long-term
Cosmic Ray data taking and measurements in particle beams, where the response
to broadband muons and to pions and positrons with energies in the range of 1 -
16 GeV was established. Detailed measurements of the chambers efficiency as
function of beam intensity have also been performed using 120 GeV protons at
varying intensity. The data are compared to simulations based on GEANT4 and to
analytical calculations of the rate limitations.
