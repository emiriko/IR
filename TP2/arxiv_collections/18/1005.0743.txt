This article contains a detailed and rigorous proof of the construction of a
geometric invariant for initial data sets for the Einstein vacuum field
equations. This geometric invariant vanishes if and only if the initial data
set corresponds to data for the Kerr spacetime, and thus, it characterises this
type of data. The construction presented is valid for boosted and non-boosted
initial data sets which are, in a sense, asymptotically Schwarzschildean. As a
preliminary step to the construction of the geometric invariant, an analysis of
a characterisation of the Kerr spacetime in terms of Killing spinors is carried
out. A space spinor split of the (spacetime) Killing spinor equation is
performed, to obtain a set of three conditions ensuring the existence of a
Killing spinor of the development of the initial data set. In order to
construct the geometric invariant, we introduce the notion of approximate
Killing spinors. These spinors are symmetric valence 2 spinors intrinsic to the
initial hypersurface and satisfy a certain second order elliptic equation
---the approximate Killing spinor equation. This equation arises as the
Euler-Lagrange equation of a non-negative integral functional. This functional
constitutes part of our geometric invariant ---however, the whole functional
does not come from a variational principle. The asymptotic behaviour of
solutions to the approximate Killing spinor equation is studied and an
existence theorem is presented.
