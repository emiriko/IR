Depending on initial conditions, individual finite time trajectories of
dynamical systems can have very different chaotic properties. Here we present a
numerical method to identify trajectories with atypical chaoticity, pathways
that are either more regular or more chaotic than average. The method is based
on the definition of an ensemble of trajectories weighted according to their
chaoticity, the Lyapunov weighted path ensemble. This ensemble of trajectories
is sampled using algorithms borrowed from transition path sampling, a method
originally developed to study rare transitions between long-lived states. We
demonstrate our approach by applying it to several systems with numbers of
degrees of freedom ranging from one to several hundred and in all cases the
algorithm found rare pathways with atypical chaoticity. For a double-well dimer
embedded in a solvent, which can be viewed as simple model for an isomerizing
molecule, rare reactive pathways were found for parameters strongly favoring
chaotic dynamics.
