In this paper, a library-based synthesis methodology for reversible circuits
is proposed where a reversible specification is considered as a permutation
comprising a set of cycles. To this end, a pre-synthesis optimization step is
introduced to construct a reversible specification from an irreversible
function. In addition, a cycle-based representation model is presented to be
used as an intermediate format in the proposed synthesis methodology. The
selected intermediate format serves as a focal point for all potential
representation models. In order to synthesize a given function, a library
containing seven building blocks is used where each building block is a cycle
of length less than 6. To synthesize large cycles, we also propose a
decomposition algorithm which produces all possible minimal and inequivalent
factorizations for a given cycle of length greater than 5. All decompositions
contain the maximum number of disjoint cycles. The generated decompositions are
used in conjunction with a novel cycle assignment algorithm which is proposed
based on the graph matching problem to select the best possible cycle pairs.
Then, each pair is synthesized by using the available components of the
library. The decomposition algorithm together with the cycle assignment method
are considered as a binding method which selects a building block from the
library for each cycle. Finally, a post-synthesis optimization step is
introduced to optimize the synthesis results in terms of different costs.
