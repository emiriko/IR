The molecular structure of the wetting layer of ice on Pt(111) is resolved
using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Two structures observed previously
by diffraction techniques are imaged for coverages at or close to completion of
the wetting layer. At 140K only a sqrt(37) x sqrt(37) R25.3{\deg}
superstructure can be established, while at 130K also a sqrt(39) x sqrt(39)
R16.1{\deg} superstructure with slightly higher molecular density is formed. In
the temperature range under concern the superstructures reversibly transform
into each other by slight changes in coverage through adsorption or desorption.
The superstructures exhibit a complex pattern of molecules in different
geometries.
