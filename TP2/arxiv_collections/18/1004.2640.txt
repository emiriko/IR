Arguments based on general principles of quantum mechanics have suggested
that a minimum length associated with Planck-scale unification may in the
context of the holographic principle entail a new kind of observable
uncertainty in the transverse position of macroscopically separated objects.
Here, we address potential implications of such a position uncertainty for
establishing an additional threshold between quantum and classical behavior.
