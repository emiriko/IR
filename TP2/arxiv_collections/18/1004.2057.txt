In the replica-exchange molecular dynamics method, where constant-temperature
molecular dynamics simulations are performed in each replica, one usually
rescales the momentum of each particle after replica exchange. This rescaling
method had previously been worked out only for the Gaussian constraint method.
In this letter, we present momentum rescaling formulae for four other commonly
used constant-temperature algorithms, namely, Langevin dynamics, Andersen
algorithm, Nos\'{e}-Hoover thermostat, and Nos\'{e}-Poincar\'{e} thermostat.
The effectiveness of these rescaling methods is tested with a small
biomolecular system, and it is shown that proper momentum rescaling is
necessary to obtain correct results in the canonical ensemble.
