In this paper, we study CP violation in $\Lambda_c^+\to BP$ and
$\Lambda_c^+\to BV$ decays, where $B,P$ and $V$ denote a light spin-1/2 baryon,
pseudoscalar and a vector meson respectively. In these processes the $T$ odd CP
violating triple-product (TP) correlations are examined. The genuine CP
violating observables which are composed of the helicity amplitudes occurring
in the angular distribution are constructed. Experimentally, by performing a
full angular analysis it is shown how one may extract the helicity amplitudes
and then obtain the TP asymmetries. We estimate the TP asymmetries in $\lam$
decays to be negligible in the standard model making these processes an
excellent place to look for new physics. Taking a two Higgs doublet model, as
an example of new physics, we show that large TP asymmetries are possible in
these decays. Finally, we discuss how BES-III and Super $\tau$-Charm
experiments will be sensitive to these CP violating signals in $\Lambda_c^+$
decays.
