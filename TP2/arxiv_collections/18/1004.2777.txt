We analyze the dynamics of the helical edge modes of a quantum spin Hall
state in the presence of a spatially non-uniform Rashba spin-orbit (SO)
interaction. A randomly fluctuating Rashba SO coupling is found to open a
scattering channel which causes localization of the edge modes for a weakly
screened electron-electron (e-e) interaction. A periodic modulation of the SO
coupling, with a wave number commensurate with the Fermi momentum, makes the
edge insulating already at intermediate strengths of the e-e interaction. We
discuss implications for experiments on edge state transport in a HgTe quantum
well.
