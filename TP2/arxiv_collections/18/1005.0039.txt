We study effects of strong fluctuations on the transport properties of
superconductors near the classical critical point. In this regime conductivity
is set by the delicate interplay of two competing effects. The first is that
strong electron-electron interactions in the Cooper channel increase the
life-time of fluctuation Cooper pairs and thus enhance conductivity. On the
other hand, quantum pair-breaking effects tend to suppress superconductivity.
An interplay between these processes defines new regime where fluctuation
induced transport becomes more singular. The most singular contributions to the
conductivity stem from the dynamic Aslamazov-Larkin term, and novel
Maki-Thompson and interference corrections. The crossover temperature from
weakly to strongly fluctuating regime is generated self-consistently as the
result of scattering on dynamic variations of the order parameter. We suggest
that the way to probe nonlinear-fluctuations in superconductors is by
magnetoconductivity measurements in the perpendicular field.
