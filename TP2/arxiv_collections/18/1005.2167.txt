We construct line shapes for the X(3872) that generalize the Flatte and
zero-range line shapes that have been considered previously. These line shapes
are associated with scattering amplitudes that are exactly unitary for real
values of the interaction parameters and can be derived from a renormalizable
quantum field theory. The new line shapes can be used to discriminate between
the alternative binding mechanisms in which the X(3872) is generated either
dynamically by charm meson interactions or by a resonance near the D^{*0}
Dbar^0 threshold. If the resonance is identified with the P-wave charmonium
state chi'_{c1}, the interaction parameters can be constrained by using
charmonium phenomenology. We analyze data on the X(3872) and also data from the
Belle and Babar Collaborations on the invariant mass distribution of the charm
mesons from the decay B -> K + D^{*0} Dbar^0 up to 4000 MeV. Our analysis is
compatible with the mechanism for the X(3872) being either a fine-tuning of
charm meson interactions or the fine-tuning of the chi'_{c1} to the D^{*0}
Dbar^0 threshold. In particular, the data do not exclude a separate chi'_{c1}
resonance between the D^{*+} D^- threshold and 4000 MeV.
