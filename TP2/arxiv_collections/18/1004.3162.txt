Cancer is a proliferation disease affecting a genetically unstable cell
population, in which molecular alterations can be somatically inherited by
genetic, epigenetic or extragenetic transmission processes, leading to a
cooperation of neoplastic cells within tumoral tissue. The efflux protein
P-glycoprotein (P gp) is overexpressed in many cancer cells and has known
capacity to confer multidrug resistance to cytotoxic therapies. Recently,
cell-to-cell P-gp transfers have been shown. Herein, we combine experimental
evidence and a mathematical model to examine the consequences of an
intercellular P-gp trafficking in the extragenetic transfer of multidrug
resistance from resistant to sensitive cell subpopulations. We report
cell-to-cell transfers of functional P-gp in co-cultures of a P-gp
overexpressing human breast cancer MCF-7 cell variant, selected for its
resistance towards doxorubicin, with the parental sensitive cell line. We found
that P-gp as well as efflux activity distribution are progressively reorganized
over time in co-cultures analyzed by flow cytometry. A mathematical model based
on a Boltzmann type integro-partial differential equation structured by a
continuum variable corresponding to P-gp activity describes the cell
populations in co-culture. The mathematical model elucidates the population
elements in the experimental data, specifically, the initial proportions, the
proliferative growth rates, and the transfer rates of P-gp in the sensitive and
resistant subpopulations. We confirmed cell-to-cell transfer of functional
P-gp. The transfer process depends on the gradient of P-gp expression in the
donor-recipient cell interactions, as they evolve over time. Extragenetically
acquired drug resistance is an additional aptitude of neoplastic cells which
has implications in the diagnostic value of P-gp expression and in the design
of chemotherapy regimens
