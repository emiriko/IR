A Rapid evolution of mobile technologies has led to the development of more
sophisticated mobile devices with better storage, processing and transmission
power. These factors enable support to many types of application but also give
rise to a necessity to find a model of service development. Actually, SOA
(Service Oriented Architecture) is a good option to support application
development. This paper presents a framework that allows the development of SOA
based application in mobile environment. The objective of the framework is to
give developers with tools for provision of services in this environment with
the necessary security characteristics.
