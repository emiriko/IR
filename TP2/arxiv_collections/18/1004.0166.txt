The colour fields, created by a static gluon-quark-antiquark system, are
computed in quenched SU(3) lattice QCD, in a $24^3\times 48$ lattice at
$\beta=6.2$ and $a=0.07261(85)\,fm$. We compute the hybrid Wilson Loop
including the cases when the gluon and the antiquark are superposed, i. e., the
quark-antiquark case and when the quark and antiquark are superposed, i. e.,
the gluon-gluon case. The Casimir scaling is investigated, in the two gluon
glueball case the Casimir scaling is consistent with the formation of an
adjoint string. Measuring the decay of the tail in the mid section of the flux
tube for the two gluon glueball and for the quark-antiquark meson, we determine
the penetration length and present a gauge invariant effective dual gluon mass
of $0.905\pm0.163\,\text{GeV}$. We also try to determine the coherence length
comparing our results with the dual Ginzburg-Landau approach. With the
penetration length and the possible coherence length we determine a putative
Ginzburg-Landau dimensionless parameter, which is possibly consistent with a
type II superconductor picture. These results are obtained at fixed
quark-antiquark distance of 0.58 fm.
