In modern science, the thermo mechanics motion can be traced back to quantum
motion in micro viewpoint. On the other hand, the thermo mechanics is
definitely related with geometrical configuration motion (phase) in macro
viewpoint. On this sense, the thermomechanics should be formulated by two kinds
of motion: quantum motion and configuration motion. Its principle goal ought to
be bridge the gap between atomic physics and engineering practice. In this
research, the configuration motion is formulated by deformation geometrical
field (motion transformation tensor). The quantum motion is formulated by the
wave function of quantum state. Based on these two fields, the thermo stress is
formulated as the coupling of quantum motion and configuration motion. Along
this line, the entropy is interpreted and formulated according to
thermodynamics rules. For scalar entropy, the traditional meaning of entropy is
reserved. For infinitesimal configuration variation, the formulation is
degenerated to the traditional elasticity deformation. For large random
configuration deformation, the formulation is degenerated to the statistical
physics methods. This research supplies a possible formulation to bridge the
gap between the macro deformation and the micro quantum motion.
