The CoRoT 5-month long observation runs give us the opportunity to analyze a
large variety of red-giant stars and to derive fundamental stellar parameters
from their asteroseismic properties. We perform an analysis of more than 4\,600
CoRoT light curves to extract as much information as possible. We take into
account the characteristics of the star sample and of the method in order to
provide asteroseismic results as unbiased as possible. We also study and
compare the properties of red giants of two opposite regions of the Galaxy. We
analyze the time series with the envelope autocorrelation function in order to
extract precise asteroseismic parameters with reliable error bars. We examine
first the mean large frequency separation of solar-like oscillations and the
frequency of maximum seismic amplitude, then the parameters of the excess power
envelope. With the additional information of the effective temperature, we
derive the stellar mass and radius. We have identified more than 1\,800 red
giants among the 4\,600 light curves and have obtained accurate distributions
of the stellar parameters for about 930 targets. We were able to reliably
measure the mass and radius of several hundred red giants. We have derived
precise information on the stellar population distribution and on the red
clump. Comparison between the stars observed in two different fields shows that
the stellar asteroseismic properties are globally similar, but with different
characteristics for red-clump stars. This study shows the efficiency of
statistical asteroseismology: validating scaling relations allows us to infer
fundamental stellar parameters, to derive precise information on the red-giant
evolution and interior structure and to analyze and compare stellar populations
from different fields.
