We extend the definition of the recently introduced valence bond entanglement
entropy to arbitrary SU(2) wave functions of S=1/2 spin systems. Thanks to a
reformulation of this entanglement measure in terms of a projection, we are
able to compute it with various numerical techniques for frustrated spin
models. We provide extensive numerical data for the one-dimensional J1-J2 spin
chain where we are able to locate the quantum phase transition by using the
scaling of this entropy with the block size. We also systematically compare
with the scaling of the von Neumann entanglement entropy. We finally underline
that the valence-bond entropy definition does depend on the choice of
bipartition so that, for frustrated models, a "good" bipartition should be
chosen, for instance according to the Marshall sign.
