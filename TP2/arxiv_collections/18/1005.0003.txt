Suppose an experimentalist wishes to verify that his apparatus produces
entangled quantum states. A finite amount of data cannot conclusively
demonstrate entanglement, so drawing conclusions from real-world data requires
statistical reasoning. We propose a reliable method to quantify the weight of
evidence for (or against) entanglement, based on a likelihood ratio test. Our
method is universal in that it can be applied to any sort of measurements. We
demonstrate the method by applying it to two simulated experiments on two
qubits. The first measures a single entanglement witness, while the second
performs a tomographically complete measurement.
