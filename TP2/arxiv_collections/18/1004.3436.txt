We investigate here the ability of a Green-Naghdi model to reproduce strongly
nonlinear and dispersive wave propagation. We test in particular the behavior
of the new hybrid finite-volume and finite-difference splitting approach
recently developed by the authors and collaborators on the challenging
benchmark of waves propagating over a submerged bar. Such a configuration
requires a model with very good dispersive properties, because of the
high-order harmonics generated by topography-induced nonlinear interactions. We
thus depart from the aforementioned work and choose to use a new Green-Naghdi
system with improved frequency dispersion characteristics. The absence of dry
areas also allows us to improve the treatment of the hyperbolic part of the
equations. This leads to very satisfying results for the demanding benchmarks
under consideration.
