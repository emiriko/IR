Following Mach's definition of mass and force in terms of space time
measurement we build the conceptual structure of classical mechanics and show
that it is remarkably similar to the results of Carnot and Clausius in
thermodynamics. The analogy is extended to equality to derive the laws of
gravity from the laws of thermodynamics.
