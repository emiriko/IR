We investigate theoretically the stationary states of two bosons in a
one-dimensional optical lattice within the Bose-Hubbard model. Starting from a
finite lattice with periodic boundary conditions, we effect a partial
separation of the center-of-mass and relative motions of the two-atom lattice
dimer in the lattice momentum representation, and carefully analyze the
eigenstates of the relative motion. In the limit when the lattice becomes
infinitely long, we find closed-form analytic expressions for both the bound
state and the dissociated states of the lattice dimer. We outline the
corresponding analysis in the position representation. The results are used to
discuss three ways to detect the dimer: by measuring the momentum distribution
of the atoms, by finding the size of the molecule with measurements of atom
number correlations at two lattice sites, and by dissociating a bound state of
the lattice dimer with a modulation of the lattice depth.
