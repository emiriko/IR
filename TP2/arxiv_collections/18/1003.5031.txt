With the aid of the vector Ward-Takahashi identity we derive a general
formula for the quark number susceptibility (QNS) which expresses the QNS as an
integral expression only involving the full quark propagator at finite
temperature and chemical potential. The QNS at finite temperature and zero
chemical potential is calculated with the dressed quark propagator in the
Hard-Thermal-Loop (HTL) approximation. A comparison of our result with the
results of QNS in HTL approximation in previous literatures is given.
