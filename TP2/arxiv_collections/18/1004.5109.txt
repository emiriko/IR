We review some aspects, especially those we can tackle analytically, of a
minimal model of closed economy analogous to the kinetic theory model of ideal
gases where the agents exchange wealth amongst themselves such that the total
wealth is conserved, and each individual agent saves a fraction (0 < lambda <
1) of wealth before transaction. We are interested in the special case where
the fraction lambda is constant for all the agents (global saving propensity)
in the closed system. We show by moment calculations that the resulting wealth
distribution cannot be the Gamma distribution that was conjectured in Phys.
Rev. E 70, 016104 (2004). We also derive a form for the distribution at low
wealth, which is a new result.
