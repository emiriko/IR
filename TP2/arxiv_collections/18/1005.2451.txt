From optical spectroscopic measurements we determine that the HD 15407 binary
system is ~80 Myr old. The primary, HD 15407A (spectral type F5V), exhibits
strong mid-infrared excess emission indicative of a recent catastrophic
collision between rocky planetary embryos or planets in its inner planetary
system. Synthesis of all known stars with large quantities of dust in their
terrestrial planet zone indicates that for stars of roughly Solar mass this
warm dust phenomenon occurs at ages between 30 and 100 Myr. In contrast, for
stars of a few Solar masses, the dominant era of the final assembling of rocky
planets occurs earlier, between 10 and 30 Myr age. The incidence of the warm
dust phenomenon, when compared against models for the formation of rocky
terrestrial-like bodies, implies that rocky planet formation in the terrestrial
planet zone around Sun-like stars is common.
