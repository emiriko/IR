We explain the motivation and main idea of our work in reference
arXiv:0907.2476 [hep-th]. We present a simple model of multifield
Dirac-Born-Infeld inflation whose bispectrum exhibits a linear combination of
the equilateral and local shapes, which are usually considered as separate
possibilities. We also point out the presence of a particularly interesting
component of the primordial trispectrum.
