On the basis of the adiabatic self-consistent collective coordinate method,
we develop an efficient microscopic method of deriving the five-dimensional
quadrupole collective Hamiltonian and illustrate its usefulness by applying it
to the oblate-prolate shape coexistence/mixing phenomena in proton-rich
68,70,72Se. In this method, the vibrational and rotational collective masses
(inertial functions) are determined by local normal modes built on constrained
Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov states. Numerical calculations are carried out using
the pairing-plus-quadrupole Hamiltonian including the quadrupole-pairing
interaction. It is shown that the time-odd components of the moving mean-field
significantly increase the vibrational and rotational collective masses in
comparison with the Inglis-Belyaev cranking masses. Solving the collective
Schroedinger equation, we evaluate excitation spectra, quadrupole transitions
and moments. Results of the numerical calculation are in excellent agreement
with recent experimental data and indicate that the low-lying states of these
nuclei are characterized as an intermediate situation between the
oblate-prolate shape coexistence and the so-called gamma unstable situation
where large-amplitude triaxial-shape fluctuations play a dominant role.
