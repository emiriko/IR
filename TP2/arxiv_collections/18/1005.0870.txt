We present theoretical and experimental studies of Schottky diodes that use
aligned arrays of single walled carbon nanotubes. A simple physical model,
taking into account the basic physics of current rectification, can adequately
describe the single-tube and array devices. We show that for as grown array
diodes, the rectification ratio, defined by the
maximum-to-minimum-current-ratio, is low due to the presence of m-SWNT shunts.
These tubes can be eliminated in a single voltage sweep resulting in a high
rectification array device. Further analysis also shows that the channel
resistance, and not the intrinsic nanotube diode properties, limits the
rectification in devices with channel length up to ten micrometer.
