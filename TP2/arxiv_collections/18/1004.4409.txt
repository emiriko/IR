We previously observed that an intrinsic staking fault shrunk through a glide
of a Shockley partial dislocation terminating its lower end in a hard-sphere
crystal under gravity coherently grown in <001> by Monte Carlo simulations
[Mori et al., Molec. Phys. 105, 1377 (2007)]; it was an answer to a one-decade
long standing question why the stacking disorder in colloidal crystals reduced
under gravity [Zhu et al., Nature 387, 883 (1997)]. Here, we present an elastic
energy calculation; in addition to the self-energy of the partial dislocation
[Mori et al., Prog. Theor. Phys. Suppl. 178, 33 (2009)] we calculate the
cross-coupling term between elastic field due to gravity and that due to a
Shockley partial dislocation. The cross term is a increasing function of the
linear dimension R over which the elastic field expands, showing that a driving
force arises for the partial dislocation moving toward the upper boundary of a
grain.
