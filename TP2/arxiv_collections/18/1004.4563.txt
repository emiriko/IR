We study time evolutions of superfluid neutron stars, focussing on the nature
of the oscillation spectrum, the effect of mutual friction force on the
oscillations and the hydrodynamical spin-up phase of pulsar glitches. We
linearise the dynamical equations of a Newtonian two-fluid model for rapidly
rotating backgrounds. In the axisymmetric equilibrium configurations, the two
fluid components corotate and are in beta-equilibrium. We use analytical
equations of state that generate stratified and non-stratified stellar models,
which enable us to study the coupling between the dynamical degrees of freedom
of the system. By means of time evolutions of the linearised dynamical
equations, we determine the spectrum of axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric
oscillation modes, accounting for the contribution of the gravitational
potential perturbations, i.e. without adopting the Cowling approximation. We
study the mutual friction damping of the superfluid oscillations and consider
the effects of the non-dissipative part of the mutual friction force on the
mode frequencies. We also provide technical details and relevant tests for the
hydrodynamical model of pulsar glitches discussed by Sidery, Passamonti and
Andersson (2010). In particular, we describe the method used to generate the
initial data that mimic the pre-glitch state, and derive the equations that are
used to extract the gravitational-wave signal.
