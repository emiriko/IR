The Sun affects the Earth's physical phenomena in multiple ways, in
particular the material in interplanetary space comes from coronal expansion in
the form of inhomogeneous plasma flow (solar wind), which is the primary source
of the interplanetary medium. Ground-based Interplanetary Scintillation (IPS)
observations are an important and effective method for measuring solar wind
speed and the structures of small diameter radio sources. We discuss one mode
of ground-based single-station observations: Single-Station Single-Frequency
(SSSF) mode. To realize the SSSF mode, a new system has been established at
Urumqi Astronomical Observatory (UAO), China, and a series of experimental
observations were carried out successfully from May to December, 2008.
