Consider the consolidation process typical of soils, this phenomenon is
expected not to exhibit a unique state of equilibrium, depending on the
\textit{external loading} and the constitutive parameters. Beyond the standard
solution, also pore-fluid segregation, which is typically associated with
fluidization of the granular material, can arise. Pore-fluid segregation has
been recognized as a phenomenon typical of the short time behavior of a
saturated porous slab or a saturated porous sphere, during consolidation. In
both circumstances Biot's three dimensional model provides time increasing
values of the water pressure (and fluid mass density) at the center of the slab
(or of the sphere), at early times, if the Lam\'{e} constant $\mu$ of the
skeleton is different from zero. This localized pore-fluid segregation is known
in the literature as Mandel--Cryer effect. In this paper a non linear
poromechanical model is formulated. The model is able to describe the
occurrence of two states of equilibrium and the switching from one to the other
by considering a kind of \textit{phase transition}. Extending classical Biot's
theory a more than quadratic strain energy potential is postulated, depending
on the strain of the porous material and the variation of the fluid mass
density (measured with respect to the skeleton reference volume). When the
consolidating pressure is strong enough the existence of two distinct minima is
proven.
