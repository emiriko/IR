The measurements of the neutrino and quark mixing angles satisfy the
empirical relations called Quark-Lepton Complementarity. These empirical
relations suggest the existence of a correlation between the mixing matrices of
leptons and quarks. In this work, we examine the possibility that this
correlation between the mixing angles of quarks and leptons originates in the
similar hierarchy of quarks and charged lepton masses and the seesaw mechanism
type~I, that gives mass to the Majorana neutrinos. We assume that the similar
mass hierarchies of charged lepton and quark masses allows us to represent all
the mass matrices of Dirac fermions in terms of a universal form with four
texture zeroes.
