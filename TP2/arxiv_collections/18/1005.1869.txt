The structure of neutron rich nitrogen nuclei has been studied by use of
neutron removal reaction and inelastic scattering. Mass and charge deformations
have been deduced for the first excited state of 21N, which indicates the
partial persitence of the N=14 subshell closure in nitrogen isotopes. The
spectroscopic information obtained on the structure of 19,20,21N confirms the
results from a previous experiment.
