We propose a pump scheme for quantum circulations, including
counter-circulations for superposition states, of a spinor Bose-Einstein
condensate. Our scheme is efficient and can be implemented within current
experimental technologies and setups. It remains valid for non-classical atomic
states, such as pseudo-spin squeezed states and maximal entangled N-GHZ or NooN
states. Moreover, it is capable of transforming several enhanced sensing
protocols relying on reduced fluctuations from quantum correlation and
entanglement of atomic internal states to enhanced measurement of spatial
interference and rotation.
