The electronic and magnetic properties of transition-metal doped
$\beta$-Ge3N4 have been studied using first-principles calculations. The
results show that the substitutional transition-metal impurities tend to
cluster. The V and Cr doped Ge3N4 compounds are ferromagnetic semiconductors,
while the compounds with Mn and Fe doping show a half-metallic ferromagnetic
character.
