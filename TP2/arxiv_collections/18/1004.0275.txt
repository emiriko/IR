We study the effect of gluon number fluctuations (Pomeron loops) on the
impact parameter behavior of the scattering amplitude in the fixed coupling
case. We demonstrate that the dipole-hadron cross-section computed from gluon
number fluctuations saturates the Froissart bound and the growth of the radius
of the black disk with rapidity is enhanced by an additional term as compared
to the single event case. We find that the physical amplitude has a Gaussian
impact parameter dependence once the gluon number fluctuations are included.
This indicates that the fluctuations may be the microscopic origin for the
Gaussian impact parameter dependence of the scattering amplitude.
