We examine the breaking of $Z_N$ symmetry recently reported for the Twisted
Eguchi-Kawai model (TEK). We analyse the origin of this behaviour and propose
simple modifications of twist and lattice action that could avoid the problem.
Our results show no sign of symmetry breaking and allow us to obtain values of
the large $N$ infinite volume string tension in agreement with extrapolations
from results based upon straightforward methods.
