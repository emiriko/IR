We have fabricated high-quality FeSe1-x superconducting films with a bulk Tc
of 11-12 K on different substrates, Al2O3(0001), SrTiO3(100), MgO(100), and
LaAlO3(100), by using a pulsed laser deposition technique. All the films were
grown at a high substrate temperature of 610 oC, and were preferentially
oriented along the (101) direction, the latter being to be a key to fabricating
of FeSe1-x superconducting thin films with high Tc. According to the energy
dispersive spectroscopy data, the Fe:Se composition ratio was 1:0.90+-0.02. The
FeSe1-x film grown on a SrTiO3 substrate showed the best quality with a high
upper critical magnetic field [Hc2(0)] of 56 T.
