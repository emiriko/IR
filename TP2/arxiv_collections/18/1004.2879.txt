The unsatisfactory status of the search for a consistent and predictive
quantization of gravity is taken as motivation to study the question whether
geometrical laws could be more fundamental than quantization procedures. In
such an approach the quantum mechanical laws should emerge from the geometrical
theory. A toy model that incorporates the idea is presented and its necessary
formulation in configuration space is emphasized.
