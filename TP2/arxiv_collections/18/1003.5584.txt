Titanium nitride (TiNx) films are ideal for use in superconducting
microresonator detectors because: a) the critical temperature varies with
composition (0 < Tc < 5 K); b) the normal-state resistivity is large, \rho_n ~
100 $\mu$Ohm cm, facilitating efficient photon absorption and providing a large
kinetic inductance and detector responsivity; and c) TiN films are very hard
and mechanically robust. Resonators using reactively sputtered TiN films show
remarkably low loss (Q_i > 10^7) and have noise properties similar to
resonators made using other materials, while the quasiparticle lifetimes are
reasonably long, 10-200 $\mu$s. TiN microresonators should therefore reach
sensitivities well below 10^-19 WHz^(-1/2).
