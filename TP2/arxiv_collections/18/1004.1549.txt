We present a VLT/FORS1 imaging and spectroscopic survey of the Wolf-Rayet
(WR) population in the Sculptor group spiral galaxy NGC 7793. We identify 74
emission line candidates from archival narrow-band imaging, from which 39 were
observed with the Multi Object Spectroscopy (MOS) mode of FORS1. 85% of these
sources displayed WR features. Additional slits were used to observe HII
regions, enabling an estimate of the metallicity gradient of NGC 7793 using
strong line calibrations, from which a central oxygen content of log (O/H) + 12
= 8.6 was obtained, falling to 8.25 at R_25. We have estimated WR populations
using a calibration of line luminosities of Large Magellanic Cloud stars,
revealing ~27 WN and ~25 WC stars from 29 sources spectroscopically observed.
Photometric properties of the remaining candidates suggest an additional ~27 WN
and ~8 WC stars. A comparison with the WR census of the LMC suggests that our
imaging survey has identified 80% of WN stars and 90% for the WC subclass.
Allowing for incompleteness, NGC 7793 hosts ~105 WR stars for which
N(WC)/N(WN)~0.5. From our spectroscopy of HII regions in NGC 7793, we revise
the global Halpha star formation rate of Kennicutt et al. upward by 50% to 0.45
M_sun/yr. This allows us to obtain N(WR)/N(O)~0.018, which is somewhat lower
than that resulting from the WR census by Schild et al. of another Sculptor
group spiral NGC 300, whose global physical properties are similar to NGC 7793.
Finally, we also report the fortuitous detection of a bright (m_V = 20.8 mag)
background quasar Q2358-32 at z~2.02 resulting from CIV 1548-51 redshifted to
the 4684 passband.
