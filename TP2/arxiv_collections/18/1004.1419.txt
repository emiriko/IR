A model to investigate Thermally Stimulated Depolarization Current (TSDC)
peak parameters using the dipole-dipole interaction concept is proposed by the
author in this work. The proposed model describe the (TSDC) peak successfully
since it gives a significant peak parameters (i.e. Activation energy (E) and
the per-exponential factor (\tau_0) in addition to the dipole-dipole
interaction strength parameter (di). Application of this model to determine the
peak parameters of polyvinyl chloride(PVC) polymer is presented . The results
show how the model fit the experimental thermal sampling data. Finally the
results are compared to the well know techniques; the initial rise method (IR),
the half width method (HW) in addition to the Cowell and Woods analysis.
