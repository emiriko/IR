One of the most effective techniques of experimental mathematics is to
compute mathematical entities such as integrals, series or limits to high
precision, then attempt to recognize the resulting numerical values. Recently
these techniques have been applied with great success to problems in
mathematical physics. Notable among these applications are the identification
of some key multi-dimensional integrals that arise in Ising theory, quantum
field theory and in magnetic spin theory.
