Given a collection of N solutions of the (3+1) vacuum Einstein constraint
equations which are asymptotically Euclidean, we show how to construct a new
solution of the constraints which is itself asymptotically Euclidean, and which
contains specified sub-regions of each of the N given solutions. This
generalizes earlier work which handled the time-symmetric case, thus providing
a construction of large classes of initial data for the many body problem in
general relativity.
