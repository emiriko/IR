Let $C\to M$ be the bundle of connections of a principal bundle on $M$. The
solutions to Hamilton-Cartan equations for a gauge-invariant Lagrangian density
$\Lambda $ on $C$ satisfying a weak condition of regularity, are shown to admit
an affine fibre-bundle structure over the set of solutions to Euler-Lagrange
equations for $\Lambda $. This structure is also studied for the Jacobi fields
and for the moduli space of extremals.
