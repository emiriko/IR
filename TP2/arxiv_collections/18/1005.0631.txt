In high density QCD the hadron production stems from decay of mini-jets that
have the transverse momenta of the order of the saturation scale. It is shown
in this paper that this idea is able to describe in a unique fashion both the
inclusive hadron production for \sqrt{s} \geq 546 GeV including the first data
from LHC and the deep inelastic scattering at HERA. Recently reported data from
ALICE, CMS and ATLAS including inclusive charged-hadron transverse-momentum and
multiplicity distribution in pp collisions are well described in our approach.
We provide predictions for the upcoming LHC measurements.
