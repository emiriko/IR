We present spontaneous symmetry breaking in a nanoscale version of a setup
prolific in classical mechanics: two coupled nanomechanical pendulums. The two
pendulums are electron shuttles fabricated as nanopillars and placed between
two capacitor plates in a homogeneous electric field. Instead of being
mechanically coupled through a spring they exchange electrons, i.e. they
shuttle electrons from the source to the drain 'capacitor plate'. Nonzero DC
current through this system by external AC excitation is caused via dynamical
symmetry breaking. This symmetry-broken current appears at sub- and
superharmonics of the fundamental mode of the coupled system.
