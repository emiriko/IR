We developed a microscope intended to probe, using a parallel heterodyne
receiver, the fluctuation spectrum of light quasi-elastically scattered by gold
nanoparticles diffusing in viscous fluids. The cutoff frequencies of the
recorded spectra scale up linearly with those expected from single scattering
formalism in a wide range of dynamic viscosities (1 to 15 times water viscosity
at room temperature). Our scheme enables ensemble-averaged optical fluctuations
measurements over multispeckle recordings in low light, at temporal frequencies
up to 10 kHz, with a 12 Hz framerate array detector.
