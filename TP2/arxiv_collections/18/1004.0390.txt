Proposals for ground-based laser remediation of space debris rely on the
creation of appropriately directed ablation-driven impulses to either divert
the fragment or drive it into an orbit with a perigee allowing atmospheric
capture. For a spherical fragment, the ablation impulse is a function of the
orbital parameters and the laser engagement angle. If, however, the target is
irregularly shaped and arbitrarily oriented, new impulse effects come into
play. Here we present an analysis of some of these effects.
