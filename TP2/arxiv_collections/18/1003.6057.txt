A special algorithm for the Fourier-transform Ghost Imaging (GI) scheme is
discussed based on the Compressive Sampling (CS) theory. The CS algorithm could
also be used for the Fourier spectrum reconstruction of pure phase object by
setting a proper sensing matrix. This could find its application in diffraction
imaging of X-ray, neutron and electron with higher efficiency and resolution.
Experiment results are also presented to prove the feasibility.
