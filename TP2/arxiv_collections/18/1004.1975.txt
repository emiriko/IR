We observe signatures of disorder-induced order in 1D XY spin chains with an
external, site-dependent uni-axial random field within the XY plane. We
numerically investigate signatures of a quantum phase transition at T=0, in
particular an upsurge of the magnetization in the direction orthogonal to the
external magnetic field, and the scaling of the block-entropy with the
amplitude of this field. Also, we discuss possible realizations of this effect
in ultra-cold atom experiments.
