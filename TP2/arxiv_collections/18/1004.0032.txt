We investigate the stability of low-friction sliding of nanocrystal with
rectangular atomic arrangement on rectangular lattices, for which analytical
results can be obtained. We find that several incommensurate periodic orbits
exist and are stable against thermal fluctuations and other perturbations. As
incommensurate orientations lead to low corrugation, and therefore low
friction, such incommensurate periodic orbits are interesting for the study of
nanotribology. The analytical results compare very well with simulations of W
nanocrystals on NaF(001). The geometry and high typical corrugation of
substrates with square lattices increase the robustness compared to typical
hexagonal lattices, such as graphite.
