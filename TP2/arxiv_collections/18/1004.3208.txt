Context: Gamma Ray Burst models predict the broadband spectral evolution and
the temporal evolution of the energy flux. In contrast, standard data analysis
tools and data repositories provide count-rate data, or use single flux
conversion factors for all of the data, neglecting spectral evolution. Aims: To
produce Swift BAT and XRT light curves in flux units, where the spectral
evolution is accounted for. Methods: We have developed software to use the
hardness ratio information to track spectral evolution of GRBs, and thus to
convert the count-rate light curves from the BAT and XRT instruments on Swift
into accurate, evolution-aware flux light curves. Results: The Swift Burst
Analyser website (http://www.swift.ac.uk/burst_analyser) contains BAT, XRT and
combined BAT-XRT flux light curves in three energy regimes for all GRBs
observed by the Swift satellite. These light curves are automatically built and
updated when data become available, are presented in graphical and plain-text
format, and are available for download and use in research.
