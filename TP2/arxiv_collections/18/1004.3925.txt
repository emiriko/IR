This paper proposes a new probabilistic classification algorithm using a
Markov random field approach. The joint distribution of class labels is
explicitly modelled using the distances between feature vectors. Intuitively, a
class label should depend more on class labels which are closer in the feature
space, than those which are further away. Our approach builds on previous work
by Holmes and Adams (2002, 2003) and Cucala et al. (2008). Our work shares many
of the advantages of these approaches in providing a probabilistic basis for
the statistical inference. In comparison to previous work, we present a more
efficient computational algorithm to overcome the intractability of the Markov
random field model. The results of our algorithm are encouraging in comparison
to the k-nearest neighbour algorithm.
