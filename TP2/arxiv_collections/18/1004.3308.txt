The open cluster M67 has solar metallicity and an age of about 4Gyr. The
turn-off mass is close to the minimum mass for which solar metallicity stars
develop a convective core during main sequence evolution as a result of the
development of hydrogen burning through the CNO-cycle. The morphology of the
color-magnitude-diagram (CMD) of M67 around the turn-off shows a clear
hook-like feature, direct sign that stars close to the turn-off have convective
cores. VandenBerg et al. investigated the possibility of using the morphology
of the M67 turn-off to put constraints on the solar metallicity, particularly
CNO elements, for which solar abundances have been revised downwards by more
than 30% over the last few years. Here, we extend their work filling in the
gaps in their analysis. To this aim, we compute isochrones appropriate for M67
using new (low metallicity) and old (high metallicity) solar abundances and
study whether the characteristic turn-off in the CMD of M67 can be reproduced
or not. We also study the importance of other constitutive physics on
determining the presence of such a hook, particularly element diffusion,
overshooting and nuclear reaction rates. We find that using the new solar
abundance determinations, with low CNO abundances, makes it more difficult to
reproduce the characteristic CMD of M67. This result is in agreement with
results by VandenBerg et al. However, changes in the constitutive physics of
the models, particularly overshooting, can influence and alter this result to
the extent that isochrones constructed with models using low CNO solar
abundances can also reproduce the turn-off morphology in M67. We conclude that
only if all factors affecting the turn-off morphology are completely under
control (and this is not the case), M67 could be used to put constraints on
solar abundances.
