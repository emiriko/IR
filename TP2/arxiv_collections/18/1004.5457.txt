We present realistic Kondo-lattice simulation results for the
recently-discovered heavy-fermion antiferromagnet CePt2In7 comparing with its
three-dimensional counterpart CeIn3 and the less two-dimensional ones,
Ce-115's. We find that the distance to the magnetic quantum critical point is
the largest for CeIn3 and the smallest for Ce-115's, and CePt2In7 falls in
between. We argue that the trend in quasi-two-dimensional materials stems from
the frequency dependence of the hybridization between Cerium 4f-electrons and
the conduction bands.
