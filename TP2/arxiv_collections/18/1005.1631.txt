From the paper of the first author it follows that upper and lower bounds for
$\gamma$-vector of a simple polytope imply the bounds for its $g$-,$h$- and
$f$-vectors. In the paper of the second author it was obtained unimprovable
upper and lower bounds for $\gamma$-vectors of flag nestohedra, particularly
Gal's conjecture was proved for this case. In the present paper we obtain
unimprovable upper and lower bounds for $\gamma$-vectors (consequently, for
$g$-,$h$- and $f$-vectors) of graph-associahedra and some its important
subclasses. We use the constructions that for an $(n-1)$-dimensional
graph-associahedron $P_{\Gamma_n}$ give the $n$-dimensional graph-associahedron
$P_{\Gamma_{n+1}}$ that is obtained from the cylinder $P_{\Gamma_n}\times I$ by
sequential shaving some facets of its bases. We show that the well-known series
of polytopes (associahedra, cyclohedra, permutohedra and stellohedra) can be
derived by these constructions. As a corollary we obtain inductive formulas for
$\gamma$- and $h$- vectors of the mentioned series. These formulas communicate
the method of differential equations developed by the first author with the
method of shavings developed by the second author.
