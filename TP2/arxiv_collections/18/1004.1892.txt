We report a temperature-dependent Raman scattering investigation of DyScO3
and GdScO3 single crystals from room temperature up to 1200 {\deg}C. With
increasing temperature, all modes decrease monotonously in wavenumber without
anomaly, which attests the absence of a structural phase transition. The high
temperature spectral signature and extrapolation of band positions to higher
temperatures suggest a decreasing orthorhombic distortion towards the ideal
cubic structure. Our study indicates that this orthorhombic-to-cubic phase
transition is close to or higher than the melting point of both rare-earth
scandates (\approx 2100 {\deg}C), which might exclude the possibility of the
experimental observation of such a phase transition before melting. The
temperature-dependent shift of Raman phonons is also discussed in the context
of thermal expansion.
