We show the explicit embedding of the Cremmer-Scherk configuration into
SO(16) Gauge theory and that the non-Abelian flux breaks the gauge symmetry
SO(16) to SO(10). Adjoint scalar fields of SO(10) coming from components of six
compact directions become massive. There are several scalar fields beloging to
the representation 10, which may break SO(10).
