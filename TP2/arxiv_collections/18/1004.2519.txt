This paper considers robust filtering for a nominal Gaussian state-space
model, when a relative entropy tolerance is applied to each time increment of a
dynamical model. The problem is formulated as a dynamic minimax game where the
maximizer adopts a myopic strategy. This game is shown to admit a saddle point
whose structure is characterized by applying and extending results presented
earlier in [1] for static least-squares estimation. The resulting minimax
filter takes the form of a risk-sensitive filter with a time varying risk
sensitivity parameter, which depends on the tolerance bound applied to the
model dynamics and observations at the corresponding time index. The
least-favorable model is constructed and used to evaluate the performance of
alternative filters. Simulations comparing the proposed risk-sensitive filter
to a standard Kalman filter show a significant performance advantage when
applied to the least-favorable model, and only a small performance loss for the
nominal model.
