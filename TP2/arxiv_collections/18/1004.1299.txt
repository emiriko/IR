The perturbation analysis of the bounce action-angle coordinates $(J,\zeta)$
for charged particles trapped in an axisymmetric dipole magnetic field is
presented. First, the lowest-order bounce action-angle coordinates are derived
for deeply-trapped particles in the harmonic-oscillator approximation. Next,
the Lie-transform perturbation method is used to derive higher-order anharmonic
action-angle corrections. Explicit expressions (with anharmonic corrections)
for the canonical parallel coordinates $s(J,\zeta)$ and $p_{\|}(J,\zeta)$ are
presented, which satisfy the canonical identity $\{s,\; p_{\|}\}(J,\zeta)
\equiv 1$. Lastly, analytical expressions for the bounce and drift frequencies
(which include anharmonic corrections) yield excellent agreement with exact
numerical results.
