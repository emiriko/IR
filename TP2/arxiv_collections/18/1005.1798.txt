Dark current is shown to be significantly reduced in quantum well infrared
photodetectors in the tunneling regime, i.e. at very low temperature, by
shifting the dopant impurity layers away from the central part of the wells.
This result confirms that the interwell tunneling current is dominated by
charged impurity scattering in usual structures. The experimental results are
in good quantitative agreement with the proposed theory. This dark current
reduction is pushing further the ultimate performances of quantum well infrared
photodetectors for the detection of low infrared photon fluxes. Routes to
further improvements are briefly sketched.
