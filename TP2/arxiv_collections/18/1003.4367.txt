We study the classical dynamics of a quasiperiodic kicked rotor, whose
quantum counterpart is known to be an equivalent of the 3D Anderson model.
Using this correspondence allowed for a recent experimental observation of the
Anderson transition with atomic matter waves. In such a context, it is
particularly important to assert the chaotic character of the classical
dynamics of this system. We show here that it is a 3D anisotropic diffusion.
Our simple analytical predictions for the associated diffusion tensor are found
in good agreement with the results of numerical simulations.
