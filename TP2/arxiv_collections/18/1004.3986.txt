This paper develops strong solutions and stochastic solutions for the
tempered fractional diffusion equation on bounded domains. First the eigenvalue
problem for tempered fractional derivatives is solved. Then a separation of
variables, and eigenfunction expansions in time and space, are used to write
strong solutions. Finally, stochastic solutions are written in terms of an
inverse subordinator.
