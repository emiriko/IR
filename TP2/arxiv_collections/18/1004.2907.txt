We prove super-quadratic lower bounds for the growth of the filling area
function of a certain class of Carnot groups. This class contains groups for
which it is known that their Dehn function grows no faster than $n^2\log n$. We
therefore obtain the existence of (finitely generated) nilpotent groups whose
Dehn functions do not have exactly polynomial growth and we thus answer a
well-known question about the possible growth rate of Dehn functions of
nilpotent groups.
