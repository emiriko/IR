Using data, provided by WMAP7, I calculate the entropy of the visible
universe, where visible refers to electromagnetic radiation, and hence the
visible universe is bounded by the Surface of Last Scatter. The dimensionless
entropy, $S/k$, is $(8.85 \pm 0.37)$ times larger than allowed by a simplified
and non-covariant holographic principle, that the entropy cannot exceed that of
a black hole. The measurement of a shift parameter, introduced by Bond,
Efstathiou and Tegmark in 1997, plays an important role in the accuracy of the
calculation, which leads to the large discrepancy.
