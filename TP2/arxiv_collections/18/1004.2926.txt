This paper introduces the Reed Muller Sieve, a deterministic measurement
matrix for compressed sensing. The columns of this matrix are obtained by
exponentiating codewords in the quaternary second order Reed Muller code of
length $N$. For $k=O(N)$, the Reed Muller Sieve improves upon prior methods for
identifying the support of a $k$-sparse vector by removing the requirement that
the signal entries be independent. The Sieve also enables local detection; an
algorithm is presented with complexity $N^2 \log N$ that detects the presence
or absence of a signal at any given position in the data domain without
explicitly reconstructing the entire signal. Reconstruction is shown to be
resilient to noise in both the measurement and data domains; the $\ell_2 /
\ell_2$ error bounds derived in this paper are tighter than the $\ell_2 /
\ell_1$ bounds arising from random ensembles and the $\ell_1 /\ell_1$ bounds
arising from expander-based ensembles.
