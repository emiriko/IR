We investigate the rotational emission from dust grains that rotate around
non- principal axes. We argue that in many phases of the interstellar medium,
the smallest grains, which dominate spinning dust emission, are likely to have
their nutation state (orientation of principal axes relative to the angular
momentum vector) randomized during each thermal spike. We recompute the
excitation and damping rates associated with rotational emission from the grain
permanent dipole, grain-plasma interactions, infrared photon emission, and
collisions. The resulting spinning dust spectra gener- ally show a shift toward
higher emissivities and peak frequencies relative to previous calculations.
