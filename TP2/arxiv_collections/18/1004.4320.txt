Reversible logic has applications in various research areas including signal
processing, cryptography and quantum computation. In this paper, direct
NCT-based synthesis of a given $k$-cycle in a cycle-based synthesis scenario is
examined. To this end, a set of seven building blocks is proposed that reveals
the potential of direct synthesis of a given permutation to reduce both quantum
cost and average runtime. To synthesize a given large cycle, we propose a
decomposition algorithm to extract the suggested building blocks from the input
specification. Then, a synthesis method is introduced which uses the building
blocks and the decomposition algorithm. Finally, a hybrid synthesis framework
is suggested which uses the proposed cycle-based synthesis method in
conjunction with one of the recent NCT-based synthesis approaches which is
based on Reed-Muller (RM) spectra. The time complexity and the effectiveness of
the proposed synthesis approach are analyzed in detail. Our analyses show that
the proposed hybrid framework leads to a better quantum cost in the worst-case
scenario compared to the previously presented methods. The proposed framework
always converges and typically synthesizes a given specification very fast
compared to the available synthesis algorithms. Besides, the quantum costs of
benchmark functions are improved about 20% on average (55% in the best case).
