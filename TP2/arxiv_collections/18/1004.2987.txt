We study hot carrier transport under magnetic fields up to 15 T in suspended
graphitic multilayers through differential conductance (dI/dV) spectroscopy.
Distinct high-energy dI/dV anomalies have been observed and shown to be related
to intrinsic phonon-emission processes in graphite. The evolution of such dI/dV
anomalies under magnetic fields is further understood as a consequence of
inter-Landau level cyclotron-phonon resonance scattering. The observed
magneto-phonon effects not only shed light on the physical mechanisms
responsible for high-current transport in graphitic systems, but also offer new
perspectives for optimizing performance in graphitic nano-electronic devices.
