Assuming that AXPs and SGRs accrete matter from a fallback disk, we attempt
to explain both the soft and the hard X-ray emission as the result of the
accretion process. We also attempt to explain their radio emission or the lack
of it. We test the hypothesis that the power-law, hard X-ray spectra are
produced in the accretion flow mainly by bulk-motion Comptonization of soft
photons emitted at the neutron star surface. Fallback disk models invoke
surface dipole magnetic fields of $10^{12} - 10^{13}$ G, which is what we
assume here. Unlike normal X-ray pulsars, for which the accretion rate is
highly super-Eddington, the accretion rate is approximately Eddington in AXPs
and SGRs and thus the bulk-motion Comptonization operates efficiently. As an
illustrative example we reproduce both the hard and the soft X-ray spectra of
AXP 4U 0142+61 well using the XSPEC package compTB. Our model seems to explain
both the hard and the soft X-ray spectra of AXPs and SGRs, as well as their
radio emission or the lack of it, in a natural way. It might also explain the
short bursts observed in these sources. On the other hand, it cannot explain
the giant X-ray outbursts observed in SGRs, which may result from the
conversion of magnetic energy in local multipole fields.
