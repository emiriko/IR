Two component Bose gas in a double well potential with repulsive interactions
may undergo a phase separation transition if the inter-species interactions
outweigh the intra-species ones. We analyze the transition in the strong
interaction limit within the two-mode approximation. Numbers of particles in
each potential well are equal and constant. However, at the transition point,
the ground state of the system reveals huge fluctuations of numbers of
particles belonging to the different gas components. That is, probability for
observation of any mixture of particles in each potential well becomes uniform.
