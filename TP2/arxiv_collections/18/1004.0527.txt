We quantize the Brownian motion undergone by a free particle in the absence
of inertial force (the so-called large friction regime) as described by the
diffusion equation early found out by Einstein in 1905. Accordingly, we are
able to come up with a time-dependent attractive quantum force F(t) that acts
upon the Brownian free particle as a result of quantum-mechanical thermal
fluctuations of a heat bath consisting of a set of quantum harmonic oscillators
having the same oscillation frequency /omega in thermodynamic equilibrium at
temperature T. More specifically, at zero temperature we predict that the
zero-point force is given by F^((T=0)) (t)=-[\omega/(1+2\omegat)^(3/2)]
\sqrt(\gamma/2), where \gamma is the friction constant with dimensions of mass
per time and /eta the Planck constant divided by 2\pi. For evolution times
t~1/\omega, \omega~0^14 Hz, /gamma~10^(-10) kg/s, and /eta~10^(-34) m^2 kg/s,
we find out F^((T=0)) ~10^(-8) N, which exhibits the same magnitude order as
the Casimir electromagnetic quantum force, for instance. Thus, we reckon that
novel quantum effects arising from our concept of time-dependent thermal
quantum force F(t) may be borne out by some experimental set-up in
nanotechnology.
