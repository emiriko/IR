Local symmetries of a non-expanding horizon has been investigated in the 1st
order formulation of gravity. When applied to a spherically symmetric isolated
horizon only a U(1) subgroup of the Lorentz group survives as residual local
symmetry that one can make use of in constructing an effective theory on the
horizon.
