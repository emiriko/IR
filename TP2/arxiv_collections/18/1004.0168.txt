Hadron spectroscopy has been an essential part of the physics program with
the CLAS detector in experimental Hall B at Jefferson Lab. Production of baryon
and meson resonances with high energy (polarized) electron and photon beams was
studied on a veriety of targets, ranging from hydrogen to lead. Physics topics
of interest include: investigation of the spectrum of baryon and meson
resonances, transition form-factors, meson-nucleon couplings (mesons in
nuclei), and search for exotic and missing states. With the 12 GeV upgrade of
the CEBAF machine, hadron spectroscopy in Hall B will be extended to a new
domain of higher mass resonances and the range of higher transferred momentum
using up to 11 GeV electron beams and the upgraded CLAS12 detector. In this
paper a brief description of the CLAS12 detector and the physics program
adopted for 12 GeV with emphasis to baryon and meson spectroscopy is presented.
