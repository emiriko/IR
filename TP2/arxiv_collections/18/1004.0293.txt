We review X-ray properties of the Supergiant Fast X-ray Transients following
from their observations with INTEGRAL and show that a compact object in these
systems is a neutron star with strong magnetic field accreting from the stellar
wind of a donor star. We show that presence of a centrifugal barrier at the
magnetospheric boundary of the neutron star may be a key to understanding of
abrupt short X-ray outbursts of these transients and long intervals of their
quiescence.
