We analyze the properties of a nonlinear metamaterial formed by integrating
nonlinear components or materials into the capacitive regions of metamaterial
elements. A straightforward homogenization procedure leads to general
expressions for the nonlinear susceptibilities of the composite metamaterial
medium. The expressions are convenient, as they enable inhomogeneous system of
scattering elements to be described as a continuous medium using the standard
notation of nonlinear optics. We illustrate the validity and accuracy of our
theoretical framework by performing measurements on a fabricated metamaterial
sample composed of an array of split ring resonators (SRRs) with packaged
varactors embedded in the capacitive gaps in a manner similar to that of Wang
et al. [Opt. Express 16, 16058 (2008)]. Because the SRRs exhibit a predominant
magnetic response to electromagnetic fields, the varactor-loaded SRR composite
can be described as a magnetic material with nonlinear terms in its effective
magnetic susceptibility. Treating the composite as a nonlinear effective
medium, we can quantitatively assess the performance of the medium to enhance
and facilitate nonlinear processes, including second harmonic generation,
three- and four-wave mixing, self-focusing and other well-known nonlinear
phenomena. We illustrate the accuracy of our approach by predicting the
intensity-dependent resonance frequency shift in the effective permeability of
the varactor-loaded SRR medium and comparing with experimental measurements.
