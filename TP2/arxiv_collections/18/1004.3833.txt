This paper stands at the intersection of two distinct lines of research. One
line is "holographic algorithms," a powerful approach introduced by Valiant for
solving various counting problems in computer science; the other is "normal
factor graphs," an elegant framework proposed by Forney for representing codes
defined on graphs. We introduce the notion of holographic transformations for
normal factor graphs, and establish a very general theorem, called the
generalized Holant theorem, which relates a normal factor graph to its
holographic transformation. We show that the generalized Holant theorem on the
one hand underlies the principle of holographic algorithms, and on the other
hand reduces to a general duality theorem for normal factor graphs, a special
case of which was first proved by Forney. In the course of our development, we
formalize a new semantics for normal factor graphs, which highlights various
linear algebraic properties that potentially enable the use of normal factor
graphs as a linear algebraic tool.
