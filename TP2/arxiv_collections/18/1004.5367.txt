We propose non-binary LDPC codes concatenated with multiplicative repetition
codes. By multiplicatively repeating the (2,3)-regular non-binary LDPC mother
code of rate 1/3, we construct rate-compatible codes of lower rates 1/6, 1/9,
1/12,... Surprisingly, such simple low-rate non-binary LDPC codes outperform
the best low-rate binary LDPC codes so far. Moreover, we propose the decoding
algorithm for the proposed codes, which can be decoded with almost the same
computational complexity as that of the mother code.
