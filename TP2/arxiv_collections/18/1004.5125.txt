We revisit flavour effects in soft leptogenesis relaxing the assumption of
universality for the soft supersymmetry breaking terms. We find that with
respect to the case in which the heavy sneutrinos decay with equal rates and
equal CP asymmetries for all lepton flavours, hierarchical flavour
configurations can enhance the efficiency by more than two orders of magnitude.
This translates in more than three order of magnitude with respect to the
one-flavour approximation. We verify that lepton flavour equilibration effects
related to off-diagonal soft slepton masses are ineffective for damping these
large enhancements. We show that soft leptogenesis can be successful for
unusual values of the relevant parameters, allowing for $B\sim {\cal O}({\rm
TeV})$ and for values of the washout parameter up to $m_{\rm eff}/m_* \sim
5\times 10^{3}$.
