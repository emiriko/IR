Nanoparticle agglomeration in a quiescent fluid is simulated by solving the
Langevin equations of motion of a set of interacting monomers in the continuum
regime. Monomers interact via a radial, rapidly decaying intermonomer
potential. The morphology of generated clusters is analyzed through their
fractal dimension $d_f$ and the cluster coordination number. The time evolution
of the cluster fractal dimension is linked to the dynamics of two populations,
small ($k \le 15$) and large ($k>15$) clusters. At early times monomer-cluster
agglomeration is the dominant agglomeration mechanism ($d_f = 2.25$), whereas
at late times cluster-cluster agglomeration dominates ($d_f = 1.56$). Clusters
are found to be compact (mean coordination number $\sim 5$), tubular, and
elongated. The local, compact structure of the aggregates is attributed to the
isotropy of the interaction potential, which allows rearrangement of bonded
monomers, whereas the large-scale tubular structure is attributed to its
relatively short attractive range. The cluster translational diffusion
coefficient is determined to be inversely proportional to the cluster mass and
the (per-unit-mass) friction coefficient of an isolated monomer, a consequence
of the neglect of monomer shielding in a cluster. Clusters generated by
unshielded Langevin equations are referred to as \textit{ideal clusters}
because the surface area accessible to the underlying fluid is found to be the
sum of the accessible surface areas of the isolated monomers. Similarly, ideal
clusters do not have, on average, a preferential orientation. The decrease of
the numbers of clusters with time and a few collision kernel elements are
evaluated and compared to analytical expressions.
