The tempered fundamental group of a p-adic analytic variety classifies
\'etale coverings that become topological coverings (for the Berkovich
topology) after finite \'etale base change. I study what can be recovered from
the tempered fundamental group. In particular, I prove that, for a Mumford
curve, one can recover the metric of the graph of the stable reduction from the
tempered fundamental group. I also study how the tempered fundamental group
behaves along the fibers of a fibration.
