One of the key unresolved problems in the study of space plasmas is to
explain the production of energetic electrons as magnetic field lines
`reconnect' and release energy in a exposive manner. Recent observations
suggest possible roles played by small scale magnetic islands in the
reconnection region, but their precise roles and the exact mechanism of
electron energization have remained unclear. Here we show that secondary
islands generated in the reconnection region are indeed efficient electron
accelerators. We found that, when electrons are trapped inside the islands,
they are energized continuously by the reconnection electric field prevalent in
the reconnection diffusion region. The size and the propagation speed of the
secondary islands are similar to those of islands observed in the magnetotail
containing energertic electrons.
