Mean field approximation of a large collection of FitzHugh-Nagumo excitable
neurons with noise and all-to-all coupling with explicit time-delays, modelled
by $N\gg 1$ stochastic delay-differential equations is derived. The resulting
approximation contains only two deterministic delay-differential equations but
provides excellent predictions concerning the stability and bifurcations of the
averaged global variables of the exact large system.
