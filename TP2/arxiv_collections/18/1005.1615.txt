By means of different physical mechanisms, the expansion of HII regions can
promote the formation of new stars of all masses. RCW 120 is a nearby Galactic
HII region where triggered star formation occurs. This region is well-studied -
there being a wealth of existing data - and is nearby. However, it is
surrounded by dense regions for which far infrared data is essential to obtain
an unbiased view of the star formation process and in particular to establish
whether very young protostars are present. We attempt to identify all Young
Stellar Objects (YSOs), especially those previously undetected at shorter
wavelengths, to derive their physical properties and obtain insight into the
star formation history in this region. We use Herschel-PACS and -SPIRE images
to determine the distribution of YSOs observed in the field. We use a spectral
energy distribution fitting tool to derive the YSOs physical properties.
Herschel-PACS and -SPIRE images confirm the existence of a young source and
allow us to determine its nature as a high-mass (8-10 MSun) Class 0 object
(whose emission is dominated by a massive envelope) towards the massive
condensation 1 observed at (sub)-millimeter wavelengths. This source was not
detected at 24 micron and only barely seen in the MISPGAL 70 micron data.
Several other red sources are detected at Herschel wavelengths and coincide
with the peaks of the millimeter condensations. SED fitting results for the
brightest Herschel sources indicate that, apart from the massive Class 0 that
forms in condensation 1, young low mass stars are forming around RCW 120. The
YSOs observed on the borders of RCW 120 are younger than its ionizing star,
which has an age of about 2.5 Myr.
