We have updated our measurement of the cross section for e^+e^- -> psi(3770)
-> hadrons, our publication "Measurement of sigma(e^+e^- -> psi(3770) ->
hadrons) at E_{c.m.} = 3773 MeV", arXiv:hep-ex/0512038, Phys.Rev.Lett.96,
092002 (2006). Simultaneous with this arXiv update, we have published an
erratum in Phys.Rev.Lett.104, 159901 (2010). There, and in this update, we have
corrected a mistake in the computation of the error on the difference of the
cross sections for e^+e^- -> psi(3770) -> hadrons and e^+e^- -> psi(3770) ->
DDbar. We have also used a more recent CLEO measurement of cross section for
e^+e^- -> psi(3770) -> DDbar. From this, we obtain an upper limit on the
branching fraction for psi(3770) -> non-DDbar of 9% at 90% confidence level.
