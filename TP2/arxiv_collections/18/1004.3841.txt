We have obtained experimentally the low frequency Raman spectra of
p-dihlorbenzol nanoparticles. Nanoparticle sizes are determined with the help
of electron microscope. It was found that in the lattice vibration spectra from
70 nm the summary spectrum of {\alpha}-paradihlorbenzola and
{\beta}-paradihlorbenzol structures appears. It agrees with both calculations
of nanoparticle structure by molecular dynamics and calculations of spectra
histograms of the lattice vibrations by a Dyne's method.
