The present work aims to describe, within a single phenomenological approach,
the specific sequence of phase transitions observed in the rare-earth
manganites RMnO3 at zero magnetic field. It is shown that a single integrated
description of the temperature versus composition phase diagrams of these
compounds and related solid solutions can be obtained within the scope of
Landau theory by adopting the so called type-II description of the modulated
phases.
