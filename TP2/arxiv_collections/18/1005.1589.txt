Binding, lateral diffusion and exchange are fundamental dynamic processes
involved in protein association with cellular membranes. In this study, we
developed numerical simulations of lateral diffusion and exchange of
fluorophores in membranes with arbitrary bleach geometry and exchange of the
membrane localized fluorophore with the cytosol during Fluorescence Recovery
after Photobleaching (FRAP) experiments. The model simulations were used to
design FRAP experiments with varying bleach region sizes on plasma-membrane
localized wild type GFP-Ras2 with a dual lipid anchor and mutant GFP-Ras2C318S
with a single lipid anchor in live yeast cells to investigate diffusional
mobility and the presence of any exchange processes operating in the time scale
of our experiments. Model parameters estimated using data from FRAP experiments
with a 1 micron x 1 micron bleach region-of-interest (ROI) and a 0.5 micron x
0.5 micron bleach ROI showed that GFP-Ras2, single or dual lipid modified,
diffuses as single species with no evidence of exchange with a cytoplasmic
pool. This is the first report of Ras2 mobility in yeast plasma membrane. The
methods developed in this study are generally applicable for studying diffusion
and exchange of membrane associated fluorophores using FRAP on commercial
confocal laser scanning microscopes.
