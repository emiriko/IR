A Ginzburg-Landau approach to fluctuations of a layered superconductor in a
magnetic field is used to show that the interlayer coupling can be incorporated
within an interacting self-consistent theory of a single layer, in the limit of
a large number of neighboring layers. The theory exhibits two phase transitions
-- a vortex liquid-to-solid transition is followed by a Bose-Einstein
condensation into the Abrikosov lattice -- illustrating the essential role of
interlayer coupling. Using this theory, explicit expressions for magnetization,
specific heat, and fluctuation conductivity are derived. We compare our results
with recent experimental data on the iron-pnictide superconductors.
