This is a technical document that provides supporting information and details
of the publicly available code used for the preparation of the analysis for
preprint "{\it A search for heavy Kaluza-Klein electroweak gauge bosons at the
LHC}" (submitted to JHEP). The {\sc Moses} C++ framework is a project written
for probing and developing new models for High Energy Physics processes which
allows complete events to be simulated by interface with the standard
simulation program Pythia8. This paper demonstrates the usage of {\sc Moses} in
a study of the nature of Kaluza-Klein (KK) excitations in a specific model
where the SU(2) \times U(1) gauge fields can exist in a single Extra Dimension
(ED) compactified on a $S^1/Z_2$ orbifold, while the matter fermions and SU(3)
gauge fields are localized in the 3d-brane. Using this framework, the events
have been fully simulated at hadron level including initial and final state
radiation. The study of particle decays was used to develop a method to
distinguish between this Kaluza-Klein model and processes with similar final
states. As a consequence, the possibility of observing and identifying a signal
of the first excited KK state of the $\gamma/Z^0$ bosons in the LHC is also
discussed.
