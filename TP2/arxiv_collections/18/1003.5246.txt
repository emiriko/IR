Based on the Caputo definition of the fractional derivative the ground state
spectra of mesons are classified as multiplets of the fractional rotation
group. The comparison with the experimental values leads to the conclusion,
that quarks carry an up to now unrevealed fractional multiplicative quantum
number, which we call fractional hyper charge.
