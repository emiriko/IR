In this paper, we present an automated system, which has the capability to
catch and track solar limb prominences based on observations from EUV 304
passband. The characteristic parameters and their evolution, including height,
position angle, area, length and brightness, are obtained without manual
interventions. By applying the system to the STEREO-B/SECCHI/EUVI 304 data
during 2007 April -2009 October, we obtain a total of 9477 well-tracked
prominences and a catalog of these events available online at
http://space.ustc.edu.cn/dreams/slipcat/. A detailed analysis of these
prominences suggests that the system has a rather good performance. We have
obtained several interesting statistical results based on the catalog. Most
prominences appear below the latitude of 60 degrees and at the height of about
26 Mm above the solar surface. Most of them are quite stable during the period
they are tracked. Nevertheless, some prominences have an upward speed of more
than 100 km/s, and some others show significant downward and/or azimuthal
speeds. There are strong correlations among the brightness, area and height.
The expansion of a prominence is probably one major cause of its fading during
the rising or erupting process.
