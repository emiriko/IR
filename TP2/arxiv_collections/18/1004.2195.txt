We observe a strong peak in the capacitive photocurrent of a MDMO-PPV / PCBM
bulk heterojunction solar cell for excitation below the absorbance threshold
energy. Illumination at the peak energy blocks charge capture at other
wavelengths, and causes the photovoltage to drop dramatically. These results
suggest that the new peak is due to a charge transfer state, which provides a
pathway for charge separation and photocurrent generation in the solar cell.
