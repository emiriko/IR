The dead cone effect has been expected to reduce the magnitude of energy loss
and jet quenching for heavy flavors produced with large pT in heavy ion
collisions. On the contrary, data from RHIC for open charm production
demonstrate a flavor independent nuclear suppression. We show that vacuum
radiation of a highly virtual quark produced at high pT with its color field
stripped off, develops a much wider dead cone, which screens the one related to
the quark mass. Lacking the field, gluons cannot be radiated within this cone
until the color field is regenerated and the quark virtuality cools down to the
scale of the order of the quark mass. However, this takes time longer than is
essential for the observed jet quenching. This is the reason why the light and
charm quark jets are quenched equally. Open beauty is expected to be suppressed
much less within the pT range studied so far.
