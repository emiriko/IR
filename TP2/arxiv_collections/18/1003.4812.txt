Two formal stochastic models are said to be bisimilar if their solutions as a
stochastic process are probabilistically equivalent. Bisimilarity between two
stochastic model formalisms means that the strengths of one stochastic model
formalism can be used by the other stochastic model formalism. The aim of this
paper is to explain bisimilarity relations between stochastic hybrid automata,
stochastic differential equations on hybrid space and stochastic hybrid Petri
nets. These bisimilarity relations make it possible to combine the formal
verification power of automata with the analysis power of stochastic
differential equations and the compositional specification power of Petri nets.
The relations and their combined strengths are illustrated for an air traffic
example.
