We analyze kinematic data of 41 nearby (z<0.1) relaxed galaxy clusters in
terms of the projected phase-space density using a phenomenological, fully
anisotropic model of the distribution function. We apply the Markov Chain Monte
Carlo approach to place constraints on total mass distribution approximated by
the universal NFW profile and the profile of the anisotropy of galaxy orbits.
We find the normalization of the mean mass-concentration relation is
c=6.9_{-0.7}^{+0.6} at the virial mass M_v=5x10^{14}M_sun. Assuming a
one-to-one correspondence between sigma_8 and the normalization of the
mass-concentration relation in the framework of the concordance model we
estimate the normalization of the linear power spectrum to be
sigma_8=0.91_{-0.08}^{+0.07}. Our constraints on the parameters of the mass
profile are compared with estimates from other methods. We show that galaxy
orbits are isotropic at the cluster centres (with the mean ratio of the
radial-to-tangential velocity dispersions sigma_r/sigma_theta=0.97+/-0.04) and
radially anisotropic at the virial sphere (with the mean ratio
sigma_r/sigma_theta=1.75^{+0.23}_{-0.19}). Although the value of the central
anisotropy appears to be universal, the anisotropy at the virial radius differs
between clusters within the range 1<(sigma_r/sigma_theta)<2. Utilizing the
Bautz-Morgan morphological classification and information on the prominence of
a cool core we select two subsamples of galaxy clusters corresponding to less
and more advanced evolutionary states. It is demonstrated that less evolved
clusters have shallower mass profiles and their galaxy orbits are more radially
biased at the virial sphere. This property is consistent with the expected
evolution of the mass profiles as well as with the observed orbital segregation
of late and early type galaxies.
