We apply the postquasistatic approximation, an iterative method for the
evolution of self-gravitating spheres of matter, to study the evolution of
dissipative and electrically charged distributions in General Relativity. We
evolve nonadiabatic distributions assuming an equation of state that accounts
for the anisotropy induced by the electric charge. Dissipation is described by
streaming out or diffusion approximations. We match the interior solution, in
noncomoving coordinates, with the Vaidya-Reissner-Nordstr\"om exterior
solution. Two models are considered: i) a Schwarzschild-like shell in the
diffusion limit; ii) a Schwarzschild-like interior in the free streaming limit.
These toy models tell us something about the nature of the dissipative and
electrically charged collapse. Diffusion stabilizes the gravitational collapse
producing a spherical shell whose contraction is halted in a short
characteristic hydrodynamic time. The streaming out radiation provides a more
efficient mechanism for emission of energy, redistributing the electric charge
on the whole sphere, while the distribution collapses indefinitely with a
longer hydrodynamic time scale.
