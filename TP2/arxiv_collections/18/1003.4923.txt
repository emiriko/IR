The real-time operator formalism for thermal quantum field theories,
thermofield dynamics, is formulated in terms of a path-integral approach in
non-commutative spaces. As an application, the two-point function for a thermal
non-commutative $\lambda \phi^4$ theory is derived at the one-loop level. The
effect of temperature and the non-commutative parameter, competing with one
another, is analyzed.
