We study dilepton production in proton-proton, Cu+Cu as well as in Au+Au
collisions at the center-of-mass energy 200 GeV per participating nucleon pair
within an extended statistical hadronization model. In extension to earlier
studies we incorporate transport calculations for an estimate of uncorrelated
e+e- -pairs from semileptonic D meson decays. While the invariant mass spectrum
of dielectrons is well understood in the p+p collisions, severe discrepancies
among different model scenarios based on hadronic degrees of freedom and recent
data from the PHENIX Collaboration are found in heavy-ion collisions in the low
mass region from 0.15 to 0.6 GeV as well as in the intermediate mass regime
from 1.1 to 3 GeV when employing the standard dilepton sources. We investigate,
furthermore, the background from correlated dileptons that are not emitted as a
pair from a parent hadron but emerge from semileptonic decays of two correlated
daughter hadrons. Our calculations suggest a sizeable contribution of such
sources in central heavy-ion collisions in the low mass region. However, even
the upper limits of our calculations are found to be far below the dilepton
mass spectra of the PHENIX Collaboration.
