Correlation-induced spin-charge and spin-orbital coupling effects on spin
dynamics in ferromagnetic manganites are calculated with realistic parameters
in order to provide a quantitative comparison with experimental results for
spin stiffness, magnon dispersion, magnon damping, anomalous zone-boundary
magnon softening, and Curie temperature. The role of orbital degeneracy,
orbital ordering, and orbital correlations on spin dynamics in different doping
regimes is highlighted.
