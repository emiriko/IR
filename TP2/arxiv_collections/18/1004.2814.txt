We give a `geometrical' construction of an action of a Heisenberg algebra on
the homology of the moduli spaces of torsion free sheaves on a complex smooth
connected projective surface, framed along a smooth connected genus zero curve.
This result generalizes Nakajima's construction for the Hilbert schemes of
points.
