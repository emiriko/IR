This paper deals with the physics of monolayer graphite, with a particular
focus on the electronics and structural properties. In contrast to the previous
electronic band structure of doped single-walled carbon nanotube calculation,
where just a ballistic graphite plate is considered, here for the carbon bonds
length alteration is calculated in terms of hole doping. It is found that doped
holes play crucial roles on the bond structure compared to that obtained no
doping configurations and it changes as hole doping increasing.
