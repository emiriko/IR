We investigate the effects of considering two different incoherent pumpings
over a microcavity-quantum dot system modelled using the Jaynes-Cummings
Hamiltonian. When the system is incoherently pumped with polaritons it is able
to sustain a large number of photons inside the cavity with Poisson-like
statistics in the stationary limit, and also leads to a separable
exciton-photon state. We also investigate the effects of both types of pumpings
(Excitonic and Polaritonic) in the emission spectrum of the cavity. We show
that the polaritonic pumping as considered here is unable to modify the
dynamical regimes of the system as the excitonics pumping does. Finally, we
obtain a closed form expression for the negativity of the density matrices that
the quantum master equation considered here generates.
