We develop the representation theory of a finite semigroup over an arbitrary
commutative semiring with unit, in particular classifying the irreducible and
minimal representations. The results for an arbitrary semiring are as good as
the results for a field. Special attention is paid to the boolean semiring,
where we also characterize the simple representations and introduce the
beginnings of a character theory.
