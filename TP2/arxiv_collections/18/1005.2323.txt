We present a global analysis of leptonic and semileptonic kaon decay data,
including all recent results published by the BNL-E865, KLOE, KTeV, ISTRA+ and
NA48 experiments. This analysis, in conjunction with precise lattice
calculations of the hadronic matrix elements now available, leads to a very
precise determination of |Vus| and allows us to perform several stringent tests
of the Standard Model.
