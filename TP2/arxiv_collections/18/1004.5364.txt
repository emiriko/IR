We aim at deriving an equation of motion for specific sums of momentum mode
occupation numbers from models for electrons in periodic lattices experiencing
elastic scattering, electron-phonon scattering or electron-electron scattering.
These sums correspond to "grains" in momentum space. This equation of motion is
supposed to involve only a moderate number of dynamical variables and/or
exhibit a sufficiently simple structure such that neither its construction nor
its analyzation/solution requires substantial numerical effort. To this we end
compute, by means of a projection operator technique, a linear(ized) collision
term which determines the dynamics of the above grain-sums. This collision term
results as non-singular, finite dimensional rate matrix and may thus be
inverted regardless of any symmetry of the underlying model. This facilitates
calculations of, e.g., transport coefficients, as we demonstrate for a 3-dim.
