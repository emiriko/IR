A UML based metamodel for Bunge-Wand-Weber (BWW) ontology is presented. BWW
ontology is a generic framework for analysis and conceptualization of real
world objects. It includes categories that can be applied to analyze and
classify objects found in an information system. In the context of BWW
ontology, the metamodel is a representation of the ontological categories and
relationships among them. An objective behind developing an object-oriented
metamodel has been to model BWW ontology in terms of widely used notions in
software development. The main contributions of this paper are a classification
for ontological categories, a description template, and representations through
UML and typed based models.
