A few papers have been interested by the fixed switching frequency direct
torque control fed by direct matrix converters, where we can find just the use
of direct torque controlled space vector modulated method. In this present
paper, we present an improved method used for a fixed switching frequency
direct torque control (DTC) using a direct matrix converter (DMC). This method
is characterized by a simple structure, a fixed switching frequency which
causes minimal torque ripple and a unity input power factor. Using this
strategy, we combine the direct matrix converters advantages with those of
direct torque control (DTC) schemes. The used technique for constant frequency
is combined with the input current space vector to create the switching table
of direct matrix converter (DMC). Simulation results clearly demonstrate a
better dynamic and steady state performances of the proposed method.
