A Gel'fand-Zetlin basis is introduced for the irreducible covariant tensor
representations of the Lie superalgebra gl(m|n). Explicit expressions for the
generators of the Lie superalgebra acting on this basis are determined.
Furthermore, Clebsch-Gordan coefficients corresponding to the tensor product of
any covariant tensor representation of gl(m|n) with the natural representation
V ([1,0,...,0]) of gl(m|n) with highest weight (1,0,. . . ,0) are computed.
Both results are steps for the explicit construction of the parastatistics Fock
space.
