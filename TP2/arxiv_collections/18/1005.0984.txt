Stellar rotation is a crucial parameter driving stellar magnetism, activity
and mixing of chemical elements. Furthermore, the evolution of stellar rotation
is coupled to the evolution of circumstellar disks. Disk-braking mechanisms are
believed to be responsible for rotational deceleration during the accretion
phase, and rotational spin-up during the contraction phase after decoupling
from the disk for fast rotators arriving at the ZAMS. We investigate the
projected rotational velocities vsini of a sample of young stars with respect
to the stellar mass and disk evolutionary state to search for possible
indications of disk-braking mechanisms. We analyse the stellar spectra of 220
nearby (mostly <100pc) young (2-600 Myr) stars for their vsini, stellar age,
Halpha emission, and accretion rates. The stars have been observed with FEROS
and HARPS in La Silla, Chile. The spectra have been cross-correlated with
appropriate theoretical templates. We build a new calibration to be able to
derive vsini values from the cross-correlated spectra. Stellar ages are
estimated from the LiI equivalent width at 6708 Ang. The equivalent width and
width at 10% height of the Halpha emission are measured to identify accretors
and used to estimate accretion rates. The vsini is then analysed with respect
to the evolutionary state of the circumstellar disks to search for indications
of disk-braking mechanisms in accretors. We find that the broad vsini
distribution of our targets extends to rotation velocities of up to more than
100 km/s and peaks at a value of 7.8+-1.2 km/s, and that ~70% of our stars show
vsini<30 km/s. Furthermore, we can find indications for disk-braking in
accretors and rotational spin-up of stars which are decoupled from their disks.
In addition, we show that a number of young stars are suitable for precise
radial-velocity measurements for planet-search surveys.
