Adaptation of the chemotaxis sensory pathway of the bacterium Escherichia
coli is integral for detecting chemicals over a wide range of background
concentrations, ultimately allowing cells to swim towards sources of attractant
and away from repellents. Its biochemical mechanism based on methylation and
demethylation of chemoreceptors has long been known. Despite the importance of
adaptation for cell memory and behavior, the dynamics of adaptation are
difficult to reconcile with current models of precise adaptation. Here, we
follow time courses of signaling in response to concentration step changes of
attractant using in vivo fluorescence resonance energy transfer measurements.
Specifically, we use a condensed representation of adaptation time courses for
efficient evaluation of different adaptation models. To quantitatively explain
the data, we finally develop a dynamic model for signaling and adaptation based
on the attractant flow in the experiment, signaling by cooperative receptor
complexes, and multiple layers of feedback regulation for adaptation. We
experimentally confirm the predicted effects of changing the enzyme-expression
level and bypassing the negative feedback for demethylation. Our data analysis
suggests significant imprecision in adaptation for large additions.
Furthermore, our model predicts highly regulated, ultrafast adaptation in
response to removal of attractant, which may be useful for fast reorientation
of the cell and noise reduction in adaptation.
