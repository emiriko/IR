A class of generalized coherent states with a new type of the identity
resolution are constructed by replacing the labeling parameter zn/n! of the
canonical coherent states by Meixner-Pollaczek polynomials with specific
parameters. The constructed coherent states belong to the state Hilbert space
of the Gol'dman-Krivchenkov Hamiltonian.
