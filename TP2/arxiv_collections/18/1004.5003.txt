The loss of coherence in quantum mechanical superposition states limits the
time for which quantum information remains useful. Similarly, it limits the
distance over which quantum information can be transmitted, resembling Anderson
localization, where disorder causes quantum mechanical states to become
localized. Here, we investigate in a nuclear spin-based quantum simulator, the
localization of the size of spin clusters that are generated by a Hamiltonian
driving the transmission of information, while a variable-strength perturbation
counteracts the spreading. We find that the system reaches a dynamic
equilibrium size, which decreases with the square of the perturbation strength.
