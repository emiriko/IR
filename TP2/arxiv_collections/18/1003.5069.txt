The main modelling methods devoted to microstrutured air-silica optical
fibres (MOFs) are presented and discussed. Then, the specific propagation
properties of MOFs are studied in detail. Characteristics measured on fibres
manufactured in our laboratory or reported in the literature are analysed. A
large number of potential and demonstrated applications are presented and the
obtained performances are discussed. A particular attention is given to hollow-
core photonic bandgap fibres and their applications.
