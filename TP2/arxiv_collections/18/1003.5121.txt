HR\,8799 is a $\lambda$ Bootis, $\gamma$ Doradus star hosting a planetary
system and a debris disk with two rings. This makes this system a very
interesting target for asteroseismic studies. In particular, this work is
devoted to the determination of the internal metallicity of this star, linked
with its $\lambda$ Bootis nature, and its age, taking the advantage of its
$\gamma$ Doradus-type pulsations. To do so we have used the equilibrium code
CESAM and the non-adiabatic pulsational code GraCo. We have applied the
Frequency Ratio Method and the Time Dependent Convection theory to estimate the
mode identification, the Brunt-Va\"is\"al\"a frequency integral and the mode
instability, making a selection of the possible models fulfilling all
observational constraints. Using the position of the star in the HR diagram,
the solar metallicity models is discarded. This result contradicts one of the
main assumptions of the most accepted hypothesis explaining the $\lambda$
Bootis nature, the accretion/diffusion of gas from a star with solar
metallicity. Therefore, in sight of these new results, a revision of this
hypothesis is needed. The inclusion of accurate internal chemical mixing is
necessary. The use of the asteroseismological constraints provides a very
accurate determination of the physical characteristics of HR\,8799: an age in
the ranges [1123, 1625] and [26, 430] Myr, and a mass in the ranges [1.32,
1.33] and [1.44, 1.45] $M_{\odot}$, respectively, depending on the visual angle
$i$. The determination of this angle and more accurate multicolor photometric
observations can definitively fix the mass, metallicity and age of this star.
In particular, an accurate age estimation is needed for a correct understanding
of the planetary system. In our study we have found that the age widely used
for modelling the system is unlike.
