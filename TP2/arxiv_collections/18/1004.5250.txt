Information entropy is applied to the state of knowledge of reaction
amplitudes in pseudoscalar meson photoproduction, and a scheme is developed
that quantifies the information content of a measured set of polarization
observables. It is shown that this definition of information is a more
practical measure of the quality of a set of measured observables than whether
the combination is a mathematically complete set. It is also shown that when
experimental uncertainty is introduced, complete sets of measurements do not
necessarily remove ambiguities, and that experiments should strive to measure
as many observables as practical in order to extract amplitudes.
