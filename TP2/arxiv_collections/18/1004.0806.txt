We have studied the possible existence of a supersolid phase of a
two-dimensional dipolar crystal using quantum Monte Carlo methods at zero
temperature. Our results show that the commensurate solid is not a supersolid
in the thermodynamic limit. The presence of vacancies or interstitials turns
the solid into a supersolid phase even when a tiny fraction of them are present
in a macroscopic system. The effective interaction between vacancies is
repulsive making a quasiequilibrium dipolar supersolid possible.
