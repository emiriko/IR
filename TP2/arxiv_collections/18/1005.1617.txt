We demonstrate lifetimes of atomic populations and coherences in excess of 60
seconds in alkali vapor cells with inner walls coated with an alkene material.
This represents two orders of magnitude improvement over the best paraffin
coatings. Such anti-relaxation properties will likely lead to substantial
improvements in atomic clocks, magnetometers, quantum memory, and enable
sensitive studies of collisional effects and precision measurements of
fundamental symmetries.
