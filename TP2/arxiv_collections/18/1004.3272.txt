Maintaining a legacy database is a difficult task especially when system
documentation is poor written or even missing. Database reverse engineering is
an attempt to recover high-level conceptual design from the existing database
instances. In this paper, we propose a technique to discover conceptual schema
using the association mining technique. The discovered schema corresponds to
the normalization at the third normal form, which is a common practice in many
business organizations. Our algorithm also includes the rule filtering
heuristic to solve the problem of exponential growth of discovered rules
inherited with the association mining technique.
