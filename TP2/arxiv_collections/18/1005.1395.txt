We study the properties of spectrum and eigenstates of the Google matrix of a
directed network formed by the procedure calls in the Linux Kernel. Our results
obtained for various versions of the Linux Kernel show that the spectrum is
characterized by the fractal Weyl law established recently for systems of
quantum chaotic scattering and the Perron-Frobenius operators of dynamical
maps. The fractal Weyl exponent is found to be $\nu \approx 0.63$ that
corresponds to the fractal dimension of the network $d \approx 1.2$. The
eigenmodes of the Google matrix of Linux Kernel are localized on certain
principal nodes. We argue that the fractal Weyl law should be generic for
directed networks with the fractal dimension $d<2$.
