In modelling sediment compaction and mineral reactions, the rheological
behaviour of sediments is typically considered as poroelastic or purely
viscous. In fact, compaction due to pressure solution and mechanical processes
in porous media is far more complicated. A generalised model of viscoelastic
compaction and the smectite to illite mineral reaction in hydrocarbon basins is
presented. A one-step dehydration model of the mineral reaction is assumed. The
obtained nonlinear governing equations are solved numerically and different
combinations of physical parameters are used to simulate realistic situations
in typical sedimentary basins. Comparison of numerical simulations with real
data has shown very good agreement with respect to both the porosity profile
and the mineral reaction.
