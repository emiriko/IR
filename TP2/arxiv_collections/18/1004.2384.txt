This paper discusses our recent work on developing the matter wave analogs to
the Hanbury Brown Twiss experiment. We discuss experiments using cold atoms,
both bosons and fermions, both coherent and incoherent. Simple concepts from
classical and quantum optics suffice to understand most of the results, but the
ideas can also be traced back to the work of Einstein on the thermodynamics of
Bose gases.
