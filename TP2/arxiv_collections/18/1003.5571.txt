Aims: Disk-averaged infrared spectra of Neptune between 1.8 and 13 $\mu$m,
obtained by the AKARI Infrared Camera (IRC) in May 2007, have been analysed to
(a) determine the globally-averaged stratospheric temperature structure; (b)
derive the abundances of stratospheric hydrocarbons; and (c) detect fluorescent
emission from CO at 4.7 $\mu$m. Methods: Mid-infrared spectra were modelled
using a line-by-line radiative transfer code to determine the temperature
structure between 1-1000 $\mu$bar and the abundances of CH$_4$, CH$_3$D and
higher-order hydrocarbons. A full non-LTE radiative model was then used to
determine the best fitting CO profile to reproduce the fluorescent emission
observed at 4.7 $\mu$m in the NG channel (with a spectral resolution of 135).
Results: The globally-averaged stratospheric temperature structure is
quasi-isothermal between 1-1000 $\mu$bar, which suggests little variation in
global stratospheric conditions since studies by the Infrared Space Observatory
a decade earlier. The derived CH$_4$ mole fraction of
$(9.0\pm3.0)\times10^{-4}$ at 50 mbar, decreasing to $(0.9\pm0.3)\times10^{-4}$
at 1 $\mu$bar, is larger than that expected if the tropopause at 56 K acts as
an efficient cold trap, but consistent with the hypothesis that CH$_4$ leaking
through the warm south polar tropopause (62-66 K) is globally redistributed by
stratospheric motion. The ratio of D/H in CH$_4$ of $3.0\pm1.0\times10^{-4}$
supports the conclusion that Neptune is enriched in deuterium relative to the
other giant planets. We determine a mole fraction of ethane of
$(8.5\pm2.1)\times10^{-7}$ at 0.3 mbar, consistent with previous studies, and a
mole fraction of ethylene of $5.0_{-2.1}^{+1.8}\times10^{-7}$ at 2.8 $\mu$bar.
An emission peak at 4.7 $\mu$m is interpreted as a fluorescent emission of CO,
and requires a vertical distribution with both external and internal sources of
CO.
