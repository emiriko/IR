The main topic of this paper is the analysis and modeling of stop-and-go
waves, observable in experiments of single lane movement with pedestrians. The
velocity density relation using measurements on a 'microscopic' scale shows the
coexistence of two phases at one density. These data are used to calibrate and
verify a spatially continuous model. Several criteria are chosen that a model
has to satisfy: firstly we investigated the fundamental diagram (velocity
versus density) using different measurement methods. Furthermore the
trajectories are compared to the occurrence of stop-and-go waves qualitatively.
Finally we checked the distribution of the velocities at fixed density against
the experimental one. The adaptive velocity model introduced satisfies these
criteria well.
