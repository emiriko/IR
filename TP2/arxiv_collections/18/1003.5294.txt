The question as to whether or not quantum mechanics is applicable to the
macroscopic scale has motivated efforts to generate superposition states of
macroscopic numbers of particles and to determine their effective size.
Superpositions of circulating current states in flux qubits constitute
candidate states that have been argued to be at least mesoscopic. We present a
microscopic analysis that reveals the number of electrons participating in
these superpositions to be surprisingly but not trivially small, even though
differences in macroscopic observables are large.
