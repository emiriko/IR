Dyson-Schwinger equations for the U(n) x U(n) symmetric matrix sigma model
reformulated with two auxiliary fields in a background breaking the symmetry to
U(n) are studied in the so-called bare vertex approximation. A large n solution
is constructed under the supplementary assumption so that the scalar components
are much heavier than the pseudoscalars. The renormalizability of the solution
is investigated by explicit construction of the counterterms.
