Multistable processes are tangent at each point to a stable process, but
where the index of stability and the index of localisability varies along the
path. In this work, we give two estimators of the stability and the
localisability functions, and we prove the consistency of those two estimators.
We illustrate these convergences with two classical examples, the Levy
multistable process and the Linear Multifractional Multistable Motion.
