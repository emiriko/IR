IEEE 802.16m amends the IEEE 802.16 Wireless MAN-OFDMA specification to
provide an advanced air interface for operation in licenced bands. It will meet
the cellular layer requirements of IMT-Advanced next generation mobile
networks. It will be designed to provide significantly improved performance
compared to other high rate broadband cellular network systems. For the next
generation mobile networks, it is important to consider increasing peak,
sustained data reates, corresponding spectral efficiencies, system capacity and
cell coverage as well as decreasing latency and providing QoS while carefully
considering overall system complexity. In this paper we provide an overview of
the state-of-the-art mobile WiMAX technology and its development. We focus our
discussion on Physical Layer, MAC Layer, Schedular,QoS provisioning and mobile
WiMAX specification.
