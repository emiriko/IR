We present a study on the impact of molecular outflows in the Perseus
molecular cloud complex using the COMPLETE survey large-scale 12CO(1-0) and
13CO(1-0) maps. We used three-dimensional isosurface models generated in
RA-DEC-Velocity space to visualize the maps. This rendering of the molecular
line data allowed for a rapid and efficient way to search for molecular
outflows over a large (~ 16 sq. deg.) area. Our outflow-searching technique
detected previously known molecular outflows as well as new candidate outflows.
Most of these new outflow-related high-velocity features lie in regions that
have been poorly studied before. These new outflow candidates more than double
the amount of outflow mass, momentum, and kinetic energy in the Perseus cloud
complex. Our results indicate that outflows have significant impact on the
environment immediately surrounding localized regions of active star formation,
but lack the energy needed to feed the observed turbulence in the entire
Perseus complex. This implies that other energy sources, in addition to
protostellar outflows, are responsible for turbulence on a global cloud scale
in Perseus. We studied the impact of outflows in six regions with active star
formation within Perseus of sizes in the range of 1 to 4 pc. We find that
outflows have enough power to maintain the turbulence in these regions and
enough momentum to disperse and unbind some mass from them. We found no
correlation between outflow strength and star formation efficiency for the six
different regions we studied, contrary to results of recent numerical
simulations. The low fraction of gas that potentially could be ejected due to
outflows suggests that additional mechanisms other than cloud dispersal by
outflows are needed to explain low star formation efficiencies in clusters.
