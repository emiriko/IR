Considering the coupling of color $1 \otimes 1$ and $8 \otimes 8$ structures,
we calculate the energy of the newly observed $X$(3915) as $S-$wave
$D^*\bar{D^*}$ state in the Bhaduri, Cohler, and Nogami quark model by the
Gaussian Expansion Method. Due to the color coupling, the bound state of
$D^*\bar{D^*}$ with $J^{PC}=0^{++}$ is found, which is well consonant with the
experimental data of the $X$(3915). The bound state of $B^*\bar{B^*}$ with
$J^{PC}=0^{++}$ and $2^{++}$ are also predicted in this work.
