We discuss outer gap closure mechanism in the trans-field direction with the
magnetic pair-creation process near the stellar surface. The gap closure by the
magnetic pair-creation is possible if some fraction of the pairs are produced
with an outgoing momentum. By assuming that multiple magnetic field will affect
the local field near the stellar surface, we show a specific magnetic field
geometry near the stellar surface resulting in the outflow of the pairs.
Together with the fact that the electric field is weak below null charge
surface, the characteristic curvature photon energy emitted by incoming
particles, which were accelerated in the outer gap, decreases drastically to
$\sim 100$MeV near the stellar surface. We estimate the height measured from
the last-open field line, above which 100MeV photons is converted into pairs by
the magnetic pair-creation. We also show the resultant multiplicity due to the
magnetic pair-creation process could acquire $M_{e^{\pm}}\sim 10^4-10^5$. In
this model the fractional outer gap size is proportional to $P^{-1/2}$. The
predicted gamma-ray luminosity ($L_{\gamma}$) and the characteristic curvature
photon energy ($E_c$) emitted from the outer gap are proportional to
$B^2P^{-5/2}$ and $B^{3/4}P^{-1}$ respectively. This model also predicts that
$L_{\gamma}$ and $E_c$ are related to the spin down power ($L_{sd}$) or the
spin down age of pulsars ($\tau$) as $L_{\gamma} \propto L_{sd}^{5/8}$ or
$L_{\gamma} \propto \tau^{-5/4}$, and $E_c \propto L_{sd}^{1/4}$ or $E_c
\propto \tau^{-1/2}$ respectively.
