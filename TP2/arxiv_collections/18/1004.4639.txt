It is shown that, the wavelet regression detrended fluctuations of the
monthly sunspot number for 1749-2009 years exhibit strong periodicity with a
period approximately equal to 3.7 years. The wavelet regression method detrends
the data from the approximately 11-years period. Therefore, it is suggested
that the one-third subharmonic resonance can be considered as a background for
the 11-years solar cycle. It is also shown that the broad-band part of the
wavelet regression detrended fluctuations spectrum exhibits an exponential
decay that, together with the positive largest Lyapunov exponent, are the
hallmarks of chaos. Using a complex-time analytic approach the rate of the
exponential decay of the broad-band part of the spectrum has been theoretically
related to the Carrington solar rotation period. Relation of the driving period
of the subharmonic resonance (3.7-years) to the active longitude flip-flop
phenomenon, in which the dominant part of the sunspot activity changes the
longitude every 3.7 years on average, has been briefly discussed.
