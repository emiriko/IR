Recent experiments renewed interest in persistent currents in mesoscopic
normal-metal rings. We show that in ballistic rings in high magnetic fields the
Zeeman splitting leads to periodic current quenching with period much larger
than the period of the persistent current. Simple arguments show that this
effect might be relevant for diffusive rings as well. Another aim of this paper
is to discuss fluctuations of the persistent current due to thermal excitation
of high energy levels. Being observed such fluctuations would witness a
coherent state of an electron system at high temperatures when the persistent
current is exponentially suppressed.
