We present an overview of quantum key distribution (QKD), a secure key
exchange method based on the quantum laws of physics rather than computational
complexity. We also provide an overview of the two most widely used commodity
security protocols, IPsec and TLS. Pursuing a key exchange model, we propose
how QKD could be integrated into these security applications. For such a QKD
integration we propose a support layer that provides a set of common QKD
services between the QKD protocol and the security applications
