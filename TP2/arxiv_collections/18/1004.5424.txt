We present a new approach for recognition of complex graphic symbols in
technical documents. Graphic symbol recognition is a well known challenge in
the field of document image analysis and is at heart of most graphic
recognition systems. Our method uses structural approach for symbol
representation and statistical classifier for symbol recognition. In our system
we represent symbols by their graph based signatures: a graphic symbol is
vectorized and is converted to an attributed relational graph, which is used
for computing a feature vector for the symbol. This signature corresponds to
geometry and topology of the symbol. We learn a Bayesian network to encode
joint probability distribution of symbol signatures and use it in a supervised
learning scenario for graphic symbol recognition. We have evaluated our method
on synthetically deformed and degraded images of pre-segmented 2D architectural
and electronic symbols from GREC databases and have obtained encouraging
recognition rates.
