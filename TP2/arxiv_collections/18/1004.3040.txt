This paper presents a novel projection-based adaptive algorithm for sparse
signal and system identification. The sequentially observed data are used to
generate an equivalent sequence of closed convex sets, namely hyperslabs. Each
hyperslab is the geometric equivalent of a cost criterion, that quantifies
"data mismatch". Sparsity is imposed by the introduction of appropriately
designed weighted $\ell_1$ balls. The algorithm develops around projections
onto the sequence of the generated hyperslabs as well as the weighted $\ell_1$
balls. The resulting scheme exhibits linear dependence, with respect to the
unknown system's order, on the number of multiplications/additions and an
$\mathcal{O}(L\log_2L)$ dependence on sorting operations, where $L$ is the
length of the system/signal to be estimated. Numerical results are also given
to validate the performance of the proposed method against the LASSO algorithm
and two very recently developed adaptive sparse LMS and LS-type of adaptive
algorithms, which are considered to belong to the same algorithmic family.
