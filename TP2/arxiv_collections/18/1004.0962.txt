We present a systematic study of uncertainties due to parton distributions
and the strong coupling on the gluon-fusion production cross section of the
Standard Model Higgs at the Tevatron and LHC colliders. We compare procedures
and results when three recent sets of PDFs are used, CTEQ6.6, MSTW08 and
NNPDF1.2, and we discuss specifically the way PDF and strong coupling
uncertainties are combined. We find that results obtained from different PDF
sets are in reasonable agreement if a common value of the strong coupling is
adopted. We show that the addition in quadrature of PDF and alphas
uncertainties provides an adequate approximation to the full result with exact
error propagation. We discuss a simple recipe to determine a conservative
PDF+alphas uncertainty from available global parton sets, and we use it to
estimate this uncertainty on the given process to be about 10% at the Tevatron
and 5% at the LHC for a light Higgs.
