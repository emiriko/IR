We continue to explore the validity of the reflected shock structure (RSS)
picture in SNR 1987A that was proposed in our previous analyses of the X-ray
emission from this object. We used an improved version of our RSS model in a
global analysis of 14 CCD spectra from the monitoring program with Chandra. In
the framework of the RSS picture, we are able to match both the expansion
velocity curve deduced from the analysis of the X-ray images and light curve.
Using a simplified analysis, we also show that the X-rays and the non-thermal
radio emission may originate from the same shock structure (the blast wave). We
believe that using the RSS model in the analysis of grating data from the
Chandra monitoring program of SNR 1987A that cover a long enough time interval,
will allow us to build a more realistic physical picture and model of SNR
1987A.
