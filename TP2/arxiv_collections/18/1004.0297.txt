A method is suggested to produce, with the help of colliding laser photons
with bunches of relativistic ions having two energy levels, both intense beams
of monochromatic polarized X-ray fluorescence photons and significant number of
X-ray entangled photons, via double Doppler transformation. Nonlinear
susceptibility of the ions, the cross section and the rate of production of
such photons at RHIC are estimated. Such beams of X-ray photons can be detected
and applied to solve various problems, in a manner similar to the usage of
optical photons.
