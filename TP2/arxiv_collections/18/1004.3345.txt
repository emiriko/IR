We consider the security of continuous-variable quantum cryptography as we
approach the classical-limit, i.e., when the unknown preparation noise at the
sender's station becomes significantly noisy or thermal (even by as much as
10,000 times the variance of the vacuum mode). We show that, provided the
channel transmission losses do not exceed 50%, the security of quantum
cryptography is not dependent on the channel transmission, and is therefore,
incredibly robust against significant amounts of excess preparation noise. We
extend these results to consider for the first time quantum cryptography at
wavelengths considerably longer than optical and find that regions of security
still exist all the way down to the microwave.
