Electron-electron interactions in half-filled high Landau levels in
two-dimensional electron gases in a strong perpendicular magnetic field can
lead to states with anisotropic longitudinal resistance. This longitudinal
resitance is generally believed to arise from broken rotational invariance,
which is indicated by charge density wave (CDW) order in Hartree-Fock
calculations. We use the Hartree-Fock approximation to study the influence of
externally tuned Landau level mixing on the formation of interaction induced
states that break rotational invariance in two-dimensional electron and hole
systems. We focus on the situation when there are two non-interacting states in
the vicinity of the Fermi level and construct a Landau theory to study coupled
charge density wave order that can occur as interactions are tuned and the
filling or mixing are varied. We examine in detail a specific example where
mixing is tuned externally through Rashba spin-orbit coupling. We calculate the
phase diagram and find the possibility of ordering involving coupled striped or
triangular charge density waves in the two levels. Our results may be relevant
to recent transport experiments on quantum Hall nematics in which Landau-level
mixing plays an important role.
