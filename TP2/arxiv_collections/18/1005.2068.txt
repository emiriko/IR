The reflectivity of a large LuFe(2)O(4) single crystal has been measured with
the radiation field either perpendicular or parallel to the c axis of its
rhombohedral structure, from 10 to 500K, and from 7 to 16000 cm-1. The
transition between the two-dimensional and the three-dimensional charge order
at T_(CO) = 320 K is found to change dramatically the phonon spectrum in both
polarizations. The number of the observed modes above and below T_(CO),
according to a factor-group analysis, is in good agreement with a transition
from the rhombohedral space group R{bar 3}m to the monoclinic C2/m. In the
sub-THz region a peak becomes evident at low temperature, whose origin is
discussed in relation with previous experiments.
