We consider a single-component gas of dipolar bosons confined in a
one-dimensional optical lattice, where the dipoles are aligned such that the
long-ranged dipolar interactions are maximally repulsive. In the limit of zero
inter-site hopping and sufficiently large on-site interaction, the phase
diagram is a complete devil's staircase for filling fractions between 0 and 1:
every commensurate state at a rational filling is stable over a finite interval
in chemical potential, and for every chemical potential the system is in a
gapped commensurate phase. We perturb away from this limit in two
experimentally motivated directions involving the addition of hopping and a
reduction of the onsite interaction. The addition of hopping alone yields a
phase diagram, which we compute in perturbation theory in the hopping, where
the commensurate Mott phases now compete with the superfluid. We capture the
physics of the Mott-superfluid phase transitions via bosonization. In a finite
trap, we argue using an LDA and simulated annealing that this results in
regions of commensurate states separated by patches with dominant superfluid
correlations. Further softening of the onsite interaction yields alternative
commensurate states with double occupancies which can form a devil's staircase
of their own; we describe these states and discuss the possible transitions
between them. Adding a hopping term in this case produces one-dimensional
"supersolids" which simultaneously exhibit discrete broken symmetries and
superfluidity. The contents of this work was first published as a chapter in
the doctoral thesis `On Exotic Orders in Strongly Correlated Systems'
(Princeton University, 09/09, supervised by S. L. Sondhi), and constitutes a
considerably more detailed version of [PRB 80: 174519 (2009)].
