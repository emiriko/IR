The Belle Collaboration observed an enhancement called X(4630) in the
Lambda_c^+ Lambda_c^- mass distribution using initial state radiation. We
demonstrate that the enhancement could be consistent with the psi'f_0(980)
molecular picture of the Y(4660) taking into account the Lambda_c^+ Lambda_c^-
final state interaction. To test the hypothesis that the X(4630) and Y(4660)
are the same molecular state, we give predictions for its spin partner, the
eta_c'f_0(980) molecule. High statistic measurements of the B decays into the K
Lambda_c^+ Lambda_c^- and K eta_c' pi^+ pi^- are strongly recommended.
