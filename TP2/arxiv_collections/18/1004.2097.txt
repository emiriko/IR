We extend our analysis of two electrons on a sphere [Phys. Rev. A {\bf 79},
062517 (2009); Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 103}, 123008 (2009)] to electrons on
concentric spheres with different radii. The strengths and weaknesses of
several electronic structure models are analyzed, ranging from the mean-field
approximation (restricted and unrestricted Hartree-Fock solutions) to
configuration interaction expansion, leading to near-exact wave functions and
energies. The M{\o}ller-Plesset energy corrections (up to third-order) and the
asymptotic expansion for the large-spheres regime are also considered. We also
study the position intracules derived from approximate and exact wave
functions. We find evidence for the existence of a long-range Coulomb hole in
the large-spheres regime, and infer that unrestricted Hartree-Fock theory
over-localizes the electrons.
