Sneutrino-antisneutrino oscillation can be a very useful probe to look for
signatures of lepton number violation ($\Delta L = 2$) at the LHC. Here, we
discuss the effect of the boost factor $\gamma$ and the travelling distance $L$
on the probability of the oscillation. We demonstrate that these two parameters
can significantly alter the probability of the oscillation when the sneutrinos
are ultrarelativistic and have a very small total decay width. We propose a
scenario where these requirements are fulfilled and which produces interesting
signals at the LHC even for a mass splitting $\Delta m$ as small as $10^{-14}$
GeV between the sneutrino mass eigenstates.
