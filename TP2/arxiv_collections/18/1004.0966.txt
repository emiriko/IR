The Anderson localization transition is considered at finite temperatures.
This includes the electrical conductivity as well as the electronic thermal
conductivity and the thermoelectric coefficients. An interesting critical
behavior of the latter is found. A method for characterizing the conductivity
critical exponent, an important signature of the transition, using the
conductivity and thermopower measurements, is outlined.
