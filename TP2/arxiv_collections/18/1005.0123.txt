Motivated by recent works [1,2], we investigate new agegraphic model of dark
energy in the framework of RS II braneworld. We also include the case of
variable gravitational constant in our model. Furthermore, we establish
correspondence between the new agegraphic dark energy with other dark energy
candidates based on scalar fields.
