Surface waves on a stationary flow of water are considered, in a linear model
that includes the surface tension of the fluid. The resulting gravity-capillary
waves experience a rich array of horizon effects when propagating against the
flow. In some cases three horizons (points where the group velocity of the wave
reverses) exist for waves with a single laboratory frequency. Some of these
effects are familiar in fluid mechanics under the name of wave blocking, but
other aspects, in particular waves with negative co-moving frequency and the
Hawking effect, were overlooked until surface waves were investigated as
examples of analogue gravity [Sch\"utzhold R and Unruh W G 2002 Phys. Rev. D 66
044019]. A comprehensive presentation of the various horizon effects for
gravity-capillary waves is given, with emphasis on the deep water/short
wavelength case kh>>1 where many analytical results can be derived. A
similarity of the state space of the waves to that of a thermodynamic system is
pointed out.
