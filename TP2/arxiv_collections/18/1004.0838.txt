In the theory of algorithmic randomness, one of the central notions is that
of computable randomness. An infinite binary sequence X is computably random if
no recursive martingale (strategy) can win an infinite amount of money by
betting on the values of the bits of X. In the classical model, the martingales
considered are real-valued, that is, the bets made by the martingale can be
arbitrary real numbers. In this paper, we investigate a more restricted model,
where only integer-valued martingales are considered, and we study the class of
random sequences induced by this model.
