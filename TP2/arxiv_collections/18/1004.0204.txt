This paper gives an overview of radio interfaces devoted for high data rate
Wireless Sensor Networks. Four aerospace applications of WSN are presented to
underline the importance of achieving high data rate. Then, two modulation
schemes by which High Data Rate can be achieved are compared : Multi carrier
approaches, represented by the popular Orthogonal Frequency Division
Multiplexing (OFDM) and Single carrier methods, represented by Single Carrier
Frequency division Equalization and its application for multiple access Single
Carrier Frequency division multiple Access (SC-FDMA). SC-FDMA, with a very low
Peak Average Power Ratio (PAPR), is as strong alternative to the OFDM scheme
for highly power constraint application. The Chosen radio interface will be,
finally, tested by a model based design approach based on Simulink and FPGA
realization. SC-FDMA, with a very low Peak Average Power Ratio (PAPR), is as
