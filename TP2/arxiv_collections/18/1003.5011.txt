A voltage bias applied to a conductor induces a change of the current noise
with respect to the equilibrium noise known as excess noise. We analyze the
excess noise of the electronic current flowing through a mesoscopic
Aharonov-Bohm ring threaded by a magnetic flux, coupled to a side gate, and
contacted by two metallic electrodes. It is shown that the excess noise can be
controlled both magnetically and electrostatically, demonstrating the full
tunability of the system. At zero frequency, the ratio of the noise strength to
the current (Fano factor) can thereby be minimized. Remarkably, at finite
frequency, regions of negative excess noise emerge.
