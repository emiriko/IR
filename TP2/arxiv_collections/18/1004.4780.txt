Solitary wave and soliton solutions of nonlinear equations are well known for
physicists. A soliton is a solitary wave with some outstanding features which
make it reasonable to be studied seriously in nonlinear systems. In fact most
of the nonlinear systems which have solitary wave solutions, has no soliton
solutions. To realize a solitary wave as a soliton, we must prepare some
initial conditions to collide two or more solitary wave solutions. In fact it
is not possible to prepare such initial conditions for any nonlinear system
with solitary wave solutions. In this paper we study the conditions that a
system should have, to prepare a combination of its single solitary wave
solutions as an initial condition for collision. These systems accept a
combination of separated single solitary waves as an initial condition, so we
call them separable systems. We see a system with periodic potential that zero
is one of its vacuum points is separable. We observed that separable systems
have two distinct set of solitons, but in general, if we collide members of
different sets, they may not behave like solitons.
