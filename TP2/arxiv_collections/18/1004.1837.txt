We use synchrotron x-ray diffraction and electrical transport under pressure
to probe both the magnetism and the structure of single crystal NiS2 across its
Mott-Hubbard transition. In the insulator, the low-temperature
antiferromagnetic order results from superexchange among correlated electrons
and couples to a (1/2, 1/2, 1/2) superlattice distortion. Applying pressure
suppresses the insulating state, but enhances the magnetism as the
superexchange increases with decreasing lattice constant. By comparing our
results under pressure to previous studies of doped crystals we show that this
dependence of the magnetism on the lattice constant is consistent for both band
broadening and band filling. In the high pressure metallic phase the lattice
symmetry is reduced from cubic to monoclinic, pointing to the primary influence
of charge correlations at the transition. There exists a wide regime of phase
separation that may be a general characteristic of correlated quantum matter.
