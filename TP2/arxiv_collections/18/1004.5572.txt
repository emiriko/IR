We propose a simple model to compute the probability of success under a
quorum sensing strategy. We show that a quorum sensing strategy has a higher
probability of success than an individualistic strategy when, for instance, the
probability of success for a single individual is low and the cost of building
a quorum is not too high. On the other hand if the cost of building a quorum is
too high then the probability of success under quorum sensing always decreases
as a function of the quorum.
