This paper is mainly devoted to applying the invariant, fast, Lyapunov
indicator to clarify some doubt regarding the apparently conflicting results of
chaos in spinning compact binaries at the second-order post-Newtonian
approximation of general relativity from previous literatures. It is shown with
a number of examples that no single physical parameter or initial condition can
be described as responsible for causing chaos, but a complicated combination of
all parameters and initial conditions is responsible. In other words, a
universal rule for the dependence of chaos on each parameter or initial
condition cannot be found in general. Chaos does not depend only on the mass
ratio, and the maximal spins do not necessarily bring the strongest effect of
chaos. Additionally, chaos does not always become drastic when the initial spin
vectors are nearly perpendicular to the orbital plane, and the alignment of
spins cannot trigger chaos by itself.
