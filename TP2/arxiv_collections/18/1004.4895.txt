We explore the "Beautiful Mirrors" model, which aims to explain the measured
value of $A^b_{FB}$, discrepant at the $2.9\sigma$ level. This scenario
introduces vector-like quarks which mix with the bottom, subtly affecting its
coupling to the $Z$. The spectrum of the new particles consists of two
bottom-like quarks and a charge -4/3 quark, all of which have electroweak
interactions with the third generation. We explore the phenomenology and
discovery reach for these new particles at the LHC, exploring single mirror
quark production modes whose rates are proportional to the same mixing
parameters which resolve the $A_{FB}^b$ anomaly. We find that for mirror quark
masses $\lesssim 500 GeV, a 14 TeV LHC with 300 {\rm fb}^{-1}$ is required to
reasonably establish the scenario and extract the relevant mixing parameters.
