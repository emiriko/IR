Feedback from protostellar outflows can influence the nature of turbulence in
star forming regions even if they are not the primary source of velocity
dispersion for all scales of molecular clouds. For the rate and power expected
in star forming regions, we previously (Carroll et al. 2009) demonstrated that
outflows could drive supersonic turbulence at levels consistent with the
scaling relations from Matzner 2007 although with a steeper velocity power
spectrum than expected for an isotropically driven supersonic turbulent
cascade. Here we perform higher resolution simulations and combine simulations
of outflow driven turbulence with those of isotropically forced turbulence. We
find that the presence of outflows within an ambient isotropically driven
turbulent environment produces a knee in the velocity power spectrum at the
outflow scale and a steeper slope at sub-outflow scales than for a purely
isotropically forced case. We also find that the presence of outflows flattens
the density spectrum at large scales effectively reducing the formation of
large scale turbulent density structures. These effects are qualitatively
independent of resolution. We have also carried out Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) for synthetic data from our simulations. We find that PCA as a
tool for identifying the driving scale of turbulence has a misleading bias
toward low amplitude large scale velocity structures even when they are not
necessarily the dominant energy containing scales. This bias is absent for
isotropically forced turbulence but manifests strongly for collimated outflow
driven turbulence.
