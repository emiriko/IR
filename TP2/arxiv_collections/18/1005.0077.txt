We show for very general classes of measures on locally compact second
countable groups that every Borel measurable quasimorphism is at bounded
distance from a quasi-biharmonic one. This allows us to deduce non-degenerate
central limit theorems and laws of the iterated logarithm for such
quasimorphisms along regular random walks on topological groups using classical
martingale limit theorems of Billingsley and Stout. For quasi-biharmonic
quasimorphism on countable groups we also obtain integral representations using
martingale convergence.
