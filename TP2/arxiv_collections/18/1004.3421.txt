We present HI observations performed at the GMRT of the nearby dwarf galaxy
NGC 1560. This Sd galaxy is well-known for a distinct "wiggle" in its rotation
curve. Our new observations have twice the resolution of the previously
published HI data. We derived the rotation curve by taking projection effects
into account, and we verified the derived kinematics by creating model
datacubes. This new rotation curve is similar to the previously published one:
we confirm the presence of a clear wiggle. The main differences are in the
innermost ~100 arcsec of the rotation curve, where we find slightly (<~ 5 km/s)
higher velocities. Mass modelling of the rotation curve results in good fits
using the core-dominated Burkert halo (which however does not reproduce the
wiggle), bad fits using the a Navarro, Frenk & White halo, and good fits using
MOND (Modified Newtonian Dynamics), which also reproduces the wiggle.
