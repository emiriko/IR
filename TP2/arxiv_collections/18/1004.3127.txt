The assembly of molecular networks into structures such as random tilings and
glasses has recently been demonstrated for a number of two-dimensional systems.
These structures are dynamically-arrested on experimental timescales so the
critical regime in their formation is that of initial growth. Here we identify
a transition from energetic to entropic stabilisation in the nucleation and
growth of a molecular rhombus tiling. Calculations based on a lattice gas model
show that clustering of topological defects and the formation of faceted
boundaries followed by a slow relaxation to equilibrium occurs under conditions
of energetic stabilisation. We also identify an entropically-stabilised regime
in which the system grows directly into an equilibrium configuration without
the need for further relaxation. Our results provide a methodology for
identifying equilibrium and non-equilibrium randomness in the growth of
molecular tilings, and we demonstrate that equilibrium spatial statistics are
compatible with exponentially slow dynamical behaviour.
