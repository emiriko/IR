In classical problem solving, there is of course correlation between the
selection of the problem on the part of Bob (the problem setter) and that of
the solution on the part of Alice (the problem solver). In quantum problem
solving, this correlation becomes quantum. This means that Alice contributes to
selecting 50% of the information that specifies the problem. As the solution is
a function of the problem, this gives to Alice advanced knowledge of 50% of the
information that specifies the solution. Both the quadratic and exponential
speed ups are explained by the fact that quantum algorithms start from this
advanced knowledge.
