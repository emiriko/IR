We show that if C is a simple closed curve bounding an embedded disk in a
closed 3-manifold M, then there exists a disk D in M with boundary C such that
D minimizes the area among the embedded disks with boundary C. Moreover, D is
smooth, minimal and embedded everywhere except where the boundary C meets the
interior of D. The same result is also valid for homogenously regular manifolds
with sufficiently convex boundary.
