We consider a quantum harmonic oscillator coupled to a general nonequilibrium
environment. We show that the decoherence factor can be expressed in terms of a
measurable effective temperature, defined via a generalized
fluctuation-dissipation relation. We further propose a simple experimental
scheme to determine the time-dependent effective temperature in a linear Paul
trap with engineered reservoirs. Our formalism allows quantitative description
of nonequilibrium decoherence in the presence of an arbitrary number of
non-Markovian noise sources in a unified manner.
