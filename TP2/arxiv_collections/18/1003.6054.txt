We present universal continuous variable quantum computation (CVQC) in the
micromaser. With a brief history as motivation we present the background theory
and define universal CVQC. We then show how to generate a set of operations in
the micromaser which can be used to achieve universal CVQC. It then follows
that the micromaser is a potential architecture for CVQC but our proof is
easily adaptable to other potential physical systems.
