We present a detailed study of the non-linear thermoelectric properties of a
molecular junction, represented by a dissipative Anderson-Holstein model. A
single orbital level with strong Coulomb interaction is coupled to a localized
vibrational mode and we account for both electron and phonon exchange with both
electrodes, investigating how these contribute to the heat and charge
transport. We calculate the efficiency and power output of the device operated
as a heat to electric power converter and identify the optimal operating
conditions, which are found to be qualitatively changed by the presence of the
vibrational mode. Based on this study of a generic model system, we discuss the
desirable properties of molecular junctions for thermoelectric applications.
