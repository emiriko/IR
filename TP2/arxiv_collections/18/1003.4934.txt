We present a two-flavour linear sigma model with global chiral symmetry and
vector and axial-vector mesons. We calculate pion-pion scattering lengths and
the decay widths of scalar, vector, and axial-vector mesons. It is demonstrated
that vector and axial-vector meson degrees of freedom play an important role in
these low-energy processes and that a reasonable theoretical description
requires globally chirally invariant terms other than the vector meson mass
term. An important question for meson vacuum phenomenology is the quark content
of the physical scalar f0(600) and a0(980) mesons. We investigate this question
by assigning the quark-antiquark sigma and a0 states of our model with these
physical mesons. We show via a detailed comparison with experimental data that
this scenario can describe all vacuum properties studied here except for the
decay width of the sigma, which turns out to be too small. We also study the
alternative assignment f0(1370) and a0(1450) for the scalar mesons. In this
case the decay width agrees with the experimental value, but the pion-pion
scattering length $a_{0}^{0}$ is too small. This indicates the necessity to
extend our model by additional scalar degrees of freedom.
