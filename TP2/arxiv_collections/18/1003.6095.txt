Recombination of minority carriers in heavily doped n-InP wafers has been
investigated using spectral and time-resolved photoluminescence at different
temperatures. Studies of the transmitted luminescence were enabled by the
partial transparency of the samples due to the Moss-Burstein effect. Temporal
evolution of the transmitted luminescence shows virtually no effect of surface
recombination but is strongly influenced by photon recycling. Temperature
dependence of the decay time suggests Auger recombination as the dominant
non-radiative process at room temperature. Radiative quantum efficiency has
been evaluated at different doping levels and at 2x1018 cm-3 it is found to be
as high as 97%, which makes n-InP suitable for scintillator application.
