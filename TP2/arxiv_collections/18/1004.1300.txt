We establish exponential localization for a multi-particle Anderson model in
a Euclidean space of an arbitrary dimension, in presence of a non-trivial
short-range interaction and an alloy-type random external potential.
Specifically, we prove that all eigenfunctions with eigenvalues near the lower
edge of the spectrum decay exponentially.
