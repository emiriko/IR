We analyze several aspects of the transport dynamics in the LH1-RC core of
purple bacteria, which consists basically in a ring of antenna molecules that
transport the energy into a target molecule, the reaction center, placed in the
center of the ring. We show that the periodicity of the system plays an
important role to explain the relevance of the initial state in the transport
efficiency. This picture is modified, and the transport enhanced for any
initial state, when considering that molecules have different energies, and
when including their interaction with the environment. We study this last
situation by using stochastic Schr{\"o}dinger equations, both for Markovian and
non-Markovian type of interactions.
