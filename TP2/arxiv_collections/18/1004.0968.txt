Electrostatic velocity filtering is a technique for the production of
continuous guided beams of slow polar molecules from a thermal gas. We extended
this technique to produce pulses of slow molecules with a narrow velocity
distribution around a tunable velocity. The pulses are generated by
sequentially switching the voltages on adjacent segments of an electric
quadrupole guide synchronously with the molecules propagating at the desired
velocity. This technique is demonstrated for deuterated ammonia (ND$_{3}$),
delivering pulses with a velocity in the range of $20-100\,\rm{m/s}$ and a
relative velocity spread of $(16\pm 2)\,%$ at FWHM. At velocities around
$60\,\rm{m/s}$, the pulses contain up to $10^6$ molecules each. The data are
well reproduced by Monte-Carlo simulations, which provide useful insight into
the mechanisms of velocity selection.
