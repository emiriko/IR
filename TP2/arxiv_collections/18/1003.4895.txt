We show that simulations of polymer rheology at a fluctuating mesoscopic
scale and at the macroscopic scale where flow instabilities occur can be
achieved at the same time with dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) technique.}
We model the visco-elasticity of polymer liquids by introducing a finite
fraction of dumbbells in the standard DPD fluid. The stretching and tumbling
statistics of these dumbbells is in agreement with what is known for isolated
polymers in shear flows. At the same time, the model exhibits behaviour
reminiscent of drag reduction in the turbulent state: as the polymer fraction
increases, the onset of turbulence in plane Couette flow is pushed to higher
Reynolds numbers. The method opens up the possibility to model nontrivial
rheological conditions with ensuing coarse grained polymer statistics.
