In this article, we establish Gaussian decay for the Box_b-heat kernel on
polynomial models in C^2. Our technique attains the exponential decay via a
partial Fourier transform. On the transform side, the problem becomes finding
quantitative smoothness estimates on a heat kernel associated to the weighted
dbar-operator on L^2(C). The bounds are established with Duhamel's formula and
careful estimation.
