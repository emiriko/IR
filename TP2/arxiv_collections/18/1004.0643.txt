We present deep high angular resolution observations of the high-mass
protostar NGC 7538S, which is in the center of a cold dense cloud core with a
radius of 0.5 pc and a mass of ~2,000 Msun. These observations show that NGC
7538S is embedded in a compact elliptical core with a mass of 85 - 115 Msun.
The star is surrounded by a rotating accretion disk, which powers a very young,
hot molecular outflow approximately perpendicular to the rotating accretion
disk. The accretion rate is very high, ~ 1.4 - 2.8 10^-3 Msun yr^-1. Evidence
for rotation of the disk surrounding the star is seen in all largely optically
thin molecular tracers, H13CN J = 1-0, HN13C J = 1-0, H13CO+ J = 1-0, and DCN J
= 3-2. Many molecules appear to be affected by the hot molecular outflow,
including DCN and H13CO+. The emission from CH3CN, which has often been used to
trace disk rotation in young high-mass stars, is dominated by the outflow,
especially at higher K-levels. Our new high-angular resolution observations
show that the rotationally supported part of the disk is smaller than we
previously estimated. The enclosed mass of the inner, rotationally supported
part of the disk (D ~ 5", i.e 14,000 AU) is ~ 14 - 24 Msun.
