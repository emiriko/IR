Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) are established tools to model
physical phenomena whose dynamics are affected by random noise. By estimating
parameters of an SDE intrinsic randomness of a system around its drift can be
identified and separated from the drift itself. When it is of interest to model
dynamics within a given population, i.e. to model simultaneously the
performance of several experiments or subjects, mixed-effects modelling allows
for the distinction of between and within experiment variability. A framework
to model dynamics within a population using SDEs is proposed, representing
simultaneously several sources of variation: variability between experiments
using a mixed-effects approach and stochasticity in the individual dynamics
using SDEs. These "stochastic differential mixed-effects models" have
applications in e.g. pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics and biomedical
modelling. A parameter estimation method is proposed and computational
guidelines for an efficient implementation are given. Finally the method is
evaluated using simulations from standard models like the two-dimensional
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) and the square root models.
