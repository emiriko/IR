We employ the metric of Schwarzschild space surrounded by quintessential
matter to study the trajectories of test masses on the motion of a binary
system. The results, which are obtained through the gradually approximate
approach, can be used to search for dark energy via the difference of the
azimuth angle of the pericenter. The classification of the motion is discussed.
