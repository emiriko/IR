Every set (finite or infinite) of quantum vectors (states) satisfies
generalized orthoarguesian equations ($n$OA). We consider two 3-dim
Kochen-Specker (KS) sets of vectors and show how each of them should be
represented by means of a Hasse diagram---a lattice, an algebra of subspaces of
a Hilbert space--that contains rays and planes determined by the vectors so as
to satisfy $n$OA. That also shows why they cannot be represented by a special
kind of Hasse diagram called a Greechie diagram, as has been erroneously done
in the literature. One of the KS sets (Peres') is an example of a lattice in
which 6OA pass and 7OA fails, and that closes an open question of whether the
7oa class of lattices properly contains the 6oa class. This result is important
because it provides additional evidence that our previously given proof of noa
=< (n+1)oa can be extended to proper inclusion noa < (n+1)oa and that nOA form
an infinite sequence of successively stronger equations.
