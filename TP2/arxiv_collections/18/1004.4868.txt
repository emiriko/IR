The synthesis of polymer-like amorphous carbon (a-C:H) thin-films by
microwave excited collisional hydrocarbon plasma process is reported. Stable
and highly aromatic a-C:H were obtained containing significant inclusions of
poly(p-phenylene vinylene) (PPV). PPV confers universal optoelectronic
properties to the synthesised material. That is a-C:H with tailor-made
refractive index are capable of becoming absorption-free in visible (red) -
near infrared wavelength range. Production of large aromatic hydrocarbon
including phenyl clusters and/or particles is attributed to enhanced
coagulation of elemental plasma species under collisional plasma conditions.
Detailed structural and morphological changes that occur in a-C:H during the
plasma synthesis are also described.
