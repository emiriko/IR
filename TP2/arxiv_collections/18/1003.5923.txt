We prove that the Hamiltonian of the model describing a spin which is
linearly coupled to a field of relativistic and massless bosons, also known as
the spin-boson model, admits a ground state for small values of the coupling
constant lambda. We show that the ground state energy is an analytic function
of lambda and that the corresponding ground state can also be chosen to be an
analytic function of lambda. No infrared regularization is imposed. Our proof
is based on a modified version of the BFS operator theoretic renormalization
analysis. Moreover, using a positivity argument we prove that the ground state
of the spin-boson model is unique. We show that the expansion coefficients of
the ground state and the ground state energy can be calculated using regular
analytic perturbation theory.
