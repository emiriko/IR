A monotone self-mapping of the nonnegative orthant induces a monotone
discrete-time dynamical system which evolves on the same orthant. If with
respect to this system the origin is attractive then there must exists points
whose image under the monotone map is strictly smaller than the original point,
in the component-wise partial ordering. Here it is shown how such points can be
found numerically, leading to a recipe to compute order intervals that are
contained in the region of attraction and where the monotone map acts
essentially as a contraction. An important application is the numerical
verification of so-called generalized small-gain conditions that appear in the
stability theory of large-scale systems.
