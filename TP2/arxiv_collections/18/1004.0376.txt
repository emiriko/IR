High spatial resolution observations of the H\alpha-emitting wind structure
associated with the Luminous Blue Variable star P Cygni were obtained with the
Navy Prototype Optical Interferometer (NPOI). These observations represent the
most comprehensive interferometric data set on P Cyg to date. We demonstrate
how the apparent size of the H\alpha-emitting region of the wind structure of P
Cyg compares between the 2005, 2007 and 2008 observing seasons and how this
relates to the H\alpha line spectroscopy. Using the data sets from 2005, 2007
and 2008 observing seasons, we fit a circularly symmetric Gaussian model to the
interferometric signature from the H\alpha-emitting wind structure of P Cyg.
Based on our results we conclude that the radial extent of the H\alpha-emitting
wind structure around P Cyg is stable at the 10% level. We also show how the
radial distribution of the H\alpha flux from the wind structure deviates from a
Gaussian shape, whereas a two-component Gaussian model is sufficient to fully
describe the H\alpha-emitting region around P Cyg.
