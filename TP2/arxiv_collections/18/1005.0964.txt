This paper presents the chemical abundance analysis of a sample of 18 giant
stars in 3 old globular clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud, namely NGC
1786, NGC 2210 and NGC 2257. The derived iron content is [Fe/H]= --1.75+-0.01
dex (sigma= 0.02 dex), --1.65+-0.02 dex (sigma= 0.04 dex) and --1.95+-0.02 dex
(sigma= 0.04 dex) for NGC 1786, NGC 2210 and NGC 2257, respectively. All the
clusters exhibit similar abundance ratios, with enhanced values (+0.30 dex) of
[alpha/Fe], consistent with the Galactic Halo stars, thus indicating that these
clusters have formed from a gas enriched by Type II SNe. We also found evidence
that r-process are the main channel of production of the measured neutron
capture elements (Y, Ba, La, Nd, Ce and Eu). In particular the quite large
enhancement of [Eu/Fe] (+0.70 dex) found in these old clusters clearly
indicates a relevant efficiency of the r-process mechanism in the LMC
environment.
