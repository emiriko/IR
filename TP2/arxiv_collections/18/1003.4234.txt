A shell-model study of proton-neutron pairing in f - p shell nuclei using a
parametrized hamiltonian that includes deformation and spin-orbit effects as
well as isoscalar and isovector pairing is reported. By working in a
shell-model framework we are able to assess the role of the various modes of
proton-neutron pairing in the presence of nuclear deformation without violating
symmetries. Results are presented for $^{44}$Ti, $^{46}$Ti and $^{48}$Cr.
