The extraction of a 'haze' from the WMAP microwave skymaps is based on
subtraction of known foregrounds, viz. free-free (bremsstrahlung), thermal dust
and synchrotron, each traced by other skymaps. While the 408 MHz all-sky survey
is used for the synchrotron template, the WMAP bands are at tens of GHz where
the spatial distribution of the radiating cosmic ray electrons ought to be
quite different because of the energy-dependence of their diffusion in the
Galaxy. The systematic uncertainty this introduces in the residual skymap is
comparable to the claimed haze and can, for certain source distributions, have
a very similar spectrum and latitudinal profile and even a somewhat similar
morphology. Hence caution must be exercised in interpreting the 'haze' as a
physical signature of, e.g., dark matter annihilation in the Galactic centre.
