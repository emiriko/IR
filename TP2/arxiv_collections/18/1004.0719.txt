We provide an analytic study of the dynamics of semiconductor lasers with
injection (pump) of spin-polarized electrons, previously considered in the
steady-state regime. Using complementary approaches of quasi-static and small
signal analyses, we elucidate how the spin modulation in semiconductor lasers
can improve performance, as compared to the conventional (spin-unpolarized)
counterparts. We reveal that the spin-polarized injection can lead to an
enhanced bandwidth and desirable switching properties of spin-lasers.
