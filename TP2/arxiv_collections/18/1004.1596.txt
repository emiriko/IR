Any infinite graph has site and bond percolation critical probabilities
satisfying $p_c^{site}\geq p_c^{bond}$. The strict version of this inequality
holds for many, but not all, infinite graphs.
  In this paper, the class of graphs for which the strict inequality holds is
extended to a continuum percolation model. In Gilbert's graph with
supercritical density on the Euclidean plane, there is almost surely a unique
infinite connected component. We show that on this component $p_c^{site} >
p_c^{bond}$. This also holds in higher dimensions.
