We compare two multi-detector detection strategies, namely, the coincidence
and the coherent, for the detection of spinless inspiraling compact binary
gravitational wave signals. The coincident strategy treats the detectors as if
they are isolated - compares individual detector statistics with their
respective thresholds while the coherent strategy combines the detector network
data {\it phase coherently} to obtain a single detection statistic which is
then compared with a single threshold. In the case of geographically separated
detectors, we also consider an {\it enhanced} coincidence strategy because the
usual (naive) coincidence strategy yields poor results for misaligned
detectors. For simplicity, we consider detector pairs having the same power
spectral density of noise, as that of initial LIGO and also assume the noise to
be stationary and Gaussian. We compare the performances of the methods by
plotting the \emph{receiver operating characteristic} (ROC) for the two
strategies. A single astrophysical source as well as a distribution of sources
is considered. We find that the coherent strategy performs better than the two
coincident strategies under the assumptions of stationary Gaussian detector
noise.
