Alain Connes' noncommutative theory led to an interesting model including
both Standard Model of particle physics and Euclidean Gravity. Nevertheless, an
hyperbolic version of the gravitational part would be necessary to make
physical predictions, but it is still under research. We shall present the
difficulties to generalize the model from Riemannian to Lorentzian Geometry and
discuss key ideas and current attempts.
