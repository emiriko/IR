Spatially indirect excitons in a coupled quantum well structure were studied
by means of polarization and time resolved photoluminescence. A strong degree
of circular polarization (> 50%) in emission was achieved when the excitation
energy was tuned into resonance with the direct exciton state. The indirect
transition remained polarized several tens of nanoseconds after the pumping
laser pulse, demonstrating directly a very long relaxation time of exciton
spin. The observed spin memory effect exceeds the radiative lifetime of the
indirect excitons.
