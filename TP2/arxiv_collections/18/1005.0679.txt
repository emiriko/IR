We report a theoretical study of the quasiparticle lifetime and the
quasiparticle mean free path caused by inelastic electron-electron scattering
in ferromagnetic compounds of the Co-Fe and Ni-Fe systems. The study is based
on spin-polarized calculations, which are performed within the $GW$
approximation for equiatomic and Co- and Ni-rich compounds, as well as for
their constituents. We mainly focus on the spin asymmetry of the quasiparticle
properties, which leads to the spin-filtering effect experimentally observed in
spin-dependent transport of hot electrons and holes in the systems under study.
By comparing with available experimental data on the attenuation length, we
estimate the contribution of the inelastic mean free path to the latter.
