In the context of the VLA-COSMOS Deep project additional VLA A array
observations at 1.4 GHz were obtained for the central degree of the COSMOS
field and combined with the existing data from the VLA-COSMOS Large project. A
newly constructed Deep mosaic with a resolution of 2.5" was used to search for
sources down to 4 sigma with 1 sigma ~ 12 microJy/beam in the central 50'x50'.
This new catalog is combined with the catalog from the Large project (obtained
at 1.5"x1.4" resolution) to construct a new Joint catalog. All sources listed
in the new Joint catalog have peak flux densities of >5 sigma at 1.5" and/or
2.5" resolution to account for the fact that a significant fraction of sources
at these low flux levels are expected to be slighty resolved at 1.5"
resolution. All properties listed in the Joint catalog such as peak flux
density, integrated flux density and source size are determined in the 2.5"
resolution Deep image. In addition, the Joint catalog contains 43 newly
identified multi-component sources.
