Effective multi-mode photon echo based quantum memory on multi-atomic
ensemble in the QED cavity is proposed. Analytical solution is obtained for the
quantum memory efficiency that can be equal unity when optimal relations for
the cavity and atomic parameters are held. Numerical estimation for realistic
atomic and cavity parameters demonstrates the high efficiency of the quantum
memory for optically thin resonant atomic system.
