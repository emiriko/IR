We present a new class of tensor network states that are specifically
designed to capture the electron correlation of a molecule of arbitrary
structure. In this ansatz, the electronic wave function is represented by a
Complete-Graph Tensor Network (CGTN) ansatz which implements an efficient
reduction of the number of variational parameters by breaking down the
complexity of the high-dimensional coefficient tensor of a
full-configuration-interaction (FCI) wave function. We demonstrate that CGTN
states approximate ground states of molecules accurately by comparison of the
CGTN and FCI expansion coefficients. The CGTN parametrization is not biased
towards any reference configuration in contrast to many standard quantum
chemical methods. This feature allows one to obtain accurate relative energies
between CGTN states which is central to molecular physics and chemistry. We
discuss the implications for quantum chemistry and focus on the spin-state
problem. Our CGTN approach is applied to the energy splitting of states of
different spin for methylene and the strongly correlated ozone molecule at a
transition state structure. The parameters of the tensor network ansatz are
variationally optimized by means of a parallel-tempering Monte Carlo algorithm.
