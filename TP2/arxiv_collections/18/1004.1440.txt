Using Laplace transform techniques, along with newly-developed accurate
numerical inverse Laplace transform algorithms, we decouple the solutions for
the singlet structure function $F_s(x,Q^2)$ and $G(x,Q^2)$ of the two
leading-order coupled singlet DGLAP equations, allowing us to write fully
decoupled solutions: F_s(x,Q^2)={\cal F}_s(F_{s0}(x), G_0(x)), G(x,Q^2)={\cal
G}(F_{s0}(x), G_0(x)). Here ${\cal F}_s$ and $\cal G$ are known
functions---found using the DGLAP splitting functions---of the functions
$F_{s0}(x) \equiv F_s(x,Q_0^2)$ and $G_{0}(x) \equiv G(x,Q_0^2)$, the chosen
starting functions at the virtuality $Q_0^2$. As a proof of method, we compare
our numerical results from the above equations with the published MSTW LO gluon
and singlet $F_s$ distributions, starting from their initial values at $Q_0^2=1
GeV^2$. Our method completely decouples the two LO distributions, at the same
time guaranteeing that both distributions satisfy the singlet coupled DGLAP
equations. It furnishes us with a new tool for readily obtaining the effects of
the starting functions (independently) on the gluon and singlet structure
functions, as functions of both $Q^2$ and $Q_0^2$. In addition, it can also be
used for non-singlet distributions, thus allowing one to solve analytically for
individual quark and gluon distributions values at a given $x$ and $Q^2$, with
typical numerical accuracies of about 1 part in $10^5$, rather than having to
evolve numerically coupled integral-differential equations on a two-dimensional
grid in $x, Q^2$, as is currently done.
