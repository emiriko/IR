Looking for associations among multiple variables is a topical issue in
statistics due to the increasing amount of data encountered in biology,
medicine and many other domains involving statistical applications. Graphical
models have recently gained popularity for this purpose in the statistical
literature. Following the ideas of the LASSO procedure designed for the linear
regression framework, recent developments dealing with graphical model
selection have been based on $\ell_1$-penalization. In the binary case,
however, exact inference is generally very slow or even intractable because of
the form of the so-called log-partition function. Various approximate methods
have recently been proposed in the literature and the main objective of this
paper is to compare them. Through an extensive simulation study, we show that a
simple modification of a method relying on a Gaussian approximation achieves
good performance and is very fast. We present a real application in which we
search for associations among causes of death recorded on French death
certificates.
