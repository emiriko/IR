The minimal supersymmetric standard model involves a rather restrictive Higgs
potential with two Higgs fields. Recently, the full set of classes of
symmetries allowed in the most general two Higgs doublet model was identified;
these classes do not include the supersymmetric limit as a particular class.
Thus, a physically meaningful definition of the supersymmetric limit must
involve the interaction of the Higgs sector with other sectors of the theory.
Here we show how one can construct basis invariant probes of supersymmetry
involving both the Higgs sector and the gaugino-higgsino Higgs interactions.
