We show that fundamental versions of the Deutsch-Jozsa and Bernstein-Vazirani
quantum algorithms can be performed using a small entangled cluster state
resource of only six qubits. We then investigate the minimal resource states
needed to demonstrate arbitrary n-qubit versions and a scalable method to
produce them. For this purpose we propose a versatile on-chip photonic
waveguide setup.
