Generalized Hidden Local Symmetry (GHLS) model is the chiral model of
pseudoscalar, vector, and axial vector mesons and their interactions. It
contains also the couplings of strongly interacting particles with electroweak
gauge bosons. Here, GHLS model is confronted with the ALEPH data on the decay
$\tau^-\to\pi^-\pi^-\pi^+\nu_\tau$. It is shown that the invariant mass
spectrum of final pions in this decay calculated in GHLS framework with the
single $a_1(1260)$ resonance disagrees with the experimental data at any
reasonable number of free GHLS parameters. Two modifications of GHLS model
based on inclusion of two additional heavier axial vector mesons are studied.
One of them giving a good description of the ALEPH data, with all the
parameters kept free is shown to result in very large
$\Gamma_{a_1^\pm\to\pi^\pm\gamma}$ partial width. The other scheme with the
GHLS parameters fixed in a way that the universality is preserved and the
observed central value of $\Gamma_{a_1^\pm\to\pi^\pm\gamma}$ is reached,
results in a good description of the three pion spectrum in
$\tau^-\to\pi^+\pi^-\pi^-\nu_\tau$ decay.
