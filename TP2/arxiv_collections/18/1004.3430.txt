We study the relation between neutron removal cross section ($\sigma_{-N}$)
and neutron skin thickness for finite neutron rich nuclei using the statistical
abrasion ablation (SAA) model. Different sizes of neutron skin are obtained by
adjusting the diffuseness parameter of neutrons in the Fermi distribution. It
is demonstrated that there is a good linear correlation between $\sigma_{-N}$
and the neutron skin thickness for neutron rich nuclei. Further analysis
suggests that the relative increase of neutron removal cross section could be
used as a quantitative measure for the neutron skin thickness in neutron rich
nuclei.
