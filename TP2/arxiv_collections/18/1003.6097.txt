Since the first limit on the (local) primordial non-Gaussianity parameter,
fNL, was obtained from COBE data in 2002, observations of the CMB have been
playing a central role in constraining the amplitudes of various forms of
non-Gaussianity in primordial fluctuations. The current 68% limit from the
7-year WMAP data is fNL=32+/-21, and the Planck satellite is expected to reduce
the uncertainty by a factor of four in a few years from now. If fNL>>1 is found
by Planck with high statistical significance, all single-field models of
inflation would be ruled out. Moreover, if the Planck satellite finds fNL=30,
then it would be able to test a broad class of multi-field models using the
four-point function (trispectrum) test of tauNL>=(6fNL/5)^2. In this article,
we review the methods (optimal estimator), results (WMAP 7-year), and
challenges (secondary anisotropy, second-order effect, and foreground) of
measuring primordial non-Gaussianity from the CMB data, present a science case
for the trispectrum, and conclude with future prospects.
