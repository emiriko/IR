We demonstrate experimentally dynamic interface binding in a system
consisting of two coupled ferromagnetic layers. While domain walls in each
layer have different velocity-field responses, for two broad ranges of the
driving field, H, walls in the two layers are bound and move at a common
velocity. The bound states have their own velocity-field response and arise
when the isolated wall velocities in each layer are close, a condition which
always occurs as H->0. Several features of the bound states are reproduced
using a one dimensional model, illustrating their general nature.
