We propose to use MapReduce to quickly test new retrieval approaches on a
cluster of machines by sequentially scanning all documents. We present a small
case study in which we use a cluster of 15 low cost ma- chines to search a web
crawl of 0.5 billion pages showing that sequential scanning is a viable
approach to running large-scale information retrieval experiments with little
effort. The code is available to other researchers at:
