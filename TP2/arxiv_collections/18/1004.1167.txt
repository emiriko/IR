We present the fifth edition of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Quasar
Catalog, which is based upon the SDSS Seventh Data Release. The catalog, which
contains 105,783 spectroscopically confirmed quasars, represents the conclusion
of the SDSS-I and SDSS-II quasar survey. The catalog consists of the SDSS
objects that have luminosities larger than M_i = -22.0 (in a cosmology with H_0
= 70 km/s/Mpc Omega_M = 0.3, and Omega_Lambda = 0.7) have at least one emission
line with FWHM larger than 1000 km/s or have interesting/complex absorption
features, are fainter than i > 15.0 and have highly reliable redshifts. The
catalog covers an area of 9380 deg^2. The quasar redshifts range from 0.065 to
5.46, with a median value of 1.49; the catalog includes 1248 quasars at
redshifts greater than four, of which 56 are at redshifts greater than five.
The catalog contains 9210 quasars with i < 18; slightly over half of the
entries have i< 19. For each object the catalog presents positions accurate to
better than 0.1" rms per coordinate, five-band (ugriz) CCD-based photometry
with typical accuracy of 0.03 mag, and information on the morphology and
selection method. The catalog also contains radio, near-infrared, and X-ray
emission properties of the quasars, when available, from other large-area
surveys. The calibrated digital spectra cover the wavelength region 3800-9200
Ang. at a spectral resolution R = 2000 the spectra can be retrieved from the
SDSS public database using the information provided in the catalog. Over 96% of
the objects in the catalog were discovered by the SDSS. We also include a
supplemental list of an additional 207 quasars with SDSS spectra whose archive
photometric information is incomplete.
