A vortex solid with self-generated randomness is found theoretically in a
frustrated Josephson junction array (JJA) under external magnetic field with
anisotropic couplings. Vorticies induced by external magnetic field develop
stripes parallel to the direction of weaker coupling. It is shown analytically
that there is a continuous, gapless band of metastable states in which stripes
are deformed randomly by transverse undulation. The vortex solid with the
frozen undulation in a metastable state freely slides along the direction of
stronger coupling, thereby destroying ordering of phases even at zero
temperature, but is jammed along the direction of weaker coupling.
