We review recent progress toward establishing lattice Quantum Chromodynamics
as a predictive calculational framework for nuclear physics. A survey of the
current techniques that are used to extract low-energy hadronic scattering
amplitudes and interactions is followed by a review of recent two-body and
few-body calculations by the NPLQCD collaboration and others. An outline of the
nuclear physics that is expected to be accomplished with Lattice QCD in the
next decade, along with estimates of the required computational resources, is
presented.
