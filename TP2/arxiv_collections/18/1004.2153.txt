In many applications expectation values are calculated by partitioning a
single experimental time series into an ensemble of data segments of equal
length. Such single trajectory ensemble (STE) is a counterpart to a multiple
trajectory ensemble (MTE) used whenever independent measurements or
realizations of a stochastic process are available. The equivalence of STE and
MTE for stationary systems was postulated by Wang and Uhlenbeck in their
classic paper on Brownian motion (Rev. Mod. Phys. 17, 323 (1945)) but
surprisingly has not yet been proved. Using the stationary and ergodic paradigm
of statistical physics -- the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) Langevin equation, we
revisit Wang and Uhlenbeck's postulate. In particular, we find that the
variance of the solution of this equation is different for these two ensembles.
While the variance calculated using the MTE quantifies the spreading of
independent trajectories originating from the same initial point, the variance
for STE measures the spreading of two correlated random walkers. Thus, STE and
MTE refer to two completely different dynamical processes. Guided by this
interpretation, we introduce a novel algorithm of partitioning a single
trajectory into a phenomenological ensemble, which we name a threshold
trajectory ensemble (TTE), that for an ergodic system is equivalent to MTE. We
find that in the cohort of healthy volunteers, the ratio of STE and TTE
asymptotic variances of stage 4 sleep electroencephalogram is equal to 1.96 \pm
0.04 which is in agreement with the theoretically predicted value of 2.
