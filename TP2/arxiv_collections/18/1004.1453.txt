The absorption of ultraviolet light creates excitations in DNA, which
subsequently start moving in the helix. Their fate is important for an
understanding of photo damage, and is determined by the interplay of electronic
couplings between bases and the structure of the DNA environment. We model the
effect of dynamical fluctuations in the environment and study correlation,
which is present when multiple base pairs interact with the same mode in the
environment. We find that the correlations strongly affect the exciton
dynamics, and show how they are observed in the decay of the anisotropy as a
function of a coherence and a population time in a non-linear optical
experiment.
