Eight decades ago, Arthur Holmes introducted the idea of mantle convection as
a mechanism for continental drift. Five decades ago, continental drift was
modified to become plate tectonics theory, which included mantle convection as
an absolutely critical component. Using the submarine design and operation
concept of "neutral buoyancy", which follows from Archimedes' discoveries, the
concept of mantle convection is proven to be incorrect, concomitantly refuting
plate tectonics, refuting all mantle convection models, and refuting all models
that depend upon mantle convection.
