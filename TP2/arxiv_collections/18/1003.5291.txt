In this letter we propose the design and simulation study of a novel
transistor, called HFinFET, which is a hybrid of a HEMT and a FinFET, to obtain
excellent performance and good off state control. Followed by the description
of the design, 3D device simulation has been performed to predict the
characteristics of the device. The device has been benchmarked against
published state of the art HEMT as well as planar and non-planar Si NMOSFET
data of comparable gate length using standard benchmarking techniques.
