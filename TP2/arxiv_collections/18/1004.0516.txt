We provide a geometric explanation for the existence of magnification
relations for the A, D, E family of caustic singularities, which were
established in recent work. In particular, it was shown that for families of
general mappings between planes exhibiting any of these caustic singularities,
and for any non-caustic target point, the total signed magnification of the
corresponding pre-images vanishes. As an application to gravitational lensing,
it was also shown that, independent of the choice of a lens model, the total
signed magnification vanishes for a light source anywhere in the four-image
region close to elliptic and hyperbolic umbilic caustics. This is a more global
and higher-order analog of the well-known fold and cusp magnification
relations. We now extend each of these mappings to weighted projective space,
which is a compact orbifold, and show that magnification relations translate
into a statement about the behavior of these extended mappings at infinity.
This generalizes multi-dimensional residue techniques developed in previous
work, and introduces weighted projective space as a new tool in the theory of
caustic singularities and gravitational lensing.
