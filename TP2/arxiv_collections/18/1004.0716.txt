From the customary view the Michelson-Morley experiment is used to expose the
failure of the aether theory. The key point in this experiment is the
\emph{fringe shift} of the interference pattern. Regularly, the fringe shift
calculations are only presented from the perspective of the inertial frame
where the one-way speed of light is anisotropic which gives a partial vision of
the problem. In a spirit of revision of these facts we have meticulously
analyzed the physics behind them. As a result, an angular effect which is based
on Huyghens principle and plays a fundamental role in the reflection of light
waves at moving mirrors is incorporated. Moreover, under the assumption of a
null result in the experiment, on the one hand, the fringe shift conditions
demand actual relativistic effects; on the other, it is confirmed that
Maxwell's electrodynamics and Galilean relativity are incompatible
formulations. From these two points at least three inertial theories follow:
(1) the special theory of relativity (SR), (2) a new aether theory (NET) based
on the Tangherlini transformations and (3) emission theories based on Ritz'
modification of electrodynamics. A brief review of their physical content is
presented and the problem of the aether detection as well as the propagation of
light, within the context of SR and the NET, are discussed. Despite the
overwhelming amount of evidences that apparently favors SR we claim that there
are no strong reasons to refuse the aether which conceived as a continuous
material medium, still stands up as a physical reality and could be physically
associated with dark matter, the cosmic background radiation and the vacuum
condensates of particle physics.
