A family of probability distributions attached to a class of generalized
weighted Bergman spaces on the Poincar\'e disk are introduced by constructing a
kind of generalized coherent states. Their main statistical parameters are
obtained explicitly. As application, photon number statistics related to
coherent states under consideration are discussed.
