We review the statistical properties of stars and brown dwarfs obtained from
the first hydrodynamical simulation of star cluster formation to produce more
than a thousand stars and brown dwarfs while simultaneously resolving the
lowest mass brown dwarfs (those with masses set by the opacity limit for
fragmentation), binaries with separations down to 1 AU, and discs with radii
greater than 10 AU. In particular, we present the eccentricity distribution of
the calculation's very-low-mass and brown dwarf binaries which has not been
previously published.
