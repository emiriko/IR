We propose a general study of standard bases of polynomial ideals with
parameters in the case where the monomial order is arbitrary. We give an
application to the computation of the stratification by the local
Hilbert-Samuel function. Moreover, we give an explicit upper bound for the
degree of a standard basis for an arbitrary order and also for the number of
the possible affine or local Hilbert-Samuel functions depending on the number
of variables and the maximal degree of the given generators.
