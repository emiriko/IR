M82 is a unique representative of a whole class of galaxies, starbursts with
superwinds, in the Very Nearby Galaxy Survey with Herschel. In addition, its
interaction with the M81 group has stripped a significant portion of its
interstellar medium from its disk. SPIRE maps now afford better
characterization of the far-infrared emission from cool dust outside the disk,
and sketch a far more complete picture of its mass distribution and energetics
than previously possible. They show emission coincident in projection with the
starburst wind and in a large halo, much more extended than the PAH band
emission seen with Spitzer. Some complex substructures coincide with the
brightest PAH filaments, and others with tidal streams seen in atomic hydrogen.
We subtract the far-infrared emission of the starburst and underlying disk from
the maps, and derive spatially-resolved far-infrared colors for the wind and
halo. We interpret the results in terms of dust mass, dust temperature, and
global physical conditions. In particular, we examine variations in the dust
physical properties as a function of distance from the center and the wind
polar axis, and conclude that more than two thirds of the extraplanar dust has
been removed by tidal interaction, and not entrained by the starburst wind.
