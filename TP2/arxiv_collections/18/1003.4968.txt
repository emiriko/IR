We show that an arbitrary body or aggregate can be made perfectly absorbing
at discrete frequencies if a precise amount of dissipation is added under
specific conditions of coherent monochromatic illumination. This effect arises
from the interaction of optical absorption and wave interference, and
corresponds to moving a zero of the elastic S-matrix onto the real wavevector
axis. It is thus the time-reversed process of lasing at threshold. The effect
is demonstrated in a simple Si slab geometry illuminated in the 500-900 nm
range. Coherent perfect absorbers are novel linear optical elements, absorptive
interferometers, which may be useful for controlled optical energy transfer.
