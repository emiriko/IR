We report the discovery of WASP-26b, a moderately over-sized Jupiter-mass
exoplanet transiting its 11.3-magnitude early-G-type host star (1SWASP
J001824.70-151602.3; TYC 5839-876-1) every 2.7566 days. A simultaneous fit to
transit photometry and radial-velocity measurements yields a planetary mass of
1.02 +/- 0.03 M_Jup and radius of 1.32 +/- 0.08 R_Jup. The host star, WASP-26,
has a mass of 1.12 +/- 0.03 M_sun and a radius of 1.34 +/- 0.06 R_sun and is in
a visual double with a fainter K-type star. The two stars are at least a
common-proper motion pair with a common distance of around 250 +/- 15 pc and an
age of 6 +/- 2 Gy.
