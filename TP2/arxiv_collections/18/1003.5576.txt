Using the relativistic Bethe-Salpeter method, the electron energy spectrum
and the semileptonic decay widths of $B^0_s\to D^-_s \ell^+{\nu_\ell}$ and
$B^0_s\to D_s^{*-}\ell^+{\nu_\ell}$ are calculated. We obtained large branching
ratios, $Br(B_s\to D_se\nu_e)=(2.85\pm0.35)% $ and $Br (B_s\to
D_s^*e\nu_e)=(7.09\pm0.88)%$, which can be easily detected in the future
experiment.
