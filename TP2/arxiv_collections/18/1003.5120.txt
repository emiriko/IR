We extend the study of a JP=2+, I=3/2 pion-Lambda-nucleon quasibound state
[Phys. Rev. D 78, 014013 (2008)] by solving nonrelativistic Faddeev equations,
using 3S1-3D1, Lambda N - Sigma N coupled channels Chiral Quark Model local
interactions, and pion-nucleon and coupled pion-Lambda - pion-Sigma separable
interactions fitted to the position and decay parameters of the Delta(1232) and
Sigma(1385) resonances, respectively. The results exhibit a strong sensitivity
to the p-wave pion-hyperon interaction, with a pion-Lambda-nucleon quasibound
state persisting over a wide range of acceptable parametrizations.
