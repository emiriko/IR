We consider pseudo-random number generators suitable for vector processors.
In particular, we describe vectorised implementations of the Box-Muller and
Polar methods, and show that they give good performance on the Fujitsu VP2200.
We also consider some other popular methods, e.g. the Ratio method of Kinderman
and Monahan (1977) (as improved by Leva (1992)), and the method of Von Neumann
and Forsythe, and show why they are unlikely to be competitive with the Polar
method on vector processors.
