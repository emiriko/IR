We estimate the splitting between the spatial correlation lengths in the
scalar and pseudoscalar channels in QCD at high temperature. The splitting is
due to the contribution of the instanton/anti-instanton chains in the thermal
ensemble, even though instanton contributions to thermodynamic quantities are
suppressed. The splitting vanishes at asymptotically high temperatures as
$\Delta M/M\propto (\Lambda_{QCD}/T)^b$, where $b$ is the beta function
coefficient.
