Structural and energy characteristics of the smallest magnetic endofullerene
Fe@C20 have been calculated using the density functional theory approach. The
ground state of Fe@C20 is found to be a septet state, and the magnetic moment
of Fe@C20 is estimated to be 8 Bohr magnetons. Characteristics of an (8,8)
carbon nanotube with a single Fe@C20 inside are studied in the framework of the
semiempirical approach. The scheme of a magnetic nanorelay based on
cantilevered nanotubes filled with magnetic endofullerenes is elaborated. The
proposed nanorelay is turned on as a result of bending of nanotubes by a
magnetic force. Operational characteristics of such a nanorelay based on (8,8)
and (21,21) nanotubes fully filled with Fe@C20 are estimated and compared to
the ones of a nanorelay made of a (21,21) nanotube fully filled with
experimentally observed (Ho3N)@C80 with the magnetic moment of 21 Bohr
magnetons. Room temperature operation of (21,21) nanotube based nanorelays is
shown.
