We construct the derived scheme of stable sheaves on a smooth projective
variety via derived moduli of finite graded modules over a graded ring. We do
this by dividing the derived scheme of actions of Ciocan-Fontanine and Kapranov
by a suitable algebraic gauge group. We show that the natural notion of
GIT-stability for graded modules reproduces stability for sheaves.
