The nuclear physics input used to compute the Monte Carlo reaction rates and
probability density functions that are tabulated in the second paper of this
series (Paper II) is presented. Specifically, we publish the input files to the
Monte Carlo reaction rate code RatesMC, which is based on the formalism
presented in the first paper of this series (Paper I). This data base contains
overwhelmingly experimental nuclear physics information. The survey of
literature for this review was concluded in November 2009.
