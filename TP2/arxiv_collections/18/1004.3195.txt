A mechanism in which gravity is the responsible for the generation of the
mass of scalar bosons and fermions was proposed recently [arXiv:1003.5126]. The
purpose of the present paper is to extend this scheme to vector bosons. The
main characteristic of this mechanism is that the gravitational field acts
really as a catalyzer, once the final expression of the mass we obtained
depends neither on the intensity of the gravitational field nor on the value of
Newton's constant.
