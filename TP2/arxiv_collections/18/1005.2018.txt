We propose a reconstruction of vortex beams based on the implementation of
quadratic transformations in the orbital angular momentum. The information is
encoded in a superposition of Bessel-like nondiffracting beams. The measurement
of the angular probability distribution at different positions allows for the
reconstruction of the Wigner function.
