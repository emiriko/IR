Periodicity is one of the most fundamental structural characteristics of
systems occurring in nature. The properties of these systems depend strongly on
the symmetry of the underlying periodic structure. In solid state materials -
for example - the static and transport properties as well as the magnetic and
electronic characteristics are crucially influenced by the crystal symmetry. In
this context, hexagonal structures play an extremely important role and lead to
novel physics like that of carbon nanotubes or graphene. Here we report on the
first realization of ultracold atoms in a spin-dependent optical lattice with
hexagonal symmetry. We show how combined effects of the lattice and
interactions between atoms lead to a forced antiferromagnetic N\'eel order when
two spin-components localize at different lattice sites. We also demonstrate
that the coexistence of two components - one Mott-insulating and the other one
superfluid - leads to the formation of a forced supersolid. Our observations
are consistent with theoretical predictions using Gutzwiller mean-field theory.
