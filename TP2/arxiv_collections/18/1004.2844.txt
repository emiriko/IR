Decoding of linear space-time block codes (STBCs) with sphere-decoding (SD)
is well known. A fast-version of the SD known as fast sphere decoding (FSD) has
been recently studied by Biglieri, Hong and Viterbo. Viewing a linear STBC as a
vector space spanned by its defining weight matrices over the real number
field, we define a quadratic form (QF), called the Hurwitz-Radon QF (HRQF), on
this vector space and give a QF interpretation of the FSD complexity of a
linear STBC. It is shown that the FSD complexity is only a function of the
weight matrices defining the code and their ordering, and not of the channel
realization (even though the equivalent channel when SD is used depends on the
channel realization) or the number of receive antennas. It is also shown that
the FSD complexity is completely captured into a single matrix obtained from
the HRQF. Moreover, for a given set of weight matrices, an algorithm to obtain
a best ordering of them leading to the least FSD complexity is presented. The
well known classes of low FSD complexity codes (multi-group decodable codes,
fast decodable codes and fast group decodable codes) are presented in the
framework of HRQF.
