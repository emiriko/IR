Graphs provide an efficient tool for object representation in various
computer vision applications. Once graph-based representations are constructed,
an important question is how to compare graphs. This problem is often
formulated as a graph matching problem where one seeks a mapping between
vertices of two graphs which optimally aligns their structure. In the classical
formulation of graph matching, only one-to-one correspondences between vertices
are considered. However, in many applications, graphs cannot be matched
perfectly and it is more interesting to consider many-to-many correspondences
where clusters of vertices in one graph are matched to clusters of vertices in
the other graph. In this paper, we formulate the many-to-many graph matching
problem as a discrete optimization problem and propose an approximate algorithm
based on a continuous relaxation of the combinatorial problem. We compare our
method with other existing methods on several benchmark computer vision
datasets.
