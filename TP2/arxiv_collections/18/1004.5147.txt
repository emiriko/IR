Levin and Wen [Phys. Rev. B 71, 045110 (2005)] have recently given a lattice
Hamiltonian description of doubled Chern-Simons theories. We relate the
partition function of these theories to an expectation of Wilson loops that
form a link in 2+1 dimensional spacetime known in the mathematical literature
as Chain-Mail. This geometric construction gives physical interpretation of the
Levin-Wen Hilbert space and Hamiltonian, its topological invariance, exactness
under coarse-graining, and how two opposite chirality sectors of the doubled
theory arise.
