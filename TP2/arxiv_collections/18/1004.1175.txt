From the parameterization of the pion-nucleon phase shift of the partial wave
P33, the pole position and width of the Delta(1232) resonance is determined by
using speed plot technique. We found the pole position and the half width of
the Delta(1232) resonance at the total center of mass energy W = (1211.47 - i
49.94) MeV. The results of our calculations are in agreement with the early
determinations.
