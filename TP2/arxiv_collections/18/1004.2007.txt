The temperature and pressure dependence of the partial density of phonon
states of iron atoms in superconducting Fe1.01Se was studied by 57Fe nuclear
inelastic scattering (NIS). The high energy resolution allows for a detailed
observation of spectral properties. A sharpening of the optical phonon modes
and shift of all spectral features towards higher energies by ~4% with
decreasing temperature from 296 K to 10 K was found. However, no detectable
change at the tetragonal - orthorhombic phase transition around 100 K was
observed. Application of a pressure of 6.7 GPa, connected with an increase of
the superconducting temperature from 8 K to 34 K, results in an increase of the
optical phonon mode energies at 296 K by ~12%, and an even more pronounced
increase for the lowest-lying transversal acoustic mode. Despite these strong
pressure-induced modifications of the phonon-DOS we conclude that the
pronounced increase of Tc in Fe1.01Se with pressure cannot be described in the
framework of classical electron-phonon coupling. This result suggests the
importance of spin fluctuations to the observed superconductivity.
