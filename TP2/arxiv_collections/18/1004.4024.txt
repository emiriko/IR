We present a multi-level graph partitioning algorithm based on the extreme
idea to contract only a single edge on each level of the hierarchy. This
obviates the need for a matching algorithm and promises very good partitioning
quality since there are very few changes between two levels. Using an efficient
data structure and new flexible ways to break local search improvements early,
we obtain an algorithm that scales to large inputs and produces the best known
partitioning results for many inputs. For example, in Walshaw's well known
benchmark tables we achieve 155 improvements dominating the entries for large
graphs.
