We consider the minimization problem of $\phi$-divergences between a given
probability measure $P$ and subsets $\Omega$ of the vector space
$\mathcal{M}_\mathcal{F}$ of all signed finite measures which integrate a given
class $\mathcal{F}$ of bounded or unbounded measurable functions. The vector
space $\mathcal{M}_\mathcal{F}$ is endowed with the weak topology induced by
the class $\mathcal{F}\cup \mathcal{B}_b$ where $\mathcal{B}_b$ is the class of
all bounded measurable functions. We treat the problems of existence and
characterization of the $\phi$-projections of $P$ on $\Omega$. We consider also
the dual equality and the dual attainment problems when $\Omega$ is defined by
linear constraints.
