I provide notes on the NFW, Einasto, Sersic, and other mass profiles which
provide good fits to simulated dark matter halos (S3). I summarize various
published c(M) relations: halo concentration as a function of mass (S1). The
definition of the virial radius is discussed and relations are given to convert
c_vir, M_vir, and r_vir between various defined values of the halo overdensity
(S2).
