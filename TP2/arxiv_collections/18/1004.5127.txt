Quantum money is a cryptographic protocol in which a mint can produce a
quantum state, no one else can copy the state, and anyone (with a quantum
computer) can verify that the state came from the mint. We present a concrete
quantum money scheme based on superpositions of diagrams that encode oriented
links with the same Alexander polynomial. We expect our scheme to be secure
against computationally bounded adversaries.
