Relationships between general long-range interacting classical systems on a
lattice and the corresponding mean-field models (infinitely long-range
interacting models) are investigated. We study systems in arbitrary dimension d
for periodic boundary conditions and focus on the free energy for fixed value
of the total magnetization. As a result, it is shown that the equilibrium free
energy of the long-range interacting systems are exactly the same as that of
the corresponding mean-field models (exactness of the mean-field theory).
Moreover, the mean-field metastable states can be also preserved in general
long-range interacting systems. It is found that in the case that the
magnetization is conserved, the mean-field theory does not give correct
property in some parameter region.
