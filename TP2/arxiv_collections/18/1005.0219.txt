This paper deals with temporal and archive object-oriented data warehouse
modelling and querying. In a first step, we define a data model describing
warehouses as central repositories of complex and temporal data extracted from
one information source. The model is based on the concepts of warehouse object
and environment. A warehouse object is composed of one current state, several
past states (modelling value changes) and several archive states (summarising
some value changes). An environment defines temporal parts in a warehouse
schema according to a relevant granularity (attribute, class or graph). In a
second step, we provide a query algebra dedicated to data warehouses. This
algebra, which is based on common object algebras, integrates temporal
operators and operators for querying object states. An other important
contribution concerns dedicated operators allowing users to transform warehouse
objects in temporal series as well as operators facilitating analytical
treatments.
