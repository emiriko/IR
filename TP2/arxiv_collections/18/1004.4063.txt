Identifying codes have been introduced in 1998 to model fault-detection in
multiprocessor systems. In this paper, we introduce two variations of
identifying codes: weak codes and light codes. They correspond to
fault-detection by successive rounds. We give exact bounds for those two
definitions for the family of cycles.
