This paper describes an object-oriented model for designing complex and
time-variant data warehouse data. The main contribution is the warehouse class
concept, which extends the class concept by temporal and archive filters as
well as a mapping function. Filters allow the keeping of relevant data changes
whereas the mapping function defines the warehouse class schema from a global
data source schema. The approach take into account static properties as well as
dynamic properties. The behaviour extraction is based on the use-matrix
concept.
