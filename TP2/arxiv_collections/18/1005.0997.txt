A circuit-field problem is considered. A resistor conducting a constant
current is argued to be associated with electromagnetic energy accumulated in
the surrounded space, though contrary to the case of an inductor or a
capacitor, this energy is always associated with both magnetic and electrical
fields. The circuit-theory point of view saying that a resistor has no
electromagnetic memory is accepted, but the necessarily involved (in view of
the field argument) capacitance and inductiveness are argued then also not be
associated with any memory. The mutually completing circuit and physical
arguments are presented as a dialog between a physicist and an electrical
engineer. How can you call "parasitic" the elements that represent the fields
due to which your resistor at all receives the energy?! -- asks the physicist
finally.
