The spin superfluidity -- superfluidity in the magnetic subsystem of a
condensed matter - is manifested as the spontaneous phase-coherent precession
of spins first discovered in 1984 in 3He-B. This superfluid current of spins -
spin supercurrent - is one more representative of superfluid currents known or
discussed in other systems, such as the superfluid current of mass and atoms in
superfluid 4He; superfluid current of electric charge in superconductors;
superfluid current of hypercharge in Standard Model of particle physics;
superfluid baryonic current and current of chiral charge in quark matter; etc.
Spin superfluidity can be described in terms of the Bose condensation of spin
waves - magnons. We discuss different phases of magnon superfluidity, including
those in magnetic trap; and signatures of magnons superfluidity: (i) spin
supercurrent, which transports the magnetization on a macroscopic distance more
than 1 cm long; (ii) spin current Josephson effect which shows interference
between two condensates; (iii) spin current vortex - a topological defect which
is an analog of a quantized vortex in superfluids, of an Abrikosov vortex in
superconductors, and cosmic strings in relativistic theories; (iv) Goldstone
modes related to the broken U(1) symmetry - phonons in the spin-superfluid
magnon gas; etc. We also touch the topic of spin supercurrent in general
including spin Hall and intrinsic quantum spin Hall effects.
