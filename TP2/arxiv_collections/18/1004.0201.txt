A general method for the direct evaluation of the temperature dependence of
the quantum-mechanical reaction rate constant in many-dimensional systems is
described. The method is based on the quantum instanton approximation for the
rate constant, thermodynamic integration with respect to the inverse
temperature, and the path integral Monte Carlo evaluation. It can describe
deviations from the Arrhenius law due to the coupling of rotations and
vibrations, zero-point energy, tunneling, corner-cutting, and other nuclear
quantum effects. The method is tested on the Eckart barrier and the
full-dimensional H + H_2 -> H_2 + H reaction. In the temperature range from
300K to 1500K, the error of the present method remains within 13% despite the
very large deviations from the Arrhenius law. The direct approach makes the
calculations much more efficient, and the efficiency is increased even further
(by up to two orders of magnitude in the studied reactions) by using optimal
estimators for reactant and transition state thermal energies. Which of the
estimators is optimal, however, depends on the system and the strength of
constraint in a constrained simulation.
