Simple rectilinear polygons (i.e. rectilinear polygons without holes or
cutpoints) can be regarded as finite rectangular cell complexes coordinatized
by two finite dendrons. The intrinsic $l_1$-metric is thus inherited from the
product of the two finite dendrons via an isometric embedding. The rectangular
cell complexes that share this same embedding property are called ramified
rectilinear polygons. The links of vertices in these cell complexes may be
arbitrary bipartite graphs, in contrast to simple rectilinear polygons where
the links of points are either 4-cycles or paths of length at most 3. Ramified
rectilinear polygons are particular instances of rectangular complexes obtained
from cube-free median graphs, or equivalently simply connected rectangular
complexes with triangle-free links. The underlying graphs of finite ramified
rectilinear polygons can be recognized among graphs in linear time by a
Lexicographic Breadth-First-Search. Whereas the symmetry of a simple
rectilinear polygon is very restricted (with automorphism group being a
subgroup of the dihedral group $D_4$), ramified rectilinear polygons are
universal: every finite group is the automorphism group of some ramified
rectilinear polygon.
