We discuss the shape of threshold signals in production cross sections of the
reaction e+ + e- --> D* + antiD*, at the opening of the D(s)* antiD(s)* and
Lambda(c)+ Lambda(c)- channels. Furthermore, evidence for the 3D, 5S, 4D, 6S,
5D, 7S, 6D, and 8S charmonium vector resonances is presented, on the basis of
data recently published by the BaBar Collaboration. Central masses and
resonance widths are estimated. Confirmation of these resonances would be a
huge step in lifting the precision level of hadron spectroscopy towards that of
atomic spectroscopy, with far-reaching consequences for theory.
