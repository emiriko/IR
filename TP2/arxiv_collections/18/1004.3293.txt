The nebula J222557+601148, tentatively identified by Morris et al. (2006) as
a young Galactic supernova remnant (SNR) from Spitzer Galactic First Look
Survey images and a follow-up mid-infrared spectrum, is unlikely to be a SNR
remnant based on Halpha, [O III], [S II] images and low dispersion optical
spectra. The object is seen in Halpha and [O III] 5007 images as a faint,
roughly circular ring nebula with dimensions matching that seen in 24 micron
Spitzer images. Low-dispersion optical spectra show it to have narrow Halpha
and [N II] 6548, 6583 line emissions with no evidence of broad or high-velocity
(v > 300 km/s) line emissions. The absence of any high-velocity optical
features, the presence of relatively strong [N II] emissions, a lack of
detected [S II] emission which would indicate the presence of shock-heated gas,
plus no coincident X-ray or nonthermal radio emissions indicate the nebula is
unlikely to be a SNR, young or old. Instead, it is likely a faint,
high-excitation planetary nebula (PN) as its elliptical morphology would
suggest, lying at a distance of approximately 2 - 3 kpc with unusual but not
extraordinary mid-IR colors and spectrum. We have identified a m_r' = 22.4 +/-
0.2 star as a PN central star candidate.
