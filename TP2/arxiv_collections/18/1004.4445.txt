Visual Cryptography is a special encryption technique to hide information in
images, which divide secret image into multiple layers. Each layer holds some
information. The receiver aligns the layers and the secret information is
revealed by human vision without any complex computation. The proposed
algorithm is for color image, that presents a system which takes four pictures
as an input and generates three images which correspond to three of the four
input pictures. The decoding requires only selecting some subset of these 3
images, making transparencies of them, and stacking them on top of each other,
so the forth picture is reconstructed by printing the three output images onto
transparencies and stacking them together. The reconstructed image achieved in
same size with original secret image.
