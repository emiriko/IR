The ATLAS Inner Detector is a composite tracking system consisting of silicon
pixels, silicon strips and straw tubes in a 2 T magnetic field. Its
installation was completed in August 2008 and the detector took part in data-
taking with single LHC beams and cosmic rays. The initial detector operation,
hardware commissioning and in-situ calibrations are described. Tracking
performance has been measured with 7.6 million cosmic-ray events, collected
using a tracking trigger and reconstructed with modular pattern-recognition and
fitting software. The intrinsic hit efficiency and tracking trigger
efficiencies are close to 100%. Lorentz angle measurements for both electrons
and holes, specific energy-loss calibration and transition radiation turn-on
measurements have been performed. Different alignment techniques have been used
to reconstruct the detector geometry. After the initial alignment, a transverse
impact parameter resolution of 22.1+/-0.9 {\mu}m and a relative momentum
resolution {\sigma}p/p = (4.83+/-0.16) \times 10-4 GeV-1 \times pT have been
measured for high momentum tracks.
