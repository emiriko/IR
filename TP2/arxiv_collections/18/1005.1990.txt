We discuss the impact of a finite effective range on three-body systems
interacting through a large two-body scattering length. By employing a
perturbative analysis in an effective field theory well suited to this scale
hierarchy we find that an additional three-body parameter is required for
consistent renormalization once range corrections are considered. This allows
us to extend previously discussed universal relations between different
observables in the recombination of cold atoms to account for the presence of a
finite effective range. We show that such range corrections allow us to
simultaneously describe the positive and negative scattering-length loss
features observed in recombination with Lithium-7 atoms by the Bar-Ilan group.
They do not, however, significantly reduce the disagreement between the
universal relations and the data of the Rice group on Lithium-7 recombination
at positive and negative scattering lengths.
