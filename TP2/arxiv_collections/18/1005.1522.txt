We present an exact calculation of the mean first-passage time to a small
target on the surface of a 2D or 3D spherical domain, for a molecule performing
surface-mediated diffusion. This minimal model of interfacial reactions, which
explicitly takes into account the combination of surface and bulk diffusion,
shows the importance of correlations induced by the coupling of the switching
dynamics to the geometry of the confinement, ignored so far. Interestingly, our
results show that, in the context of interfacial systems in confinement, the
reaction time can be minimized as a function of the desorption rate from the
surface, which puts forward a general mechanism of enhancement and regulation
of chemical reactivity.
