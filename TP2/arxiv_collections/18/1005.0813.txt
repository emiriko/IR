Time Series Data Server (TSDS) is a software package for implementing a
server that provides fast super-setting, sub-setting, filtering, and uniform
gridding of time series-like data. TSDS was developed to respond quickly to
requests for long time spans of data. Data may be served from a fast database,
typically created by aggregating granules (e.g., data files) from a remote data
source and storing them in a local cache that is optimized for serving time
series. The system was designed specifically for time series data, and is
optimized for requests where the longest dimension of the requested data
structure is time. Scalar, vector, and spectrogram time series types are
supported. The user can interact with the server by requesting a time series, a
date range, and an optional filter to apply to the data. Available filters
include strides, block average/minimum/maximum, exclude, and inequality.
Constraint expressions are supported, which allow such operations as a request
for data from one time series when a different time series satisfied a
specified relationship. TSDS builds upon DAP (Data Access Protocol), NcML
(netCDF Mark-up language) and related software libraries. In this work, we
describe the current design of this server, as well as planned features and
potential implementation strategies.
