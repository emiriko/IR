The production of charmed and beauty baryons in proton-proton collisions at
high energies is analyzed within the modified quark-gluon string model. We
present some predictions for the experiments on the forward beauty baryon
production in pp collisions at LHC energies. This analysis allows us to find
useful information on the Regge trajectories of the heavy (b barb) mesons and
the sea beauty quark distributions in the proton.
