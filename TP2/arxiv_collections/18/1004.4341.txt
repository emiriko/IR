Even 100 years after the discovery of cosmic rays their origin remains a
mystery. In recent years, TeV gamma-ray detectors have discovered and
investigated many Galactic sources where particles are accelerated up to
energies of 100 TeV. However, it has not been possible up to now to identify
these sites unambiguously as sources of hadronic acceleration. The observation
of cosmic high-energy neutrinos from these or other sources will be a
smoking-gun evidence for the sites of the acceleration of cosmic rays.
