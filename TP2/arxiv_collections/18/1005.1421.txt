A general coordinate invariant theory is constructed where confinement of
gauge fields and gauge dynamics in general is governed by the spontaneous
symmetry breaking (s.s.b.) of scale invariance. The model uses two measures of
integration in the action, the standard $\sqrt{-g}$ where $g$ is the
determinant of the metric and another measure $\Phi$ independent of the metric.
To implement scale invariance (S.I.), a dilaton field is introduced. Using the
first order formalism, curvature ( $\Phi R$ and $\sqrt{-g}R^{2}$ ) terms ,
gauge field term and dilaton kinetic terms are introduced in a conformally
invariant way. Exponential potentials for the dilaton break down (softly) the
conformal invariance down to global scale invariance, which also suffers s.s.b.
after integrating the equations of motion. The model has a well defined flat
space limit. As a result of the s.s.b. of scale invariance phases with
different vacuum energy density appear. Inside the bags, that is in the regions
of larger vacuum energy density, the gauge dynamics is normal, that is non
confining, while for the region of smaller vacuum energy density, the gauge
field dynamics is confining. Likewise, the dynamics of scalars, like would be
Goldstone bosons, is suppressed inside the bags.
