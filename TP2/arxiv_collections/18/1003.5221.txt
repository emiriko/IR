We report temperature and thermal-cycling dependence of surface and bulk
structures of double-layered perovskite Sr3Ru2O7 single crystals. The surface
and bulk structures were investigated using low-energy electron diffraction
(LEED) and single-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques, respectively.
Single-crystal XRD data is in good agreement with previous reports for the bulk
structure with RuO6 octahedral rotation, which increases with decreasing
temperature (~ 6.7(6)degrees at 300 K and ~ 8.1(2) degrees at 90 K). LEED
results reveal that the octahedra at the surface are much more distorted with a
higher rotation angle (~ 12 degrees between 300 and 80 K) and a slight tilt
((4.5\pm2.5) degrees at 300 K and (2.5\pm1.7) degrees at 80 K). While XRD data
confirms temperature dependence of the unit cell height/width ratio (i.e.
lattice parameter c divided by the average of parameters a and b) found in a
prior neutron powder diffraction investigation, both bulk and surface
structures display little change with thermal cycles between 300 and 80 K.
