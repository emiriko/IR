We have investigated a set of sodium cobaltates (NaxCoO2) samples with
various sodium content (0.67 \le x \le 0.75) using Nuclear Quadrupole Resonance
(NQR). The four different stable phases and an intermediate one have been
recognized. The NQR spectra of 59Co allowed us to clearly differentiate the
pure phase samples which could be easily distinguished from multi-phase
samples. Moreover, we have found that keeping samples at room temperature in
contact with humid air leads to destruction of the phase purity and loss of
sodium content. The high sodium content sample evolves progressively into a
mixture of the detected stable phases until it reaches the x=2/3 composition
which appears to be the most stable phase in this part of phase diagram.
