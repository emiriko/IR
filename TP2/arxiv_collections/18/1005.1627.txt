Transverse momentum (p^e_T) spectra of electrons from semileptonic weak
decays of heavy flavor mesons in the range of 0.3 < p^e_T < 9.0 GeV/c have been
measured at mid-rapidity (|eta| < 0.35) by the PHENIX experiment at the
Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider in p+p and Au+Au collisions at sqrt(s_NN)=200
GeV. The nuclear modification factor R_AA with respect to p+p collisions
indicates substantial energy loss of heavy quarks in the produced medium. In
addition, the azimuthal anisotropy parameter v_2 has been measured for 0.3 <
p^e_T < 5.0 GeV/c in Au+Au collisions. Comparisons of R_AA and v_2 are made to
various model calculations.
