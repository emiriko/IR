A simultaneous investigation of the space- and time-like electromagnetic form
factors of the charged kaon is presented within the framework of light-cone
QCD, with perturbative $k_T$-factorization including Sudakov suppression. The
effects of power suppressed sub-leading twists and the genuine ``soft'' QCD
corrections turn out to be dominant at low- and moderate-energies/momentum
transfers $Q^2$. Our predictions agree well with the available moderate-energy
experimental data, including the recent results from the CLEO measurements and
certain estimates based on the phenomenological analyses of $J/\psi$ decays.
