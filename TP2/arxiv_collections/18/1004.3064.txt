The dynamics of partons, hadrons and strings in relativistic nucleus-nucleus
collisions is analyzed within the novel Parton-Hadron-String Dynamics (PHSD)
transport approach, which is based on a dynamical quasiparticle model for
partons (DQPM) matched to reproduce recent lattice-QCD results - including the
partonic equation of state - in thermodynamic equilibrium. Scalar- and
vector-interaction densities are extracted from the DQPM as well as effective
scalar- and vector-mean fields for the partons. The transition from partonic to
hadronic degrees of freedom is described by covariant transition rates for the
fusion of quark-antiquark pairs or three quarks (antiquarks), respectively,
obeying flavor current-conservation, color neutrality as well as
energy-momentum conservation. Since the dynamical quarks and antiquarks become
very massive close to the phase transition, the formed resonant 'pre-hadronic'
color-dipole states ($q\bar{q}$ or $qqq$) are of high invariant mass, too, and
sequentially decay to the groundstate meson and baryon octets increasing the
total entropy. When applying the PHSD approach to Pb+Pb colllisions at 158
A$\cdot$GeV we find a significant effect of the partonic phase on the
production of multi-strange antibaryons due to a slightly enhanced $s{\bar s}$
pair production from massive time-like gluon decay and a larger formation of
antibaryons in the hadronization process.
