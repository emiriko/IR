An analytical model for the self-modulation instability of a long
relativistic proton bunch propagating in uniform plasmas is developed. The
self-modulated proton bunch resonantly excites a large amplitude plasma wave
(wake field), which can be used for acceleration of plasma electrons.
Analytical expressions for the linear growth rate and the number of
exponentiations are given. We use the full three-dimensional particle-in-cell
(PIC) simulations to study the beam self-modulation and the transition to the
nonlinear stage. It is shown that the self-modulation of the proton bunch
competes with the hosing instability which tends to destroy the plasma wave. A
method is proposed and studied through PIC simulations to circumvent this
problem which relies on the seeding of the self-modulation instability in the
bunch.
