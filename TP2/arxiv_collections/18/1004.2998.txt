In the \swift era, two-component jet models were introduced to explain the
complex temporal profiles and the diversity of early afterglows. In this paper,
we concentrate on the two-component jet model; first component is the
conventional afterglow and second is the emission due to the late internal
dissipation such as the late-prompt emission. We suggest herein that the
two-component jet model can be probed by the existence of two optical peaks for
orphan GRB afterglows. Each peak is caused by its respective jet as its
relativistic beaming cone widens to encompass the off-axis line of sight.
Typically, the first peak appears at $10^4-10^5$ s and the second at
$10^5-10^6$ s. Furthermore, we expect to observe a single, bright X-ray peak at
the same time as the first optical peak. Because orphan afterglows do not have
prompt emission, it is necessary to monitor the entire sky every $10^4$ s in
the X-ray regime. We can test the model with orphan afterglows through the
X-ray all-sky survey collaboration and by using ground-based optical
telescopes.
