We prove that there exists no algorithm to decide whether the language
generated by a context-free grammar is dense with respect to the lexicographic
ordering. As a corollary to this result, we show that it is undecidable whether
the lexicographic orderings of the languages generated by two context-free
grammars have the same order type.
