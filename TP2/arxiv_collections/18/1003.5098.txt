A measurement of the decay in time of nuclei excited by an intense short
laser pulse of energy E(0) yields the Fourier transform of the autocorrelation
function of the associated scattering matrix. We determine the optimal length
(in time) of the pulse and evaluate the time-decay function using random-matrix
theory. That function is shown to contain information not otherwise available.
We approximate that function in a manner that is useful for the analysis of
data. For E(0) below the threshold energy E(n) of the first neutron channel,
the time-decay function is exponential in time t while it is the product of an
exponential and a power in t for E(0) > E(n). The comparison of the measured
decay functions in both energy domains yields an unambiguous and novel test of
random-matrix theory in nuclei.
