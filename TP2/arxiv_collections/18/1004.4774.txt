We investigate the predictability of extreme events in a dissipative
Olami-Feder-Christensen model on a small world topology. Due to the mechanism
of self-organized criticality, it is impossible to predict the magnitude of the
next event knowing previous ones, if the system has an infinite size. However,
by exploiting the finite size effects, we show that probabilistic predictions
of the occurrence of extreme events in the next time step are possible in a
finite system. In particular, the finiteness of the system unavoidably leads to
repulsive temporal correlations of extreme events. The predictability of those
is higher for larger magnitudes and for larger complex network sizes. Finally,
we show that our prediction analysis is also robust by remarkably reducing the
accessible number of events used to construct the optimal predictor.
