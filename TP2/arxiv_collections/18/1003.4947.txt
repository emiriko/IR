The variations of gravity were measured with a high precision LaCoste-Romberg
D gravimeter during a total solar eclipse to investigate the effect of solar
eclipse on the gravitational field. The observed anomaly $(7.0 \pm 2.7) \times
10^{-8}$ m/s$^2$ during the eclipse implies that there may be a shielding
property of gravitation.
