We consider the situation of a two-level quantum system undergoing a
continuous indirect measurement, giving rise to so-called "quantum
trajectories". We first describe these quantum trajectories in a physically
realistic discrete-time setup and we then justify, by going to the
continuous-time limit, the "stochastic Schr\"odinger equation" attached to this
model. We prove return to equilibrium properties for these equations.
