One-dimensional and quasi-one-dimensional strongly-coupled dusty plasma rings
have been created experimentally. Longitudinal (acoustic) and transverse
(optical) dispersion relations for the 1-ring were measured and found to be in
very good agreement with the theory for an unbounded straight chain of
particles interacting through a Yukawa (i.e., screened Coulomb or
Debye-H\"uckel) potential. These rings provide a new system in which to study
one-dimensional and quasi-one-dimensional physics.
