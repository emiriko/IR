We consider a semiconductor in a non-equilibrium steady state, with a dc
current. On top of the stationary carrier motion there are fluctuations. It is
shown that the stationary motion of the carriers (i.e., their drift) can have a
profound effect on the electromagnetic field fluctuations in the bulk of the
sample as well as outside it, close to the surface (evanescent waves in the
near field). The effect is particularly pronounced near the plasma frequency.
This is because drift leads to a significant modification of the dispersion
relation for the bulk and surface plasmons.
