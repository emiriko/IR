Structural and electronic properties of the all-Si analogue of graphene,
silicene have elucidated through DFT calculations. Silicene differs
considerably from graphene in being `chair-type' puckered in each 6-membered
ring which leads to ordered ripples across the surface. Binding energies
suggest stability for such rippled silicenes and are predicted to behave as a
finite gap semi-conductor with electron-hole symmetry quenched. Inter-layer
coupling between the silicenes is suggested as the mechanism for the formation
of the bulk-Si in its only known diamond form.
