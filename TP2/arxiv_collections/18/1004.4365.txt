We present the results of a baryonic Tully-Fisher relation (BTFR) study for a
local sample of relatively isolated disk galaxies. We derive a BTFR with a
slope near 3 measured over about 4 dex in baryon mass for our combined
\textrm{H\,\scriptsize{I}} and bright spiral disk samples. This BTFR is
significantly flatter and has less scatter than the TFR (stellar mass only)
with its slope near 4 reported for other samples and studies. A BTFR slope near
3 is in better agreement with the expected slope from simple $\Lambda$CDM
cosmological simulations that include both stellar and gas baryons. The scatter
in the TFR/BTFR appears to depend on $W_{20}$: galaxies that rotate slower have
more scatter. The atomic gas--to--stars ratio shows a break near $W_{20} = 250$
\kms\, probably associated with a change in star formation efficiency. In
contrast the absence of such a break in the BTFR suggests that this relation
was probably set at the main epoch of baryon dissipation rather than as a
product of later galactic evolution.
