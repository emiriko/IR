Utilizing the hyperspace of noise-based logic, we show two string
verification methods with low communication complexity. One of them is based on
continuum noise-based logic. The other one utilizes noise-based logic with
random telegraph signals where a mathematical analysis of the error probability
is also given. The last operation can also be interpreted as computing
universal hash functions with noise-based logic and using them for string
comparison. To find out with 10^-25 error probability that two strings with
arbitrary length are different (this value is similar to the error probability
of an idealistic gate in today's computer) Alice and Bob need to compare only
83 bits of the noise-based hyperspace.
