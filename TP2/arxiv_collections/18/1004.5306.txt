A b-coloring is a coloring of the vertices of a graph such that each color
class contains a vertex that has a neighbor in all other color classes, and the
b-chromatic number of a graph $G$ is the largest integer $k$ such that $G$
admits a b-coloring with $k$ colors. A graph is b-perfect if the b-chromatic
number is equal to the chromatic number for every induced subgraph of $G$. We
prove that a graph is b-perfect if and only if it does not contain as an
induced subgraph a member of a certain list of twenty-two graphs. This entails
the existence of a polynomial-time recognition algorithm and of a
polynomial-time algorithm for coloring exactly the vertices of every b-perfect
graph.
