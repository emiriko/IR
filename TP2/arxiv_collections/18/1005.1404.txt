Motivated by the recent work of the hidden conformal symmetry of the Kerr
black hole, we investigate the hidden conformal symmetry of a Kerr-Sen black
hole and a Kerr-Newman-Kasuya black hole. Our result shows the conformal
symmetry is spontaneously broken due to the periodicity of the azimuthal angle.
The absorption across section is in consistence with the finite temperature
absorption cross section for a 2D CFT. The entropies of the black holes are
reproduced by the Cardy formula.
