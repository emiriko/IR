The superfluid to normal fluid transition of dipolar bosons in two dimensions
is studied throughout the whole density range using path integral Monte Carlo
simulations and summarized in the phase diagram. While at low densities, we
find good agreement with the universal results depending only on the scattering
length $a_s$, at moderate and high densities, the transition temperature is
strongly affected by interactions and the elementary excitation spectrum. The
results are expected to be of relevance to dipolar atomic and molecular systems
and indirect excitons in quantum wells.
