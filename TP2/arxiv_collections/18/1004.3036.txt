A two-dimensional arrangement of toothpicks is constructed by the following
iterative procedure. At stage 1, place a single toothpick of length 1 on a
square grid, aligned with the y-axis. At each subsequent stage, for every
exposed toothpick end, place an orthogonal toothpick centered at that end. The
resulting structure has a fractal-like appearance. We will analyze the
toothpick sequence, which gives the total number of toothpicks after n steps.
We also study several related sequences that arise from enumerating active
cells in cellular automata. Some unusual recurrences appear: a typical example
is that instead of the Fibonacci recurrence, which we may write as a(2+i) =
a(i) + a(i+1), we set n = 2^k+i (0 <= i < 2^k), and then
a(n)=a(2^k+i)=2a(i)+a(i+1). The corresponding generating functions look like
Prod{k >= 0} (1+x^{2^k-1}+2x^{2^k}) and variations thereof.
