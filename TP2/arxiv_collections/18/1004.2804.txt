We analyze new JLAB data for inclusive electron scattering on various
targets. Computed and measured total inclusive cross sections in the range
$0.3\lesssim x\lesssim 0.95$ show on a logarithmic scale reasonable agreement
for all targets. However, closer inspection of the Quasi-Elastic components
bares serious discrepancies. EMC ratios which may contain less systematic
errors fare the same. The above observations for the new data do not enable the
extraction of the magnetic form factor (FF) $G_M^n$ and the Structure Function
(SFs) $F_2^n$ of the neutron, although the application of exactly the same
analysis to older data had been successful. We add to the above analysis older
CLAS collaboration on $F_2^D$. Removing some scattered points, it appears
possible to obtain the above mentioned neutron information. We compare our
results with others from alternative sources. Particular attention is paid to
the A=3 iso-doublet. Present data exist only for $^3$He, but the available
input and charge symmetry also enable computations for $^3$H. Their average is
the computed iso-scalar part and is compared with the empirical modification of
$^3$He towards a fictitious A=3 iso-singlet.
