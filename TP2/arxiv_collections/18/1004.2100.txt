Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is generally assumed to be the fundamental
theory underlying nuclear physics. In recent years there is progress towards
investigating the nucleon structure from first principles of QCD. Although this
structure is best revealed in Deep Inelastic Scattering, a consistent analysis
has to be performed in a fully non-perturbative scheme. The only known method
for this purpose are lattice simulations. We first sketch the ideas of Monte
Carlo simulations in lattice gauge theory. Then we comment in particular on the
issues of chiral symmetry and operator mixing. Finally we present our results
for the Bjorken variable of a single quark, and for the second Nachtmann moment
of the nucleon structure functions.
