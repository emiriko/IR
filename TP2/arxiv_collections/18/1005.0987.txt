A brief survey of the author's works on the fundamental conceptual ideas of
quantum statistical physics developed by N. N. Bogoliubov and his school was
given. The development and applications of the method of quasiaverages to
quantum statistical physics and condensed matter physics were analyzed. The
relationship with the concepts of broken symmetry, quantum protectorate and
emergence was examined, and the progress to date towards unified understanding
of complex many-particle systems was summarized. Current trends for extending
and using these ideas in quantum field theory and condensed matter physics were
discussed, including microscopic theory of superfluidity and superconductivity,
quantum theory of magnetism of complex materials, Bose-Einstein condensation,
chirality of molecules, etc.
