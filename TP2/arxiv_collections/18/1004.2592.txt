Charge density wave (CDW) ordering in the prototypical low-dimensional
compound NbSe3 is reconsidered. We show that the widely accepted CDW model with
two incommensurate modulations, q1 = (0,0.241,0) and q2 = (0.5,0.260,0.5),
localized on type-III and type-I bi-capped trigonal prismatic (BCTP) columns,
does not explain some details, revealed by various microscopic methods. The
suggested alternative explanation is in a better accord with the entire
experimental evidence, including low-temperature (LT) scanning tunneling
microscopy (STM) results. It is based on the existence of modulated layered
nano-domains formed below both CDW onset temperatures. According to this model,
two of the three slightly different BCTP types of columns are modulated by the
same wave vector, either q1 or q2, which can easily switch over in a domain as
a whole. This approach explains the presence of the q2 modulation in the STM
images recorded above the T2 CDW transition and the absence of the q2
satellites in the corresponding diffraction patterns. The long periodic
modulation, detected by LT STM is attributed to a beating between the two CDWs,
centered on adjacent columns of the same type. These pairs of columns, both
either of type-III or type-I, modulated by the two alternative CDWs, represent
the basic modulation units, ordered into nano-domains.
