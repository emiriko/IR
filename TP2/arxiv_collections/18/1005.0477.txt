The basic theory on relativistic positioning systems in a two-dimensional
space-time has been presented in two previous papers [Phys. Rev. D {\bf 73},
084017 (2006); {\bf 74}, 104003 (2006)], where the possibility of making
relativistic gravimetry with these systems has been analyzed by considering
specific examples. Here we study generic relativistic positioning systems in
the Minkowski plane. We analyze the information that can be obtained from the
data received by a user of the positioning system. We show that the
accelerations of the emitters and of the user along their trajectories are
determined by the sole knowledge of the emitter positioning data and of the
acceleration of only one of the emitters. Moreover, as a consequence of the so
called master delay equation, the knowledge of this acceleration is only
required during an echo interval, i.e., the interval between the emission time
of a signal by an emitter and its reception time after being reflected by the
other emitter. We illustrate these results with the obtention of the dynamics
of the emitters and of the user from specific sets of data received by the
user.
