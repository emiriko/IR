Scalar fields with a "chameleon" property, in which the effective particle
mass is a function of its local environment, are common to many theories beyond
the standard model and could be responsible for dark energy. If these fields
couple weakly to the photon, they could be detectable through the "afterglow"
effect of photon-chameleon-photon transitions. The ADMX experiment was used in
the first chameleon search with a microwave cavity to set a new limit on scalar
chameleon-photon coupling excluding values between 2*10^9 and 5*10^14 for
effective chameleon masses between 1.9510 and 1.9525 micro-eV.
