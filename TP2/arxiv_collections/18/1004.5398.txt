It is shown that even a single $e^-e^+$ pair created by a super strong laser
field in vacuum would cause development of an avalanche-like QED cascade which
rapidly depletes the incoming laser pulse. This confirms the old N. Bohr
conjecture that the electric field of the critical QED strength
$E_S=m^2c^3/e\hbar$ could never be created.
