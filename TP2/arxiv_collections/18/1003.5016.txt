This work addresses unique characteristics of our Universe, namely fractal
structures that consist of coaxial-tubular and wheel-like building blocks. The
front view of the tubes may show a wheel, and in turn, the wheel may show
radial tubes arranged as spokes. A flexible interconnect originates from
magnetic fields. Neutrino astronomy indicates fractal structure in the core of
stars and galaxies. Fractals are fundamental for modeling baryonic filaments
important in "dark matter" with a topology that can be inferred from radiating
cosmic objects. The rupture of dark-matter filaments may cause formation of
cosmic objects including birth of the Universe.
