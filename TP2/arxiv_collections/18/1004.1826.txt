Using 5.4 fb-1 of integrated luminosity from ppbar collisions at sqrt(s)=1.96
TeV collected by the D0 detector at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider, we search
for decays of the lightest Kaluza-Klein mode of the graviton in the
Randall-Sundrum model to ee and gammagamma. We set 95% C.L. lower limits on the
mass of the lightest graviton between 560 GeV and 1050 GeV for values of the
coupling k/Mbar_pl between 0.01 and 0.1.
