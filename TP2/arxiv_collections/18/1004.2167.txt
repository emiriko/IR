We explore the emissions by accelerated electrons in shocked shells driven by
jets in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Focusing on powerful sources which host
luminous quasars, the synchrotron radiation and inverse Compton (IC) scattering
of various photons that are mainly produced in the core are considered as
radiation processes. We show that the radiative output is dominated by the IC
emission for compact sources (< 30kpc), whereas the synchrotron radiation is
more important for larger sources. It is predicted that, for powerful sources
($L_j \sim 10^{47} ergs s^{-1}$), GeV-TeV gamma-rays produced via the IC
emissions can be detected by the Fermi satellite and modern Cherenkov
telescopes such as MAGIC, HESS and VERITAS if the source is compact.
