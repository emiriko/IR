We study a new set of identity-based solutions to analyze the problem of
tachyon condensation in open bosonic string field theory and cubic superstring
field theory. Even though these identity-based solutions seem to be trivial, it
turns out that after performing a suitable gauge transformation, we are left
with the known Erler-Schnabl-type solutions which correctly reproduce the value
of the D-brane tension. This result shows explicitly that how a seemingly
trivial solution can generate a non-trivial configuration which precisely
represents to the tachyon vacuum.
