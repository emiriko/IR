We explore the LHC phenomenology of the dark matter candidate arising from
the extension of warped Higgsless models. In particular, we consider a model of
warped supersymmetry in the bulk and on the IR brane in which the lightest
Neutralino is rendered stable by an R parity and serves as a realistic cold
dark matter candidate. The production of the LSP and NLSP in association with
third generation quarks is simulated using an implementation in O'Mega/Whizard.
