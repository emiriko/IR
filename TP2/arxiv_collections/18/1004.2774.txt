In this paper, we combine the the latest observational data, including the
WMAP five-year data (WMAP5), the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) and type Ia
supernovae (SN) "union" compilation, and use the Markov Chain Monte Carlo
method to determine the dark energy parameters. We pay particular attention to
the Integrated Sache-Wolfe (ISW) data from the cross-correlations of cosmic
microwave background (CMB) and large scale structure (LSS). In the \Lambda CDM
model, we find that the ISW data, as a complement to the WMAP data, could
significantly improve the constraint of curvature \Omega_k. We also check the
improvement of constraints from the new prior on the Hubble constant and find
this new prior could improve the constraint of \Omega_k by a factor of 2.
Finally, we study the dynamical evolving EoS of dark energy from the current
observational data. Based on the dynamical dark energy model, parameterizing as
w(a)=w_0+w_a(1-a), we find that the \Lambda CDM model remains a good fit to the
current data. When taking into account the ISW data, the error bars of w_0 and
w_a could be shrunk slightly. Current constraints on the dynamical dark energy
model are not conclusive. The future precision measurements are needed.
