We report an eclipse mapping study of the intermediate polar DQ Her based on
time-resolved optical spectroscopy (~3800-5000A) covering 4 eclipses. Eclipse
maps of the HeII 4686 line indicate that an azimuthally-and vertically-extended
bright spot at disk rim is important source of reprocessing of x-rays from the
magnetic poles. The disk spectrum is flat with no Balmer or Helium lines in the
inner regions, and shows double-peaked emission lines in the intermediate and
outer disk regions while the slope of the continuum becomes progressively
redder with increasing radius. The inferred disk temperatures are in the range
T~13500-5000K and can be reasonably well described by a steady-state disk with
mass accretion rate of dM/dt=(2.7+/-1.0)x10^-9 Msun/yr. A comparison of the
radial intensity distribution for the Balmer lines reveals a linear correlation
between the slope of the distribution and the transition energy. The spectrum
of the uneclipsed light is dominated by Balmer and HeI lines in emission with
narrow absorption cores. The observed narrow and redshifted CaII 3934
absorption line in the total light spectra plus the inverse P-Cygni profiles of
the Balmer and HeII 4686 emission lines in spectra of the asymmetric component
indicate radial inflow of gas in the innermost disk regions and are best
explained in terms of magnetically-controlled accretion inside the white dwarf
magnetosphere. We infer projected radial inflow velocities of ~200-500km/s,
significantly lower than both the rotational and the free-fall velocities for
the corresponding range of radii. A combined net emission HeII plus Hbeta
low-velocity eclipse map reveals a twisted dipole emitting pattern near disk
center. This is interpreted as being the projection of accretion curtains onto
the orbital plane at two specific spin phases, as a consequence of the
selection in velocity provided by the spectral eclipse mapping.
