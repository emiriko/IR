The criticism contained in the recent preprint arxiv:1004.5258 is based
essentially on misquoting the articles criticized therein. As to the conclusion
advocated in that preprint, according to which the density of dark matter bound
to the Solar System is small as compared to the dark-matter density in the
Galactic halo, it is not clear whether this claim is correct.
