This paper proposes an incremental method that can be used by an intelligent
system to learn better descriptions of a thematic context. The method starts
with a small number of terms selected from a simple description of the topic
under analysis and uses this description as the initial search context. Using
these terms, a set of queries are built and submitted to a search engine. New
documents and terms are used to refine the learned vocabulary. Evaluations
performed on a large number of topics indicate that the learned vocabulary is
much more effective than the original one at the time of constructing queries
to retrieve relevant material.
