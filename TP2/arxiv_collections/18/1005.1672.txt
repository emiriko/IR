We investigate the possibility of realizing quantum anomalous Hall effect in
graphene. We show that a bulk energy gap can be opened in the presence of both
Rashba spin-orbit coupling and an exchange field. We calculate the Berry
curvature distribution and find a non-zero Chern number for the valence bands
and demonstrate the existence of gapless edge states. Inspired by this finding,
we also study, by first principles method, a concrete example of graphene with
Fe atoms adsorbed on top, obtaining the same result.
