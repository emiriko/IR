We consider a strongly interacting one-dimensional (1D) Bose-Fermi mixture
confined in a hard wall trap or a harmonic oscillator trap with a tunable
$\delta$-function barrier at the trap center. The mixture consists of 1D Bose
gas with repulsive interactions and of 1D noninteracting spin-aligned Fermi
gas, both species interacting through hard-core interactions. Using a
generalized Bose-Fermi mapping, we calculated the reduced single-particle
density matrix and the momentum distribution of the gas as a function of
barrier strength and the parity of particle number. The secondary peaks in the
momentum distribution show remarkable correlation between particles on the two
sides of the split.
