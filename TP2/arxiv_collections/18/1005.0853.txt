Ni(OH)2 nanocrystals grown on graphene sheets with various degrees of
oxidation are investigated as electrochemical pseudocapacitor materials for
potential energy storage applications. Single-crystalline Ni(OH)2 hexagonal
nanoplates directly grown on lightly-oxidized, electrically-conducting graphene
sheets (GS) exhibit a high specific capacitance of ~1335F/g at a charge and
discharge current density of 2.8A/g and ~953F/g at 45.7A/g with excellent
cycling ability. The high specific capacitance and remarkable rate capability
are promising for applications in supercapacitors with both high energy and
power densities. Simple physical mixture of pre-synthesized Ni(OH)2 nanoplates
and graphene sheets show lower specific capacitance, highlighting the
importance of direct growth of nanomaterials on graphene to impart intimate
interactions and efficient charge transport between the active nanomaterials
and the conducting graphene network. Single-crystalline Ni(OH)2 nanoplates
directly grown on graphene sheets also significantly outperform small Ni(OH)2
nanoparticles grown on heavily-oxidized, electrically-insulating graphite oxide
(GO), suggesting that the electrochemical performance of these composites are
dependent on the quality of graphene substrates and the morphology and
crystallinity of the nanomaterials grown on top. These results suggest the
importance of rational design and synthesis of graphene-based nanocomposite
materials for high-performance energy applications.
