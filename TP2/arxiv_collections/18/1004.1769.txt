Cross Site Scripting (XSS) Flaws are currently the most popular security
problems in modern web applications. These Flaws make use of vulnerabilities in
the code of web-applications, resulting in serious consequences, such as theft
of cookies, passwords and other personal credentials. Cross-Site scripting
Flaws occur when accessing information in intermediate trusted sites. Client
side solution acts as a web proxy to mitigate Cross Site Scripting Flaws which
manually generated rules to mitigate Cross Site Scripting attempts. Client side
solution effectively protects against information leakage from the user's
environment. Cross Site Scripting Flaws are easy to execute, but difficult to
detect and prevent. This paper provides client-side solution to mitigate
cross-site scripting Flaws. The existing client-side solutions degrade the
performance of client's system resulting in a poor web surfing experience. In
this project provides a client side solution that uses a step by step approach
to protect cross site scripting, without degrading much the user's web browsing
experience.
