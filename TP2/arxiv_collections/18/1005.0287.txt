We show the equivalence between Deitmar's and Toen-Vaquie's notions of
schemes over F_1 (the 'field with one element'), establishing a symmetry with
the classical case of schemes, seen either as spaces with a structure sheaf, or
functors of points. In proving so, we also conclude some new basic results on
commutative algebra of monoids.
