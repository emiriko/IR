We investigate the phase diagram of a two-component repulsive Fermi gas at
T=0 by means of quantum Monte Carlo simulations. For a given value of the
positive s-wave scattering length, both purely repulsive and purely attractive
model potentials are considered in order to analyze the limits of the universal
regime where the details of interatomic forces can be neglected. The equation
of state of both balanced and unbalanced systems is calculated as a function of
the interaction strength and the critical density for the onset of
ferromagnetism is determined. The energy per particle of the strongly polarized
gas is calculated and parametrized in terms of the physical properties of
repulsive polarons, which are relevant for the stability of the fully
magnetized ferromagnetic state. Finally, we analyze the phase diagram in the
polarization/interaction plane under the assumption that only phases with
homogeneous magnetization can be produced.
