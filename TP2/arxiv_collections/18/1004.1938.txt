Motivated by the set-antiset method for codes over permutations under the
infinity norm, we study anticodes under this metric. For half of the parameter
range we classify all the optimal anticodes, which is equivalent to finding the
maximum permanent of certain $(0,1)$-matrices. For the rest of the cases we
show constraints on the structure of optimal anticodes.
