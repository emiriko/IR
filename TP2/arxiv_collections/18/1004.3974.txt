Symmetry arguments are used to show that a boundary of a magnetoelectric
antiferromagnet has an equilibrium magnetization. This magnetization is coupled
to the bulk antiferromagnetic order parameter and can be switched along with it
by a combination of E and B fields. As a result, the antiferromagnetic domain
state of a magnetoelectric can be used as a non-volatile switchable state
variable in nanoelectronic device applications. Mechanisms affecting the
boundary magnetization and its temperature dependence are classified. The
boundary magnetization can be especially large if the boundary breaks the
equivalence of the antiferromagnetic sublattices.
