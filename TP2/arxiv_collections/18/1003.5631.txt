Wireless data communications in form of Short Message Service (SMS) and
Wireless Access Protocols (WAP) browsers have gained global popularity, yet,
not much has been done to extend the usage of these devices in electronic
learning (e-learning) and information sharing. This project explores the
extension of e learning into wireless/ handheld (W/H) computing devices with
the help of a mobile learning (m-learning) framework. This framework provides
the requirements to develop m-learning application that can be used to share
academic and administrative information among people within the university
campus. A prototype application has been developed to demonstrate the important
functionality of the proposed system in simulated environment. This system is
supposed to work both in bulk SMS and interactive SMS delivery mode. Here we
have combined both Short Message Service (SMS) and Wireless Access Protocols
(WAP) browsers. SMS is used for Short and in time information delivery and WAP
is used for detailed information delivery like course content, training
material, interactive evolution tests etc. The push model is used for sending
personalized multicasting messages to a group of mobile users with a common
profile thereby improving the effectiveness and usefulness of the cntent
delivered. Again pull mechanism can be applied for sending information as SMS
when requested by end user in interactive SMS delivery mode. The main strength
of the system is that, the actual SMS delivery application can be hosted on a
mobile device, which can operate even when the device is on move.
