The direct interaction of the 4-rotational (Lorentzian) gauge field with the
angular orbital momentum of an external field is considered. This interaction
appears in a new Poincar\'{e} gauge theory of gravitation, in which tetrads are
not true gauge fields, but represent some functions of the translational and
4-rotational gauge fields. The given interaction leads to a new effect: the
existence of an electronic orbits precession under the action of an intensive
external gravitational field (gravidiamagnetic effect), and also substantiates
the existence of the direct interaction of the proper angular momentum of a
gyroscope with the torsion field, which theoretically can be generated by the
rotational angular momentum of the planet the Earth. The latter interaction can
be detected by the experiment Gravity Probe B on the satellite orbit.
