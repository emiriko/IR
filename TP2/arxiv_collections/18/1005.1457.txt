The problem of tsunami wave shoaling and runup in U-shaped bays (such as
fjords) and underwater canyons is studied in the framework of shallow water
theory. The wave shoaling in bays, when the depth varies smoothly along the
channel axis, is studied with the use of asymptotic approach. In this case a
weak reflection provides significant shoaling effects. The existence of
traveling (progressive) waves, propagating in bays, when the water depth
changes significantly along the channel axis, is studied. It is shown that
traveling waves do exist for certain bay bathymetry configurations and may
propagate over large distances without reflection. The tsunami runup in such
bays is significantly larger than for a plane beach.
