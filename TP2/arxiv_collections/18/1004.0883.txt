We study the interplay between traveling action potentials and spatial
inhomogeneities in the FitzHugh-Nagumo model to investigate possible mechanisms
for the occurrence of fibrillatory states in the atria of the heart. Different
dynamical patterns such as ectopic foci, localized and meandering spiral waves
are found depending on the characteristics of the inhomogeneities. Their
appearance in dependence of the size and strength of the inhomogeneities is
quantified by phase diagrams. Furthermore it is shown that regularly paced
waves in a region R, that is connected by a small bridge connection to another
region L with perturbing waves emanating from an additional pacemaker, can be
strongly disturbed, so that a fibrillatory state emerges in region R after a
transient time interval. This finding supports conjectures that fibrillatory
states in the right atrium can be induced by self-excitatory pacemakers in the
left atrium.
