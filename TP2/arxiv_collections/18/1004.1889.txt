New data on the production of charged kaons in p+p interactions are
presented. The data come from a sample of 4.8 million inelastic events obtained
with the NA49 detector at the CERN SPS at 158 GeV/c beam momentum. The kaons
are identified by energy loss in a large TPC tracking system. Inclusive
invariant cross sections are obtained in intervals from 0 to 1.7 GeV/c in
transverse momentum and from 0 to 0.5 in Feynman x. Using these data as a
reference, a new evaluation of the energy dependence of kaon production,
including neutral kaons, is conducted over a range from 3 GeV to p+anti-p
collider energies.
