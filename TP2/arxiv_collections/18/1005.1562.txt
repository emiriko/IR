We propose a scheme to transfer the quantum state of light fields to the
collective density excitations of a Bose Einstein condensate (BEC) in a cavity.
This scheme allows to entangle two BECs in a double cavity setup by
transferring the quantum entanglement of two light fields produced from a
nondegenerate parametric amplifier (NOPA) to the collective density excitations
of the two BECs. An EPR state of the collective density excitations can be
created by a judicious choice of the system parameters.
