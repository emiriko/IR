Our goal is to understand primary accretion of the first planetesimals. The
primitive meteorite record suggests that sizeable planetesimals formed in the
asteroid belt over a period longer than a million years, each composed entirely
of an unusual, but homogeneous, mixture of mm-size particles. We sketch a
scenario in which primary accretion of 10-100km size planetesimals proceeds
directly, if sporadically, from aerodynamically-sorted mm-size particles
(generically "chondrules"). These planetesimal sizes are in general agreement
with the currently observed asteroid mass peak near 100km diameter, which has
been identified as a "fossil" property of the pre-erosion, pre-depletion
population. We extend our primary accretion theory to make predictions for
outer solar system planetesimals, which may also have a preferred size in the
100km diameter range. We estimate formation rates of planetesimals and assess
the conditions needed to match estimates of both asteroid and Kuiper Belt
Object (KBO) formation rates. For nebula parameters that satisfy observed mass
accretion rates of Myr-old protoplanetary nebulae, the scenario is roughly
consistent with not only the "fossil" sizes of the asteroids, and their
estimated production rates, but also with the observed spread in formation ages
of chondrules in a given chondrite, and with a tolerably small radial diffusive
mixing during this time between formation and accretion (the model naturally
helps explain the peculiar size distribution of chondrules within such
objects). The scenario also produces 10-100km diameter primary KBOs. The
optimum range of parameters, however, represents a higher gas density and
fractional abundance of solids, and a smaller difference between keplerian and
pressure-supported orbital velocities, than "canonical" models of the solar
nebula. We discuss several potential explanations for these differences.
