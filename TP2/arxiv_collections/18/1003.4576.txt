We present analytical estimates and numerical calculations showing that the
energy level density in open-shell atoms increases exponentially with increase
of excitation energy. As an example, we use the relativistic Hartree-Fock and
configuration interaction methods to calculate the density of states of Th and
Th II. The result is used to estimate the effect of electrons on the nuclear
transition which is considered for the use in a nuclear clock.
