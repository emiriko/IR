We study theoretically the surface of time-reversal-symmetric,
noncentrosymmetric superconductor with mixed singlet and triplet order
parameters. A pair of counterpropagating subgap quasiparticle surface bound
states with opposite spin projections are obtained in the nontrivial Z$_2$ case
where the triplet component is larger than the singlet one, contributing to a
spin current. In contrast to the pure p-wave cases, these subgap states do not
have a fixed spin projections but depend on the momenta along the surface. In
the trivial Z$_2$ case where the singlet order parameter is larger, no subgap
surface bound states show up. In both cases, there is also a finite
contribution to the spin current from the continuum states with energies
between the two gaps. The method for obtaining the quasiclassical Green's
functions associated with the noncentrosymmetric superconductors is also
presented.
