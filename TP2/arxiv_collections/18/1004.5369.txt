Single-site and cluster dynamical mean-field methods are used to estimate the
response of a doped Mott insulator to a charged impurity. The effect of
correlations on the Thomas-Fermi screening properties is determined. The charge
density, the on-site and near-neighbor spin-spin correlations in the vicinity
of the impurity are compared to those far from it. The theory is used to
address the question of the effect of the density perturbation induced by the
muon charge on the local response functions of a high-temperature
superconductor. For reasonable values of the background dielectric constant and
basic correlation strength, a muon is shown to lead to an observable
perturbation of the local spin dynamics, raising questions about the
interpretation of muon-spin-rotation experiments in metallic high-temperature
superconductors.
