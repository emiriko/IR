Given a smooth proper dg-algebra $A$, a perfect dg $A$-module $M$, and an
endomorphism $f$ of $M$, we define the Hochschild class of the pair $(M,f)$
with values in the Hochschild homology of $A$. Our main result is a
Riemann-Roch type formula involving the convolution of two such Hochschild
classes.
