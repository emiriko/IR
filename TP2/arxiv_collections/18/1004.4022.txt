The importance of security in database research has greatly increased over
the years as most of critical functionality of the business and military
enterprises became digitized. Database is an integral part of any information
system and they often hold sensitive data. The security of the data depends on
physical security, OS security and DBMS security. Database security can be
compromised by obtaining sensitive data, changing data or degrading
availability of the database. Over the last 30 years the information technology
environment have gone through many changes of evolution and the database
research community have tried to stay a step ahead of the upcoming threats to
the database security. The database research community has thoughts about these
issues long before they were address by the implementations. This paper will
examine the different topics pertaining to database security and see the
adaption of the research to the changing environment. Some short term database
research trends will be ascertained at the conclusion.
