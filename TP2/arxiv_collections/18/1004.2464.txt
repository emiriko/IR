Eclipses of the single-line spectroscopic binary star, epsilon Aurigae,
provide an opportunity to study the poorly-defined companion. We used the MIRC
beam combiner on the CHARA array to create interferometric images during
eclipse ingress. Our results demonstrate that the eclipsing body is a dark disk
that is opaque and tilted, and therefore exclude alternative models for the
system. These data constrain the geometry and masses of the components,
providing evidence that the F-star is not a massive supergiant star.
