We present an efficient solution to the following problem, of relevance in a
numerical optimization scheme: calculation of integrals of the type \[\iint_{T
\cap \{f\ge0\}} \phi_1\phi_2 \, dx\,dy\] for quadratic polynomials
$f,\phi_1,\phi_2$ on a plane triangle $T$. The naive approach would involve
consideration of the many possible shapes of $T\cap\{f\geq0\}$ (possibly after
a convenient transformation) and parameterizing its border, in order to
integrate the variables separately. Our solution involves partitioning the
triangle into smaller triangles on which integration is much simpler.
