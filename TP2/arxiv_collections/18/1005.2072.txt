We review a case study of a UI design project for a complete travel search
engine system prototype for regular and corporate users. We discuss various
usage scenarios, guidelines, and so for, and put them into a web-based
prototype with screenshots and the like. We combined into our prototype the
best features found at the time (2002) on most travel-like sites and added more
to them as a part of our research. We conducted feasibility studies, review
common design guidelines and Nelson's heuristics while constructing this work.
The prototype is itself open-source, but has no backend functionality, as the
focus is the user-centered design of such a system. While the prototype is
mostly static, some dynamic activity is present through the use of PHP.
