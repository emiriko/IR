Finding the product of two polynomials is an essential and basic problem in
computer algebra. While most previous results have focused on the worst-case
complexity, we instead employ the technique of adaptive analysis to give an
improvement in many "easy" cases. We present two adaptive measures and methods
for polynomial multiplication, and also show how to effectively combine them to
gain both advantages. One useful feature of these algorithms is that they
essentially provide a gradient between existing "sparse" and "dense" methods.
We prove that these approaches provide significant improvements in many cases
but in the worst case are still comparable to the fastest existing algorithms.
