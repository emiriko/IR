We construct a strong extractor against quantum storage that works for every
min-entropy $k$, has logarithmic seed length, and outputs $\Omega(k)$ bits,
provided that the quantum adversary has at most $\beta k$ qubits of memory, for
any $\beta < \half$. The construction works by first condensing the source
(with minimal entropy-loss) and then applying an extractor that works well
against quantum adversaries when the source is close to uniform.
  We also obtain an improved construction of a strong quantum-proof extractor
in the high min-entropy regime. Specifically, we construct an extractor that
uses a logarithmic seed length and extracts $\Omega(n)$ bits from any source
over $\B^n$, provided that the min-entropy of the source conditioned on the
quantum adversary's state is at least $(1-\beta) n$, for any $\beta < \half$.
