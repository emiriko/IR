The charged fermion mass matrices are always invariant under $U(1)^3$
symmetry linked to the fermion number transformation. A class of two Higgs
doublet models (2HDM) can be identified by requiring that the definition of
this symmetry in an arbitrary weak basis be independent of Higgs parameters
such as the ratio of the Higgs vacuum expectation values. The tree level
flavour changing neutral currents normally present in 2HDM are absent in this
class of models but unlike the type I or type II Higgs doublet models, the
charged Higgs couplings in these models contain additional flavour dependent CP
violating phases. These phases can account for the recent hints of the beyond
standard model CP violation in the $B_d$ and $B_s$ mixing. In particular, there
is a range of parameters in which new phases do not contribute to the $K$ meson
CP violation but give identical new physics contribution to the $B_d$ and $B_s$
meson mixing. Specific model realizations of the above scenario are briefly
discussed.
