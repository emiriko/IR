Importance sampling is a common technique for Monte Carlo approximation,
including Monte Carlo approximation of p-values. Here it is shown that a simple
correction of the usual importance sampling p-values creates valid p-values,
meaning that a hypothesis test created by rejecting the null when the p-value
is <= alpha will also have a type I error rate <= alpha. This correction uses
the importance weight of the original observation, which gives valuable
diagnostic information under the null hypothesis. Using the corrected p-values
can be crucial for multiple testing and also in problems where evaluating the
accuracy of importance sampling approximations is difficult. Inverting the
corrected p-values provides a useful way to create Monte Carlo confidence
intervals that maintain the nominal significance level and use only a single
Monte Carlo sample. Several applications are described, including accelerated
multiple testing for a large neurophysiological dataset and exact conditional
inference for a logistic regression model with nuisance parameters.
