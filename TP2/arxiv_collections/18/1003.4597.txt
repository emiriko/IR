The interface behaviour between steel and concrete, during pull-out tests, is
numerically investigated using an interface model coupling adhesion and Coulomb
friction. This model, first developed by Raous, Cang\'emi, Cocou and Monerie
(RCCM), is based on the adhesion intensity variable, introduced by Fr\'emond,
which is a surface damage variable. The RCCM model is here completed by taking
a variable friction coefficient to simulate the slip weakening of the interface
when sliding occurs. Identification of the parameters and validation of the
model are carried on pull out experiments conducted at the INSA of Toulouse on
steel-concrete interface of reinforced concrete.
