The quantum master equation obtained from two different thermodynamic
arguments is seriously nonlinear. We argue that, for quantum systems,
nonlinearity occurs naturally in the step from reversible to irreversible
equations and we analyze the nature and consequences of the nonlinear
contribution. The thermodynamic nonlinearity naturally leads to canonical
equilibrium solutions and extends the range of validity to lower temperatures.
We discuss the Markovian character of the thermodynamic quantum master equation
and introduce a solution strategy based on coupled evolution equations for the
eigenstates and eigenvalues of the density matrix. The general ideas are
illustrated for the two-level system and for the damped harmonic oscillator.
Several conceptual implications of the nonlinearity of the thermodynamic
quantum master equation are pointed out, including the absence of a Heisenberg
picture and the resulting difficulties with defining multi-time correlations.
