The time delays between gamma-rays of different energies from extragalactic
sources have often been used to probe quantum gravity models in which Lorentz
symmetry is violated. It has been claimed that these time delays can be
explained by or at least put the strongest available constraints on quantum
gravity scenarios that cannot be cast within an effective field theory
framework, such as the space-time foam, D-brane model. Here we show that this
model would predict too many photons in the ultra-high energy cosmic ray flux
to be consistent with observations. The resulting constraints on the space-time
foam model are much stronger than limits from time delays and allow for Lorentz
violations effects way too small for explaining the observed time delays.
