The spectral theorem is proven for the quantum dynamics of quadratic open
systems of n fermions described by the Lindblad equation. Invariant eigenspaces
of the many-body Liouvillean dynamics and their largest Jordan blocks are
explicitly constructed for all eigenvalues. For eigenvalue zero we describe an
algebraic procedure for constructing (possibly higher dimensional) spaces of
(degenerate) non-equilibrium steady states.
