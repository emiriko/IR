We study the genuine part of the Arthur-Selberg trace formula for some
nonlinear covers of connected reductive groups. As a first step towards the
invariant trace formula, we express the geometric side in terms of weighted
orbital integrals. In particular, our results apply to the covers constructed
by Brylinksi and Deligne.
