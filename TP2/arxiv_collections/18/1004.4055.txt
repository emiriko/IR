We consider invariance of the action of N=1 supersymmetric theories under the
change of sign of the fermionic co-ordinate in superspace. We show that the
R-parity can be realized as a special implementation of this symmetry. Other
implementations in the supersymmetric extension of the standard model can be
related to lepton number and baryon number parities.
