In this paper we describe a procedure of calculating the number cubes that
have coordinates in the set {0,1,...,n}. We adapt the code that appeared in
[11] developed to calculate the number of regular tetrahedra with coordinates
in the set {0,1,...,n}. The idea is based on the theoretical results obtained
in [13]. We extend then the sequence A098928 in the Online Encyclopedia of
Integer Sequences to the first one hundred terms.
