We examine recombination processes of photocarriers in one-dimensional Mott
insulators coupled to phonons. Performing density matrix renormalization group
calculations, we find that, even for small electron-phonon coupling, many
phonons are generated dynamically, which cause initial relaxation process after
the irradiation. At the same time, spin-charge coupling coming from mixing of
high- and low-energy states by the irradiation is suppressed. We discuss
differences between Mott and band insulators in terms of relaxation dynamics.
