We introduce a variant of linear logic with second order quantifiers and type
fixpoints, both restricted to purely linear formulas. The Church encodings of
binary words are typed by a standard non-linear type `Church,' while the Scott
encodings (purely linear representations of words) are by a linear type
`Scott.' We give a characterization of polynomial time functions, which is
derived from (Leivant and Marion 93): a function is computable in polynomial
time if and only if it can be represented by a term of type Church => Scott.
  To prove soundness, we employ a resource sensitive realizability technique
developed by Hofmann and Dal Lago.
