This paper studies the fastest distributed consensus averaging problem on
branches of an arbitrary connected sensor network. In the previous works full
knowledge about the sensor network's connectivity topology was required for
determining the optimal weights and convergence rate of distributed consensus
averaging algorithm over the network. Here in this work for the first time, the
optimal weights are determined analytically for the edges of certain types of
branches, independent of the rest of network. The solution procedure consists
of stratification of associated connectivity graph of the branches and
Semidefinite Programming (SDP), particularly solving the slackness conditions,
where the optimal weights are obtained by inductive comparing of the
characteristic polynomials initiated by slackness conditions. Several examples
and numerical results are provided to confirm the optimality of the obtained
weights.
