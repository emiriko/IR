We show that to accommodate inflation in the entropic force scenario of
Verlinde, it is necessary to introduce a negative temperature on a holographic
screen, this will introduce several puzzles such as energy non-conservation. If
one tries to modify the derivation of the Einstein equations to avoid a
negative temperature, we prove that it is impossible to find a proper new
definition of temperature to derive the Einstein equations.
