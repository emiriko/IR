FBS0107-082 is an emission line object previously classified as a nova-like
cataclysmic variable star. New optical spectroscopy shows very strong hydrogen
Balmer lines, along with a nebular forbidden line spectrum and absorption
features from an early-F photosphere. When combined with other IR and optical
data from the literature, these data point to the object being a symbiotic nova
seen in a prolonged outburst. Photometry on time scales of minutes, days, and
years show only very weak variability.
