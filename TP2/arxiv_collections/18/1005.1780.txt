We give the necessary and sufficient (local) conditions for a metric tensor
to be a non conformally flat spherically symmetric solution. These conditions
exclusively involve explicit concomitants of the Riemann tensor. As a direct
application we obtain the {\em ideal} labeling of the Schwarzschild,
Reissner-Nordstr\"om and Lema\^itre-Tolman-Bondi solutions.
