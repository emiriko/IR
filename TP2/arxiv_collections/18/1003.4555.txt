I consider the "Quantum Bayesian" view of quantum theory as expounded in a
2006 paper of Caves, Fuchs, and Schack. I argue that one can accept a generally
personalist, decision-theoretic view of probability, including probability as
manifested in quantum physics, while nevertheless accepting that in some
situations, including some in quantum physics, probabilities may in a useful
sense be thought of as objectively correct. This includes situations in which
the ascription of a quantum state should be thought of as objectively correct.
I argue that this does not cause any prima facie objectionable sort of action
at a distance, though it may involve adopting the attitude that certain
dispositional properties of things are not "localized" at those things. Whether
this insouciant view of nonlocality and objectivity can survive more detailed
analysis is a matter for further investigation.
