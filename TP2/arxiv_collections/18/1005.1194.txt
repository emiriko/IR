Negative databases - negative representations of a set of data - have been
introduced in 2004 to protect the data they contain. Today, no solution is
known to constitute biometric negative databases. This is surprising as
biometric applications are very demanding of such protection for privacy
reasons. The main difficulty comes from the fact that biometric captures of the
same trait give different results and comparisons of the stored reference with
the fresh captured biometric data has to take into account this variability. In
this paper, we give a first answer to this problem by exhibiting a way to
create and exploit biometric negative databases.
