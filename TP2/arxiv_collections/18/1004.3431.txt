The information content of a spinning sound field is analyzed using a
combination of exact and asymptotic results, in order to set limits on how
accurately source identification can be carried out. Using a transformation of
the circular source to an exactly equivalent set of line source modes, given by
Chebyshev polynomials, it is found that the line source modes of order greater
than the source wavenumber generate exponentially small fields. Asymptotic
analysis shows that the remaining, lower order, modes radiate efficiently only
into a region around the source plane, with this region shrinking as the mode
order is increased. The results explain the ill-conditioning of source
identification methods; the successful use of low order models in active noise
control; and the low radiation efficiency of subsonic jets.
