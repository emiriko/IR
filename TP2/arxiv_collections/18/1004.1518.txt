We consider various hadron models with a string carrying $n=3$ massive points
(quarks): Y configuration, linear baryon model $q$-$q$-$q$ and the closed
string. For these models classical rotational states (planar uniform rotations)
are tested for stability with respect to small disturbances. It is shown that
rotations of all mentioned models are unstable, but nature of this instability
is different. For the model Y the instability results from existence of
multiple real frequencies in the spectrum of small disturbances, but for the
linear model and the closed string the similar spectra contain complex
frequencies, corresponding to exponentially growing modes of disturbances. This
classical rotational instability is important for describing excited hadrons,
in particular, for the linear model and the closed string it results in
additional contribution in width of hadron states.
