Using the uniform most powerful unbiased test, we observed the sales
distribution of consumer electronics in Japan on a daily basis and report that
it follows both a lognormal distribution and a power-law distribution and
depends on the state of the market. We show that these switches occur quite
often. The underlying sales dynamics found between both periods nicely matched
a multiplicative process. However, even though the multiplicative term in the
process displays a size-dependent relationship when a steady lognormal
distribution holds, it shows a size-independent relationship when the power-law
distribution holds. This difference in the underlying dynamics is responsible
for the difference in the two observed distributions.
