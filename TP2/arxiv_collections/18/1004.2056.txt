We discuss a model of Poynting-dominated gamma-ray bursts from the collapse
of very massive first generation (pop. III) stars. From redshifts of order 20,
the resulting relativistic jets would radiate in the hard X-ray range around 50
keV and above, followed after roughly a day by an external shock component
peaking around a few keV. On the same timescales an inverse Compton component
around 75 GeV may be expected, as well as a possible infra-red flash. The
fluences of these components would be above the threshold for detectors such as
Swift and Fermi, providing potentially valuable information on the formation
and properties of what may be the first luminous objects and their black holes
in the high redshift Universe.
