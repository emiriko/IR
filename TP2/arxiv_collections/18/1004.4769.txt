Mathematical physics problems are often formulated using differential
oprators of vector analysis - invariant operators of first order, namely,
divergence, gradient and rotor operators. In approximate solution of such
problems it is natural to employ similar operator formulations for grid
problems, too. The VAGO (Vector Analysis Grid Operators) method is based on
such a methodology. In this paper the vector analysis difference operators are
constructed using the Delaunay triangulation and the Voronoi diagrams. Further
the VAGO method is used to solve approximately boundary value problems for the
general elliptic equation of second order. In the convection-diffusion-reaction
equation the diffusion coefficient is a symmetric tensor of second order.
