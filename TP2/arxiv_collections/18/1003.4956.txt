The Landau-Zener model of a quantum mechanical two-level system driven with a
linearly time dependent detuning has served over decades as a textbook paradigm
of quantum dynamics. In their seminal work [L. D. Landau, Physik. Z. Sowjet. 2,
46 (1932); C. Zener, Proc. Royal Soc. London 137, 696 (1932)], Landau and Zener
derived a non-perturbative prediction for the transition probability between
two states, which often serves as a reference point for the analysis of more
complex systems. A particularly intriguing question is whether that framework
can be extended to describe many-body quantum dynamics. Here we report an
experimental and theoretical study of a system of ultracold atoms, offering a
direct many-body generalization of the Landau-Zener problem. In a system of
pairwise tunnel-coupled 1D Bose liquids we show how tuning the correlations of
the 1D gases, the tunnel coupling between the tubes and the inter-tube
interactions strongly modify the original Landau-Zener picture. The results are
explained using a mean-field description of the inter-tube condensate
wave-function, coupled to the low-energy phonons of the 1D Bose liquid.
