We determine the number of cusps of minimal Picard modular surfaces. The
proof also counts cusps of other Picard modular surfaces of arithmetic
interest. Consequently, for each N > 0 there are finitely many commensurability
classes of nonuniform arithmetic lattices in SU(2, 1) that contain an N-cusped
surface. We also discuss a higher-rank analogue.
