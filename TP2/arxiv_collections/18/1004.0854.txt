The zero-field specific heat of LiFeAs was measured on several single
crystals selected from a bulk sample. A sharp Delta Cp/Tc anomaly of
approximately 20 mJ/(mole x K^2) was observed. The value appears to be between
those of SmFeAs(O0.9F0.1) and (Ba0.6K0.4)Fe2As2, but bears no clear correlation
with their Sommerfeld coefficients. The electronic specific heat below Tc
further reveals a two-gap structure with the narrower one only on the order of
0.7 meV. While the results are in rough agreement with the Hc1(T) previously
reported on both LiFeAs and (Ba0.6K0.4)Fe2As2, they are different from the
published specific-heat data of a (Ba0.6K0.4)Fe2As2 single crystal.
