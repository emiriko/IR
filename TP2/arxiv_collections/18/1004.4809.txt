The most efficient receiver-driven multicast congestion control protocols use
dynamic channels. This means that each group has a cyclic rate variation with a
continuously decreasing phase. Despite promising results in terms of fairness,
using efficiently these dynamic groups could be a challenging task for
application programmers. This paper presents a sequencer which maps out
application data to dynamic groups in an optimal way. Multiple applications
such as file transfer or video streaming, can use this sequencer, thanks to a
simple API usable with any buffer containing the most important data first. To
evaluate this solution, we designed a file transfer software using a FEC
encoding. Results show the sequencer optimal behavior and the file transfer
efficiency, as a single download generates only little more overhead than TCP .
Moreover, download time is almost independent of the number of receivers, and
is already faster than TCP with 2 competing downloads.
