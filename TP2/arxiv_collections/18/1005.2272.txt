NGC 6791 is a well studied open cluster1 that it is so close to us that can
be imaged down to very faint luminosities. The main sequence turn-off age (~8
Gyr) and the age derived from the termination of the white dwarf cooling
sequence (~6 Gyr) are significantly different. One possible explanation is that
as white dwarfs cool, one of the ashes of helium burning, 22Ne, sinks in the
deep interior of these stars. At lower temperatures, white dwarfs are expected
to crystallise and phase separation of the main constituents of the core of a
typical white dwarf, 12C and 16O, is expected to occur. This sequence of events
is expected to introduce significant delays in the cooling times, but has not
hitherto been proven. Here we report that, as theoretically anticipated,
physical separation processes occur in the cores of white dwarfs, solving the
age discrepancy for NGC 6791.
