In this paper, we investigate experimentally the non-equilibrium steady state
of an active colloidal suspension under gravity field. The active particles are
made of chemically powered colloids, showing self propulsion in the presence of
an added fuel, here hydrogen peroxide. The active suspension is studied in a
dedicated microfluidic device, made of permeable gel microstructures. Both the
microdynamics of individual colloids and the global stationary state of the
suspension under gravity - density profiles, number fluctuations - are measured
with optical microscopy. This allows to connect the sedimentation length to the
individual self-propelled dynamics, suggesting that in the present dilute
regime the active colloids behave as 'hot' particles. Our work is a first step
in the experimental exploration of the out-of-equilibrium properties of
artificial active systems.
