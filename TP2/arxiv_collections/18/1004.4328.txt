In this paper we present detailed M\"ossbauer spectroscopy study of
structural and magnetic properties of the undoped parent compound
CaFe$_2$As$_2$ single crystal. By fitting the temperature dependence of the
hyperfine magnetic field we show that the magneto-structural phase transition
is clearly first-order in nature and we also deduced the compressibility of our
sample to be $1.67\times10^{-2}\,GPa^{-1}$. Within the Landau's theory of phase
transition, we further argue that the observed phase transition may stem from
the strong magneto-structural coupling effect. Temperature dependence of the
Lamb-M\"ossbauer factor show that the paramagnetic phase and the
antiferromagnetic phase exhibit similar lattice dynamics in high frequency
modes with very close Debye temperatures, $\Theta_D \sim$270\,K.
