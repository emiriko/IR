The cooling effects of a quantum LC circuit coupled inductively with an
ensemble of artificial qubits are investigated. The particles may decay
independently or collectively through their interaction with the environmental
vacuum electromagnetic field reservoir. For appropriate bath temperatures and
the resonator's quality factors, we demonstrate an effective cooling well below
the thermal background. In particular, we found that for larger samples the
cooling efficiency is better for independent qubits. However, the cooling
process can be faster for collectively interacting particles.
