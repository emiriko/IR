Recently, Verlinde discussed that gravity can be understood as an entropic
force caused by changes in the information associated with the positions of
material bodies. In the Verlinde's argument, the area law of the black hole
entropy plays a crucial role. However, the entropy-area relation can be
modified from the inclusion of quantum effects, motivated from the loop quantum
gravity. In this note, by employing this modified entropy-area relation, we
derive corrections to Newton's law of gravitation as well as modified Friedman
equations by adopting the viewpoint that gravity can be emerged as an entropic
force. Our study further supports the universality of the log correction and
provides a strong consistency check on Verlinde's model.
