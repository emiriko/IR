We investigate the prospects for indirect detection of fermion WIMPless dark
matter at the neutrino telescopes IceCube and DeepCore. The dark matter
annihilating in the Sun is a hidden sector Majorana fermion that couples
through Yukawa couplings to a connector particle and a visible sector particle,
and it exhibits only spin-dependent scattering with nuclei via couplings to
first generation quarks. We consider cases where the annihilation products are
taus, staus, or sneutrinos of the three generations. To evaluate the muon
fluxes incident at the detector, we propagate the neutrino spectra through the
solar medium and to the Earth and account for the effects of neutrino
oscillations, energy losses due to neutral- and charged-current interactions,
and tau regeneration. We find that for the stau and sneutrino channels, a 5 yr
3$\sigma$ detection of dark matter lighter than about 300 GeV is possible at
IceCube for large Yukawa couplings or for dark matter and connector particles
with similar masses. The tau channel offers far better detection prospects.
However, due to its lower energy threshold and better muon background rejection
capability, DeepCore is able to detect signals in all annihilation channels and
for a wider range of dark matter masses.
