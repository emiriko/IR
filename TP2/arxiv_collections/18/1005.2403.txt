A novel supersolid phase is predicted for an ensemble of Rydberg atoms in the
dipole-blockade regime, interacting via a repulsive dipolar potential
"softened" at short distances. Using exact numerical techniques, we study the
low temperature phase diagram of this system, and observe an intriguing phase
consisting of a crystal of mesoscopic superfluid droplets. At low temperature,
phase coherence throughout the whole system, and the ensuing bulk
superfluidity, are established through tunnelling of identical particles
between neighbouring droplets.
