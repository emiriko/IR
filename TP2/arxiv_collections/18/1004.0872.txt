We investigate slicings of combinatorial manifolds as properly embedded
co-dimension 1 submanifolds. A focus is given to dimension 3 where slicings are
normal surfaces. In the case of 2-neighborly 3-manifolds and quadrangulated
slicings, a lower bound on the number of quadrilaterals of normal surfaces
depending on the genus g is presented. It is shown to be sharp for infinitely
many values of g. Furthermore we classify slicings of combinatorial 3-manifolds
with a maximum number of edges in the slicing.
