General structure of the multivariate plain and q-hypergeometric terms and
univariate elliptic hypergeometric terms is described. Some explicit examples
of the totally elliptic hypergeometric terms leading to multidimensional
integrals on root systems, either computable or obeying non-trivial symmetry
transformations, are presented.
