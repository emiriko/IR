Magneto-transport measurements in a clean two-dimensional electron system
confined to a wide GaAs quantum well reveal that, when the electrons occupy two
electric subbands, the sequences of fractional quantum Hall states observed at
high fillings ($\nu > 2$) are distinctly different from those of a
single-subband system. Notably, when the Fermi energy lies in the ground state
Landau level of either of the subbands, no quantum Hall states are seen at the
even-denominator $\nu$ = 5/2 and 7/2 fillings; instead the observed states are
at $\nu = (i + p/(2p \pm 1))$ where $i$ = 2, 3, and $p$ = 1, 2, 3, and include
several new states at $\nu$ = 13/5, 17/5, 18/5, and 25/7.
