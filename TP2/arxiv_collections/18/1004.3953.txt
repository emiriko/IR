We present a hidden Abelian extension of the Standard Model including a
complex scalar as a dark matter candidate and a light scalar acting as a long
range force carrier between dark matter particles. The Sommerfeld enhanced
annihilation cross-section of the dark matter explains the observed cosmic ray
excesses. The light scalar field also gives rise to potentially large
cross-sections of dark matter on nucleon, therefore providing an interesting
way to probe this model simultaneously at direct and indirect dark matter
search experiments. We constrain the parameter-space of the model by taking
into account CDMS-II exclusion limit as well as PAMELA and FermiLAT data.
