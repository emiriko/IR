A complex pervasive system is typically composed of many cooperating
\emph{nodes}, running on machines with different capabilities, and pervasively
distributed across the environment. These systems pose several new challenges
such as the need for the nodes to manage autonomously and dynamically in order
to adapt to changes detected in the environment. To address the above issue, a
number of autonomic frameworks has been proposed. These usually offer either
predefined self-management policies or programmatic mechanisms for creating new
policies at design time. From a more theoretical perspective, some works
propose the adoption of prediction models as a way to anticipate the evolution
of the system and to make timely decisions. In this context, our aim is to
experiment with the integration of prediction models within a specific
autonomic framework in order to assess the feasibility of such integration in a
setting where the characteristics of dynamicity, decentralization, and
cooperation among nodes are important. We extend an existing infrastructure
called \emph{SelfLets} in order to make it ready to host various prediction
models that can be dynamically plugged and unplugged in the various component
nodes, thus enabling a wide range of predictions to be performed. Also, we show
in a simple example how the system works when adopting a specific prediction
model from the literature.
