We consider the problem of communicating over a multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) real valued channel for which no mathematical model is
specified, and achievable rates are given as a function of the channel input
and output sequences known a-posteriori. This paper extends previous results
regarding individual channels by presenting a rate function for the MIMO
individual channel, and showing its achievability in a fixed transmission rate
communication scenario.
