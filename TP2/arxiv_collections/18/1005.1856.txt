An elliptic curve-based signcryption scheme is introduced in this paper that
effectively combines the functionalities of digital signature and encryption,
and decreases the computational costs and communication overheads in comparison
with the traditional signature-then-encryption schemes. It simultaneously
provides the attributes of message confidentiality, authentication, integrity,
unforgeability, non-repudiation, public verifiability, and forward secrecy of
message confidentiality. Since it is based on elliptic curves and can use any
fast and secure symmetric algorithm for encrypting messages, it has great
advantages to be used for security establishments in store-and-forward
applications and when dealing with resource-constrained devices.
