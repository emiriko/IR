We study few-boson tunneling in a one-dimensional double well with a
spatially modulated interaction. The dynamics changes from Rabi oscillations in
the non-interacting case to a highly suppressed tunneling for intermediate
coupling strengths followed by a revival near the fermionization limit. With
extreme interaction inhomogeneity in the regime of strong correlations we
observe tunneling between the higher bands. The dynamics is explained on the
basis of the few-body spectrum and stationary eigenstates. For higher number of
particles, N > 2, it is shown that the inhomogeneity of the interaction can be
tuned to generate tunneling resonances. Finally, a tilted double-well and its
interplay with the interaction asymmetry is discussed.
