Several refinements are made in a theory which starts with a Planck-scale
statistical picture and ends with supersymmetry and a coupling of fundamental
fermions and bosons to SO(N) gauge fields. In particular, more satisfactory
treatments are given for (1) the transformation from the initial Euclidean form
of the path integral for fermionic fields to the usual Lorentzian form, (2) the
corresponding transformation for bosonic fields (which is much less
straightforward), (3) the transformation from an initial primitive
supersymmetry to the final standard form (containing, e.g., scalar sfermions
and their auxiliary fields), (4) the initial statistical picture, and (5) the
transformation to an action which is invariant under general coordinate
transformations.
