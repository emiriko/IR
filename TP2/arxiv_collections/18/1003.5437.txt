VANETs (Vehicular Ad hoc Networks) are highly mobile wireless ad hoc networks
and will play an important role in public safety communications and commercial
applications. Routing of data in VANETs is a challenging task due to rapidly
changing topology and high speed mobility of vehicles. Position based routing
protocols are becoming popular due to advancement and availability of GPS
devices. One of the critical issues of VANETs are frequent path disruptions
caused by high speed mobility of vehicle that leads to broken links which
results in low throughput and high overhead . This paper argues the use of
information on vehicles' movement information (e.g., position, direction, speed
of vehicles) to predict a possible link-breakage event prior to its occurrence.
So in this paper we propose a Reliable Directional Greedy routing (RDGR), a
reliable position based routing approach which obtains position, speed and
direction of its neighboring nodes from GPS. This approach incorporates
potential score based strategy, which calculates link stability between
neighbor nodes in distributed fashion for reliable forwarding of data packet.
