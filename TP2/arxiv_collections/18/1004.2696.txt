We theoretically consider specific adhesion of a fluctuating membrane to a
hard substrate via the formation of bonds between receptors attached to the
substrate and ligands in the membrane. By integrating out the degrees of
freedom of the membrane shape, we show that in the biologically relevant limit
specific adhesion is well described by a lattice gas model, where lattice sites
correspond to bond sites. We derive an explicit expression for the effective
bond interactions induced by the thermal undulations of the membrane.
Furthermore, we compare kinetic Monte Carlo simulations for our lattice gas
model with full dynamic simulations that take into account both the shape
fluctuations of the membrane and reactions between receptors and ligands at
bond sites. We demonstrate that an appropriate mapping of the height dependent
binding and unbinding rates in the full scheme to rates in the lattice gas
model leads to good agreement.
