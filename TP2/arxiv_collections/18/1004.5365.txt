The problem of diffraction of an electromagnetic plane wave by a perfectly
conducting circular disk and its complementary problem, diffraction by a
circular hole in an infinite conducting plate, are rigorously solved using the
method of the Kobayashi potential. The mathematical formulation involved dual
integral equation derived from the potential integral and boundary condition on
the plane where a disk or hole is located. The weighting function in the
potential integral are determined by applying the properties of the
Weber-Schafheitlin's discontinuous integral and the solution are obtained in
the form of a matrix equation. The matrix elements of the equations for the
expansion coefficients are given by three kinds of infinite integral and the
series solution for these infinite integral are derived. For the verification
of these series solution, the numerical integral are derived and the results
are computed numerically using the method of Gaussian quadrature for
conformation. The numerical results are given for the far-field pattern
diffraction by a perfectly conducting disk and the results are compared with
those obtained from physical optics method (PO), which is fairly good.
