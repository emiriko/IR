We propose a practical scheme for deterministically teleporting an arbitrary
multipartite state, either product or entangled, using Faraday rotation of the
photonic polarization. Our scheme, based on the input-output process of
single-photon pulses regarding cavities, works in low-Q cavities and only
involves virtual excitation of the atoms, which is insensitive to both cavity
decay and atomic spontaneous emission. Besides, the Bell-state measurement is
accomplished by the Faraday rotation plus product-state measurements, which
could much relax the experimental difficulty to realize the Bell-state
measurement by the CNOT operation.
