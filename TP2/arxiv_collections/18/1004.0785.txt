Distributed storage systems are mainly justified due to the limited amount of
storage capacity and improving the reliability through distributing data over
multiple storage nodes. On the other hand, it may happen the data is stored in
unreliable nodes, while it is desired the end user to have a reliable access to
the stored data. So, in an event that a node is damaged, to prevent the system
reliability to regress, it is necessary to regenerate a new node with the same
amount of stored data as the damaged node to retain the number of storage
nodes, thereby having the previous reliability. This requires the new node to
connect to some of existing nodes and downloads the required information,
thereby occupying some bandwidth, called the repair bandwidth. On the other
hand, it is more likely the cost of downloading varies across different nodes.
This paper aims at investigating the theoretical cost-bandwidth tradeoff, and
more importantly, it is demonstrated that any point on this curve can be
achieved through the use of the so called generalized regenerating codes which
is an enhancement of the regeneration codes introduced by Dimakis et al. in
[1].
