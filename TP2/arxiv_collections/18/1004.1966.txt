We study the dependency of the quantum spin dynamics on the particle number
in a system of ultracold spin-1 atoms within the single-spatial-mode
approximation. We find, for all strengths of the spin-dependent interaction,
convergence towards the mean-field dynamics in the thermodynamic limit. The
convergence is, however, particularly slow when the spin-changing collisional
energy and the quadratic Zeeman energy are equal, i.e. deviations between
quantum and mean-field spin dynamics may be extremely large under these
conditions. Our estimates show, that quantum corrections to the mean-field
dynamics may play a relevant role in experiments with spinor Bose-Einstein
condensates. This is especially the case in the regime of few atoms, which may
be accessible in optical lattices. Here, spin dynamics is modulated by a beat
note at large magnetic fields due to the significant influence of correlated
many-body spin states.
