Population analysis is persistently challenging but important, leading to the
determination of diversity and function prediction of microbial community
members. Here we detail our bioinformatics methods for analyzing population
distribution and diversity in large microbial communities. This was achieved
via (i) a homology based method for robust phylotype determination, equaling
the classification accuracy of the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) classifier,
but providing improved associations of closely related sequences; (ii) a
comparison of different clustering methods for achieving more accurate richness
estimations. Our methodology, which we developed using the RDP vetted 16S rRNA
gene sequence set, was validated by testing it on a large 16S rRNA gene dataset
of approximately 2300 sequences, which we obtained from a soil microbial
community study. We concluded that the best approach to obtain accurate
phylogenetics profile of large microbial communities, based on 16S rRNA gene
sequence information, is to apply an optimized blast classifier. This approach
is complemented by the grouping of closely related sequences, using complete
linkage clustering, in order to calculate richness and evenness indices for the
communities.
