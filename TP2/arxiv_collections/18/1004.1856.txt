Considerable progress has been made in determining the Hubble constant over
the past two decades. We discuss the cosmological context and importance of an
accurate measurement of the Hubble constant, and focus on six high-precision
distance-determination methods: Cepheids, tip of the red giant branch, maser
galaxies, surface brightness fluctuations, the Tully-Fisher relation and Type
Ia supernovae. We discuss in detail known systematic errors in the measurement
of galaxy distances and how to minimize them. Our best current estimate of the
Hubble constant is 73 +/-2 (random) +/-4 (systematic) km/s/Mpc. The importance
of improved accuracy in the Hubble constant will increase over the next decade
with new missions and experiments designed to increase the precision in other
cosmological parameters. We outline the steps that will be required to deliver
a value of the Hubble constant to 2% systematic uncertainty and discuss the
constraints on other cosmological parameters that will then be possible with
such accuracy.
