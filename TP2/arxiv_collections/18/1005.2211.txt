In this paper we present a modification of a technique by Chiba and Nishizeki
[Chiba and Nishizeki: Arboricity and Subgraph Listing Algorithms, SIAM J.
Comput. 14(1), pp. 210--223 (1985)]. Based on it, we design a data structure
suitable for dynamic graph algorithms. We employ the data structure to
formulate new algorithms for several problems, including counting subgraphs of
four vertices, recognition of diamond-free graphs, cop-win graphs and strongly
chordal graphs, among others. We improve the time complexity for graphs with
low arboricity or h-index.
