Radial velocity (RV) observations of an exoplanet system giving a value of
M_T sin(i) condition (i.e. give information about) not only the planet's true
mass M_T but also the value of sin(i) (where i is the orbital inclination
angle). Thus the value of sin(i) for a system with any particular observed
value of M_T sin(i) cannot be assumed to be drawn randomly from a uniform
distribution between zero and unity (corresponding to an isotropic i
distribution). The actual distribution from which it is drawn depends on the
intrinsic distribution of M_T for the exoplanet population being studied. We
give a simple Bayesian derivation of this relationship and apply it to several
"toy models" for the (currently unknown) intrinsic distribution of M_T. The
results show that the effect can be an important one. For example, even for
simple power-law distributions of M_T, the median value of sin(i) in an
observed RV sample can vary between 0.25 and 0.71 (as compared to the 0.5 value
for an isotropic i distribution) for indices of the power-law in the quite
plausible range between -2 and -0.5, respectively. Over the same range of
indicies, the 95% confidence upper bound on M_T ranges from 4.5 to 400 times
larger than M_T sin(i), respectively, due to sin(i) uncertainty alone. More
complex, but still simple and plausible, distributions of M_T yield still more
complicated and less intuitive $sin(i)$ distributions. In particular, if the
M_T distribution contains any characteristic mass scale M_c, the sin(i)
distribution will depend on the ratio of M_T sin(i) to $M_c$, often in a
non-trivial way. Our qualitative conclusion is that RV studies of exoplanets,
both individual objects and statistical samples, should regard the sin(i)
factor as more than a "numerical constant of order unity" with simple and well
understood statistical properties. (abridged)
