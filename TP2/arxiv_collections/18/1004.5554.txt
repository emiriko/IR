An unusual noise component is found near and below about 250 K in the normal
state of underdoped YBCO and Ca-YBCO films. This noise regime, unlike the more
typical noise above 250 K, has features expected for a symmetry-breaking
collective electronic state. These include large individual fluctuators, a
magnetic sensitivity, and aging effects. A possible interpretation in terms of
fluctuating charge nematic order is presented.
