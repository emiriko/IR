We have carried out an L' and M band Adaptive Optics (AO) extrasolar planet
imaging survey of 54 nearby, sunlike stars using the Clio camera at the MMT.
Our survey concentrates more strongly than all others to date on very nearby F,
G, and K stars, in that we have prioritized proximity higher than youth. Our
survey is also the first to include extensive observations in the M band, which
supplemented the primary L' observations. These longer wavelength bands are
most useful for very nearby systems in which low temperature planets with red
IR colors (i.e. H - L', H - M) could be detected. The survey detected no
planets, but set interesting limits on planets and brown dwarfs in the star
systems we investigated. We have interpreted our null result by means of
extensive Monte Carlo simulations, and constrained the distributions of
extrasolar planets in mass $M$ and semimajor axis $a$. If planets are
distributed according to a power law with $dN \propto M^{\alpha} a^{\beta} dM
da$, normalized to be consistent with radial velocity statistics, we find that
a distribution with $\alpha = -1.1$ and $\beta = -0.46$, truncated at 110 AU,
is ruled out at the 90% confidence level. These particular values of $\alpha$
and $\beta$ are significant because they represent the most planet-rich case
consistent with current statistics from radial velocity observations. With 90%
confidence no more than 8.1% of stars like those in our survey have systems
with three widely spaced, massive planets like the A-star HR 8799. Our
observations show that giant planets in long-period orbits around sun-like
stars are rare, confirming the results of shorter-wavelength surveys, and
increasing the robustness of the conclusion.
