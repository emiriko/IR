We present a high bandwidth piezoelectric-actuated mirror for length
stabilization of an optical cavity. The actuator displays a transfer function
with a flat amplitude response and greater than 135$^\circ$ phase margin up to
200 kHz, allowing a 180 kHz unity gain frequency to be achieved in a closed
servo loop. To the best of our knowledge, this actuator has achieved the
largest servo bandwidth for a piezoelectric transducer (PZT). The actuator
should be very useful in a wide variety of applications requiring precision
control of optical lengths, including laser frequency stabilization, optical
interferometers, and optical communications.
