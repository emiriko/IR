simpcomp is an extension (a so called package) to GAP, the well known system
for computational discrete algebra. The package enables the user to compute
numerous properties of (abstract) simplicial complexes, provides functions to
construct new complexes from existing ones and an extensive library of
triangulations of manifolds.
