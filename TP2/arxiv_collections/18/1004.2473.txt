The radio source 18P87, previously thought to be a point source, has been
serendipitously found to be resolved into a core-jet geometry in VLA maps. HI
absorption of continuum emission (in data from the Canadian Galactic Plane
Survey) appears in gas with radial velocities > +2 km/s but not in brightly
emitting gas at lower radial velocity. Examination of further archival
observations at radio, infrared and optical wavelengths suggests that the
"obvious" interpretation as a radio galaxy requires a rather unusual object of
this kind and a highly unusual local line of sight. We argue that 18P87 may be
a Galactic object, a local astrophysical jet. If this is correct it could have
arisen from outbursts of a microquasar.
