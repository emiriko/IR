Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein integral functions are of importance not only
in quantum statistics but for their mathematical properties, in themselves.
Here, we have extended these functions by introducing an extra parameter in a
way that gives new insights into these functions and their relation to the
family of zeta functions. These extensions are "dual" to each other in a sense
that is explained. Some identities are proved for them and the relation between
them and the general Hurwitz-Lerch zeta function (\phi(z,s,v) is exploited to
deduce new identities.
