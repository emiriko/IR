Experiments on carrier recombination in two-dimensional organic structures
are often interpreted in the frame of the Langevin model with taking into
account only the drift of the charge carriers in their mutual electric field.
While this approach is well justified for three-dimensional systems, it is in
general not valid for two-dimensional structures, where the contribution of
diffusion can play a dominant role. We study the two-dimensional Langevin
recombination theoretically and find the critical concentration below which
diffusion cannot be neglected. For typical experimental conditions, neglecting
the diffusion leads to an underestimation of the recombination rate by several
times.
