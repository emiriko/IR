The effect of direct current component appearance in material with
non-additive energy spectrum in the case when two electromagnetic waves with
mutually transverse planes of polarization are incident normally on the surface
of the sample is studied on the base of analysis of quantum kinetic equation.
The cases of electron scattering on optical and acoustic phonons are
considered. The first non-vanishing approximation by electromagnetic waves
field strengths is obtained. It is shown that in concerned situation the
decisive condition of direct current appearance is sufficient inelasticity of
scattering.
