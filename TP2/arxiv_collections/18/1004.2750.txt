The rod-structure formalism has played an important role in the study of
black holes in D=4 and 5 dimensions with RxU(1)^{D-3} isometry. In this paper,
we apply this formalism to the study of four-dimensional gravitational
instantons with U(1)xU(1) isometry, which could serve as spatial backgrounds
for five-dimensional black holes. We first introduce a stronger version of the
rod structure with the rod directions appropriately normalised, and show how
the regularity conditions can be read off from it. Requiring the absence of
conical and orbifold singularities will in general impose periodicity
conditions on the coordinates, and we illustrate this by considering known
gravitational instantons in this class. Some previous results regarding certain
gravitational instantons are clarified in the process. Finally, we show how the
rod-structure formalism is able to provide a classification of gravitational
instantons, and speculate on the existence of possible new gravitational
instantons.
