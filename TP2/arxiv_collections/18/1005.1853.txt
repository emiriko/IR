To find the best lattice model representation of a given full atom protein
structure is a hard computational problem. Several greedy methods have been
suggested where results are usually biased and leave room for improvement. In
this paper we formulate and implement a Constraint Programming method to refine
such lattice structure models. We show that the approach is able to provide
better quality solutions. The prototype is implemented in COLA and is based on
limited discrepancy search. Finally, some promising extensions based on local
search are discussed.
