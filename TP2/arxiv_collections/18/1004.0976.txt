We study the evolution of initially extended distributions in the coined
quantum walk on the line by analyzing the dispersion relation of the process
and its associated wave equations. This allows us, in particular, to devise an
initially extended condition leading to a uniform probability distribution
whose width increases linearly with time, with increasing homogeneity.
