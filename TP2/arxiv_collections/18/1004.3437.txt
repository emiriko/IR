We present results of an analytic and numerical calculation that studies the
relationship between the time of initial foot contact and the ground reaction
force of human gait and explores the dynamic principle of center of mass.
Assuming the ground reaction force of both feet to be the same in the same
phase of a stride cycle, we establish the relationships between the time of
initial foot contact and the ground reaction force, acceleration, velocity,
displacement and average kinetic energy of center of mass. We employ the
dispersion to analyze the effect of the time of the initial foot contact that
imposes upon these physical quantities. Our study reveals that when the time of
one foot's initial contact falls right in the middle of the other foot's stride
cycle, these physical quantities reach extrema. An action function has been
identified as the dispersion of the physical quantities and optimized analysis
used to prove the least-action principle in gait. In addition to being very
significant to the research domains such as clinical diagnosis, biped robot's
gait control, the exploration of this principle can simplify our understanding
of the basic properties of gait.
