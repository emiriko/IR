We calculate the autocorrelation function for the characteristic polynomial
of a random matrix in the microscopic scaling regime. While results fitting
this description have be proved before, we will cover all values of inverse
temperature $\beta \in (0,\infty)$. The method also differs from prior work,
relying on matrix models introduced by Killip and Nenciu.
