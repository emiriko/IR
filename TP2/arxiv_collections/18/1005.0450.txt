We theoretically study Aharonov-Bohm resonances in an antidot system with
multiple bound modes in the integer quantum Hall regime, taking capacitive
interactions between the modes into account. We find the spectator behavior
that the resonances of some modes disappear and instead are replaced by those
of other modes, due to internal charge relaxation between the modes. This
behavior is a possible origin of the features of previous experimental data
which remain unexplained, spectator behavior in an antidot molecule and
resonances in a single antidot with three modes.
