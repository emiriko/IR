We have designed and built a near-field scanning microwave microscope, which
has been used to measure the local microwave response and the local
density-of-states (LDOS) in the area including the boundary between the gold
deposited and the non-deposited region on highly-orientated pyrolytic graphite
at a frequency of about 7.3 GHz. We have succeeded in measuring the spatial
variation of both the LDOS and the surface resistance. It can be observed that
the surface resistance in gold deposited region with the metallic tunneling
spectra is smaller than that in the non-deposited region with the U-shaped
tunneling spectra.
