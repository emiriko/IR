At the Tevatron, the collider experiments CDF and DO have data sets at their
disposal that comprise a few thousand reconstructed top-antitop-quark pairs and
allow for precision measurements of the cross section as well as production and
decay properties. Besides comparing the measurements to standard model
predictions, these data sets open a window to physics beyond the standard
model. Dedicated analyses look for new heavy gauge bosons, fourth generation
quarks, and flavor-changing neutral currents. In this mini-review the current
status of these measurements is summarized.
