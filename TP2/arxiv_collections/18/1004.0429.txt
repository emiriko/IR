Multidimensional affine diffusions have been studied in detail for the case
of a canonical state space. We present results for general state spaces and
provide a complete characterization of all possible affine diffusions with
polyhedral and quadratic state space. We give necessary and sufficient
conditions on the behavior of drift and diffusion on the boundary of the state
space in order to obtain invariance and to prove strong existence and
uniqueness.
