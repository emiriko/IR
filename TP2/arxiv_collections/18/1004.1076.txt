We propose here that for a spin-imbalanced two-component attractive Fermi gas
loaded in a 1D optical lattice in presence of an harmonic confining potential,
the observation of the change in the double occupancy after a lattice depth
modulation can provide clear evidence of the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov
(FFLO) phase. Simulating the time evolution of the system, we can characterize
the double occupancy spectrum for different initial conditions, relating its
features to the FFLO wavevector $q$. In particular, the narrowing of the width
of the spectrum can be related, through Bethe-ansatz equations in the strongly
interacting limit, to the FFLO wavevector $q$.
