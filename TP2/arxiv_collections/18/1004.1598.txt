We present a both simple and comprehensive graphical calculus for quantum
computing. In particular, we axiomatize the notion of an environment, which
together with the earlier introduced axiomatic notion of classical structure
enables us to define classical channels, quantum measurements and classical
control. If we moreover adjoin the earlier introduced axiomatic notion of
complementarity, we obtain sufficient structural power for constructive
representation and correctness derivation of typical quantum informatic
protocols.
