We study possible formulations of algebraic propositional proof systems
operating with noncommutative formulas. We observe that a simple formulation
gives rise to systems at least as strong as Frege---yielding a semantic way to
define a Cook-Reckhow (i.e., polynomially verifiable) algebraic analog of Frege
proofs, different from that given in [BIKPRS96,GH03]. We then turn to an
apparently weaker system, namely, polynomial calculus (PC) where polynomials
are written as ordered formulas (PC over ordered formulas, for short): an
ordered polynomial is a noncommutative polynomial in which the order of
products in every monomial respects a fixed linear order on variables; an
algebraic formula is ordered if the polynomial computed by each of its
subformulas is ordered. We show that PC over ordered formulas is strictly
stronger than resolution, polynomial calculus and polynomial calculus with
resolution (PCR) and admits polynomial-size refutations for the pigeonhole
principle and the Tseitin's formulas. We conclude by proposing an approach for
establishing lower bounds on PC over ordered formulas proofs, and related
systems, based on properties of lower bounds on noncommutative formulas.
  The motivation behind this work is developing techniques incorporating rank
arguments (similar to those used in algebraic circuit complexity) for
establishing lower bounds on propositional proofs.
