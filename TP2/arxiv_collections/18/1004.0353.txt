We present the results of a Bayesian analysis of a Regge model to describe
the background contribution for K+ Lambda and K+ Sigma0 photoproduction. The
model is based on the exchange of K+(494) and K*+(892) trajectories in the
t-channel. We utilise the Bayesian evidence Z to determine the best model
variant for each channel. The Bayesian evidence integrals were calculated using
the Nested Sampling algorithm. For different prior widths, we find decisive
Bayesian evidence (\Delta ln Z ~ 24) for a K+ Lambda photoproduction Regge
model with a positive vector coupling and a negative tensor coupling constant
for the K*+(892) trajectory, and a rotating phase factor for both trajectories.
Using the chi^2 minimisation method, one could not draw this conclusion from
the same dataset. For the K+ Sigma0 photoproduction Regge model, on the other
hand, the difference between the evidence integrals is insufficient to pinpoint
one model variant.
