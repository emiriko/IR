Local and global persistence exponents associated with zero temperature
quenched dynamics of two dimensional XY model and three dimensional Heisenberg
model have been estimated using numerical simulations. We have used the method
of block persistence to find both global and local exponents simultaneously (in
a single simulation). Temperature universality of both the exponents for three
dimensional Heisenberg model has been confirmed by simulating the stochastic
(with noise) version of the equation of motion. The noise amplitudes added were
small enough to retain the dynamics below criticality. In the second part of
our work we have studied scaling associated with correlated persistence sites
in the three dimensional Heisenberg model in the later stages of the dynamics.
The relevant length scale associated with correlated persistent sites was found
to behave in a manner similar to the dynamic length scale associated with the
phase ordering dynamics.
