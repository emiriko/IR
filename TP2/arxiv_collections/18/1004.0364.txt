We show that the ring of translation invariant symmetric polynomials in n
variables is isomorphic to the full polynomial ring in n-1 variables, in
characteristic 0. We disprove a conjecture of Haldane regarding the structure
of such polynomials. Our motivation is the fractional quantum Hall effect,
where translation invariant (anti)symmetric complex n-variate polynomials
characterize n-electron wavefunctions.
