In a recent paper we have considered an explicit model of a PT-symmetric
system based on a modification of the canonical commutation relation. We have
introduced the so-called {\em pseudo-bosons}, and the role of Riesz bases in
this context has been analyzed in detail. In this paper we consider a general
construction of pseudo-bosons based on an explicit {coordinate-representation},
extending what is usually done in ordinary supersymmetric quantum mechanics. We
also discuss an example arising from a linear modification of standard creation
and annihilation operators, and we analyze its connection with coherent states.
