The normal state properties of the recently discovered ferropnictide
superconductors might hold the key to understanding their exotic
superconductivity. Using point-contact spectroscopy we show that Andreev
reflection between an epitaxial thin film of
Ba(Fe$_{0.92}$Co$_{0.08}$)$_2$As$_2$ and a silver tip can be seen in the normal
state of the film up to temperature $T\sim1.3T_c$, where $T_c$ is the critical
temperature of the superconductor. Andreev reflection far above $T_c$ can be
understood only when superconducting pairs arising from strong fluctuation of
the phase of the complex superconducting order parameter exist in the normal
state. Our results provide spectroscopic evidence of phase-incoherent
superconducting pairs in the normal state of the ferropnictide superconductors.
