The purpose of this article is to study the persistence of solution of a
hyperbolic system under small viscous perturbation. Here, the solution of the
hyperbolic system is supposed to be periodic: it is a periodic perturbation of
a roll-wave. So, it has an infinity of shocks. The proof of the persistence is
based on an expansion of the viscous solution and estimates on Green's
functions.
