Homologically fibered knots are knots whose exteriors satisfy the same
homological conditions as fibered knots. In our previous paper, we observed
that for such a knot, higher-order Alexander invariants defined by Cochran,
Harvey and Friedl are generally factorized into the part of the Magnus matrix
and that of a certain Reidemeister torsion, both of which are known as
invariants of homology cylinders over a surface. In this paper, we study more
details of the invariants and give some concrete calculations by restricting to
the case of the invariants associated with metabelian quotients of their knot
groups. We provide examples of explicit calculations of the invariants for all
the 12 crossings non-fibered homologically fibered knots.
