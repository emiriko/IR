The identification of the X(3872) as a loosely-bound charm-meson molecule
allows it to be described by an effective field theory, called XEFT, for the
D^* Dbar, D Dbar^* and D Dbar pi sector of QCD at energies small compared to
the pion mass. We point out that this effective field theory can be extended to
the sector that includes an additional pion and used to calculate cross
sections for the scattering of a pion and the X(3872). If the collision energy
is much smaller than the pion mass, the cross sections are completely
calculable at leading order in terms of the masses and widths of the charm
mesons, pion masses, and the binding energy of the X(3872). We carry out an
explicit calculation of the cross section for the breakup of the X(3872) into
D^{*+} Dbar^{*0} by the scattering of a very low energy pi^+.
