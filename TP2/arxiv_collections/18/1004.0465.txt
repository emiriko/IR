Focal conic domains are typically the "smoking gun" by which smectic liquid
crystalline phases are identified. The geometry of the equally-spaced smectic
layers is highly generic but, at the same time, difficult to work with. In this
Letter we develop an approach to the study of focal sets in smectics which
exploits a hidden Poincar\'e symmetry revealed only by viewing the smectic
layers as projections from one-higher dimension. We use this perspective to
shed light upon several classic focal conic textures, including the concentric
cyclides of Dupin, polygonal textures and tilt-grain boundaries.
