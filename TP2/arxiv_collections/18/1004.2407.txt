We obtain systematic approximations to the states (energies and wave
functions) of quantum rings (annular drums) of arbitrary shape by conformally
mapping the annular domain to a simply connected domain. Extending the general
results of Ref.\cite{Amore09} we obtain an analytical formula for the spectrum
of quantum ring of arbirtrary shape: for the cases of a circular annulus and of
a Robnik ring considered here this formula is remarkably simple and precise. We
also obtain precise variational bounds for the ground state of different
quantum rings. Finally we extend the Conformal Collocation Method of
\cite{Amore08,Amore09} to the class of problems considered here and calculate
precise numerical solutions for a large number of states ($\approx 2000$).
