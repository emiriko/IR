Cassini radio science experiments have provided multiple occultation optical
depth profiles of Saturn's rings that can be used in combination to analyze
density waves. This paper establishes an accurate procedure of inversion of the
wave profiles to reconstruct the wave kinematic parameters as a function of
semi-major axis, in the nonlinear regime. This procedure is achieved from
simulated data in the presence of realistic noise perturbations, to control the
reconstruction error. By way of illustration we have applied our procedure to
the Mimas 5:3 density wave. We were able to recover precisely the kinematic
parameters from the radio experiment occultation data in most of the
propagation region; a preliminary analysis of the pressure-corrected dispersion
allowed us to determine new but still uncertain values for the opacity
($K\simeq 0.02$ cm$^2$/g) and velocity dispersion of ($c_o\simeq 0.6$ cm/s) in
the wave region. Our procedure constitutes the first step in our planned
analysis of the density waves of Saturn's rings. It is very accurate and
efficient in the far-wave region. However, improvements are required within the
first wavelength. The ways in which this method can be used to establish
diagnostics of ring physics are outlined.
