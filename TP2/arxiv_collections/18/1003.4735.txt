A crossover between the Bose Einstein condensation (BEC) and BCS
superconducting state is described topologically in the chiral symmetric
fermion system with attractive interaction. Using a local Z_2 Berry phase, we
found a quantum phase transition between the BEC and BCS phases without
accompanying the bulk gap closing.
