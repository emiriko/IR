We analyze large scale mapping observations of the molecular lines in the
12CO (J=2-1), 12CO (J=3-2), 13CO (J=2-1), and 13CO (J=3-2) transition emissions
toward the Cepheus B molecular cloud with the KOSMA 3m-telescope. The
integrated intensity map of the 12CO (J=2-1) transition has shown a structure
with a compact core and a compact ridge extended in the north-west of the core.
The cloud is surrounded by an optically bright rim, where the radiation-driven
implosion (RDI) may greatly change the gas properties. The intensities of the
CO (J=3-2) transition are higher than those of the CO (J=2-1) transition along
the rim area.We find characteristic RDI structure in positionvelocity diagrams.
Non-LTE Large velocity gradient (LVG) model analysis shows that the density and
temperature at the edge are higher than that in the center. Our results provide
evidences that RDI is taking place in Cepheus B molecular cloud.
