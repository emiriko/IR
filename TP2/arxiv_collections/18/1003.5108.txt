We extend the Majumdar-Papapetrou (MP) solution of the Einstein-Maxwell (EM)
equations which is implied generally for static electric charge in non-rotating
metrics to encompass equally well magnetic charges. In the absence of Higgs and
non-Abelian gauge fields, 'dyonic' is to be understood in this simpler sense.
Cosmologically this may have far-reaching consequences, to the extent that
existence of multi-magnetic monopole black holes may become a reality in our
universe. Infalling charged particle geodesics may reveal, through particular
integrals, their inner secrets which are screened from our observation.
