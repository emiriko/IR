We employ the hysteretic behavior of a superconducting thin film in the
remanent state to generate different traps and flexible magnetic potentials for
ultra-cold atoms. The trap geometry can be programmed by externally applied
fields. This new approach for atom-optics is demonstrated by three different
trap types realized on a single micro-structure: a Z-type trap, a double trap
and a bias field free trap. Our studies show that superconductors in the
remanent state provide a new versatile platform for atom-optics and
applications in ultra-cold quantum gases.
