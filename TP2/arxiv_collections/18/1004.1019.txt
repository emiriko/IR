In a recent paper [Phys. Rev. B 72, 153314 (2005)], the $k^{3}$-Dresselhaus
term in the contacts and the full form of the current operator are considered
for spin-dependent tunneling through a symmetric barrier. The authors found
that the full form of the current operator has a much larger influence on the
spin polarization than it was initially thought. In this Comment we will show
that their treatment of the other problem, the $k^{3}$-Dresselhaus term in the
contacts, is incorrect. Their proposed solution in the contacts simply does not
obey the Schr\"{o}dinger equation. In this context we also comment on the
definition and the suitability of spin polarization in contacts with spin-orbit
coupling.
