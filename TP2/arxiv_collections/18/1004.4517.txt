Numerical values of charged-particle thermonuclear reaction rates for nuclei
in the A=14 to 40 region are tabulated. The results are obtained using a
method, based on Monte Carlo techniques, that has been described in the
preceding paper of this series (Paper I). We present a low rate, median rate
and high rate which correspond to the 0.16, 0.50 and 0.84 quantiles,
respectively, of the cumulative reaction rate distribution. The meaning of
these quantities is in general different from the commonly reported, but
statistically meaningless expressions, "lower limit", "nominal value" and
"upper limit" of the total reaction rate. In addition, we approximate the Monte
Carlo probability density function of the total reaction rate by a lognormal
distribution and tabulate the lognormal parameters {\mu} and {\sigma} at each
temperature. We also provide a quantitative measure (Anderson-Darling test
statistic) for the reliability of the lognormal approximation. The user can
implement the approximate lognormal reaction rate probability density functions
directly in a stellar model code for studies of stellar energy generation and
nucleosynthesis. For each reaction, the Monte Carlo reaction rate probability
density functions, together with their lognormal approximations, are displayed
graphically for selected temperatures in order to provide a visual impression.
Our new reaction rates are appropriate for bare nuclei in the laboratory. The
nuclear physics input used to derive our reaction rates is presented in the
subsequent paper of this series (Paper III). In the fourth paper of this series
(Paper IV) we compare our new reaction rates to previous results.
