The inclusive production of light mesons in pp-scattering is considered in
the framework of reggeon phenomenology with supercritical Pomeron. Available
low-energy data can be explained with three reggeon particles taken into
account. With the obtained results rapidity and pseudorapidity distributions
for light-meson production at LHC energies are predicted.
