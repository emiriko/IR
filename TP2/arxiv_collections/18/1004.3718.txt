Bose-Einstein condensation of a sample of non-interacting chiral molecules
leads to a non zero optical activity of the condensate and also to a
subcritical temperature in the heat capacity. This is due to the internal
structure of the molecule which, in our model, is considered as a simple
two-state system, characterized by tunneling and parity violation. The
predicted singular behavior found for the specific heat, below the condensation
temperature, sheds some light on the existence of the so far elusive parity
violation energy difference between enantiomers.
