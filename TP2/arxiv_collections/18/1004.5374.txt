We have studied the far-infrared (far-IR) charge dynamics of an equilibrated
pure oxygen doped La2CuO4+0.0315 under slow-cooled and fast-cooled conditions.
The superconducting transition temperature (Tc) for the slow-cooled and that
for the fast-cooled processes were respectively found to be close to the two
intrinsic Tc's: One at 30 K and the other at 15 K. Direct comparison with our
previous results and other far-IR and Raman studies on single crystalline
La2-xSrxCuO4, we conclude that the topology of the pristine electronic phases
that are responsible for the two intrinsic Tc's is holes arranged into
two-dimensional (2D) square lattices.
