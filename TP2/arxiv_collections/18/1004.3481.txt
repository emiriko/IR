(abbreviated) Measuring the surface abundances of AGB stars is an important
tool for studying the effects of nucleosynthesis and mixing in the interior of
low- to intermediate mass stars during their final evolutionary phases. The
atmospheres of AGB stars can be strongly affected by stellar pulsation and the
development of a stellar wind, though, and the abundance determination of these
objects should therefore be based on dynamic model atmospheres. We investigate
the effects of stellar pulsation and mass loss on the appearance of selected
spectral features (line profiles, line intensities) and on the derived
elemental abundances by performing a systematic comparison of hydrostatic and
dynamic model atmospheres. High-resolution synthetic spectra in the near
infrared range were calculated based on two dynamic model atmospheres (at
various phases during the pulsation cycle) as well as a grid of hydrostatic
COMARCS models. Equivalent widths of a selection of atomic and molecular lines
were derived in both cases and compared with each other. In the case of the
dynamic models, the equivalent widths of all investigated features vary over
the pulsation cycle. A consistent reproduction of the derived variations with a
set of hydrostatic models is not possible, but several individual phases and
spectral features can be reproduced well with the help of specific hydrostatic
atmospheric models. In addition, we show that the variations in equivalent
width that we found on the basis of the adopted dynamic model atmospheres agree
qualitatively with observational results for the Mira R Cas over its light
cycle. The findings of our modelling form a starting point to deal with the
problem of abundance determination in strongly dynamic AGB stars (i.e.,
long-period variables).
