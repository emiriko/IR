School and College campuses face a perceived threat of violent crimes and
require a realistic plan against unpredictable emergencies and disasters.
Existing emergency systems (e.g., 911, campus-wide alerts) are quite useful,
but provide delayed response (often tens of minutes) and do not utilize
proximity or locality. There is a need to augment such systems with
proximity-based systems for more immediate response to attempt to prevent and
deter crime. In this paper we propose SHIELD, an on-campus emergency rescue and
alert management service. It is a fully distributed infrastructure-less
platform based on proximity-enabled trust and cooperation. It relies on
localized responses, sent using Bluetooth and/or WiFi on the fly to achieve
minimal response time and maximal availability thereby augmenting the
traditional notion of emergency services. Analysis of campus crime statistics
and WLAN traces surprisingly show a strong positive correlation (over 55%)
between on-campus crime statistics and spatio-temporal density distribution of
on-campus mobile users. This result provides a motivation to develop such
platform and points to the promise in reducing crime incidences. We also show
an implementation of a prototype application to be used in such scenarios.
