Nowadays quantum-mechanical theory allows one to reliably calculate the
processes of 2p radioactivity (true three-body decays) and the corresponding
energy and angular correlations up to distances of the order of 1000 fm.
However, the precision of modern experiments has now become sufficient to
indicate some deficiency of the predicted theoretical distributions. In this
paper we discuss the extrapolation along the classical trajectories as a method
to improve the convergence of the theoretical energy and angular correlations
at very large distances (of the order of atomic distances), where only the
long-range Coulomb forces are still operating. The precision of this approach
is demonstrated using the "exactly" solvable semianalytical models with
simplified three-body Hamiltonians. It is also demonstrated that for heavy 2p
emitters, the 2p decay momentum distributions can be sensitive to the effect of
the screening by atomic electrons. We compare theoretical results with
available experimental data.
