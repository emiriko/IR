We investigate the continuum limit of the low lying static-light meson
spectrum using Wilson twisted mass lattice QCD with N_f = 2 dynamical quark
flavours. We consider three values of the lattice spacing a ~ 0.051 fm, 0.064
fm, 0.080 fm and various values of the pion mass in the range 280 MeV < m_PS <
640 MeV. We present results in the continuum limit for light cloud angular
momentum j = 1/2, 3/2, 5/2 and for parity P = +, -. We extrapolate our results
to physical quark masses, make predictions regarding the spectrum of B and B_s
mesons and compare with available experimental results.
