The hyperfine constants of the levels 2p2(3P)3s 4P_J, 2p2(3P)3p 4Po_J and
2p2(3P)3p 4Do_J, deduced by Jennerich et al. [Eur. Phys. J. D 40 (2006) 81]
from the observed hyperfine structures of the transitions 2p2(3P)3s 4P_J -
2p2(3P)3p 4Po_J' and 2p2(3P)3s 4P_J - 2p2(3P)3p 4Do_J' recorded by saturation
spectroscopy in the near-infrared, strongly disagree with the ab initio values
of J\"onsson et al. [J. Phys. B: At. Mol. Opt. Phys. 43 (2010) 115006]. We
propose a new interpretation of the recorded weak spectral lines. If the latter
are indeed reinterpreted as crossover signals, a new set of experimental
hyperfine constants is deduced, in very good agreement with the ab initio
predictions.
