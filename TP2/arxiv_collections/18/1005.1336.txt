Atmospheric flows exhibit self-similar fractal space-time fluctuations on all
space-time scales in association with inverse power law distribution for power
spectra of meteorological parameters such as wind, temperature, etc., and thus
implies long-range correlations, identified as self-organized criticality
generic to dynamical systems in nature. A general systems theory based on
classical statistical physical concepts developed by the author visualizes the
fractal fluctuations to result from the coexistence of eddy fluctuations in an
eddy continuum, the larger scale eddies being the integrated mean of enclosed
smaller scale eddies. The model satisfies the maximum entropy principle and
predicts that the probability distributions of component eddy amplitudes and
the corresponding variances (power spectra) are quantified by the same
universal inverse power law distribution which is a function of the golden
mean. Atmospheric particulates are held in suspension by the vertical velocity
distribution (spectrum). The atmospheric particulate size spectrum is derived
in terms of the model predicted universal inverse power law characterizing
atmospheric eddy spectrum. Model predicted spectrum is in agreement with the
following four experimentally determined data sets: (i) CIRPAS mission
TARFOX_WALLOPS_SMPS aerosol size distributions (ii) CIRPAS mission ARM-IOP
(Ponca City, OK) aerosol size distributions (iii) SAFARI 2000 CV-580 (CARG
Aerosol and Cloud Data) cloud drop size distributions and (iv) TWP-ICE (Darwin,
Australia) rain drop size distributions.
