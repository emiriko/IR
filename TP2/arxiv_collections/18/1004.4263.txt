Let g be a semisimple Lie algebra of finite dimension. The nullcone N of g is
the set of (x, y) in g\timesg such that x and y are nilpotents and are in the
same Borel subalgebra. The main result of this paper is that N is a closed and
irreducible subvariety of g \times g whose normalization has rational
singularities and such that the normalization morphism is bijective.
