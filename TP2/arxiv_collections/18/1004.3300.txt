An efficient and precise thermodynamic method to extract the interchain
coupling (IC) of spatially anisotropic 2D or 3D spin-1/2 systems from their
empirical saturation field H_s (T=0) is proposed. Using density-matrix
renormalization group, hard-core boson, and spin-wave theory we study how H_s
is affected by an antiferromagnetic (AFM) IC between frustrated chains
described in the J_1-J_2-spin model with ferromagnetic 1st and AFM 2nd neighbor
in-chain exchange. A complex 3D-phase diagram has been found. For Li2CuO2 and
Y2Ca2Cu5O10, we show that H_s is solely determined by the IC and predict H_s
approx 61 T for the latter.Using H_s approx 55 T from our high-field pulsed
measurements one reads out a weak IC for Li2CuO2 close to that from neutron
scattering.
