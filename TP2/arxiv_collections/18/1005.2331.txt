We present Herschel-SPIRE observations of the perturbed galaxy NGC4438 in the
Virgo cluster. These images reveal the presence of extra-planar dust up to ~4-5
kpc away from the galaxy's disk. The dust closely follows the distribution of
the stripped atomic and molecular hydrogen, supporting the idea that gas and
dust are perturbed in a similar fashion by the cluster environment.
Interestingly, the extra-planar dust lacks a warm temperature component when
compared to the material still present in the disk, explaining why it was
missed by previous far-infrared investigations. Our study provides evidence for
dust stripping in clusters of galaxies and illustrates the potential of
Herschel data for our understanding of environmental effects on galaxy
evolution.
