The need for integration of ontologies with nonmonotonic rules has been
gaining importance in a number of areas, such as the Semantic Web. A number of
researchers addressed this problem by proposing a unified semantics for hybrid
knowledge bases composed of both an ontology (expressed in a fragment of
first-order logic) and nonmonotonic rules. These semantics have matured over
the years, but only provide solutions for the static case when knowledge does
not need to evolve. In this paper we take a first step towards addressing the
dynamics of hybrid knowledge bases. We focus on knowledge updates and,
considering the state of the art of belief update, ontology update and rule
update, we show that current solutions are only partial and difficult to
combine. Then we extend the existing work on ABox updates with rules, provide a
semantics for such evolving hybrid knowledge bases and study its basic
properties. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that an update
operator is proposed for hybrid knowledge bases.
