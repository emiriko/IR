As shown by strains measured on full scale experimental aircraft structures,
traffic of slow-moving multiple loads leads to asymmetric transverse strains
that can be higher than longitudinal strains at the bottom of asphalt pavement
layers. To analyze this effect, a model and a software called ViscoRoute have
been developed. In these tools, the structure is represented by a multilayered
half-space, the thermo-viscoelastic behaviour of asphalt layers is accounted by
the Huet-Sayegh rheological law and loads are assumed to move at constant
speed. First, the paper presents a comparison of results obtained with
ViscoRoute to results stemming from the specialized literature. For thick
asphalt pavement and several configurations of moving loads, other ViscoRoute
simulations confirm that it is necessary to incorporate viscoelastic effects in
the modelling to well predict the pavement behaviour and to anticipate possible
damages in the structure.
