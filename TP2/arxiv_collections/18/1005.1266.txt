The lowest energy configurations of Cn(n =< 55) clusters are obtained using
the energy mini- mization technique with the conjugate gradient (CG) method
where a modified Brenner potential is invoked to describe the carbon and
hydrocarbon interaction. We found that the ground state configuration consists
of a single ring for small number of C atoms and multi-ring structures are
found with increasing n, which can be in planar, bowl-like or cap-like form.
Contrary to previous predictions, the binding energy Eb does not show even-odd
oscillations and only small jumps are found in the Eb(n) curve as a consequence
of specific types of edges or equivalently the number of secondary atoms. We
found that hydrogenation of the edge atoms may change the ground state
configuration of the nanocluster. In both cases we determined the magic
clusters. Special attention is paid to trigonal and hexagonal shaped carbon
clusters and to clusters having a graphene-like configuration. Trigonal
clusters are never the ground state, while hexagonal shaped clusters are only
the ground state when they have zigzag edges.
