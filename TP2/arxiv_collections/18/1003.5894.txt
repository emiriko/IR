Let G be a connected linear algebraic group over a field k. We say that G is
toric-friendly if for any field extension K/k and any maximal K-torus T in G
the group G(K) has only one orbit in (G/T)(K). Our main result is a
classification of semisimple (and under certain assumptions on k, of connected)
toric-friendly groups.
