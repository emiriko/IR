{\em Voyager 1} and {\em 2} data reveals that magnetic field fluctuations are
compressive and exhibit a Gaussian distribution in the compressed heliosheath
plasma, whereas they follow a lognormal distribution in a nearly incompressible
supersonic solar wind plasma. To describe the evolution of magnetic field, we
develop a nonlinear simulation model of a partially ionized plasma based on two
dimensional time-dependent multifluid model. Our model self-consistently
describes solar wind plasma ions, electrons, neutrals and pickup ions. It is
found from our simulations that the magnetic field evolution is governed by
mode conversion process that leads to the suppression of vortical modes,
whereas the compressive modes are amplified. An implication of the mode
conversion process is to quench the Alfv\'enic interactions associated with the
vortical motions. Consequently anisotropic cascades are reduced. This is
accompanied by the amplification of compressional modes that tend to isotropize
the plasma fluctuations and lead to a Gaussian distribution of the magnetic
field.
