We present an analysis of the loop-induced magnetic dipole operator in the
Randall-Sundrum model of a warped extra dimension with anarchic bulk fermions
and an IR brane localized Higgs. These operators are finite at one-loop order
and we explicitly calculate the branching ratio for mu to e gamma using the
mixed position/momentum space formalism. The particular bound on the anarchic
Yukawa and KK scales can depend on the flavor structure of the anarchic
matrices. It is possible for a generic model to either be ruled out or
unaffected by these bounds without any fine tuning. We quantify how these
models realize this surprising behavior. We also review tree-level lepton
flavor bounds in these models and show that these are are in mild tension with
the penguin bounds from typical models with a 3 TeV Kaluza-Klein scale.
Further, we illuminate the nature of the one-loop finiteness of these diagrams
and show how to accurately determine the degree of divergence of a 5D loop
diagram using both the 5D and KK formalism. This power counting can be
obfuscated in the 4D Kaluza-Klein formalism and we explicitly point out
subtleties that ensure that the two formalisms agree. Finally, we remark on the
existence of a perturbative regime in which these one-loop results give the
dominant contribution.
