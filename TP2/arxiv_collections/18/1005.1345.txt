A linearly polarized light normally incident on a semiconductor quantum well
with spin-orbit coupling may generate pure spin current via direct interband
optical transition. An electric photocurrent can be extracted from the pure
spin current when an in-plane magnetic field is applied, which has been
recently observed in the InGaAs/InAlAs quantum well [Dai et al., Phys. Rev.
Lett. 104, 246601 (2010)]. Here we present a theoretical study of this
magnetoelectric photocurrent effect associated with the interband transition.
By employing the density matrix formalism, we show that the photoexcited
carrier density has an anisotropic distribution in k space, strongly dependent
on the orientation of the electron wavevector and the polarization of the
light. This anisotropy provides an intuitive picture of the observed dependence
of the photocurrent on the magnetic field and the polarization of the light. We
also show that the ratio of the pure spin photocurrent to the magnetoelectric
photocurrent is approximately equal to the ratio of the kinetic energy to the
Zeeman energy, which enables us to estimate the magnitude of the pure spin
photocurrent. The photocurrent density calculated with the help of an
anisotropic Rashba model and the Kohn-Luttinger model can produce all three
terms in the fitting formula for measured current, with comparable order of
magnitude, but discrepancies are still present and further investigation is
needed.
