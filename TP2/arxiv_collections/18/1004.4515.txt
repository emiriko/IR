The effect of a thermal reservoir is investigated on a bipartite Gaussian
state. We derive a pre-Lindblad master equation in the non-rotating wave
approximation for the system. We then solve the master equation for a bipartite
harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian with entangled initial state. We show that for
strong damping the loss of entanglement is the same as for freely evolving
particles. However, if the damping is small, the entanglement is shown to
oscillate and eventually tend to a constant nonzero value.
