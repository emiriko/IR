This article reviews recent developments in the physics of quantized vortices
in superfluid helium and atomic Bose-Einstein condensates. Quantized vortices
appear in low-temperature quantum condensed systems as the direct product of
Bose-Einstein condensation. Quantized vortices were first discovered in
superfluid 4He in the 1950s, and have since been studied with a primary focus
on the quantum hydrodynamics of this system. Since the discovery of superfluid
3He in 1972, quantized vortices characteristic of the anisotropic superfluid
have been studied theoretically and observed experimentally using rotating
cryostats. The realization of atomic Bose-Einstein condensation in 1995 has
opened new possibilities, because it became possible to control and directly
visualize condensates and quantized vortices. Historically, many ideas
developed in superfluid 4He and 3He have been imported to the field of cold
atoms and utilized effectively. Here, we review and summarize our current
understanding of quantized vortices, bridging superfluid helium and atomic
Bose-Einstein condensates. This review article begins with a basic
introduction, which is followed by discussion of modern topics such as quantum
turbulence and vortices in unusual cold atom condensates.
