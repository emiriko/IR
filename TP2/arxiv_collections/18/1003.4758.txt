Supra-arcade downflows (SADs) have been observed with Yohkoh/SXT (soft X-rays
(SXR)), TRACE (extreme ultra-violet (EUV)), SoHO/LASCO (white light),
SoHO/SUMER (EUV spectra), and Hinode/XRT (SXR). Characteristics such as low
emissivity and trajectories which slow as they reach the top of the arcade are
consistent with post-reconnection magnetic flux tubes retracting from a
reconnection site high in the corona until they reach a lower-energy magnetic
configuration. Viewed from a perpendicular angle, SADs should appear as
shrinking loops rather than downflowing voids. We present XRT observations of
supra-arcade downflowing loops (SADLs) following a coronal mass ejection (CME)
on 2008 April 9 and show that their speeds and decelerations are consistent
with those determined for SADs. We also present evidence for a possible current
sheet observed during this flare that extends between the flare arcade and the
CME. Additionally, we show a correlation between reconnection outflows observed
with XRT and outgoing flows observed with LASCO.
