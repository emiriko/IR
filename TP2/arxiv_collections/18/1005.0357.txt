We report a comparison between two absolute gravimeters: the LNE-SYRTE cold
atoms gravimeter and FG5#220 of Leibniz Universit\"at of Hannover. They rely on
different principles of operation: atomic and optical interferometry. Both are
movable which enabled them to participated to the last International Comparison
of Absolute Gravimeters (ICAG'09) at BIPM. Immediately after, their bilateral
comparison took place in the LNE watt balance laboratory and showed an
agreement of 4.3 +/- 6.4 {\mu}Gal.
