We discuss the holographic implications of torsional degrees of freedom in
the context of AdS4/CFT3, emphasizing in particular their physical
interpretation as carriers of the non-trivial gravitational magnetic field,
i.e. the part of the gravitational magnetic field not determined by the frame
field. As a concrete example we present a new exact 4d gravitational background
with torsion and argue that it corresponds to the holographic dual of a 3d
system undergoing parity symmetry breaking. Finally, we compare our new
gravitational background with known wormhole solutions - with and without
cosmological constant - and argue that they can all be unified under an
intriguing "Kalb-Ramond superconductivity" framework.
