Carpet cloaking is proposed to hide an object on a dielectric half-space from
electromagnetic (EM) detection. A two-dimensional conformal transformation
specified by an analytic function is utilized for the design. Only one
nonsingular material parameter distribution suffices for the characterization.
The cloaking cover situates on the dielectric half-space, and consists of a
lossless upper part for EM wave redirection and an absorbing bottom layer for
inducing correct reflection coefficient and absorbing transmission. Numerical
simulations with Gaussian beam incidence are performed for verification.
