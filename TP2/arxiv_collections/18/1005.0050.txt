We present an efficient quantum entanglement distribution over an arbitrary
collective-noise channel. The basic idea in the present scheme is that two
parties in quantum communication first transmit the entangled states in the
frequency degree of freedom which suffers little from the noise in an optical
fiber. After the two parties share the photon pairs, they add some operations
and equipments to transfer the frequency entanglement of pairs into the
polarization entanglement with the success probability of 100\%. Finally, they
can get maximally entangled polarization states with polarization independent
wavelength division multiplexers and quantum frequency up-conversion which can
erase distinguishability for frequency. Compared with conventional entanglement
purification protocols, the present scheme works in a deterministic way in
principle. Surprisingly, the collective noise leads to an additional advantage.
