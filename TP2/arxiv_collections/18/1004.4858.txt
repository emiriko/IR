In this short talk we review basic ideas of string field theory with the
emphasis on the recent developments. We show how without too much technicality
one can look for analytic solutions to Witten's open string field theory. This
is an expanded version of a talk given by the author over the last year at a
number of occasions and notably at the conference "Selected Topics in
Mathematical and Particle Physics" in honor of Prof. Jiri Niederle's 70th
birthday.
