AU Mic is a young, nearby X-ray active M-dwarf with an edge-on debris disk.
Debris disk are the successors of the gaseous disks usually surrounding
pre-main sequence stars which form after the first few Myrs of their host
stars' lifetime, when - presumably - also the planet formation takes place.
Since X-ray transmission spectroscopy is sensitive to the chemical composition
of the absorber, features in the stellar spectrum of AU Mic caused by its
debris disk can in principle be detected. The upper limits we derive from our
high resolution Chandra LETGS X-ray spectroscopy are on the same order as those
from UV absorption measurements, consistent with the idea that AU Mic's debris
disk possesses an inner hole with only a very low density of sub-micron sized
grains or gas.
