Motivated by the recent experiments of Amasha {\it et al.} [Phys. Rev. B {\bf
78}, 041306(R) (2008)], we investigate single electron tunneling into an empty
quantum dot in presence of a magnetic field. We numerically calculate the
tunneling rate from a laterally confined, few-channel external lead into the
lowest orbital state of a spin-orbit coupled quantum dot. We find two
mechanisms leading to a spin-dependent tunneling rate. The first originates
from different electronic $g$-factors in the lead and in the dot, and favors
the tunneling into the spin ground (excited) state when the $g$-factor
magnitude is larger (smaller) in the lead. The second is triggered by
spin-orbit interactions via the opening of off-diagonal spin-tunneling
channels. It systematically favors the spin excited state. For physical
parameters corresponding to lateral GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures and the
experimentally reported tunneling rates, both mechanisms lead to a discrepancy
of $\sim$10% in the spin up vs spin down tunneling rates. We conjecture that
the significantly larger discrepancy observed experimentally originates from
the enhancement of the $g$-factor in laterally confined lead.
