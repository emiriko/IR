This volume contains the proceedings of the International Workshop on
Developments in Implicit Computational complExity (DICE 2010), which took place
on March 27-28 2010 in Paphos, Cyprus, as a satellite event of the Joint
European Conference on Theory and Practice of Software, ETAPS 2010.
  Implicit Computational Complexity aims at studying computational complexity
without referring to external measuring conditions or particular machine
models, but instead by considering restrictions on programming languages or
logical principles implying complexity properties. The aim of this workshop was
to bring together researchers working on implicit computational complexity,
from its logical and semantical aspects to those related to the static analysis
of programs, so as to foster their interaction and to give newcomers an
overview of the current trends in this area.
