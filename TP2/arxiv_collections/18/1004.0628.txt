We study the fractional gravity for spacetimes with non-integer dimensions.
Our constructions are based on a geometric formalism with the fractional Caputo
derivative and integral calculus adapted to nonolonomic distributions. This
allows us to define a fractional spacetime geometry with fundamental
geometric/physical objects and a generalized tensor calculus all being similar
to respective integer dimension constructions. Such models of fractional
gravity mimic the Einstein gravity theory and various Lagrange-Finsler and
Hamilton-Cartan generalizations in nonholonomic variables. The approach
suggests a number of new implications for gravity and matter field theories
with singular, stochastic, kinetic, fractal, memory etc processes. We prove
that the fractional gravitational field equations can be integrated in very
general forms following the anholonomic deformation method for constructing
exact solutions. Finally, we study some examples of fractional black hole
solutions, fractional ellipsoid gravitational configurations and imbedding of
such objects in fractional solitonic backgrounds.
