Here we report the structural, electrical and magnetic properties of Fe doped
La0.7Ca0.3Mn1-xFexO3 with x = 0.0 to 1.0 prepared by conventional solid state
reaction method. Simulated data on XRD shows an increase in volume with an
increase in Fe ion concentration. XPS supports that Fe3+ ions directly
substitute Mn3+ ions. Shifting towards lower wave-number and symmetric IR band
structure confirms increase in volume and homogeneous distribution of Fe ions.
Fe ion doesn't contribute in double-exchange (DE) conduction mechanism due to
its stable half filled 3d orbital. The presence of Fe3+ ions encourages
anti-ferromagnetism (AFM) generated by super-exchange interaction and suppress
insulator-metal transition temperature (TIM). Magnetic measurements show the
existence of magnetic polarons supported by increase in volume of unit cell and
deviation from Curie-Weiss law.
