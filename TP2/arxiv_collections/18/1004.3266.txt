We explore the consequences of assuming that the neutrino mass matrix is a
linear combination of the matrices of a three dimensional representation of the
group $S_3$ and that it has one zero mass eigenvalue. When implemented, these
two assumptions allow us to express the transformation matrix relating the mass
eigenstates to the flavor eigenstates in terms of a single parameter which we
fit to the available data.
