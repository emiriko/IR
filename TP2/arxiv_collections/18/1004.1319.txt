We present a measurement of the slope parameter $\alpha$ for the $\eta\to
3\pi^{0}$ decay, with the KLOE experiment at the DA$\Phi$NE $\phi$-factory,
based on a background free sample of $\sim$ 17 millions $\eta$ mesons produced
in $\phi$ radiative decays. By fitting the event density in the Dalitz plot we
determine $\alpha = -0.0301 \pm 0.0035\,stat\;_{-0.0035}^{+0.0022}\,syst\,$.
The result is in agreement with recent measurements from hadro- and
photo-production experiments.
