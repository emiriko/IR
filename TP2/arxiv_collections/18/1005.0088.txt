An efficient low-order scaling method is presented for large-scale electronic
structure calculations based on the density functional theory using localized
basis functions, which directly computes selected elements of the density
matrix by a contour integration of the Green function evaluated with a nested
dissection approach for resultant sparse matrices. The computational effort of
the method scales as O($N(\log_2N)^2$), O($N^{2}$), and O($N^{7/3}$) for one,
two, and three dimensional systems, respectively, where $N$ is the number of
basis functions. Unlike O($N$) methods developed so far the approach is a
numerically exact alternative to conventional O($N^{3}$) diagonalization
schemes in spite of the low-order scaling, and can be applicable to not only
insulating but also metallic systems in a single framework. It is also
demonstrated that the nested algorithm and the well separated data structure
are suitable for the massively parallel computation, which enables us to extend
the applicability of density functional calculations for large-scale systems
together with the low-order scaling.
