We propose a spontaneous A4 flavor symmetry breaking scheme implemented in a
warped extra dimensional setup to explain the observed pattern of quark and
lepton masses and mixings. The main advantages of this choice are the
explanation of fermion mass hierarchies by wave function overlaps, the
emergence of tribimaximal neutrino mixing and zero quark mixing at the leading
order and the absence of tree-level gauge mediated flavor violations. Quark
mixing is induced by the presence of bulk flavons, which allow for cross-brane
interactions and a cross-talk between the quark and neutrino sectors, realizing
the spontaneous symmetry breaking pattern A4 --> nothing first proposed in
[X.G.\,He, Y.Y.\,Keum, R.R.\,Volkas, JHEP{0604}, 039 (2006)]. We show that the
observed quark mixing pattern can be explained in a rather economical way,
including the CP violating phase, with leading order cross-interactions, while
the observed difference between the smallest CKM entries V_{ub} and V_{td} must
arise from higher order corrections. We briefly discuss bounds on the
Kaluza-Klein scale implied by flavor changing neutral current processes in our
model and show that the residual little CP problem is milder than in flavor
anarchic models.
