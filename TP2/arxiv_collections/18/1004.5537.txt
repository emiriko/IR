We study the evolutionary dynamics of a maladapted population of
self-replicating sequences on strongly correlated fitness landscapes. Each
sequence is assumed to be composed of blocks of equal length and its fitness is
given by a linear combination of four independent block fitnesses. A mutation
affects the fitness contribution of a single block leaving the other blocks
unchanged and hence inducing correlations between the parent and mutant
fitness. On such strongly correlated fitness landscapes, we calculate the
dynamical properties like the number of jumps in the most populated sequence
and the temporal distribution of the last jump which is shown to exhibit a
inverse square dependence as in evolution on uncorrelated fitness landscapes.
We also obtain exact results for the distribution of records and extremes for
correlated random variables.
