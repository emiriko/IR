We point out that there are regions in the MSSM parameter space which
successfully provide a dark matter (DM) annihilation explanation for observed
positron excess (e.g. PAMELA), while still remaining in agreement with all
other data sets. Such regions (e.g. the uplifted Higgs region) can realize an
enhanced neutralino DM annihilation dominantly into leptons via a Breit-Wigner
resonance through the CP-odd Higgs channel. Such regions can give the proper
thermal relic DM abundance, and the DM annihilation products are compatible
with current antiproton and gamma ray observations. This scenario can succeed
without introducing any additional degrees of freedom beyond those already in
the MSSM.
