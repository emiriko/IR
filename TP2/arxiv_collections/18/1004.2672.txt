New dynamical mechanism of quark mass generations and mixing is demonstrated
in the examples of three and four generations. In the framework of the new
mixing pattern, called the coherent mixing, the CKM elements are predicted
compatible with experimental data for three generations, and are strongly
constrained for four generations.
