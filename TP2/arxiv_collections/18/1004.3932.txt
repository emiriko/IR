Accurate immunological models offer the possibility of performing
highthroughput experiments in silico that can predict, or at least suggest, in
vivo phenomena. In this chapter, we compare various models of immunological
memory. We first validate an experimental immunological simulator, developed by
the authors, by simulating several theories of immunological memory with known
results. We then use the same system to evaluate the predicted effects of a
theory of immunological memory. The resulting model has not been explored
before in artificial immune systems research, and we compare the simulated in
silico output with in vivo measurements. Although the theory appears valid, we
suggest that there are a common set of reasons why immunological memory models
are a useful support tool; not conclusive in themselves.
