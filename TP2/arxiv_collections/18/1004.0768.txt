Recent experiments demonstrate that a ballistic version of spin resonance,
mediated by spin-orbit interaction, can be induced in narrow channels of a
high-mobility GaAs two-dimensional electron gas by matching the spin precession
frequency with the frequency of bouncing trajectories in the channel. Contrary
to the typical suppression of Dyakonov-Perel' spin relaxation in confined
geometries, the spin relaxation rate increases by orders of magnitude on
resonance. Here, we present Monte Carlo simulations of this effect to explore
the roles of varying degrees of disorder and strength of spin-orbit
interaction. These simulations help to extract quantitative spin-orbit
parameters from experimental measurements of ballistic spin resonance, and may
guide the development of future spintronic devices.
