A string-inspired 3-form-dilaton-gravity model is studied in a
Randall-Sundrum brane world scenario. As expected, the rank-3 antisymmetric
field is exponentially suppressed. For each mass level, the mass spectrum is
bigger than the one for the Kalb-Ramond field. The coupling between the dilaton
and the massless Kaluza-Klein mode of the 3-form is calculated and the coupling
constant of the cubic interactions obtained numerically. This coupling are of
the order of Tev$^{-1}$, therefore there exist a possibility to find some
signal of it at Tev scale.
