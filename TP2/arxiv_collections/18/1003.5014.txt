We present a simple one-dimensional quantum-mechanical model for a particle
attached to a surface. We solve the Schr\"odinger equation in terms of Weber
functions and discuss the behavior of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. We
derive the virial theorem and other exact relationships as well as the
asymptotic behaviour of the eigenvalues. We calculate the zero-point energy for
model parameters corresponding to H adsorbed on Pd(100) and also outline the
application of the Rayleigh-Ritz variational method.
