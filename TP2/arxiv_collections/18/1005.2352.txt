It is discovered in our previous work that different observational
systematics, e.g., errors of antenna pointing directions, asynchronous between
the attitude and science data, can generate pseudo-dipole signal in full-sky
maps of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy published by The
Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) team. Now the antenna sidelobe
response to the Doppler signal is found to be able to produce similar effect as
well. In this work, independent to the sources, we uniformly model the
pseudo-dipole signal and remove it from published WMAP7 CMB maps by model
fitting. The result demonstrates that most of the released WMAP CMB quadrupole
is artificial.
