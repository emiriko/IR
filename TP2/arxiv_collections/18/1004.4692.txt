If dark matter in the galactic halo is composed of bosons that form a
Bose-Einstein condensate then it is likely that the rotation of the halo will
lead to the nucleation of vortices. After a review of the Gross-Pitaevskii
equation, the Thomas-Fermi approximation and vortices in general, we consider
vortices in detail. We find strong bounds for the boson mass, interaction
strength, the shape and quantity of vortices in the halo, the critical
rotational velocity for the nucleation of vortices and, in the Thomas-Fermi
regime, an exact solution for the mass density of a single, axisymmetric
vortex.
