The motion of a finite number of point vortices on a two-dimensional periodic
domain is considered. In the deterministic case it is known to be well posed
only for almost every initial configuration. Coalescence of vortices may occur
for certain initial conditions. We prove that when a generic stochastic
perturbation compatible with the Eulerian description is introduced, the point
vortex motion becomes well posed for every initial configuration, in particular
coalescence disappears.
