We study the generation of magnetic field in Higgs-inflation models where the
Standard Model Higgs boson has a large coupling to the Ricci scalar. We couple
the Higgs field to the Electromagnetic fields via a non- renormalizable
dimension six operator suppressed by the Planck scale in the Jordan frame. We
show that during Higgs inflation magnetic fields with present value $10^{-6}$
Gauss and comoving coherence length of $100 kpc$ can be generated in the
Einstein frame. The problem of large back-reaction which is generic in the
usual inflation models of magneto-genesis is avoided as the back-reaction is
suppressed by the large Higgs-curvature coupling.
