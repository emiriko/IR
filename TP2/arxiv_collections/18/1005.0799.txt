In this work, we report a novel technique in lattice QCD for studying the
high momentum-transfer region of nucleon form factors. These calculations could
give important theoretical input to experiments, such as those of JLab's 12-GeV
program and studies of nucleon deformation. There is an extensive history of
form-factor calculations on the lattice, primarily with ground states for both
the initial and final state. However, determining form factors at large
momentum transfer ($Q^2$) has been difficult due to large statistical and
systematic errors in this regime. We study the nucleon form factors using three
pion masses with both quenched and 2+1-flavor anisotropic lattice
configurations with $Q^2$ as large as $6 GeV^2$. These form factors are further
processed to obtain transverse charge and magnetization densities across
2-dimensional impact-parameter space. Our approach can be applied to isotropic
lattices and lattices with smaller lattice spacing to calculate even
larger-$Q^2$ form factors.
