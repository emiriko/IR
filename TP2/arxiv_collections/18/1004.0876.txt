We present a complete next-to-leading order (NLO) QCD calculation to a heavy
resonance production and decay into a top quark pair at the LHC, where the
resonance could be either a Randall-Sundrum (RS) Kaluza-Klein (KK) graviton $G$
or an extra gauge boson $Z'$. The complete NLO QCD corrections can enhance the
total cross sections by about $80\%- 100\%$ and $20\%- 40\%$ for the $G$ and
the $Z'$, respectively, depending on the resonance mass. We also explore in
detail the NLO corrections to the polar angle distributions of the top quark,
and our results show that the shapes of the NLO distributions can be different
from the leading order (LO) ones for the KK graviton. Moreover, we study the
NLO corrections to the spin correlations of the top quark pair production via
the above process, and find that the corrections are small.
