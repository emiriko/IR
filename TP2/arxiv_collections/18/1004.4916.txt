Although they are but a small fraction of the mass ejected in core-collapse
supernovae, neutrino-driven winds (NDWs) from nascent proto-neutron stars
(PNSs) have the potential to contribute significantly to supernova
nucleosynthesis. In previous works, the NDW has been implicated as a possible
source of r-process and light p-process isotopes. In this paper we present
time-dependent hydrodynamic calculations of nucleosynthesis in the NDW which
include accurate weak interaction physics coupled to a full nuclear reaction
network. Using two published models of PNS neutrino luminosities, we predict
the contribution of the NDW to the integrated nucleosynthetic yield of the
entire supernova. For the neutrino luminosity histories considered, no true
r-process occurs in the most basic scenario. The wind driven from an older $1.4
M_\odot$ model for a PNS is moderately neutron-rich at late times however, and
produces $^{87}$Rb, $^{88}$Sr, $^{89}$Y, and $^{90}$Zr in near solar
proportions relative to oxygen. The wind from a more recently studied $1.27
M_\odot$ PNS is proton-rich throughout its entire evolution and does not
contribute significantly to the abundance of any element. It thus seems very
unlikely that the simplest model of the NDW can produce the r-process. At most,
it contributes to the production of the N = 50 closed shell elements and some
light p-nuclei. In doing so, it may have left a distinctive signature on the
abundances in metal poor stars, but the results are sensitive to both uncertain
models for the explosion and the masses of the neutron stars involved.
