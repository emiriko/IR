The observed enhancement of $p\bar p$-production near the threshold in
radiative decays of $J/\psi$ and $e^+e^-$-annihilations can be explained with
final state interactions among the produced $N\bar N$ system, where the
enhancement is essentially determined by $N\bar N$ elastic scattering
amplitudes. We propose to use an effective theory for interactions in a $N\bar
N$ system near its threshold. The effective theory is similar to the well-known
one for interactions in a $NN$ system but with distinctions. It is interesting
to note that in the effective theory some corrections to scattering amplitudes
at tree-level can systematically be summed into a simple form. These
corrections are from rescattering processes. With these corrected amplitudes we
are able to describe the enhancement near the threshold in radiative decays of
$J/\psi$ and $e^+e^-$-annihilations, and the $p\bar p$ elastic scattering near
the threshold.
