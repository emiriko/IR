We propose and analyze a new approach to generate a broadband astro-comb by
spectral broadening of a narrowband astro-comb inside a highly nonlinear
optical fiber. Numerical modeling shows that cascaded four-wave-mixing
dramatically degrades the input comb's side-mode suppression and causes
side-mode amplitude asymmetry. These two detrimental effects can systematically
shift the center-of-gravity of astro-comb spectral lines as measured by an
astrophysical spectrograph with resolution \approx100,000; and thus lead to
wavelength calibration inaccuracy and instability. Our simulations indicate
that this performance penalty, as a result of nonlinear spectral broadening,
can be compensated by using a filtering cavity configured for double-pass. As
an explicit example, we present a design based on an Yb-fiber source comb (with
1 GHz repetition rate) that is filtered by double-passing through a low finesse
cavity (finesse = 208), and subsequent spectrally broadened in a 2-cm,
SF6-glass photonic crystal fiber. Spanning more than 300 nm with 16 GHz line
spacing, the resulting astro-comb is predicted to provide 1 cm/s (~10 kHz)
radial velocity calibration accuracy for an astrophysical spectrograph. Such
extreme performance will be necessary for the search for and characterization
of Earth-like extra-solar planets, and in direct measurements of the change of
the rate of cosmological expansion.
