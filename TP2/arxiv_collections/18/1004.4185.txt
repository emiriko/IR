Investigating the anisotropy of superconductors permits an access to
fundamental properties. Having succeeded in the fabrication of epitaxial
superconducting LaFeAs(O,F) thin films we performed an extensive study of
electrical transport properties. In face of multiband superconductivity we can
demonstrate that a Blatter scaling of the angular dependent critical current
densities can be adopted, although being originally developed for single band
superconductors. In contrast to single band superconductors the mass anisotropy
of LaFeAs(O,F) is temperature dependent. A very steep increase of the upper
critical field and the irreversibility field can be observed at temperatures
below 6K, indicating that the band with the smaller gap is in the dirty limit.
This temperature dependence can be theoretically described by two dominating
bands responsible for superconductivity. A pinning force scaling provides
insight into the prevalent pinning mechanism and can be specified in terms of
the Kramer model.
