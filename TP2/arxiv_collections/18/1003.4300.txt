We consider the dispersion correction to elastic parity violating
electron-proton scattering due to \gammaZ exchange. In a recent publication,
this correction was reported to be substantially larger than the previous
estimates. In this paper, we study the dispersion correction in greater detail.
We confirm the size of the disperion correction to be 6% for the QWEAK
experiment designed to measure the proton weak charge. We enumerate parameters
that have to be constrained to better than relative 30% in order to keep the
theoretical uncertainty for QWEAK under control.
