In this paper the long time behaviour of the solutions of 3-D strongly damped
wave equation is studied. It is shown that the semigroup generated by this
equation possesses a global attractor in H_{0}^{1}(\Omega)\times L_{2}(\Omega)
and then it is proved that this global attractor is a bounded subset of
H^{2}(\Omega)\times H^{2}(\Omega) and also a global attractor in
H^{2}(\Omega)\cap H_{0}^{1}(\Omega)\times H_{0}^{1}(\Omega).
