We show that shortfall risks of American options in a sequence of multinomial
approximations of the multidimensional Black--Scholes (BS) market converge to
the corresponding quantities for similar American options in the
multidimensional BS market with path dependent payoffs. In comparison to
previous papers we consider the multi assets case for which we use the weak
convergence approach.
