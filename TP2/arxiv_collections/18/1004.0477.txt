In recent years we have witnessed a move of the major industrial automation
providers into the wireless domain. While most of these companies already offer
wireless products for measurement and monitoring purposes, the ultimate goal is
to be able to close feedback loops over wireless networks interconnecting
sensors, computation devices, and actuators. In this paper we present a
decentralized event-triggered implementation, over sensor/actuator networks, of
centralized nonlinear controllers. Event-triggered control has been recently
proposed as an alternative to the more traditional periodic execution of
control tasks. In a typical event-triggered implementation, the control signals
are kept constant until the violation of a condition on the state of the plant
triggers the re-computation of the control signals. The possibility of reducing
the number of re-computations, and thus of transmissions, while guaranteeing
desired levels of performance makes event-triggered control very appealing in
the context of sensor/actuator networks. In these systems the communication
network is a shared resource and event-triggered implementations of control
laws offer a flexible way to reduce network utilization. Moreover reducing the
number of times that a feedback control law is executed implies a reduction in
transmissions and thus a reduction in energy expenditures of battery powered
wireless sensor nodes.
