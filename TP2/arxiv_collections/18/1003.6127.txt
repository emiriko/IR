We consider the effect of lensing magnification on high redshift sources in
the case that magnification varies on the sky, as expected in wide fields of
view or within observed galaxy clusters. We give expressions for number counts,
flux and flux variance as integrals over the probability distribution of the
magnification. We obtain these through a simple mapping between averages over
the observed sky and over the magnification probability distribution in the
source plane. Our results clarify conflicting expressions in the literature and
can be used to calculate a variety of magnification effects. We highlight two
applications: 1. Lensing of high-z galaxies by galaxy clusters can provide the
dominant source of scatter in SZ observations at frequencies larger than the SZ
null. 2. The number counts of high-z galaxies with a Schechter-like luminosity
function will be changed at high luminosities to a power law, with significant
enhancement of the observed counts at L > 10 L*.
