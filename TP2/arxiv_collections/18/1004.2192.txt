We study the global existence and regularity of solutions for a system
describing the evolution of a nematic liquid crystal fluid. The fluid is
described by a system that couples a forced Navier-Stokes system with a
parabolic-type system. In our previous work, \cite{pz1}, we assumed that a
certain parameter, $\xi$, is zero, which had the effect of cancelling certain
terms. In the current work we do not make this assumption and study the full
system, observing that the presence of these additional terms has a non-trivial
effect, namely the quadruply exponential increase of the high norms. We also
estimate differently certain terms already existent in the simplified system
and improve the estimates in \cite{pz1}. We prove the existence of global weak
solutions in dimensions two and three. In dimension two we prove the higher
regularity of solutions and show that the high norms increase in time at most
quadruply exponential. We also show the weak-strong uniqueness in dimension
two.
