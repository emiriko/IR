We study four dimensional field theory from the low-energy effective theory
of Type I, II or heterotic string theories. Chiral fermions in four dimensions
are obtained by several mechanisms. Especially, the background flux is one of
the most interesting mechanisms for obtaining four dimensional chiral theories.
Chiral matter fields have localized wavefunctions on extra dimensions. We
discuss about the relations between background flux and low-energy spectra
which are counted by their zero-modes. Yukawa couplings are free parameters in
the standard model and may be related to the underlying physics. In the string
theory or its low-energy limit, they are determined by overlap integral of
wavefunctions on extra dimensions. We also study the higher order couplings
based on the field theoretical approach. From the analysis of generic n-point
couplings, we can discuss about flavor structures. We find that in such a
construction some discrete flavor symmetries appear in the four dimensional
effective theory. Their phenomenological implications are discussed.
Furthermore we extend these constructions to orbifold background. Magnetic flux
still plays an important role and leads to various types of low-energy spectra
different from that of toroidal compactifications. The orbifold models with
heterotic string are also investigated.
