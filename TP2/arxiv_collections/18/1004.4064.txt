It is shown that Newtonian mechanics is not appropriate to compute
approximate individual trajectories with small velocities in chaotic
scattering. However, some global properties of the dynamical system, such as
the dimension of the non-attracting chaotic invariant set, are more robust and
the Newtonian approximation provides reasonably accurate results for them in
slow chaotic scattering.
