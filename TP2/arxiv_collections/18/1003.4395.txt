We show how taking into account the kinematical effect of extra dimensions
can have a significant impact on the gravity wave emission from cosmic strings.
Additional dimensions both round off cusps, as well as reduce the probability
of their formation. We recompute the cusp gravity wave burst with these factors
and find a significant dimension dependent damping of the gravity waves.
