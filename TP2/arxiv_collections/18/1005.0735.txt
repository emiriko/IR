The structure and microstrucutre of fully-strained BiCrO3 thin films have
been investigated by X-rays diffraction and transmission electron microscopy,
at room temperature. Interestingly, three structural variants are
simultaneously stabilized within the film. While txo of them are consistent
with the existing phases in the bulk-below and above the 420 K structural
transition, a different phase is identified. The existence of various
structures has been attributed to the inhomogeneous distribution of local
strains and oxygens resulting from a minimization of the strain-energy at the
interface. These findings will open the route to a better understanding of
Bi-based perovskites and metastable phases.
