The non-Gaussian distribution of primordial perturbations has the potential
to reveal the physical processes at work in the very early Universe. Local
models provide a well-defined class of non-Gaussian distributions that arise
naturally from the non-linear evolution of density perturbations on
super-Hubble scales starting from Gaussian field fluctuations during inflation.
I describe the delta-N formalism used to calculate the primordial density
perturbation on large scales and then review several models for the origin of
local primordial non-Gaussianity, including the cuvaton, modulated reheating
and ekpyrotic scenarios. I include an appendix with a table of sign conventions
used in specific papers.
