We present a consistent 3D model for the head-tail radio galaxy NGC 1265 that
explains the complex radio morphology and spectrum by a past passage of the
galaxy and radio bubble through a shock wave. Using analytical solutions to the
full Riemann problem and hydrodynamical simulations, we study how this passage
transformed the plasma bubble into a toroidal vortex ring. Adiabatic
compression of the aged electron population causes it to be energized and to
emit low-surface brightness and steep-spectrum radio emission. The large infall
velocity of NGC 1265 and the low Faraday rotation measure values and variance
of the jet strongly argue that this transformation was due to the accretion
shock onto Perseus situated roughly at R_200. Estimating the volume change of
the radio bubble enables inferring a shock Mach number of M =
4.2_{-1.2}^{+0.8}, a density jump of 3.4_{-0.4}^{+0.2}, a temperature jump of
6.3_{-2.7}^{+2.5}, and a pressure jump of 21.5 +/- 10.5 while allowing for
uncertainties in the equation of state of the radio plasma and volume of the
torus. Extrapolating X-ray profiles, we obtain upper limits on the gas
temperature and density in the infalling warm-hot intergalactic medium of kT <
0.4 keV and n < 5e-5 / cm^3. The orientation of the ellipsoidally shaped radio
torus in combination with the direction of the galaxy's head and tail in the
plane of the sky is impossible to reconcile with projection effects. Instead,
this argues for post-shock shear flows that have been caused by curvature in
the shock surface with a characteristic radius of 850 kpc. The energy density
of the shear flow corresponds to a turbulent-to-thermal energy density of 14%.
The shock-injected vorticity might be important in generating and amplifying
magnetic fields in galaxy clusters. Future LOFAR observations of head-tail
galaxies can be complementary probes of accretion shocks onto galaxy clusters.
