The aim of this article is to review the recent developments in the
phenomenology of quantum gravity at the Large Hadron Collider. We shall pay
special attention to four-dimensional models which are able to lower the
reduced Planck mass to the TeV region and compare them to models with a large
extra-dimensional volume. We then turn our attention to reviewing the emission
of gravitons (massless or massive) at the LHC and to the production of small
quantum black holes.
