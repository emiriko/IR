We report an experimental realization of an atomic vapor quantum memory for
the photonic po- larization qubit. The performance of the quantum memory for
the polarization qubit, realized with electromagnetically-induced transparency
in two spatially separated ensembles of warm Rubidium atoms in a single vapor
cell, has been characterized with quantum process tomography. The process
fidelity better than 0.91 for up to 16 \mu s of storage time has been achieved.
