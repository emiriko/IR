We outline some of Chris Wallace's contributions to pseudo-random number
generation. In particular, we consider his idea for generating normally
distributed variates without relying on a source of uniform random numbers, and
compare it with more conventional methods for generating normal random numbers.
Implementations of Wallace's idea can be very fast (approximately as fast as
good uniform generators). We discuss the statistical quality of the output, and
mention how certain pitfalls can be avoided.
