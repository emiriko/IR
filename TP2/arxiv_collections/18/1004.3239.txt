We propose a closure model for the transport of entropy and momentum in
astrophysical turbulence, intended for application to rotating stellar
convective regions. Our closure model is first presented in the Boussinesq
formalism, and compared with laboratory and numerical experimental results on
Rayleigh-Benard convection and Homogeneous Rayleigh-Benard convection. The
predicted angular momentum transport properties of the turbulence in the slowly
rotating case recover the well-known Lambda-effect, with an amplitude uniquely
related to the convective heat flux. The model is then extended to the
anelastic case as well as the fully compressible case. In the special case of
spherical symmetry, the predicted radial heat flux is equivalent to that of
mixing-length theory. For rotating stars, our model describes the coupled
transport of heat and angular momentum, and provides a unified formalism in
which to study both differential rotation and thermal inhomogeneities in
stellar convection zones.
