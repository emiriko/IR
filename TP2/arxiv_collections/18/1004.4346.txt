We study the screening of the Coulomb interaction in a quasi one-dimensional
superconductor given by the presence of either a one- or a two-dimensional
non-interacting electron gas. To that end, we derive an effective low-energy
phase-only action, which amounts to treating the Coulomb and superconducting
correlations in the random-phase approximation. We concentrate on the study of
dissipation effects in the superconductor, induced by the effect of Coulomb
coupling to the diffusive density-modes in the metal, and study its
consequences on the static and dynamic conductivity. Our results point towards
the importance of the dimensionality of the screening metal in the behavior of
the superconducting plasma mode of the wire at low energies. In absence of
topological defects, and when the screening is given by a one-dimensional
electron gas, the superconducting plasma mode is completely damped in the limit
$q\to 0$, and consequently superconductivity is lost in the wire. In contrast,
we recover a Drude-response in the conductivity when the screening is provided
by a two-dimensional electron gas.
