We present SUSY_FLAVOR -- a Fortran 77 program that calculates important
leptonic and semi-leptonic low-energy observables in the general R-parity
conserving MSSM. For a set of input MSSM parameters, the code gives predictions
for the K0-bar K0, D-bar D, B_d-bar B_d and B_s-bar B_s mixing parameters; B to
X_s gamma, B_{s,d} to l+ l-, K0_L to pi nu-bar nu and K+ to pi+ nu-bar nu decay
branching ratios; and the electric dipole moments of the leptons and the
neutron. All these quantities are calculated at one-loop level (with some
higher-order QCD corrections included) in the exact sfermion mass eigenbasis,
without resorting to mass insertion approximations.
