Magnetic anisotropies of Co-implanted ZnO (0001) films grown on
single-crystalline Al2O3 (11-20) substrates have been studied by ferromagnetic
resonance (FMR) technique for different cobalt implantation doses. The FMR data
show that the easy and hard axes have a periodicity of 60 degrees in the film
plane, in agreement with the hexagonal structure of the ZnO films. This
six-fold in-plane magnetic anisotropy, which is observed for the first time in
ZnO-based diluted magnetic semiconductors, is attributed to the substitution of
cobalt on Zn sites in the ZnO structure, and a clear indication for long range
ferromagnetic ordering between substitutional cobalt ions in the
single-crystalline ZnO films.
