We calculate the magnetic and quasiparticle excitation spectra of an
itinerant $J_1-J_2$ model for iron pnictides. In addition to an acoustic
spin-wave branch, the magnetic spectrum has a second, optical branch, resulting
from the coupled four-sublattice magnetic structure. The spin-wave velocity has
also a planar directional anisotropy, due to the collinear/striped
antiferromagnetism. Within the magnetically ordered phase, the quasiparticle
spectrum is composed of two Dirac cones, resulting from the folding of the
magnetic Brillouin zone. We discuss the relevance of our findings to the
understanding of both neutron scattering and photoemission spectroscopy results
for SrFe$_{2}$As$_{2}$.
