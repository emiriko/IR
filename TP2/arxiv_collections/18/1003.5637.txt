We investigate the new agegraphic dark energy scenario in a universe governed
by Horava-Lifshitz gravity. We consider both the detailed and non-detailed
balanced version of the theory, we impose an arbitrary curvature, and we allow
for an interaction between the matter and dark energy sectors. Extracting the
differential equation for the evolution of the dark energy density parameter
and performing an expansion of the dark energy equation-of-state parameter, we
calculate its present and its low-redshift value as functions of the dark
energy and curvature density parameters at present, of the Horava-Lifshitz
running parameter $\lambda$, of the new agegraphic dark energy parameter $n$,
and of the interaction coupling $b$. We find that $w_0=-0.82^{+0.08}_{-0.08}$
and $w_1=0.08^{+0.09}_{-0.07}$. Although this analysis indicates that the
scenario can be compatible with observations, it does not enlighten the
discussion about the possible conceptual and theoretical problems of
Horava-Lifshitz gravity.
