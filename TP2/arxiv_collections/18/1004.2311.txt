To date transport measurements of topological insulators have been dominated
by the conductivity of the bulk, leading to substantial difficulties in
resolving the properties of the surface. To this end, we use high magnetic
field, rf- and microwave-spectroscopy to selectively couple to the surface
conductivity of Bi$_2$Se$_3$ at high frequency. In the frequency range of a few
GHz we observe a crossover from quantum oscillations indicative of a small 3D
Fermi surface, to cyclotron resonance indicative of a 2D surface state.
