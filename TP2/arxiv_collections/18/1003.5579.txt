Large dynamic range room temperature photon number resolving (PNR) detectors
can be very useful for measuring very low light intensities and for analyzing
multiphoton quantum states. In this paper we present a PNR detector based on
the up-conversion (UC) of telecom signal into visible wavelength and on its
detection by a thermoelectrically cooled multi-pixel silicon avalanche
photodiodode (APD), also known as Silicon Photon Multiplier (SiPM). An
efficiency of 4% is attained and the poissonian statistics of input coherent
states is maintained up to approximately 20 simultaneous detections. The
cross-talk effects on the detected signal are estimated in order to properly
calibrate the detector. This scheme can be used at arbitrary wavelengths above
the visible spectral window with appropriate up-conversion.
