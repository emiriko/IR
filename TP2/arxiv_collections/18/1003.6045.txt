Statistical analysis of the data series from 1856 to 2000 for the annual
global and hemispheric surface air temperature anomalies is completed.
Statistically significant correlations are found between global and hemispheric
temperature anomalies and solar and geomagnetic indices. The temperature
anomalies in the Northern and Southern hemispheres show similar statistical
relations with the solar and geomagnetic indices. The cross-correlation
analysis shows no statistically significant global temperature lag behind the
sunspots as well as behind aa-indices. The correlation between the temperature
anomalies and the geomagnetic indices is about two times higher than the
correlation between the temperature anomalies and the solar indices. These
results support the suggestion that the geomagnetic forcing predominates over
the solar activity forcing on the global and hemispheric surface air
temperatures.
