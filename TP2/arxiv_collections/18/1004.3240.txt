It is shown that the equations of relativistic Bohmian mechanics for multiple
bosonic particles have a dual description in terms of a classical theory of
conformally "curved" space-time. This shows that it is possible to formulate
quantum mechanics as a purely classical geometrical theory. The results are
further generalized to interactions with an external electromagnetic field.
