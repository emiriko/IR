We elaborate an interpretation of quantum physics founded on the hypothesis
that quantum particles are conceptual entities playing the role of
communication vehicles between material entities composed of ordinary matter
which function as memory structures for these quantum particles. We show in
which way this new interpretation gives rise to a natural explanation for the
quantum effects of interference and entanglement by analyzing how interference
and entanglement emerge for the case of human concepts. We put forward a scheme
to derive a metric based on similarity as a predecessor for the structure of
'space, time, momentum, energy' and 'quantum particles interacting with
ordinary matter' underlying standard quantum physics, within the new
interpretation, and making use of aspects of traditional quantum axiomatics.
More specifically, we analyze how the effect of non-locality arises as a
consequence of the confrontation of such an emerging metric type of structure
and the remaining presence of the basic conceptual structure on the fundamental
level, with the potential of being revealed in specific situations.
