Aims: We test predictions of evolution models on mixing of CNO-cycled
products in massive stars from a fundamental perspective. Relative changes
within the theoretical C:N:O abundance ratios and the buildup of helium are
compared with observational results. Methods: A sample of well-studied Galactic
massive stars is presented. High-quality optical spectra are carefully analysed
using improved NLTE line-formation and comprehensive analysis strategies. The
results are put in the context of the existing literature data. Results: A
tight trend in the observed N/C vs. N/O ratios and the buildup of helium is
found from the self-consistent analysis of main-sequence to supergiant stars
for the first time. The catalytic nature of the CNO-cycles is confirmed
quantitatively, though further investigations are required to derive a fully
consistent picture. Our observational results support the case of strong
mixing, as predicted e.g. by evolution models that consider magnetic fields or
by models that have gone through the first dredge-up in the case of many
supergiants.
