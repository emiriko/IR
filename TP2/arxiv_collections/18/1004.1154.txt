Energetic electrons of up to tens of MeV are created during explosive
phenomena in the solar corona. While many theoretical models consider magnetic
reconnection as a possible way of generating energetic electrons, the precise
roles of magnetic reconnection during acceleration and heating of electrons
still remain unclear. Here we show from 2D particle-in-cell simulations that
coalescence of magnetic islands that naturally form as a consequence of tearing
mode instability and associated magnetic reconnection leads to efficient
energization of electrons. The key process is the secondary magnetic
reconnection at the merging points, or the `anti-reconnection', which is, in a
sense, driven by the converging outflows from the initial magnetic reconnection
regions. By following the trajectories of the most energetic electrons, we
found a variety of different acceleration mechanisms but the energization at
the anti-reconnection is found to be the most important process. We discuss
possible applications to the energetic electrons observed in the solar flares.
We anticipate our results to be a starting point for more sophisticated models
of particle acceleration during the explosive energy release phenomena.
