We present the first results of the ongoing Canada-France Brown Dwarfs
Survey-InfraRed, hereafter CFBDSIR, a Near InfraRed extension to the optical
wide-field survey CFBDS. Our final objectives are to constrain ultracool
atmosphere physics by finding a statistically significant sample of objects
cooler than 650K and to explore the ultracool brown dwarf mass function
building on a well defined sample of such objects. Candidates are identified in
CFHT/WIRCam J and CFHT/MegaCam z' images using optimised psf-fitting, and we
follow them up with pointed near infrared imaging with SOFI at NTT. We finally
obtain low resolution spectroscopy of the coolest candidates to characterise
their atmospheric physics. We have so far analysed and followed up all
candidates on the first 66 square degrees of the 335 square degrees survey. We
identified 55 T-dwarfs candidates with z'-J > 3:5 and have confirmed six of
them as T-dwarfs, including 3 that are strong later-than-T8 candidates, based
on their far-red and NIR colours. We also present here the NIR spectra of one
of these ultracool dwarfs, CFBDSIR1458+1013 which confirms it as one of the
coolest brown dwarf known, possibly in the 550-600K temperature range. From the
completed survey we expect to discover 10 to 15 dwarfs later than T8, more than
doubling the known number of such objects. This will enable detailed studies of
their extreme atmospheric properties and provide a stronger statistical base
for studies of their luminosity function.
