We find the numbers of $3 \times 3$ magic, semimagic, and magilatin squares,
as functions either of the magic sum or of an upper bound on the entries in the
square. Our results on magic and semimagic squares differ from previous ones in
that we require the entries in the square to be distinct from each other and we
derive our results not by \emph{ad hoc} reasoning but from the general
geometric and algebraic method of our paper "An enumerative geometry for magic
and magilatin labellings". Here we illustrate that method with a detailed
analysis of $3\times3$ squares.
