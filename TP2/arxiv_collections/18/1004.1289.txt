We consider a double quantum dot in the Pauli blockade regime interacting
with a nearby single spin. We show that under microwave irradiation the average
electron occupations of the dots exhibit resonances that are sensitive to the
state of the nearby spin. The system thus acts as a spin meter for the nearby
spin. We investigate the conditions for a non-demolition read-out of the spin
and find that the meter works at temperatures comparable to the dot charging
energy and sensitivity is mainly limited by the intradot spin relaxation.
