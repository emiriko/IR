Let (R,m) be a local ring and U_R=Spec(R) -{m} be the punctured spectrum of
R. Gabber conjectured that if R is a complete intersection of dimension 3, then
the abelian group Pic(U_R) is torsion-free. In this note we prove Gabber's
statement for the hypersurface case. We also point out certain connections
between Gabber's Conjecture, Van den Bergh's notion of non-commutative crepant
resolutions and some well-studied questions in homological algebra over local
rings.
