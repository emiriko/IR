We study the leakage dynamics of charge stored in an ensemble of CdTe quantum
dots embedded in a field-effect structure. Optically excited electrons are
stored and read out by a proper time sequence of bias pulses. We monitor the
dynamics of electron loss and find that the rate of the leakage is strongly
dependent on time, which we attribute to an optically generated electric field
related to the stored charge. A rate equation model quantitatively reproduces
the results.
