The quantum efficiency, which characterizes the quality of information gain
against information loss, is an important figure of merit for any realistic
quantum detectors in the gradual process of collapsing the state being
measured. In this work we consider the problem of solid-state charge qubit
measurements with a single-electron-transistor (SET). We analyze two models:
one corresponds to a strong response SET, and the other is a tunable one in
response strength. We find that the response strength would essentially bound
the quantum efficiency, making the detector non-quantum-limited. Quantum
limited measurements, however, can be achieved in the limits of strong response
and asymmetric tunneling. The present study is also associated with appropriate
justifications for the measurement and backaction-dephasing rates, which were
usually evaluated in controversial methods.
