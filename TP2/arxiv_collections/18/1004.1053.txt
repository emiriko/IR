We present an approach to derivative exposure management based on subjective
and implied probabilities. We suggest to maximize the valuation difference
subject to risk constraints and propose a class of risk measures derived from
the subjective distribution. We illustrate this process with specific examples
for the two and three dimensional case. In these cases the optimization can be
performed graphically.
