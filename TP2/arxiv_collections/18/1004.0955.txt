We present 2323 High-Amplitude \delta-Scuti (HADS) candidates discovered in
the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) by the SuperMACHO survey (Rest et al. 2005).
Frequency analyses of these candidates reveal that several are multimode
pulsators, including 119 whose largest amplitude of pulsation is in the
fundamental (F) mode and 19 whose largest amplitude of pulsation is in the
first overtone (FO) mode. Using Fourier decomposition of the HADS light curves,
we find that the period-luminosity (PL) relation defined by the FO pulsators
does not show a clear separation from the PL-relation defined by the F
pulsators. This differs from other instability strip pulsators such as type c
RR Lyrae. We also present evidence for a larger amplitude, subluminous
population of HADS similar to that observed in Fornax (Poretti et al. 2008).
