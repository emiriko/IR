Arrays of nanoscopic magnetic asymmetric rings, 150 nm in outer diameter, are
fabricated using the techniques of electron-beam lithography, angular
deposition and ion-beam etching. Magnetic measurements for cobalt asymmetric
rings at room temperature verifies previous reports of vortex magnetic state
formation of a desired circulation direction for the application of external
magnetic field along the asymmetry axis of the rings. However, the main theme
of this article is the observation of exchange bias phenomena when the ring
samples are cooled down to low temperature in the presence of a positive
magnetic field. Very interestingly, the observed exchange bias effect is
negative for along and perpendicular orientations of ring's asymmetry axis with
respect to the in-plane external magnetic field. This is in good quantitative
agreement with the random interface model proposed by Malozemoff et al. For the
application of inplane external magnetic field at 45 degree with respect to the
asymmetry axis, the exchange bias effect is positive. Unlike the exchange bias
effects in thin films, this is a very unusual observation indicating that
exchange bias phenomena of opposite natures can be manipulated by appropriate
combination of geometrical constraint and external magnetic field direction, in
addition to the interfacial interactions between ferromagnetic (FM) and
antiferromagnetic (AFM) layer.
