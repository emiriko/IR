In a recent paper, four of the present authors proposed a class of dark
matter models where generalized parity symmetry leads to equality of dark
matter abundance with baryon asymmetry of the Universe and predicts dark matter
mass to be around 5 GeV. In this note we explore how this model can be tested
in direct search experiments. In particular, we point out that if the dark
matter happens to be the mirror neutron, the direct detection cross section has
the unique feature that it increases at low recoil energy unlike the case of
conventional WIMPs. It is also interesting to note that the predicted
spin-dependent scattering could make significant contribution to the total
direct detection rate, especially for light nucleus. With this scenario, one
could explain recent DAMA and CoGeNT results.
