The Bell and Leggett-Garg tests offer operational ways to demonstrate that
non-classical behavior manifests itself in quantum systems, and
experimentalists have implemented these protocols to show that classical
worldviews such as local realism and macrorealism are false, respectively.
Previous theoretical research has exposed important connections between more
general Bell inequalities and polyhedral combinatorics. We show here that
general Leggett-Garg inequalities are closely related to the cut polytope of
the complete graph, a geometric object well-studied in combinatorics. Building
on that connection, we offer a family of Leggett-Garg inequalities that are not
trivial combinations of the most basic Leggett-Garg inequalities. We then show
that violations of macrorealism can occur in surprising ways, by giving an
example of a quantum system that violates the new "pentagon" Leggett-Garg
inequality but does not violate any of the basic "triangle" Leggett-Garg
inequalities.
