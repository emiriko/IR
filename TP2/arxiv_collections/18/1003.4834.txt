Ventilation aims at providing a sufficient air renewal for ensuring a good
indoor air quality (IAQ), yet building energy policies are leading to adapting
various ventilation strategies minimising energy losses through air renewal. A
recent IAQ evaluation campaign in French dwellings shows important pollution of
living spaces by VOCs such as formaldehyde, acetaldehyde or hexanal,
particularly in buildings equipped with a garage. Besides, radon emission from
soil is a subject of concern in many countries. Several studies are done to
understand its release mode and deal with the spread of this carcinogen gas.
This paper aims to experimentally assess a contaminant spread from a house
basement using mechanical exhaust and balanced ventilation systems, and natural
ventilation.
