For any state in four-dimensional system, the quantum violation of an
inequality based on the Peres-Mermin proof for testing noncontextual realist
models has experimentally been corroborated. In the Peres-Mermin proof, an
array of nine holistic observables for two two-qubit system was used. We, in
this letter, present a new symmetric set of observables for the same system
which also provides a contradiction of quantum mechanics with noncontextual
realist models in a state-independent way. The whole argument can also be cast
in the form of a new inequality that can be empirically tested.
