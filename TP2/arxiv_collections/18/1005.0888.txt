We discuss some fundamental properties of the XXZ spin chain, which are
important in the algebraic Bethe-ansatz derivation for the multiple-integral
representations of the spin-s XXZ correlation function with an arbitrary
product of elementary matrices. For instance, we construct Hermitian conjugate
vectors in the massless regime and introduce the spin-s Hermitian elementary
matrices.
