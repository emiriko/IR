To obtain good system performance, a DBA must choose a set of indices that is
appropriate for the workload. The system can aid in this challenging task by
providing recommendations for the index configuration. We propose a new index
recommendation technique, termed semi-automatic tuning, that keeps the DBA "in
the loop" by generating recommendations that use feedback about the DBA's
preferences. The technique also works online, which avoids the limitations of
commercial tools that require the workload to be known in advance. The
foundation of our approach is the Work Function Algorithm, which can solve a
wide variety of online optimization problems with strong competitive
guarantees. We present an experimental analysis that validates the benefits of
semi-automatic tuning in a wide variety of conditions.
