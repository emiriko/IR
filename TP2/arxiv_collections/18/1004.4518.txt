In the early days of April 2010, the blazar 3C 454.3 (z=0.859) underwent a
strong gamma-ray outburst, reaching fluxes (E > 100 MeV) in excess of 10^-5 ph
cm^-2 s^-1. The Fermi Gamma ray Space Telescope performed a 200 ks long pointed
observation starting from 5 April 2010 19:38 UTC. This allowed us to try
probing the variability of the gamma-ray emission on timescales of hours or
less. We found the variability on a few hours timescale. On sub-hour timescale
we found no evidence of significant variability, although the present
statistics is not yet conclusive and further observations are needed.
