A dynamical symmetry, as well as special diffeomorphism algebras generalizing
the Witt-Virasoro algebra, related to Poincar\'e-invariance and crucial with
regard to quantisation, questions of integrability, and M(atrix) theory, are
found to exist in the theory of relativistic extended objects of any dimension.
