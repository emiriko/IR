Doping of semiconductors is essential in modern electronic and photonic
devices. While doping is well understood in bulk semiconductors, the advent of
carbon nanotubes and nanowires for nanoelectronic and nanophotonic applications
raises some key questions about the role and impact of doping at low
dimensionality. Here we show that for semiconducting carbon nanotubes, bandgaps
and exciton binding energies can be dramatically reduced upon experimentally
relevant doping, and can be tuned gradually over a broad range of energies in
contrast to higher dimensional systems. The later feature is made possible by a
novel mechanism involving strong dynamical screening effects mediated by
acoustic plasmons.
