Many synthesis approaches for reversible and quantum logic have been proposed
so far. However, most of them generate circuits with respect to simple metrics,
i.e. gate count or quantum cost. On the other hand, to physically realize
reversible and quantum hardware, additional constraints exist. In this paper,
we describe cost metrics beyond gate count and quantum cost that should be
considered while synthesizing reversible and quantum logic for the respective
target technologies. We show that the evaluation of a synthesis approach may
differ if additional costs are applied. In addition, a new cost metric, namely
Nearest Neighbor Cost (NNC) which is imposed by realistic physical quantum
architectures, is considered in detail. We discuss how existing synthesis flows
can be extended to generate optimal circuits with respect to NNC while still
keeping the quantum cost small.
