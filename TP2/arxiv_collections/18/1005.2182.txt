Over the past few years several studies have provided estimates of the SFR
(star-formation rate) or the total infrared luminosity from just one infrared
band. However these relations are generally derived for entire galaxies, which
are known to contain a large scale diffuse emission that is not necessarily
related to the latest star-formation episode. We provide new relations to
estimate the SFR from resolved star-forming regions at 100 mum and 160 mum. We
select individual star-forming regions in the nearby (840 kpc) galaxy M33. We
estimate the SFR combining the emission in Halpha and at 24 mum to calibrate
the emission at 100 mum and 160 mum as SFR estimators, as mapped with
PACS/Herschel. The data are obtained in the framework of the HERM33ES open time
key project. There is less emission in the HII regions at 160 mum than at 100
mum. Over a dynamic range of almost 2 dex in Sigma(SFR) we find that the 100
mum emission is a nearly linear estimator of the SFR, whereas that at 160 mum
is slightly superlinear. The behaviour of individual star-forming regions is
surprisingly similar to that of entire galaxies. At high Sigma(SFR), star
formation drives the dust temperature, whereas uncertainties and variations in
radiation-transfer and dust-heated processes dominate at low Sigma(SFR).
Detailed modelling of both galaxies and individual star forming regions will be
needed to interpret similarities and differences between the two and assess the
fraction of diffuse emission in galaxies.
