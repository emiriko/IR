It is shown that when the stress-energy tensor of a spacetime is diagonal and
is written in the mixed form, its collineations admit infinite dimensional Lie
algebras except possibly in the case when the tensor depends on all the
spacetime coordinates. The result can be extended for more general second rank
tensors.
