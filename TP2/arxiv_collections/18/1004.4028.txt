We report a first-principles study of (BaTiO${_3}$)$_m$/(BaO)$_n$
superlattices for a wide range of periodicities $m/n$. We show that such a
system develops a polar zone-center instability for sufficiently large
\textit{m}/\textit{n} ratio, which can be understood, at least qualitatively,
from a simple electrostatic model and should lead to a ferroelectric
ground-state. However, the analysis of the phonon dispersion curves also points
out the appearance of stronger antiferroelectric instabilities at the zone
boundaries around $m=4$, before the critical ratio for ferroelectricity is
reached and which still dominate beyond it. The dominant character of the
anti-ferroelectric instability is explained from the depolarizing field which
hardens the ferroelectric mode. This analysis allows us to predict that,
(BaTiO${_3}$)$_m$/(BaO)$_n$ superlattices should present an antiferroelectric
ground state for $m$ larger than 4, which should smoothly evolve to a
multidomain structure for increasing $m$ values and only become ferroelectric
for large $m$.
