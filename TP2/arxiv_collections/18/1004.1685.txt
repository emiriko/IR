Swift observations suggest that the central compact objects of some gamma-ray
bursts (GRBs) could be newly born millisecond magnetars. Therefore, by
considering the spin evolution of the magnetars against r-mode instability, we
investigate the role of the magnetars in GRB X-ray afterglow emission. Besides
modifying the conventional energy injection model, we pay particular attention
to the internal X-ray afterglow emission, whose luminosity is assumed to track
the magnetic dipole luminosity of the magentars with a certain fraction.
Following a comparison between the model and some selected observational
samples, we suggest that some so-called "canonical" X-ray afterglows including
the shallow decay, normal decay, and steeper-than-normal decay phases could be
internally produced by the magnetars (possibly through some internal
dissipations of the magnetar winds), while the (energized) external shocks are
associated with another type of X-ray afterglows. If this is true, from those
internal X-ray afterglows, we can further determine the magnetic field
strengths and the initial spin periods of the corresponding magnetars.
