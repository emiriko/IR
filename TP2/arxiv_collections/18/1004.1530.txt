We study transport properties and also local density of states in a clean
superconductor-normal metal-superconductor Josephson junction with triplet
f-wave superconductors based on the Eilenberger equation. Effects of thickness
of normal metal and misorientation between gap vector of superconductors on the
spin and charge currents are investigated. Spin current, which stems from the
misalignment of d-vectors, in the absence of charge current for some values of
phase difference between superconductors is found. We also find unconventional
behavior of the spin current associated with 0-pitransition. The misalignment
of d-vectors also gives rise to a zero energy peak in the density of states in
the normal metal.
