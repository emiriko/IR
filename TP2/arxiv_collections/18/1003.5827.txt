Precision predictions for phenomenologically interesting observables such as
the t-tbar invariant mass distribution and forward-backward asymmetry in
top-quark pair production at hadron colliders require control over the
differential cross section in perturbative QCD. In this paper we improve
existing calculations of the doubly differential cross section in the invariant
mass and scattering angle by using techniques from soft-collinear effective
theory to perform an NNLL resummation of threshold logarithms, which become
large when the invariant mass M of the top-quark pair approaches the partonic
center-of-mass energy. We also derive an approximate formula for the
differential cross section at NNLO in fixed-order perturbation theory, which
completely determines the coefficients multiplying the singular plus
distributions. We then match our results in the threshold region with the exact
results at NLO in fixed-order perturbation theory, and perform a numerical
analysis of the invariant mass distribution, the total cross section, and the
forward-backward asymmetry. We argue that these are the most accurate
predictions available for these observables at present. Using MSTW2008NNLO
parton distribution functions (PDFs) along with \alpha_s(M_Z)=0.117 and
m_t=173.1 GeV, we obtain for the inclusive production cross sections at the
Tevatron and LHC the values \sigma_{Tevatron} = (6.30 +-0.19 +0.31-0.23) pb and
\sigma_{LHC} = (149 +- 7 +- 8) pb, where the first error results from scale
variations while the second reflects PDF uncertainties.
