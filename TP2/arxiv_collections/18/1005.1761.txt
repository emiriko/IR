Chuang et al (Reports, 8th of January 2010, p. 181)1 report quasiparticle
interference (QPI) imaging that shows pronounced C2 asymmetry. They interpreted
this result as indication of an electronic nematic phase with an electron band
dispersive only along the b-axis of this orthorhombic material. We argue that
this asymmetry is consistent with the underlying long range magnetic order and
that LDA electronic structure provides a better description of the QPI images
than the 1D band structure conjectured by Chuang et al.
