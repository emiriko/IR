We find the DIS structure functions at strong coupling by calculating
R-current correlators on a finite-size shock wave using AdS/CFT correspondence.
We improve on the existing results in the literature by going beyond the
eikonal approximation for the two lowest orders in graviton exchanges. We argue
that since the eikonal approximation at strong coupling resums integer powers
of 1/x (with x the Bjorken-x variable), the non-eikonal corrections bringing in
positive integer powers of x can not be neglected in the small-x limit, as the
non-eikonal order-x correction to the (n+1)st term in the eikonal series is of
the same order in x as the nth eikonal term in that series. We demonstrate
that, in qualitative agreement with the earlier DIS analysis based on
calculation of the expectation value of the Wilson loop in the shock wave
background using AdS/CFT, after inclusion of non-eikonal corrections DIS
structure functions are described by two momentum scales: Q_1^2 ~ \Lambda^2 \,
A^{1/3}/x and Q_2^2 ~ \Lambda^2 \, A^{2/3}, where \Lambda is the typical
transverse momentum in the shock wave and A is the atomic number if the shock
wave represents a nucleus. We discuss possible physical meanings of the scales
Q_1 and Q_2.
