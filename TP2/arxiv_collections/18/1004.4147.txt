This article connects the theory of extremal doubly stochastic measures to
the geometry and topology of optimal transportation. We begin by reviewing an
old question (# 111) of Birkhoff in probability and statistics [4], which is to
give a necessary and sufficient condition on the support of a joint probability
to guarantee extremality among all measures which share its marginals.
Following work of Douglas, Lindenstrauss, and Bene\v{s} and \v{S}t\v{e}p\'an,
Hestir and Williams [15] found a necessary condition which is nearly
sufficient; we relax their subtle measurability hypotheses separating necessity
from sufficiency slightly, yet demonstrate by example that to be sufficient
certainly requires some measurability. Their condition amounts to the vanishing
of {\gamma} outside a countable alternating sequence of graphs and antigraphs
in which no two graphs (or two antigraphs) have domains that overlap, and where
the domain of each graph / antigraph in the sequence contains the range of the
succeeding antigraph (respectively, graph). Such sequences are called numbered
limb systems. Surprisingly, this characterization can be used to resolve the
uniqueness question for optimal transportation on manifolds with the topology
of the sphere.
