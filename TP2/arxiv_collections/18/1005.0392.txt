The EAGLE instrument for the E-ELT is a multi-IFU spectrograph, that uses a
MOAO system for wavefront correction of interesting lines of sight. We present
a Monte-Carlo AO simulation package that has been used to model the performace
of EAGLE, and provide results, including comparisons with an analytical code.
These results include an investigation of the performance of compressed
reconstructor representations that have the potential to significantly reduce
the complexity of a real-time control system when implemented.
