We give a simple condition for a linear recurrence (mod 2^w) of degree r to
have the maximal possible period 2^(w-1).(2^r-1). It follows that the period is
maximal in the cases of interest for pseudo-random number generation, i.e. for
3-term linear recurrences defined by trinomials which are primitive (mod 2) and
of degree r > 2. We consider the enumeration of certain exceptional polynomials
which do not give maximal period, and list all such polynomials of degree less
than 15.
