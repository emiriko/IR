The dynamical creation of entanglement between three-level atoms coupled to
the common vacuum is investigated. For the class of bound entangled initial
states we show that the dynamics of closely separated atoms generates
stationary distillable entanglement of asymptotic states. We also find that the
effect of delayed sudden birth of distillable entanglement occurs in the case
of atoms separated by a distance comparable with the radiation wavelength.
