The nuclide 241Am decays by alpha emission to 237Np. Most of the decays (84.6
%) populate the excited level of 237Np with energy of 59.54 keV. Digital
Coincidence Counting was applied to standardize a solution of 241Am by
alpha-gamma coincidence counting with efficiency extrapolation. Electronic
discrimination was implemented with a pressurized proportional counter and the
results were compared with two other independent techniques: Liquid
Scintillation Counting using the logical sum of double coincidences in a TDCR
array and Defined Solid Angle Counting taking into account activity
inhomogeneity in the active deposit. The results show consistency between the
three methods within a limit of a 0.3%. An ampoule of this solution will be
sent to the International Reference System (SIR) during 2009. Uncertainties
were analysed and compared in detail for the three applied methods.
