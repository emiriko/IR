We are going to analyze the nucleation of vortices in a thin mesoscopic
superconducting disk. The Gibbs free energy from London model is formulated.
This energy function, with an arbitrary configuration of vortices, is
assoicated with the disk's size, applied magnetic field and finite temperature.
Then, the optimal solution is obtained by differentiating with respect position
r, for fixed applied field and temperature. We also investigate the stability
of the different vortex states inside the disk and compare our results with
those of other theoretical studies and with available experimental
observations. Our results agree with experiments. Besides, we formulate the
Gibbs free energy by Ginzburg-Landau (GL) model. Theoretically, the free energy
by GL model takes the superconducting density into account but not in London
model. Our simulations from both theories show the same quantum states of
vortex. We find that the Gibbs free energy by GL model is smaller than by
London model.
