We present an extensive study of interfaces defined in the Z_4 spin lattice
representation of the Ashkin-Teller (AT) model. In particular, we numerically
compute the fractal dimensions of boundary and bulk interfaces at the
Fateev-Zamolodchikov point. This point is a special point on the self-dual
critical line of the AT model and it is described in the continuum limit by the
Z_4 parafermionic theory. Extending on previous analytical and numerical
studies [10,12], we point out the existence of three different values of
fractal dimensions which characterize different kind of interfaces. We argue
that this result may be related to the classification of primary operators of
the parafermionic algebra. The scenario emerging from the studies presented
here is expected to unveil general aspects of geometrical objects of critical
AT model, and thus of c=1 critical theories in general.
