HD 189733 is a K2 dwarf, orbited by a giant planet at 8.8 stellar radii. In
order to study magnetospheric interactions between the star and the planet, we
explore the large-scale magnetic field and activity of the host star.
  We collected spectra using the ESPaDOnS and the NARVAL spectropolarimeters,
installed at the 3.6-m Canada-France-Hawaii telescope and the 2-m Telescope
Bernard Lyot at Pic du Midi, during two monitoring campaigns (June 2007 and
July 2008).
  HD 189733 has a mainly toroidal surface magnetic field, having a strength
that reaches up to 40 G. The star is differentially rotating, with latitudinal
angular velocity shear of domega = 0.146 +- 0.049 rad/d, corresponding to
equatorial and polar periods of 11.94 +- 0.16 d and 16.53 +- 2.43 d
respectively. The study of the stellar activity shows that it is modulated
mainly by the stellar rotation (rather than by the orbital period or the beat
period between the stellar rotation and the orbital periods). We report no
clear evidence of magnetospheric interactions between the star and the planet.
  We also extrapolated the field in the stellar corona and calculated the
planetary radio emission expected for HD 189733b given the reconstructed field
topology. The radio flux we predict in the framework of this model is time
variable and potentially detectable with LOFAR.
