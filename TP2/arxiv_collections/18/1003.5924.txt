Light curves in the B, V, and I_c passbands have been obtained for the type
II Cepheids V154 in M3 and V42 and V84 in M5. Alternating cycle behavior,
similar to that seen among RV Tauri variables, is confirmed for V84. Old and
new observations, spanning more than a century, show that V154 has increased in
period while V42 has decreased in period. V84, on the other hand, has shown
large, erratic changes in period that do not appear to reflect the long term
evolution of V84 through the HR diagram.
