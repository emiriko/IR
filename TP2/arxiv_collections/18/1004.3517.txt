Several analog-to-digital conversion methods for bandlimited signals used in
applications, such as Sigma Delta quantization schemes, employ coarse
quantization coupled with oversampling. The standard mathematical model for the
error accrued from such methods measures the performance of a given scheme by
the rate at which the associated reconstruction error decays as a function of
the oversampling ratio L > 1. It was recently shown that exponential accuracy
of the form O(2(-r L)) can be achieved by appropriate one-bit Sigma Delta
modulation schemes. However, the best known achievable rate constants r in this
setting differ significantly from the general information theoretic lower
bound. In this paper, we provide the first lower bound specific to coarse
quantization, thus narrowing the gap between existing upper and lower bounds.
In particular, our results imply a quantitative correspondence between the
maximal signal amplitude and the best possible error decay rate. Our method
draws from the theory of large deviations.
