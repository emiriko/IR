I present recent calculations of the hadronic contributions to muon anomalous
magnetic moment in holographic QCD, based on gauge/gravity duality. The
holographic estimates are compared well with the analysis based on recently
revised BaBar measurements of e+ e- -> pi+ pi- cross-sections and also with
other model calculations for the light-by-light scattering contributions.
