Thermodynamic properties of charge-stabilised colloidal suspensions are
commonly modeled by implementing the mean-field Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) theory
within a cell model. This approach models a bulk system by a single macroion,
together with counterions and salt ions, confined to a symmetrically shaped,
electroneutral cell. While easing solution of the nonlinear PB equation, the
cell model neglects microion-induced correlations between macroions, precluding
modeling of macroion ordering phenomena. An alternative approach, avoiding
artificial constraints of cell geometry, maps a macroion-microion mixture onto
a one-component model of pseudo-macroions governed by effective interactions.
In practice, effective-interaction models are usually based on linear screening
approximations, which can accurately describe nonlinear screening only by
incorporating an effective (renormalized) macroion charge. Combining charge
renormalization and linearized PB theories, in both the cell model and an
effective-interaction (cell-free) model, we compute osmotic pressures of highly
charged colloids and monovalent microions over a range of concentrations. By
comparing predictions with primitive model simulation data for salt-free
suspensions, and with predictions of nonlinear PB theory for salty suspensions,
we chart the limits of both the cell model and linear-screening approximations
in modeling bulk thermodynamic properties. Up to moderately strong
electrostatic couplings, the cell model proves accurate in predicting osmotic
pressures of deionized suspensions. With increasing salt concentration,
however, the relative contribution of macroion interactions grows, leading
predictions of the cell and effective-interaction models to deviate. No
evidence is found for a liquid-vapour phase instability driven by monovalent
microions. These results may guide applications of PB theory to soft materials.
