The main workshop objective was to promote a holistic view and
interdisciplinary methods for design, verification and co-ordination of
aerospace systems, by combining formal methods with techniques from control
engineering and artificial intelligence. The very demanding safety, robustness
and performance requirements of these systems require unprecedented integration
of heterogeneous techniques and models. The aim of FMA was to bring together
active researchers from all the above areas to discuss and present their work.
