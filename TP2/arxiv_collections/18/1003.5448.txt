The chiral topological superconductor in two dimensions has a full pairing
gap in the bulk and a single chiral Majorana state at the edge. The vortex of
the chiral superconducting state carries a Majorana zero mode which is
responsible for the non-abelian statistics of the vortices. Despite intensive
searches, this novel superconducting state has not yet been identified in
nature. In this paper, we consider a quantum Hall or a quantum anomalous Hall
state near the plateau transition, and in proximity to a fully gapped s-wave
superconductor. We show that this hybrid system realizes the long sought after
chiral superconductor state, and propose several experimental methods for its
observation.
