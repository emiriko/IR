We consider Poincare gravity coupled in a nonminimal way to spinors. The
gravitational action is considered that contains both Palatini and Holst terms.
Due to torsion the effective four - fermion interactions appear that may lead
to the left - right asymmetry and the condensation of fermions. When the mass
parameter entering the mentioned terms of the gravitational action is at a Tev
scale the given construction may provide the dynamical Electroweak symmetry
breaking. This is achieved via an arrangement of all Standard Model fermions in
the left - handed Dirac spinors while the right - handed spinors are reserved
for the technifermions. Due to the gravitational action the technifermions are
condensed and, therefore, cause the appearance of gauge boson masses.
