A new framework for information hiding security, called chaos-security, has
been proposed in a previous study. It is based on the evaluation of
unpredictability of the scheme, whereas existing notions of security, as
stego-security, are more linked to information leaks. It has been proven that
spread-spectrum techniques, a well-known stego-secure scheme, are chaos-secure
too. In this paper, the links between the two notions of security is deepened
and the usability of chaos-security is clarified, by presenting a novel data
hiding scheme that is twice stego and chaos-secure. This last scheme has better
scores than spread-spectrum when evaluating qualitative and quantitative
chaos-security properties. Incidentally, this result shows that the new
framework for security tends to improve the ability to compare data hiding
scheme.
