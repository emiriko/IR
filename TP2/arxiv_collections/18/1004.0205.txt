In this communication are presented some complements to a recent paper
entitled "Simple Fourier optics formalism for high angular resolution systems
and nulling interferometry", dealing with imaging and nulling capacities of a
few types of multi-aperture optical systems. Herein the characteristics of such
systems in terms of Point Spread Function (PSF) and Field of View (FoV) are
derived from simple analytical expressions that are further evaluated
numerically for various configurations. We consider successively the general
cases of Fizeau and Michelson interferometers, and those of a monolithic pupil,
nulling telescope, of a nulling, Sheared-Pupil Telescope (SPT), and of a sparse
aperture, Axially Combined Interferometer (ACI). The analytical formalism also
allows establishing the exact Object-Image relationships applicable to nulling
PSTs or ACIs that are planned for future space missions searching for habitable
extra-solar planets.
