The effect of nucleon-nucleon correlations in symmetric nuclear matter at
finite temperature is studied beyond BCS theory. Starting from a Hartree-Fock
description of nuclear matter with the Gogny effective interaction, we add
correlations corresponding to the formation of preformed pairs and scattering
states above the superfluid critical temperature within the in-medium T-matrix
approach, which is analogous to the Nozieres-Schmitt-Rink theory. We calculate
the critical temperature for a BEC superfluid of deuterons, of a BCS superfluid
of nucleons, and in the crossover between these limits. The effect of the
correlations on thermodynamic properties (equation of state, energy, entropy)
and the liquid-gas phase transition is discussed. Our results show that
nucleon-nucleon correlations beyond BCS play an important role for the
properties of nuclear matter, especially in the low-density region.
