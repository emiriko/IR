We present lattice calculations for the ground state energies of tritium,
helium-3, helium-4, lithium-6, and carbon-12 nuclei. Our results were
previously summarized in a letter publication. This paper provides full details
of the calculations. We include isospin-breaking, Coulomb effects, and
interactions up to next-to-next-to-leading order in chiral effective field
theory.
