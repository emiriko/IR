We study universality classes and crossover behaviors in non-Abelian directed
sandpile models, in terms of the metastable pattern analysis. The non-Abelian
property induces spatially correlated metastable patterns, characterized by the
algebraic decay of the grain density along the propagation direction of an
avalanche. Crossover scaling behaviors are observed in the grain density due to
the interplay between the toppling randomness and the parity of the threshold
value. In the presence of such crossovers, we show that the broadness of the
grain distribution plays a crucial role in resolving the ambiguity of the
universality class. Finally, we claim that the metastable pattern analysis is
important as much as the conventional analysis of avalanche dynamics.
