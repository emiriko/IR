We show that under certain conditions, subsurface structures in the solar
interior can alter the average acoustic power observed at the photosphere above
them. By using numerical simulations of wave propagation, we show that this
effect is large enough for it to be potentially used for detecting emerging
active regions before they appear on the surface. In our simulations,
simplified subsurface structures are modeled as regions with enhanced or
reduced acoustic wave speed. We investigate the dependence of the acoustic
power above a subsurface region on the sign, depth, and strength of the wave
speed perturbation. Observations from the Solar and Heliospheric
Observatory/Michelson Doppler Imager (SOHO/MDI) prior and during the emergence
of NOAA active region 10488 are used to test the use of acoustic power as a
potential precursor of magnetic flux emergence.
