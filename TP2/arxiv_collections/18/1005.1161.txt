We report the discovery of Quasi Periodic Oscillations (QPO) at 0.02 Hz in a
transient high mass X-ray binary pulsar KS 1947+300 using {\em RXTE}-PCA. The
QPOs were detected during May-June 2001, at the end of a long outburst. This is
the 9th transient accretion powered high magnetic field X-ray pulsar in which
QPOs have been detected and the QPO frequency of this source is lowest in this
class of sources. The unusual feature of this source is that though the
outburst lasted for more than 100 days, the QPOs were detected only during the
last few days of the outburst when the X-ray intensity had decayed to 1.6% of
the peak intensity. The rms value of the QPO is large, $\sim15.4\pm1.0%$ with a
slight positive correlation with energy. The detection of QPOs and strong
pulsations at a low luminosity level suggests that the magnetic field strength
of the neutron star is not as high as was predicted earlier on the basis of a
correlation between the spin-up torque and the X-ray luminosity.
