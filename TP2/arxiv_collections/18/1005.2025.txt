A cooperative observation with Hida observatory and Hinode satellite was
performed on an emerging flux region. The successive Ca II K spectro-heliograms
of the emerging flux region were taken by the Domeless Solar Telescope of Hida
observatory. Hinode observed the emerging flux region with Ca II H and Fe I
Stokes IQUV filtergrams. In this study, detailed dynamics and temporal
evolution of the magnetic flux emergence was studied observationally. The event
was first detected in the photospheric magnetic field signals. 3 minutes later,
the horizontal expansion of the dark area was detected. And then, 7 minutes
later than the horizontal expansion, the emerging loops were detected with the
maximal rise speed of 2.1 km/s at chromospheric heights. The observed dynamics
of emerging magnetic flux from the photosphere to the upper chromosphere is
well consistent with the results of previous simulation works. The gradual
rising phase of flux tubes with a weak magnetic strength was confirmed by our
observation.
