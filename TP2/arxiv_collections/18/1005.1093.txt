Optical microcavities support Whispering Gallery Modes (WGMs) with a very
high quality factor Q. However, WGMs typically display a far-field isotropic
emission profile and modifying this far-field profile without spoiling the
associated high Q remains a challenge. Using a 2D annular cavity, we present a
procedure capable to achieve these two apparently conflicting goals. With the
correspondence between the classical and the wave picture, properties of the
classical phase space shed some light on the characteristics of the wave
dynamics. Specifically, the annular cavity has a well separated mixed phase
space, a characteristic that proves to be of crucial importance in the emission
properties of WGMs. While the onset of directionality in the far-field may be
achieved through parametric deformation of the distance cavity-hole centers,
this contribution presents a method to control the emission profile via a
second parameter, the hole radius. The influence of the classical dynamics to
control and predict the field emission will be demonstrated.
