A new kind of contactless pumping mechanism is realized in a layer of
ferrofluid via a spatio-temporally modulated magnetic field. The resulting
pressure gradient leads to a liquid ramp, which is measured by means of X-rays.
The transport mechanism works best if a resonance of the surface waves with the
driving is achieved. The behavior can be understood semi-quantitatively by
considering the magnetically influenced dispersion relation of the fluid.
