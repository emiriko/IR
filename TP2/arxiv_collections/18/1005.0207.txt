How far is neuroepithelial cell proliferation in the developing central
nervous system a deterministic process? Or, to put it in a more precise way,
how accurately can it be described by a deterministic mathematical model? To
provide tracks to answer this question, a deterministic system of transport and
diffusion partial differential equations, both physiologically and spatially
structured, is introduced as a model to describe the spatially organized
process of cell proliferation during the development of the central nervous
system. As an initial step towards dealing with the three-dimensional case, a
unidimensional version of the model is presented. Numerical analysis and
numerical tests are performed. In this work we also achieve a first
experimental validation of the proposed model, by using cell proliferation data
recorded from histological sections obtained during the development of the
optic tectum in the chick embryo.
