The question of citation behavior has always intrigued scientists from
various disciplines. While general citation patterns have been widely studied
in the literature we develop the notion of citation projection graphs by
investigating the citations among the publications that a given paper cites. We
investigate how patterns of citations vary between various scientific
disciplines and how such patterns reflect the scientific impact of the paper.
We find that idiosyncratic citation patterns are characteristic for low impact
papers; while narrow, discipline-focused citation patterns are common for
medium impact papers. Our results show that crossing-community, or bridging
citation patters are high risk and high reward since such patterns are
characteristic for both low and high impact papers. Last, we observe that
recently citation networks are trending toward more bridging and
interdisciplinary forms.
