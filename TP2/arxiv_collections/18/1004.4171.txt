For skew-symmetric acyclic quantum cluster algebras, we express the quantum
$F$-polynomials and the quantum cluster monomials in terms of Serre polynomials
of quiver Grassmannians of rigid modules. As byproducts, we obtain the
existence of counting polynomials for these varieties and the positivity
conjecture with respect to acyclic seeds. These results complete previous work
by Caldero and Reineke and confirm a recent conjecture by Rupel.
