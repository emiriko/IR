Let ${\bf{w}}(t,x):=(u,v)(t,x),\ t>0,\ x\in \mathbb{R}^{n},$ be the
$\mathbb{R}^2$-valued spatial-temporal random field ${\bf{w}}=(u, v)$ arising
from a certain two-equation system of fractional kinetic equations of
reaction-diffusion type, with given random initial data $u(0,x)$ and $v(0,x).$
The space-fractional derivative is characterized by the composition of the
inverses of the Riesz potential and the Bessel potential. We discuss two
scaling limits, the macro and the micro, for the homogenization of
${\bf{w}}(t,x)$, and prove that the rescaled limit is a singular field of
multiple It\^{o}-Wiener integral type, subject to suitable assumptions on the
random initial conditions. In the two scaling procedures, the Riesz and the
Bessel parameters play distinctive roles. Moreover, since the component fields
$u,v$ are dependent on the interactions present within the system, we employ a
certain stochastic decoupling method to tackle this components dependence. The
time-fractional system is also considered, in which the Mittag-Leffler function
is used.
