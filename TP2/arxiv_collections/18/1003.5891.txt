In the present work, we have used Tesseract 2.01 open source Optical
Character Recognition (OCR) Engine under Apache License 2.0 for recognition of
handwriting samples of lower case Roman script. Handwritten isolated and
free-flow text samples were collected from multiple users. Tesseract is trained
to recognize user-specific handwriting samples of both the categories of
document pages. On a single user model, the system is trained with 1844
isolated handwritten characters and the performance is tested on 1133
characters, taken form the test set. The overall character-level accuracy of
the system is observed as 83.5%. The system fails to segment 5.56% characters
and erroneously classifies 10.94% characters.
