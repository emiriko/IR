The statistics of peaks of the initial, Gaussian density field can be used to
interpret the abundance and clustering of massive dark matter haloes. I discuss
some recent theoretical results related to their clustering and its redshift
evolution. Predictions from the peak model are qualitatively consistent with
measurements of the linear bias of high mass haloes, which also show some
evidence for a dependence on the halo mass M at fixed peak height. The peak
approach also predicts a distinctive scale-dependence in the bias of haloes
across the baryon acoustic feature, a measurement of which would provide strong
support for its validity. For 2-sigma density peaks collapsing at z=0.3, this
residual scale-dependent bias is at the 5-10 percent level and should thus be
within reach of very large simulations of structure formation.
