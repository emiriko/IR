The use of World Web Wide for distance education has received increasing
attention over the past decades. The real challenge of adapting this technology
for engineering education and training is to facilitate the laboratory
experiments via Internet. In the sciences, measurement plays an important role.
The accuracy of the measurement, as well as the units, help scientists to
better understand phenomena occurring in nature. This paper introduces
Metrology educators to the use and adoption of Java-applets in order to create
virtual, online Metrology laboratories for students. These techniques have been
used to successfully form a laboratory course which augments the more
conventional lectures in concepts of Metrology course at Faculty of
Engineering, Albaha University, KSA. Improvements of the package are still
undergoing to incorporate Web-based technologies (Internet home page, HTML,
Java programming etc...). This Web-based education and training has been
successfully class-tested within an undergraduate preliminary year engineering
course and students reported a positive experience with its use. The use of
these labs should be self-explanatory and their reliable operation has been
thoroughly tested.
