Deep subwavelength integration of high-definition plasmonic nanostructures is
of key importance for the development of future optical nanocircuitry for
high-speed communication, quantum computation and lab-on-a-chip applications.
So far the experimental realization of proposed extended plasmonic networks
consisting of multiple functional elements remains challenging, mainly due to
the multi-crystallinity of commonly used thermally evaporated gold layers.
Resulting structural imperfections in individual circuit elements will
drastically reduce the yield of functional integrated nanocircuits. Here we
demonstrate the use of very large (>100 micron^2) but thin (<80 nm) chemically
grown single-crystalline gold flakes, which, after immobilization, serve as an
ideal basis for focused-ion beam milling and other top-down nanofabrication
techniques on any desired substrate. Using this methodology we obtain
high-definition ultrasmooth gold nanostructures with superior optical
properties and reproducible nano-sized features over micrometer length scales.
Our approach provides a possible solution to overcome the current fabrication
bottleneck and to realize high-definition plasmonic nanocircuitry.
