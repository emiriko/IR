A possible process to destroy a black hole consists on throwing point
particles with sufficiently large angular momentum into the black hole. In the
case of Kerr black holes, it was shown by Wald that particles with dangerously
large angular momentum are simply not captured by the hole, and thus the event
horizon is not destroyed. Here we reconsider this gedanken experiment for a
variety of black hole geometries, from black holes in higher dimensions to
black rings. We show that this particular way of destroying a black hole does
not succeed and that Cosmic Censorship is preserved.
