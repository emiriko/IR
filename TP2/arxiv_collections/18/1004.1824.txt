In this paper we set out to measure time dilation in quasar light curves. In
order to detect the effects of time dilation, sets of light curves from two
monitoring programmes are used to construct Fourier power spectra covering
timescales from 50 days to 28 years. Data from high and low redshift samples
are compared to look for the changes expected from time dilation. The main
result of the paper is that quasar light curves do not show the effects of time
dilation. Several explanations are discussed, including the possibility that
time dilation effects are exactly offset by an increase in timescale of
variation associated with black hole growth, or that the variations are caused
by microlensing in which case time dilation would not be expected.
