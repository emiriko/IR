We show that shunt capacitor stabilizes synchronized oscillations in
intrinsic Josephson junction stacks biased by DC current. This synchronization
mechanism has an effect similar to the previously discussed radiative coupling
between junctions, however, it is not defined by the geometry of the stack. It
is particularly important in crystals with smaller number of junctions, where
radiation coupling is week, and is comparable with the effect of strong
super-radiation in crystal with many junctions. The shunt also helps to enter
the phase-locked regime in the beginning of oscillations, after switching on
the bias current. Shunt may be used to tune radiation power, which drops as
shunt capacitance increases.
