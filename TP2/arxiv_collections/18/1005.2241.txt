We analyze the relation between the Dirac spectrum and the gauge field in
SU(3) lattice QCD. We focus on how components of the gauge field are related to
the Dirac spectrum. First, we consider momentum components of the gauge field.
It turns out that the broad region of momentum components is relevant for the
low-lying Dirac spectrum and zero modes, i.e., topological charges. The
connection with chiral random matrix theory is also discussed. Second, we
consider an SU(2) subgroup component of the SU(3) gauge field. The SU(2)
subgroup component behaves like the SU(2) gauge field in the low-lying Dirac
spectrum.
