We present a study of the charge-transfer excitations in undoped Nd2CuO4
using resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) at the Cu K-edge. At the
Brillouin zone center, azimuthal scans that rotate the incident-photon
polarization within the CuO2 planes reveal weak fourfold oscillations. A
comparison of spectra taken in different Brillouin zones reveals a spectral
weight decrease at high energy loss from forward- to back-scattering. We show
that these are scattered-photon polarization effects related to the properties
of the observed electronic excitations. Each of the two effects constitutes
about 10% of the inelastic signal while the '4p-as-spectator' approximation
describes the remaining 80%. Raman selection rules can accurately model our
data, and we conclude that the observed polarization-dependent RIXS features
correspond to Eg and B1g charge-transfer excitations to non-bonding oxygen 2p
bands, above 2.5 eV energy-loss, and to an Eg d->d excitation at 1.65 eV.
