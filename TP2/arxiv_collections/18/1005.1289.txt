It has long been regarded as difficult for a cosmological model to account
simultaneously for the galaxy luminosity, mass, and velocity distributions. We
revisit this issue using a modern compilation of observational data along with
the best available large-scale cosmological simulation of dark matter. We find
that the standard cosmological model, used in conjunction with halo abundance
matching (HAM) and simple dynamical corrections, fits all basic statistics of
galaxies with circular velocities Vcirc > 80 km/s. Our observational constraint
is the luminosity-velocity relation which allows all types of galaxies to be
included. We have compiled data for a variety of galaxies ranging from dwarf
irregulars to giant ellipticals. The data present a clear monotonic
luminosity-velocity relation from 50 km/s to 500 km/s, with a bend below 80
km/s and a systematic offset between late- and early-type galaxies. For
comparison to theory, we employ our LCDM "Bolshoi" simulation of dark matter,
which has unprecedented mass and force resolution. We use halo abundance
matching to assign rank-ordered galaxy luminosities to the dark matter halos.
The resulting predictions for the luminosity-velocity relation are in excellent
agreement with the available data on both early-type and late-type galaxies for
the luminosity range from Mr = -14-22. We also compare our predictions for the
"cold" baryon mass (i.e., stars and cold gas) of galaxies as a function of
circular velocity with the available observations, again finding a very good
agreement. The predicted circular velocity function is in agreement with the
galaxy velocity function for 80-400 km/s. However, we find that the dark matter
halos with Vcirc < 80 km/s are much more abundant than observed galaxies with
the same Vcirc . We find that the two-point correlation function of galaxies in
our model matches very well the results from the SDSS.
