This paper investigates the capacity of compound state-dependent channels
with non-causal state information available at only the transmitter. A new
lower bound on the capacity of this class of channels is derived. This bound is
shown to be tight for the special case of compound channels with stochastic
degraded components, yielding the full characterization of the capacity.
Specific results are derived for the compound Gaussian Dirty-Paper (GDP)
channel. This model consists of an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel
corrupted by an additive Gaussian interfering signal, known at the transmitter
only, where the input and the state signals are affected by fading coefficients
whose realizations are unknown at the transmitter. Our bounds are shown to be
tight for specific cases. Applications of these results arise in a variety of
wireless scenarios as multicast channels, cognitive radio and problems with
interference cancellation.
