The strong coupling of rho meson to the nucleon produces $s$ and $p$ wave rho
meson nucleon $(\rho N)$ resonances. In a nucleus, the $\rho N$ resonance-hole
polarization generates the optical potential or self-energy for the rho meson.
The scattering of rho meson due to this potential provides valuable
informations about the $\rho N$ resonance dynamics in a nucleus. To investigate
it, we use this potential to calculate the mass distribution spectrum for the
$\rho$ meson produced coherently in the proton nucleus reaction. The cross
sections arising due to $s$ and $p$ wave $\rho N$ resonances have been
presented. The coherent and incoherent contributions to the cross sections due
to these resonances are compared. In addition, the calculated results due to
non-relativistic and relativistic $\rho$ meson self-energy are illustrated.
