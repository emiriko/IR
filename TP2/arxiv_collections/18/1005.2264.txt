We solve the quantum constraint equations of the Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi model
in a semiclassical approximation in which an expansion is performed with
respect to the Planck length. We recover in this way the standard expression
for the Hawking temperature as well as its first quantum gravitational
correction. We then interpret this correction in terms of the one-loop trace
anomaly of the energy-momentum tensor and thereby make contact with earlier
work on quantum black holes.
