We present new observations of a transit of the 111-day-period exoplanet
HD80606b. Using the Spitzer Space Telescope and its IRAC camera on the
post-cryogenic mission, we performed a 19-hour-long photometric observation of
HD80606 that covers the full transit of 13-14 January 2010. We complement this
photometric data by new spectroscopic observations that we simultaneously
performed with SOPHIE at Haute-Provence Observatory. This provides radial
velocity measurements of the first half of the transit that was previously
uncovered with spectroscopy. This new data set allows the parameters of this
singular planetary system to be significantly refined. We obtained a
planet-to-star radius ratio R_p/R_* = 0.1001 +/- 0.0006 that is slightly lower
than the one measured from previous ground observations. We detected a feature
in the Spitzer light curve that could be due to a stellar spot. We also found a
transit timing about 20 minutes earlier than the ephemeris prediction; this
could be caused by actual TTVs due to an additional body in the system or by
underestimated systematic uncertainties. The sky-projected angle between the
spin-axis of HD80606 and the normal to the planetary orbital plane is found to
be lambda = 42 +/- 8 degrees thanks to the fit of the Rossiter-McLaughlin
anomaly. This allows scenarios with aligned spin-orbit to be definitively
rejected. Over the twenty planetary systems with measured spin-orbit angles, a
few of them are misaligned; this is probably the signature of two different
evolution scenarios for misaligned and aligned systems, depending if they
experienced or not gravitational interaction with a third body. As in the case
of HD80606b, most of the planetary systems including a massive planet are
tilted; this could be the signature of a separate evolution scenario for
massive planets in comparison with Jupiter-mass planets.
