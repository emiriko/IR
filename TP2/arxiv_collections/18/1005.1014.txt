RTS2 is an open source observatory manager. It was written from scratch in
the C++ language, with portability and modularity in mind. Its driving
requirements originated from quick follow-ups of Gamma Ray Bursts. After some
years of development it is now used to carry tasks it was originally not
intended to carry. This article presents the current development status of the
RTS2 code. It focuses on describing strategies which worked as well as things
which failed to deliver expected results.
