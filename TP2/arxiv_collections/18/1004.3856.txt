We consider the dynamics of moving curves in three-dimensional Minkowski
space $R_1^{3}$ and deduce the evolution equations for the curvature and
torsion of the curve. Next by mapping a continuous SO(2,1) Heisenberg spin
chain on the space curve in $R_1^{3}$, we show that the defocusing nonlinear
Schr\"odinger equation(NLSE) can be identified with the spin chain, thereby
giving a geometrical interpretation of it. The associated linear eigenvalue
problem is also obtained in a geometrical way.
