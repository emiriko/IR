The efficiency of current cargo screening processes at sea and air ports is
largely unknown as few benchmarks exists against which they could be measured.
Some manufacturers provide benchmarks for individual sensors but we found no
benchmarks that take a holistic view of the overall screening procedures and no
benchmarks that take operator variability into account. Just adding up
resources and manpower used is not an effective way for assessing systems where
human decision-making and operator compliance to rules play a vital role. Our
aim is to develop a decision support tool (cargo-screening system simulator)
that will map the right technology and manpower to the right commodity-threat
combination in order to maximise detection rates. In this paper we present our
ideas for developing such a system and highlight the research challenges we
have identified. Then we introduce our first case study and report on the
progress we have made so far.
