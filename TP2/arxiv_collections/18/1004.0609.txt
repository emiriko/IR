Rotationally-split modes can provide valuable information about the internal
rotation profile of stars. This has been used for years to infer the internal
rotation behavior of the Sun. The present work discusses the potential
additional information that rotationally splitting asymmetries may provide when
studying the internal rotation profile of stars. We present here some
preliminary results of a method, currently under development, which intends: 1)
to understand the variation of the rotational splitting asymmetries in terms of
physical processes acting on the angular momentum distribution in the stellar
interior, and 2) how this information can be used to better constrain the
internal rotation profile of the stars. The accomplishment of these two
objectives should allow us to better use asteroseismology as a test-bench of
the different theories describing the angular momentum distribution and
evolution in the stellar interiors.
