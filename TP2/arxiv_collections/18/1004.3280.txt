Recommended 2 $\beta$ (2 $\nu$) half-life values and their systematics were
analyzed in the frame- work of a simple empirical approach. T$^{2 \nu}$$_{1/2}$
~ 1/E$^{8}$ trend has been observed for $^{128,130}$Te recommended values. This
trend was used to predict T$^{2 \nu}$$_{1/2}$ for all isotopes of interest.
Current results were compared with other theoretical and experimental works.
