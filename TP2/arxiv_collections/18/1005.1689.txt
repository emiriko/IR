We investigate chiral-restoration patterns of QCD for N_{c}=3 and N_{f}=2 at
finite temperature (T) and zero quark-chemical potential beyond the chiral
limit, indicating the explicit chiral-symmetry breaking. To this end, we employ
the instanton-vacuum configuration for the flavor SU(2) sector and the
Harrington-Shepard caloron for modifying relevant instanton parameters as
functions of T. The meson-loop corrections (MLC), which correspond to 1/N_{c}
corrections, are also taken into account to reproduce appropriate m_{q}
dependences of chiral order parameters. We compute chiral condensate as a
function of T and/or m_{q}. From the numerical calculations, we observe that
MLC play an important role to have a correct universality-class behavior of
chiral-restoration patterns in this framework, depending on m_{q}: Second-order
phase transition in the chiral limit, m_{q}=0 and crossover for m_{q}>0.
Without MLC, all the restoration patterns are crossover, due to simple
saddle-point approximations. It turns out that T^{\chi}_{c}=159 MeV in the
chiral limit and T^{\chi}_{c}=(177,186,196) MeV for m_{q}=(5,10,15) MeV, using
the phenomenological choices for the instanton parameters at T=0.
