We describe and analyze CUDA simulations of hydrodynamic interactions in
active dumbbell suspensions. GPU-based parallel computing enables us not only
to study the time-resolved collective dynamics of up to a several hundred
active dumbbell swimmers but also to test the accuracy of effective
time-averaged models. Our numerical results suggest that the stroke-averaged
model yields a relatively accurate description down to distances of only a few
times the dumbbell's length. This is remarkable in view of the fact that the
stroke-averaged model is based on a far-field expansion. Thus, our analysis
confirms that stroke-averaged far-field equations of motion may provide a
useful starting point for the derivation of hydrodynamic field equations.
