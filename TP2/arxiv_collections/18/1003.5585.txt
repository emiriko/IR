We analyze and compute, within a number of standard model (SM) extensions,
the cross sections $\sigma_{A\to VV'}$ for the production of a heavy neutral
pseudoscalar Higgs boson/spin-zero resonance at the LHC and its subsequent
decays into electroweak gauge bosons. For comparison we calculate also the
corresponding cross sections for a heavy scalar. The SM extensions we consider
include a type-II two-Higgs doublet model (2HDM), a 2HDM with 4 chiral fermion
generations, the minimal supersymmetric extension of the SM (MSSM), and
top-color assisted technicolour models. Presently available phenomenological
constraints on the parameters of these models are taken into account. We find
that, with the exception of the MSSM, these models permit the LHC cross
sections $\sigma_{A\to VV'}$ to be of observable size. That is, a pseudoscalar
resonance may be observable, if it exists, at the LHC in its decays into
electroweak gauge bosons, in particular in $WW$ and $\gamma \gamma$ final
states.
