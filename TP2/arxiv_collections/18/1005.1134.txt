A $q$-analogue of combinatorics concerning the Cartan matrix for the
Iwahori-Hecke algebra of type $A$ is investigated. We give several descriptions
for the determinant of the graded Cartan matrix, which imply some combinatorial
identities. A conjectural expression for the elementary divisors is also
presented.
