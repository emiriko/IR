We present a sample of 20 massive galaxy clusters with total virial masses in
the range of 6 10^14 M_sol<M(vir)< 2 10^15M_sol, re-simulated with a customized
version of the 1.5. ENZO code employing Adaptive Mesh Refinement. This
technique allowed us to obtain unprecedented high spatial resolution (25kpc/h)
up to the distance of 3 virial radii from the clusters center, and makes it
possible to focus with the same level of detail on the physical properties of
the innermost and of the outermost cluster regions, providing new clues on the
role of shock waves and turbulent motions in the ICM, across a wide range of
scales.
  In this paper, a first exploratory study of this data set is presented. We
report on the thermal properties of galaxy clusters at z=0. Integrated and
morphological properties of gas density, gas temperature, gas entropy and
baryon fraction distributions are discussed, and compared with existing
outcomes both from the observational and from the numerical literature.
  Our cluster sample shows an overall good consistency with the results
obtained adopting other numerical techniques (e.g. Smoothed Particles
Hydrodynamics), yet it provides a more accurate representation of the accretion
patterns far outside the cluster cores. We also reconstruct the properties of
shock waves within the sample by means of a velocity-based approach, and we
study Mach numbers and energy distributions for the various dynamical states in
clusters, giving estimates for the injection of Cosmic Rays particles at
shocks. The present sample is rather unique in the panorama of cosmological
simulations of massive galaxy clusters, due to its dynamical range, statistics
of objects and number of time outputs. For this reason, we deploy a public
repository of the available data, accessible via web portal at
http://data.cineca.it.
