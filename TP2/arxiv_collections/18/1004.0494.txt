We report on the measurement of the direct emission (DE) and interference
(INT) terms of the K\pm -> \pi\pm\pi^0 g decay by the NA48/2 experiment at the
CERN SPS. From the data collected during 2003 and 2004 about 600k such decay
candidates have been selected. The relative amounts of DE and INT with respect
to the internal bremsstrahlung (IB) contribution have been measured in the
range 0<T*\pi<80 MeV:
  Frac_{DE} (0<T*\pi<80 MeV) = (3.32\pm 0.15_{stat} \pm 0.14_{sys})x10^{-2}
  Frac_{INT} (0<T*\pi<80 MeV) = (- 2.35\pm 0.35_{stat} \pm 0.39_{sys})x10^{-2},
where T*pi is the kinetic energy of the charged pion in the kaon rest frame.
This is the first observation of an interference term in T*\pi decays. In
addition, a limit on the CP violating asymmetry in the K^+ and K^- branching
ratios for this channel has been determined to be less than 1.5x10^{-3} at 90%
confidence level.
