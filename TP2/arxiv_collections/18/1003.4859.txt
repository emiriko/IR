La2Zr2O7 (LZO) formation of bulk powders and of films by Chemical Solution
Deposition (CSD) process have been studied using propionates. The treatment
involved a one step cycle in the reducing forming gas (Ar-5%H2) to be
compatible with Ni-5at%W RABITS. Large amount of residual carbon was found in
LZO powders formed in these conditions (10 wt %). The volume fraction of the
cube texture in LZO films on Ni-5at%w RABITS was found to be a function of the
speed of the gas flown above sample. This phenomenon is discussed in
considering the C deposited from the carbon-containing gases emitted during the
pyrolysis of the precursor. Using proper conditions (950 ^\circC and the speed
of gas of 6.8\times10^{-2} m/s), LZO films with good surface crystallinity
could be obtained on Ni-5at%W RABITS as demonstrated by X-ray diffraction,
electron backscattered diffraction and RHEED. The existence of residual carbon
in oxide films is a common question to films deposited by CSD processes under
reducing condition.
