In this work, we investigate the intrinsic limits of subthreshold slope in a
dual gated bilayer graphene transistor using a coupled self-consistent
Poisson-bandstructure solver. We benchmark the solver by matching the bias
dependent bandgap results obtained from the solver against published
experimental data. We show that the intrinsic bias dependence of the electronic
structure and the self-consistent electrostatics limit the subthreshold slope
obtained in such a transistor well above the Boltzmann limit of 60mV/decade at
room temperature, but much below the results experimentally shown till date,
indicating room for technological improvement of bilayer graphene.
