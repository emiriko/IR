This article summarizes the Quantum Bayesian point of view of quantum
mechanics, with special emphasis on the view's outer edges---dubbed QBism.
QBism has its roots in personalist Bayesian probability theory, is crucially
dependent upon the tools of quantum information theory, and most recently, has
set out to investigate whether the physical world might be of a type sketched
by some false-started philosophies of 100 years ago (pragmatism, pluralism,
nonreductionism, and meliorism). Beyond conceptual issues, work at Perimeter
Institute is focused on the hard technical problem of finding a good
representation of quantum mechanics purely in terms of probabilities, without
amplitudes or Hilbert-space operators. The best candidate representation
involves a mysterious entity called a symmetric informationally complete
quantum measurement. Contemplation of it gives a way of thinking of the Born
Rule as an addition to the rules of probability theory, applicable when an
agent considers gambling on the consequences of his interactions with a newly
recognized universal capacity: dimension (formerly Hilbert-space dimension).
(The word "capacity" should conjure up an image of something like gravitational
mass---a body's mass measures its capacity to attract other bodies. With
hindsight one can say that the founders of quantum mechanics discovered another
universal capacity, "dimension.") The article ends by showing that the
egocentric elements in QBism represent no impediment to pursuing quantum
cosmology and outlining some directions for future work.
