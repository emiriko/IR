The detailed mathematical model of heat and mass transfer of steel ingot of
curvilinear continuous casting machine is proposed. The process of heat and
mass transfer is described by nonlinear partial differential equations of
parabolic type. Position of phase boundary is determined by Stefan conditions.
The temperature of cooling water in mould channel is described by a special
balance equation. Boundary conditions of secondary cooling zone include radiant
and convective components of heat exchange and account for the complex
mechanism of heat-conducting due to airmist cooling using compressed air and
water. Convective heat-transfer coefficient of secondary cooling zone is
unknown and considered as distributed parameter. To solve this problem the
algorithm of initial adjustment of parameter and the algorithm of operative
adjustment are developed.
