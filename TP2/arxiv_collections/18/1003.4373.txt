S5 0716+714 is a well-studied BL Lac object in the sky. Verifying the
existence of correlations among the flux variations in different bands serves
as an important tool to investigate the emission processes. To examine the
possible existence of a lag between variations in different optical bands on
this source, we employ a discrete correlation function (DCF) analysis on the
light curves. In order to obtain statistically meaningful values for the
cross-correlation time lags and their related uncertainties, we perform Monte
Carlo simulations called "flux redistribution/random subset selection"
(FR/RSS). Our analysis confirms that the variations in different optical light
curves are strongly correlated. The time lags show a hint of the variations in
high frequency band leading those in low frequency band of the order of a few
minutes.
