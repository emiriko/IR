For a second-order elliptic equation in divergence form we investigate
conditions on the coefficients which imply that all solutions are Lipschitz
continuous or differentiable at a given point. We assume the coefficients have
modulus of continuity satisfying the square-Dini condition, and obtain
additional conditions that examples show are sharp. Our results extend those of
previous authors who assume the modulus of continuity satisfies the Dini
condition. Our method involves the study of asymptotic properties of solutions
to a dynamical system that is derived from the coefficients of the elliptic
equation.
