DWIA calculations of Lambda-hypernuclear production rates in stopped K-
reactions on several p-shell targets used recently in experiments by the FINUDA
Collaboration are reported. Chirally motivated K- + N -> pion + Lambda
in-medium transition amplitudes are employed and the sensitivity of the
calculated rates to the initial K- atomic wavefunctions and final pion
distorted waves is studied. The calculated rates are compared with measured
rates, wherever available, confirming earlier observations that (i) the
calculated rates are generally lower than the measured rates, and (ii) the
deeper the K- nuclear potential, the worse is the discrepancy. The A dependence
of the calculated 1s Lambda hypernuclear production rates is discussed for the
first time, providing a useful tool in resolving the issue of depth of the K-
nuclear potential near threshold.
