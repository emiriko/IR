The PASTEL catalogue is an update of the [Fe/H] catalogue, published in 1997
and 2001. It is a bibliographical compilation of stellar atmospheric parameters
providing (Teff,logg,[Fe/H]) determinations obtained from the analysis of high
resolution, high signal-to-noise spectra, carried out with model atmospheres.
PASTEL also provides determinations of the one parameter Teff based on various
methods. It is aimed in the future to provide also homogenized atmospheric
parameters and elemental abundances, radial and rotational velocities. A web
interface has been created to query the catalogue on elaborated criteria.
PASTEL is also distributed through the CDS database and VizieR. To make it as
complete as possible, the main journals have been surveyed, as well as the CDS
database, to find relevant publications. The catalogue is regularly updated
with new determinations found in the literature. As of Febuary 2010, PASTEL
includes 30151 determinations of either Teff or (Teff,logg,[Fe/H]) for 16649
different stars corresponding to 865 bibliographical references. Nearly 6000
stars have a determination of the three parameters (Teff,logg,[Fe/H]) with a
high quality spectroscopic metallicity.
