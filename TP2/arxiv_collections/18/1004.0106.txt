We study the propagation of surface electromagnetic waves along the metallic
surface covered by various layered dielectric structures. We show that strong
radiative losses typical for the scattering of the surface wave can be
considerably suppressed when single dielectric step is substituted by gradient
index or periodic layered structure.
