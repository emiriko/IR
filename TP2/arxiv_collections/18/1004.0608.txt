We derive the maximum success probability of the circuits with passive linear
optics for expanding an N-photon W state to an (N + n)-photon W state, by
accessing only one photon of the initial W state and adding n photons in a Fock
state. We show that the maximum success probability is achieved by a
polarization-dependent beamsplitter and n-1 polarization-independent
beamsplitters.
