The cumulative luminosity distribution functions (CLFs) of radio millisecond
pulsars (MSPs) in globular clusters (GCs) and in the Galactic field at a
frequency of 1.4 GHz have been examined. Assuming a functional form, $N \propto
L^q$ where $N$ is the number of MSPs and $L$ is the luminosity at 1.4 GHz, it
is found that the CLFs significantly differ with a steeper slope, $q=-0.83 \pm
0.05$, in GCs than in the Galactic field ($q=-0.48 \pm 0.04$), suggesting a
different formation or evolutionary history of MSPs in these two regions of the
Galaxy. To probe the production mechanism of MSPs in clusters, a search of the
possible relationships between the MSP population and cluster properties was
carried out. The results of an investigation of 9 GCs indicate positive
correlations between the MSP population and the stellar encounter rate and
metallicity. This provides additional evidence suggesting that stellar
dynamical interactions are important in the formation of the MSP population in
GCs.
