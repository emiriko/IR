We predict and analyze {\it radiation-induced quantum interference effect} in
low-dimensional $n$-$p$ junctions. This phenomenon manifests itself by large
oscillations of the photocurrent as a function of the gate voltage or the
frequency of the radiation. The oscillations result from the quantum
interference between two electron paths accompanied by resonant absorption of
photons. They resemble Ramsey quantum beating and Stueckelberg oscillations
well-known in atomic physics. The effect can be observed in one- and
two-dimensional $n$-$p$ junctions based on nanowires, carbon nanotubes,
monolayer or bilayer graphene nanoribbons.
