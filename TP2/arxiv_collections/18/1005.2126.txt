Describing by a Hubbard type of model a thin armchair graphene ribbon in the
armchair hexagon chain limit, one shows in exact terms, that even if the system
does not have flat bands at all, at low concentration a mesoscopic sample can
have ferromagnetic ground state, being metallic in the same time. The mechanism
is connected to a common effect of correlations and confinement.
