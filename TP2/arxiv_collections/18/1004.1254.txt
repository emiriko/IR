Using a two-fluid model for viscoelastic polymer solutions, we study
analytically fluid transport driven by a transverse, small amplitude traveling
wave propagation. The pumping flow far from the waving boundary is shown to be
strongly wave number and viscosity dependent, in contrast to a viscous
Newtonian fluid. We find the two qualitatively different regimes: In one regime
relevant to small wave numbers, the fluidic transport is almost the same as the
Newtonian case, and uniform viscoelastic constitutive equations provide a good
approximation. In the other regime, the pumping is substantially decreased
because of the gel-like character. The boundary separating these two regimes is
clarified. Our results suggest possible needs of two-fluid descriptions for the
transport and locomotion in biological fluids with cilia and flagella.
