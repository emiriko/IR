As the thinnest atomic membrane, graphene presents an opportunity to combine
geometry, elasticity and electronics at the limits of their validity. The
availability of reliable atomistic potentials for graphene allows unprecedented
precise simulations of the mechanical response of atomic membranes. Here we
describe the transport and electronic structure in the neighbourhood of conical
singularities, the elementary excitations of the ubiquitous wrinkled and
crumpled graphene that occur in non-epitaxial suspended samples where shear
stresses are unavoidable. We use a combination of atomistic mechanical
simulations, analytical geometry and transport calculations in curved graphene,
and exact diagonalization of the electronic spectrum to calculate the effects
of geometry on electronic structure, transport and mobility in suspended
samples. We also point out how the geometry-generated pseudo-magnetic/electric
fields might disrupt Landau quantization under a magnetic field.
