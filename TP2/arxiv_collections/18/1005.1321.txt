For baryons composed by the light quarks ($q=u,d$) we write spectral integral
equation using the notion of two diquarks: (i) axial--vector state,
$D^{1}_{1}$, with the spin $S_D=1$ and isospin $I_D=1$ and (ii) scalar one,
$D^{0}_{0}$, with the spin $S_D=0$ and isospin $I_D=0$. We present spectral
integral equations for the $qD^{0}_{0}$ and $qD^{1}_{1}$ states taking into
account quark--diquark confinement interaction.
