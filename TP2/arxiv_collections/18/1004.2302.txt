The spatial distribution of short Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) in their host
galaxies provide us an opportunity to investigate their origins. Based on the
currently observed distribution of short GRBs relative to their host galaxies,
we obtain the fraction of the component that traces the mergers of binary
compact objects and the one that traces star formation rate (such as massive
stars) in early- and late-type host galaxies. We find that the fraction of
massive star component is 0.37\pm 0.13 from the analysis of projected offset
distribution. This suggests that a good fraction of short GRBs still originate
from merger events. From our analysis, we also conclude that the fraction of
late-type hosts among the elliptical, starburst and spiral galaxy is 0.82\pm
0.05, which is consistent with the observed early- to late-type number ratio of
host galaxies.
