We describe implementations for solving the discrete logarithm problem in the
class group of an imaginary quadratic field and in the infrastructure of a real
quadratic field. The algorithms used incorporate improvements over
previously-used algorithms, and extensive numerical results are presented
demonstrating their efficiency. This data is used as the basis for
extrapolations, used to provide recommendations for parameter sizes providing
approximately the same level of security as block ciphers with $80,$ $112,$
$128,$ $192,$ and $256$-bit symmetric keys.
