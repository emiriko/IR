We calculate mean square deviations for crystals in one and two dimensions.
For the two dimensional lattices, we consider several distinct geometries (i.e.
square, triangular, and honeycomb), and we find the same essential phenomena
for each lattice structure. We investigate the stability of long-range
crystalline order for a variety of coupling schemes, including short-range
exponentially decaying inter-atomic potentials and long-range interactions with
a power law dependence r^{-alpha}. For the latter in the 1D case, we find a
critical value alpha_c(1D) = 1.615 +/- 0.005 for the power law decay exponent
below which crystalline order is intact, and above which thermal fluctuations
destroy long-range order when T > 0. The corresponding critical value for two
dimensional lattices with displacements confined to the plane is alpha_c(2D) =
3.15 +/ 0.025. If motion perpendicular to the crystal plane is permitted,
thermally induced distortions diverge rapidly (i.e. linearly) in dual layer
systems with local stiffness provided by an extended coupling scheme, even if
the interaction is long ranged, decaying as a power law in the separation
between lattice sites.
