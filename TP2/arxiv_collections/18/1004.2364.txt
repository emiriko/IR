In (k, n) visual secret sharing (VSS) scheme, secret image can be visually
reconstructed when k or more participants printing theirs shares on
transparencies and stack them together. No secret is revealed with fewer than k
shares. The alignment of the transparencies is important to the visual quality
of the reconstructed secret image. In VSS scheme, each pixel of the original
secret image is expanded to m sub-pixels in a share image. If a share image is
printed on paper with the same size as the original secret image, the alignment
or the registration of the sub-pixels, which is only m times smaller than that
in the original secret, could be troublesome. Liu et al. [4] has noticed this
alignment problem and observed that some information of the secret image may
still be revealed even when the shares are not precisely registered in the
horizontal direction. Yang et al. [9] introduced a general approach to
construct a misalignment tolerant (k, n)-VSS scheme using big and small blocks
for the situation where the original secret image has a certain degree of
redundancy in shape accuracy. In this paper, we propose a (2, n)-VSS scheme
that allows a relative shift between the shares in the horizontal direction and
vertical direction. When the shares are perfectly aligned, the contrast of the
reconstructed image is equal to that of traditional VSS shceme. When there is a
shift, average contrast in the reconstructed image is higher than that of the
traditional VSS scheme, and the scheme can still work in the cases where very
little shape redundancy presents in the image. The trade-off is that our method
involves a larger pixel expansion. The basic building block of our scheme is
duplication and concatenation of certain rows or columns of the basic matrices.
This seemingly simple but very powerful construction principle can be easily
used to create more general (k, n)-VSS schemes.
