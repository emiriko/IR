The concept of a ponderomotive force due to the intrinsic spin of electrons
is developed. An expression containing both the classical as well as the
spin-induced ponderomotive force is derived. The results are used to
demonstrate that an electromagnetic pulse can induce a spin-polarized plasma.
Furthermore, it is shown that for certain parameters, the nonlinear
back-reaction on the electromagnetic pulse from the spin magnetization current
can be larger than that from the classical free current. Suitable parameter
values for a direct test of this effect are presented.
