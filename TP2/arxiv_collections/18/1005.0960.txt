We present a streamlined axiom system of special relativity in first-order
logic. From this axiom system we "derive" an axiom system of general relativity
in two natural steps. We will also see how the axioms of special relativity
transform into those of general relativity. This way we hope to make general
relativity more accessible for the non-specialist.
