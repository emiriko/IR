We obtain an analytic solution for a three-parameter class of logarithmic
potentials at zero energy. The potential terms are products of the inverse
square and the inverse log to powers 2, 1 and 0. The configuration space is the
one-dimensional box. Using point canonical transformation, we simplify the
solution by mapping the problem into the oscillator problem. We also obtain an
approximate analytic solution for non-zero energy when there is strong
attraction to one side of the box. The wavefunction is written in terms of the
confluent hypergeometric function. We also present a numerical scheme to
calculate the energy spectrum for a general configuration and to any desired
accuracy.
