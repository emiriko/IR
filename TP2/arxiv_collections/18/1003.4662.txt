We elaborate the idea of quantum computation through measuring the
correlation of a gapped ground state, while the bulk Hamiltonian is utilized to
stabilize the resource. A simple computational primitive, by pulling out a
single spin adiabatically from the bulk followed by its measurement, is shown
to make any ground state of the one-dimensional isotropic Haldane phase useful
ubiquitously as a quantum logical wire. The primitive is compatible with
certain discrete symmetries that protect this topological order, and the
antiferromagnetic Heisenberg spin-1 finite chain is practically available. Our
approach manifests a holographic principle in that the logical information of a
universal quantum computer can be written and processed perfectly on the edge
state (i.e., boundary) of the system, supported by the persistent entanglement
from the bulk even when the ground state and its evolution cannot be exactly
analyzed.
