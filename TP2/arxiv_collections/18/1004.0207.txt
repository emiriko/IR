The detection of non-Gaussianity in the CMB data would rule out a number of
inflationary models. A null detection of non-Gaussianity, instead, would
exclude alternative models for the early universe. Thus, a detection or
non-detection of primordial non-Gaussianity in the CMB data is crucial to
discriminate among inflationary models, and to test alternative scenarios.
However, there are various non-cosmological sources of non-Gaussianity. This
makes important to employ different indicators in order to detect distinct
forms of non-Gaussianity in CMB data. Recently, we proposed two new indicators
to measure deviation from Gaussianity on large angular scales, and used them to
study the Gaussianity of the raw band WMAP maps with and without the KQ75 mask.
Here we extend this work by using these indicators to perform similar analyses
of deviation from Gaussianity of the foreground-reduced Q, V, and W band maps.
We show that there is a significant deviation from Gaussianity in the
considered full-sky maps, which is reduced to a level consistent with
Gaussianity when the KQ75 mask is employed.
