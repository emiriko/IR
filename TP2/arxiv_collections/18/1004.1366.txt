We derive exact expressions for the Casimir scalar interaction energy between
media-separated eccentric dielectric cylinders and for the media-separated
cylinder-plane geometry using a mode-summation approach. Similarly to the
electromagnetic Casimir-Lifshitz interaction energy between fluid-separated
planar plates, the force between cylinders is attractive or repulsive depending
on the relative values of the permittivities of the three intervening media.
