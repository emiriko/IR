Azurite, Cu3(CO3)2(OH)2, has been considered an ideal example of a
one-dimensional (1D) diamond chain antiferromagnet. Early studies of this
material imply the presence of an ordered antiferromagnetic phase below $T_N
\sim 1.9$ K while magnetization measurements have revealed a 1/3 magnetization
plateau. Until now, no corroborating neutron scattering results have been
published to confirm the ordered magnetic moment structure. We present recent
neutron diffraction results which reveal the presence of commensurate magnetic
order in azurite which coexists with significant magnetoelastic strain. The
latter of these effects may indicate the presence of spin frustration in zero
applied magnetic field. Muon spin rotation, $\mu$SR, reveals an onset of
short-range order below 3K and confirms long-range order below $T_N$.
