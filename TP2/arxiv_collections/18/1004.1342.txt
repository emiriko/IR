We present optical emission-line spectra for outlying HII regions in the
extended neutral gas disk surrounding the blue compact dwarf galaxy NGC 2915.
Using a combination of strong-line R23 and direct oxygen abundance
measurements, we report a flat, possibly increasing, metallicity gradient out
to 1.2 times the Holmberg radius. We find the outer-disk of NGC 2915 to be
enriched to a metallicity of 0.4 Z_solar. An analysis of the metal yields shows
that the outer disk of NGC 2915 is overabundant for its gas fraction, while the
central star-foming core is similarly under-abundant for its gas fraction. Star
formation rates derived from very deep ~14 ks GALEX FUV exposures indicate that
the low-level of star formation observed at large radii is not sufficient to
have produced the measured oxygen abundances at these galactocentric distances.
We consider 3 plausible mechanisms that may explain the metal-enriched outer
gaseous disk of NGC 2915: radial redistribution of centrally generated metals,
strong galactic winds with subsequent fallback, and galaxy accretion. Our
results have implications for the physical origin of the mass-metallicity
relation for gas-rich dwarf galaxies.
