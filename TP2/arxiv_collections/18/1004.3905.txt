This is the second article in a series where we succeed in enlarging the
class of solvable problems in one and three dimensions. We do that by working
in a complete square integrable basis that carries a tridiagonal matrix
representation of the wave operator. Consequently, the wave equation becomes
equivalent to a three-term recursion relation for the expansion coefficients of
the wavefunction in the basis. Finding solutions of the recursion relation is
equivalent to solving the original problem. This method gives a larger class of
solvable potentials. The usual diagonal representation constraint results in a
reduction to the conventional class of solvable potentials. However, the
tridiagonal requirement allows only very few and special potentials to be added
to the solvability class. In the present work, we obtain S-wave solutions for a
three-parameter 1/r singular but short-range potential with a non-orbital
barrier and study its energy spectrum. We argue that it could be used as a more
appropriate model for the screened Coulomb interaction of an electron with
extended molecules. We give also its resonance structure for non-zero angular
momentum. Additionally, we plot the phase shift for an electron scattering off
a molecule modeled by a set of values of the potential parameters.
