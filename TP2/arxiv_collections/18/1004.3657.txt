We develop a formalism to describe quasihole condensates in quantum Hall
liquids and thereby extend the conformal field theory approach to the full
hierarchy of spin-polarized Abelian states, and to several classes of
non-Abelian hierarchical states. Most previously proposed spin-polarized
quantum Hall wave functions appear as special cases. In this paper we explain
the physical motivations for the approach, and exemplify it by explicitly
constructing the level-two quasihole condensate state at filling fraction 2/3,
and the two level-three states at 5/13 and 5/7 which are built from
combinations of quasielectron and quasihole condensates.
