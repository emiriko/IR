Possible alternatives to tri-bimaximal mixing are presented based on other
symmetry principles, and their predictions for |U_{e3}|, sin^2 theta_{12} and
sin^2 theta_{23} are compared to the present neutrino mixing data. In some
cases perturbations are required to give better agreement with the data, and
the use of a minimal approach is illustrated. Precise experimental
determinations of the mixing parameters will be required to decipher the
correct mixing pattern and to pin down the appropriate flavor symmetry.
