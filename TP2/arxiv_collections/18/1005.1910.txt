The impulse approximation (one-body operator) in the n p --> d pi^0 reaction
is reexamined with emphasis on the issues of reducibility and recoil
corrections. An inconsistency when one pion exchange is included in the
production operator is demonstrated and then resolved via the introduction of
"wave function corrections" which nearly vanish for static nucleon propagators.
Inclusion of the recoil corrections to the nucleon propagators is found to
change the magnitude and sign of the impulse production amplitude, worsening
agreement with the experimental cross section by approximately 30%. A cutoff is
used to account for the phenomenological nature of the external wave functions,
and is found to have a significant impact up to approximately 2.5 GeV.
