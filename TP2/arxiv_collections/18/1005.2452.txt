We generalize the class of split graphs to the directed case and show that
these split digraphs can be identified from their degree sequences. The first
degree sequence characterization is an extension of the concept of splittance
to directed graphs, while the second characterization says a digraph is split
if and only if its degree sequence satisfies one of the Fulkerson inequalities
(which determine when an integer-pair sequence is digraphic) with equality.
