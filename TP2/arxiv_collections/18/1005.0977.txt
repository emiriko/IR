Astrophysical sources emit gravitational waves in a large variety of
processes occurred since the beginning of star and galaxy formation. These
waves permeate our high redshift Universe, and form a background which is the
result of the superposition of different components, each associated to a
specific astrophysical process. Each component has different spectral
properties and features that it is important to investigate in view of a
possible, future detection. In this contribution, we will review recent
theoretical predictions for backgrounds produced by extragalactic sources and
discuss their detectability with current and future gravitational wave
observatories.
