If $L/K$ is a finite Galois extension of local fields, we say that the
valuation criterion $VC(L/K)$ holds if there is an integer $d$ such that every
element $x \in L$ with valuation $d$ generates a normal basis for $L/K$.
Answering a question of Byott and Elder, we first prove that $VC(L/K)$ holds if
and only if the tamely ramified part of the extension $L/K$ is trivial and
every non-zero $K[G]$-submodule of $L$ contains a unit. Moreover, the integer
$d$ can take one value modulo $[L:K]$ only, namely $-d_{L/K}-1$, where
$d_{L/K}$ is the valuation of the different of $L/K$. When $K$ has positive
characteristic, we thus recover a recent result of Elder and Thomas, proving
that $VC(L/K)$ is valid for all extensions $L/K$ in this context. When
$\char{\;K}=0$, we identify all abelian extensions $L/K$ for which $VC(L/K)$ is
true, using algebraic arguments. These extensions are determined by the
behaviour of their cyclic Kummer subextensions.
