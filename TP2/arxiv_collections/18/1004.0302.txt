Context. The formation of vortices in accretion disks is of high interest in
various astrophysical contexts, in particular for planet formation or in the
disks of compact objects. But despite numerous attempts it has thus far not
been possible to produce strong vortices in fully three-dimensional simulations
of disks. Aims. The aim of this paper is to present the first 3D simulation of
a strong vortex, established across the vertically stratified structure of a
disk by the Rossby Wave Instability. Methods. Using the Versatile Advection
Code (VAC), we set up a fully 3D cylindrical stratified disk potentially prone
to the Rossby Wave Instability. Results. The simulation confirms the basic
expectations obtained from previous 2D analytic and numerical works. The
simulation exhibits a strong vortex that grows rapidly and saturates at a
finite amplitude. On the other hand the third dimension shows unexpected
additional behaviours that could be of strong importance in the astrophysical
roles that such vortices can play.
