In a density-stratified turbulent medium the cross helicity <u'.B'> is
considered as a result of the interaction of the velocity fluctuations and a
large-scale magnetic field. By means of a quasilinear theory and by numerical
simulations we find the cross helicity and the mean vertical magnetic field
anti-correlated. In the high-conductivity limit the ratio of the helicity and
the mean magnetic field equals the ratio of the magnetic eddy diffusivity and
the (known) density scale height. The result can be used to predict that the
cross helicity at the solar surface exceeds the value of 1 Gauss km/s. Its sign
is anti-correlated with that of the radial mean magnetic field. Alternatively,
we can use our result to determine the value of the turbulent magnetic
diffusivity from observations of the cross helicity.
