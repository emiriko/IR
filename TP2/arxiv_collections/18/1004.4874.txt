All-versus-nothing (AVN) proofs show the conflict between Einstein, Podolsky,
and Rosen's elements of reality and the perfect correlations of some quantum
states. Given an n-qubit state distributed between m parties, we provide a
method with which to decide whether this distribution allows an m-partite AVN
proof specific for this state using only single-qubit measurements. We apply
this method to some recently obtained n-qubit m-particle states. In addition,
we provide all inequivalent AVN proofs with less than nine qubits and a minimum
number of parties.
