The Approach unifying spin and charges, assuming that all the internal
degrees of freedom---the spin, all the charges and the families---originate in
$d > (1+3)$ in only two kinds of spins (the Dirac one and the only one existing
beside the Dirac one and anticommuting with the Dirac one), is offering a new
way in understanding the appearance of the families and the charges (in the
case of charges the similarity with the Kaluza-Klein-like theories must be
emphasized). A simple starting action in $d >(1+3)$ for gauge fields (the
vielbeins and the two kinds of the spin connections) and a spinor (which
carries only two kinds of spins and interacts with the corresponding gauge
fields) manifests after particular breaks of the starting symmetry the massless
four (rather than three) families with the properties as assumed by the
Standard model for the three known families, and the additional four massive
families. The lowest of these additional four families is stable. A part of the
starting action contributes, together with the vielbeins, in the break of the
electroweak symmetry manifesting in $d=(1+3)$ the Yukawa couplings (determining
the mixing matrices and the masses of the lower four families of fermions and
influencing the properties of the higher four families) and the scalar field,
which determines the masses of the gauge fields. The fourth family might be
seen at the LHC, while the stable fifth family might be what is observed as the
dark matter.
