We review here the construction of a translation-invariant scalar model which
was proved to be perturbatively renormalizable on Moyal space. Some general
considerations on nonlocal renormalizability are given. Finally, we present
perspectives for generalizing these quantum field theoretical techniques to
group field theory, a new setting for quantum gravity.
