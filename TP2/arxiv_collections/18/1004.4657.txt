Coherent control of quantum states is at the heart of implementing
solid-state quantum processors and testing quantum mechanics at the macroscopic
level. Despite significant progress made in recent years in controlling single-
and bi-partite quantum systems, coherent control of quantum wave function in
multipartite systems involving artificial solid-state qubits has been hampered
due to the relatively short decoherence time and lacking of precise control
methods. Here we report the creation and coherent manipulation of quantum
states in a tripartite quantum system, which is formed by a superconducting
qubit coupled to two microscopic two-level systems (TLSs). The avoided
crossings in the system's energy-level spectrum due to the qubit-TLS
interaction act as tunable quantum beam splitters of wave functions. Our result
shows that the Landau-Zener-St\"{u}ckelberg interference has great potential in
the precise control of the quantum states in the tripartite system.
