User-driven applications are the programs, in which the full control is given
to the users. Designers of such programs are responsible only for developing an
instrument for solving some task, but they do not enforce users to work with
this instrument according with the predefined scenario. Users' control of the
applications means that only users decide at any moment WHAT, WHEN, and HOW
must appear on the screen. Such applications can be constructed only on the
basis of moveable / resizable elements. Programs, based on such elements, have
very interesting features and open absolutely new possibilities. This article
describes the design of the user-driven applications and shows the consequences
of switching to such type of programs on the samples from different areas.
