Vortex flow remains laminar up to large Reynolds numbers (Re~1000) in a
cylinder filled with 3He-B. This is inferred from NMR measurements and
numerical vortex filament calculations where we study the spin up and spin down
responses of the superfluid component, after a sudden change in rotation
velocity. In normal fluids and in superfluid 4He these responses are turbulent.
In 3He-B the vortex core radius is much larger which reduces both surface
pinning and vortex reconnections, the phenomena, which enhance vortex bending
and the creation of turbulent tangles. Thus the origin for the greater
stability of vortex flow in 3He-B is a quantum phenomenon. Only large flow
perturbations are found to make the responses turbulent, such as the walls of a
cubic container or the presence of invasive measuring probes inside the
container.
