Measurements of spin observables in pp -> {\vec p}{\vec p}\pi^0 are suggested
to remove the phase ambiguity of the threshold amplitude. The suggested
measurements complement the IUCF data on {\vec p}{\vec p} -> pp\pi^0 to
completely determine all the twelve partial wave amplitudes, taken into
consideration by Mayer et.al. [15] and Deepak, Haidenbauer and Hanhart [20].
