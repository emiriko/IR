We present the total cross sections at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO)
in the strong coupling for Higgs production via weak boson fusion. Our results
are obtained via the structure function approach, which builds upon the
approximate, though very accurate, factorization of the QCD corrections between
the two quark lines. The theoretical uncertainty on the total cross sections at
the LHC from higher order corrections and the parton distribution uncertainties
are estimated at the 2% level each for a wide range of Higgs boson masses.
