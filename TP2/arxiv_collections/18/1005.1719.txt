Using data from the Deep Ecliptic Survey (DES), we investigate the
inclination distributions of objects in the Kuiper Belt. We present a
derivation for observational bias removal and use this procedure to generate
unbiased inclination distributions for Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs) of different
DES dynamical classes, with respect to the Kuiper Belt Plane. Consistent with
previous results, we find that the inclination distribution for all DES KBOs is
well fit by the sum of two Gaussians, or a Gaussian plus a generalized
Lorentzian, multiplied by sin i. Approximately 80% of KBOs are in the
high-inclination grouping. We find that Classical object inclinations are well
fit by sin i multiplied by the sum of two Gaussians, with roughly even
distribution between Gaussians of widths 2.0 -0.5/+0.6 degrees and 8.1
-2.1/+2.6 degrees. Objects in different resonances exhibit different
inclination distributions. The inclinations of Scattered objects are best
matched by sin i multiplied by a single Gaussian that is centered at 19.1
-3.6/+3.9 degrees with a width of 6.9 -2.7/+4.1 degrees. Centaur inclinations
peak just below 20 degrees, with one exceptionally high-inclination object near
80 degrees. The currently observed inclination distribution of the Centaurs is
not dissimilar to that of the Scattered Extended KBOs and Jupiter-family
comets, but is significantly different from the Classical and Resonant KBOs.
While the sample sizes of some dynamical classes are still small, these results
should begin to serve as a critical diagnostic for models of Solar System
evolution.
