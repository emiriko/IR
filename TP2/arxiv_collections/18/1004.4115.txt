We derive an algorithm for mutating quivers of 2-CY tilted algebras that have
loops and 2-cycles, under certain specific conditions. Further, we give the
classification of the 2-CY tilted algebras coming from standard algebraic 2-CY
triangulated categories with a finite number of indecomposables. These form a
class of algebras that satisfy the setup for our mutation algorithm.
