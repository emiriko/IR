We demonstrate that the differential magnetic susceptibility of a fractional
quantum Hall disk, representing a Coulomb island in a Fabry--Perot
interferometer, is exactly proportional to the island's conductance and its
paramagnetic peaks are the equilibrium counterparts of the Coulomb blockade
conductance peaks. Using as a thermodynamic potential the partition functions
of the edge states' effective conformal field theory we find the positions of
the Coulomb blockade peaks, when the area of the island is varied, the
modulations of the distance between them as well as the thermal decay and
broadening of the peaks when temperature is increased. The finite-temperature
estimates of the peak's heights and widths could give important information
about the experimental observability of the Coulomb blockade. In addition, the
predicted peak asymmetry and displacement at finite temperature due to neutral
multiplicities could serve to distinguish different fractional quantum Hall
states with similar zero-temperature Coulomb blockade patterns.
