We demonstrate a "bottom up" approach to the computational design of a
multifunctional chemical sensor. General techniques are employed for describing
the adsorption coverage and resistance properties of the sensor based on
density functional theory (DFT) and non-equilibrium Green's function
methodologies (NEGF), respectively. Specifically, we show how Ni and Cu doped
metallic (6,6) single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) may work as effective
multifunctional sensors for both CO and NH3.
