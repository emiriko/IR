We compute the dielectric constant of a Maxwell-Garnett (MG) dielectric
renormalized by radiative corrections at off-resonance frequencies. To this
aim, the self-energy of the dipole constituents of the dielectric is calculated
following Ref.1. The spectrum of coherent emission is obtained in exact form
for the MG model. Contrarily to the common assumption, its expression contains
an only local field factor. Beyond the MG model, leading order corrections due
to recurrent scattering are implemented. Several experiments are proposed to
validate our results in both three and two dimensional samples.
