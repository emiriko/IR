The signcryption is a relatively new cryptographic technique that is supposed
to fulfill the functionalities of encryption and digital signature in a single
logical step. Although several signcryption schemes are proposed over the
years, some of them are proved to have security problems. In this paper, the
security of Han et al.'s signcryption scheme is analyzed, and it is proved that
it has many security flaws and shortcomings. Several devastating attacks are
also introduced to the mentioned scheme whereby it fails all the desired and
essential security attributes of a signcryption scheme.
