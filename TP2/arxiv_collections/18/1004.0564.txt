We show that vacuum induced coherence in three level atomic systems can lead
to preservation of bi-partite entanglement, when two such atoms are prepared as
two initially entangled qubits each independently interacting with their
respective vacuum reservoirs. We explicitly calculate the time evolution of
concurrence for two different Bell states and show that a large amount of
entanglement can survive in the long time limit. The amount of entanglement
left among the two qubits depends strongly on the ratio of the non- orthogonal
transitions in each qubit and can be more than 50%
