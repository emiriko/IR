Two procedures to compute the output distribution phi_S of certain stack
filters S (so called erosion-dilation cascades) are given. One rests on the
disjunctive normal form of S and also yields the rank selection probabilities.
The other is based on inclusion-exclusion and e.g. yields phi_S for some
important LULU-operators S. Properties of phi_S can be used to characterize
smoothing properties of S. One of the methods discussed also allows for the
calculation of the reliability polynomial of any positive Boolean function
(e.g. one derived from a connected graph).
