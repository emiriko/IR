We present the first complete calculation of the one-loop electroweak effect
in the process of semi-inclusive bottom-Higgs production at LHC in the MSSM.
The size of the electroweak contribution depends on the choice of the final
produced neutral Higgs boson, and can be relevant, in some range of the input
parameters. A comparison of the one-loop results obtained in two different
renormalization schemes is also performed, showing a very good NLO scheme
independence. We further comment on two possible, simpler, approximations of
the full NLO result, and on their reliabilty.
