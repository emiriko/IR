Giant electrocaloric (EC) effect is observed in BaTiO3 multilayer thick film
structure. The temperature change is as high as 4.0 oC under an applied
electric field of 352 kV/cm. Most importantly, the EC effect is found to depend
on the varying rate of the applied field. Based on the giant net cooling (~0.37
J/g) resulting from the difference in the varying rates of rising and falling
fields, the kinetic EC effect provides an effective solution for the design of
refrigeration cycle in ferroelectric micro-refrigerator.
