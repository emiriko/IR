This paper considers the state of nuclear and radiological security in the UK
and abroad and reports on the methods that could be employed by terrorists with
radiological or nuclear material to cause destruction. It is shown that despite
current safeguards that problems arise due to materials that are unaccounted
for and poor implementation of detection regimes in some geographical regions.
The prospect of a future terrorist event that involves nuclear or radiological
materials seems likely despite best efforts of prevention.
