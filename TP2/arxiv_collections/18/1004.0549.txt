We have studied the associated production processes of a neutral top-Higgs in
the topcolor assisted technicolor model with a pair of heavy quarks in
\gamma\gamma collisions at the International Linear Collider (ILC). We find
that the cross section for t\bar{t}h_t in \gamma\gamma collisions is at the
level of a few fb with the c.m. energy \sqrt{s}=1000 GeV, which is consistent
with the results of the cross section of t\bar{t}H in the standard model and
the cross section of t\bar{t}h in the minimal supersymmetric standard modeland
the little Higgs models. It should be distinct that hundreds of to thousands of
h_t per year can be produced at the ILC, this process of \gamma\gamma \to
t\bar{t}h_t is really interesting in testing the standard model and searching
the signs of technicolor.
