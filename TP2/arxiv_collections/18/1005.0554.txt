Our models for detecting the effect of adaptation on population genomic
diversity are often predicated on a single newly arisen mutation sweeping
rapidly to fixation. However, a population can also adapt to a new situation by
multiple mutations of similar phenotypic effect that arise in parallel. These
mutations can each quickly reach intermediate frequency, preventing any single
one from rapidly sweeping to fixation globally (a "soft" sweep). Here we study
models of parallel mutation in a geographically spread population adapting to a
global selection pressure. The slow geographic spread of a selected allele can
allow other selected alleles to arise and spread elsewhere in the species
range. When these different selected alleles meet, their spread can slow
dramatically, and so form a geographic patchwork which could be mistaken for a
signal of local adaptation. This random spatial tessellation will dissipate
over time due to mixing by migration, leaving a set of partial sweeps within
the global population. We show that the spatial tessellation initially formed
by mutational types is closely connected to Poisson process models of
crystallization, which we extend. We find that the probability of parallel
mutation and the spatial scale on which parallel mutation occurs is captured by
a single characteristic length that reflects the expected distance a spreading
allele travels before it encounters a different spreading allele. This
characteristic length depends on the mutation rate, the dispersal parameter,
the effective local density of individuals, and to a much lesser extent the
strength of selection. We argue that even in widely dispersing species, such
parallel geographic sweeps may be surprisingly common. Thus, we predict, as
more data becomes available, many more examples of intra-species parallel
adaptation will be uncovered.
