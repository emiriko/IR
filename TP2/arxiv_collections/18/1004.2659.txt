We present the first view of the magnetic field structure in the OH shell of
the extreme OH/IR star OH 26.5+0.6. MERLIN interferometric observations of this
object were obtained in December 1993 in full polarisation, at 1612, 1665 and
1667 MHz. The maser spots show a spheroidal distribution both at 1612 and 1667
MHz, while at 1665 MHz emission from the blue-shifted maser peak is
concentrated on the stellar position, and the red-shifted peak emission
exhibits a filamentary structure oriented on a SE-NW axis. The linear
polarisation in both main lines is rather faint, ranging from 9 to 20% at 1665
MHz and from 0 to 30% at 1667 MHz. At 1612 MHz most maser spots exhibit a
similar range of linear polarisation although those in the outermost parts of
the envelope reach values as high as 66%. This is particularly apparent in the
southern part of the shell. The detailed distribution of the polarisation
vectors could only be obtained at 1612 MHz. The polarisation vectors show a
highly structured distribution indicative of a poloidal magnetic field inclined
by 40-60$^\circ$ to the line of sight. The velocity distribution of the maser
spots with respect to the radial distance is well explained by an isotropic
outflow at constant velocity in the case of a prolate shaped spheroid envelope,
also tilted about 45-65$^\circ$ to the line of sight.
