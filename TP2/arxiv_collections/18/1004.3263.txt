In this paper, we present Digital Rights Management systems (DRMS) which are
becoming more and more complex due to technology revolution in relation with
telecommunication networks, multimedia applications and the reading equipments
(Mobile Phone, IPhone, PDA, DVD Player,..). The complexity of the DRMS,
involves the use of new tools and methodologies that support software
components and hardware components coupled design. The traditional systems
design approach has been somewhat hardware first in that the software
components are designed after the hardware has been designed and prototyped.
This leaves little flexibility in evaluating different design options and
hardware-software mappings. The key of codesign is to avoid isolation between
hardware and software designs to proceed in parallel, with feedback and
interaction between the two as the design progresses, in order to achieve high
quality designs with a reduced design time. In this paper, we present the F4MS
(Framework for Mixed Systems) which is a unified framework for software and
hardware design environment, simulation and aided execution of mixed systems.
To illustrate this work we propose an implementation of DRMS business model
based on F4MS framework.
