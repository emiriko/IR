We present here a simple analytical model for self-oscillations in
nano-electro-mechanical systems. We show that a field emission self-oscillator
can be described by a lumped electrical circuit and that this approach is
generalizable to other electromechanical oscillator devices. The analytical
model is supported by dynamical simulations where the electrostatic parameters
are obtained by finite element computations.
