In this research-paper, many of the general-relativity-tests such as bending
of light near a star and gravitational red/blue shift are explained without
general-relativity & even without Newtonian-approach. The authors first raise
questions on the validity of both, the Newtonian and the relativistic approach;
and then propose a novel alternative-explanation. The new alternative
explanation is based on refraction-phenomenon of optics. Estimation of results
with new approach are in agreement with known values. Though physics is
different, but it is argued that general-relativity based gravitational-bending
and refraction based bending have more in common than is generally realized.
Also discussed are black-hole and gravitational-lensing in the new perspective
of refraction. The new refraction-based theory makes a few new predictions and
also suggests a few tests.
