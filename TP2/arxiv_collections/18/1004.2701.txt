Restrictions to molecular motion by barriers (membranes) are ubiquitous in
biological tissues, porous media and composite materials. A major challenge is
to characterize the microstructure of a material or an organism
nondestructively using a bulk transport measurement. Here we demonstrate how
the long-range structural correlations introduced by permeable membranes give
rise to distinct features of transport. We consider Brownian motion restricted
by randomly placed and oriented permeable membranes and focus on the
disorder-averaged diffusion propagator using a scattering approach. The
renormalization group solution reveals a scaling behavior of the diffusion
coefficient for large times, with a characteristically slow inverse square root
time dependence. The predicted time dependence of the diffusion coefficient
agrees well with Monte Carlo simulations in two dimensions. Our results can be
used to identify permeable membranes as restrictions to transport in disordered
materials and in biological tissues, and to quantify their permeability and
surface area.
