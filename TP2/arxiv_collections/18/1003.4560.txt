The nature of the Lambda(1405) is discussed based on the unitarised
coupled-channels approach with chiral dynamics (chiral unitary model). This
approach describes the Kbar N scattering cross sections and the Lambda(1405)
spectra phenomenologically very well. With this successful description of
Lambda(1405), it is found that the Lambda(1405) is composed by two resonance
states having different coupling nature to the meson-baryon states. As a
consequence, the resonance position in the pi Sigma invariant mass spectrum
depends on the initial channel of the Lambda(1405) production. To observe the
Lambda(1405) initiated by the Kbar N channel, K^- d to Lambda(1405) n is one of
the most favorable reactions. Hadronic molecule states with kaons are also
discussed by emphasizing an important role of Lambda(1405) as a quasibound
state of Kbar N.
