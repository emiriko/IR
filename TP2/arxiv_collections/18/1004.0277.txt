Mesoscopic molecular dynamics simulations are used to determine the large
scale structure of several binary polymer mixtures of various chemical
architecture, concentration, and thermodynamic conditions. By implementing an
analytical formalism, which is based on the solution to the Ornstein-Zernike
equation, each polymer chain is mapped onto the level of a single soft colloid.
From the appropriate closure relation, the effective, soft-core potential
between coarse-grained units is obtained and used as input to our mesoscale
simulations. The potential derived in this manner is analytical and explicitly
parameter dependent, making it general and transferable to numerous systems of
interest. From computer simulations performed under various thermodynamic
conditions the structure of the polymer mixture, through pair correlation
functions, is determined over the entire miscible region of the phase diagram.
In the athermal regime mesoscale simulations exhibit quantitative agreement
with united atom simulations. Furthermore, they also provide information at
larger scales than can be attained by united atom simulations and in the
thermal regime approaching the phase transition.
