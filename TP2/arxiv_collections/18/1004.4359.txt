This paper introduced NgViz, a tool that examines DNS traffic and shows
anomalies in n-gram frequencies. This is accomplished by comparing input files
against a fingerprint of legitimate traffic. Both quantitative analysis and
visual aids are provided that allow the user to make determinations about the
legitimacy of the DNS traffic.
