We present preliminary observational results of the multi-site STEPHI
campaign on the cluster NGC 1817. The three observatories involved are San
Pedro Martir (Mexico), Xing Long (China) and the Observatorio del Teide (Spain)
- giving an ideal combination to maximise the duty cycle. The cluster has 12
known delta Scuti stars and at least two detached eclipsing binary systems.
This combination of characteristics is ideal for extracting information about
global parameters of the targets, which will in turn impose strict constraints
on the stellar models. From an initial comparison with stellar models using the
known fundamental parameters, and just the observed pulsation frequencies and
measured effective temperatures, it appears that a lower value of initial
helium mass fraction will most likely explain the observations of these stars.
