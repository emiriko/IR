We present the results of our $^{13}$C NMR study of the quasi-two-dimensional
organic conductor $\theta$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$I$_{3}$ under pressure, which is
suggested to be a zero-gap conductor by transport measurements. We found that
NMR spin shift is proportional to $T$ and that spin-lattice relaxation rate
follows the power law $T^{\alpha}$ ($\alpha =3 \sim 4$), where $T$ is the
temperature. This behavior is consistent with the cone-like band dispersion and
provides microscopic evidence for the realization of the zero-gap state in the
present material under pressure.
