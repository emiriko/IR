We propose a realistic generalization of the Maki-Thompson rumour model by
assuming that each spreader ceases to propagate the rumour right after being
involved in a random number of stifling experiences. We consider the process
with a general initial configuration and establish the asymptotic behaviour
(and its fluctuation) of the ultimate proportion of ignorants as the population
size grows to $\infty$. Our approach leads to explicit formulas so that the
limiting proportion of ignorants and its variance can be computed.
