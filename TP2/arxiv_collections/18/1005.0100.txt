The Large Area Telescope on the Fermi gamma-ray Space Telescope provides
unprecedented sensitivity for all-sky monitoring of gamma-ray activity. It has
detected a few Galactic sources, including 2 gamma-ray binaries and a
microquasar. In addition, it is an adequate telescope to detect other transient
sources. The observatory scans the entire sky every three hours and allows a
general search for flaring activity on daily timescales. This search is
conducted automatically as part of the ground processing of the data and allows
a fast response to transient events, typically less than a day. Most of the
outbursts detected are spatially associated with known blazars, but in several
cases during the first years of observations, gamma-ray flares occurring near
the Galactic plane did not reveal any initially compelling counterparts. This
prompted follow-up observations in X-ray, optical, and radio to attempt to
identify the origin of the emission and probe the possible existence of a class
of transient gamma-ray sources in the Galaxy. Here we report on these LAT
events and the results of the multiwavelength counterpart searches.
