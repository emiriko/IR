We introduce a new class of exchange-correlation potentials for a static and
time-dependent Density Functional Theory of strongly correlated systems in 3D.
The potentials are obtained via Dynamical Mean Field Theory and, for strong
enough interactions, exhibit a discontinuity at half filling density, a
signature of the Mott transition. For time-dependent perturbations, the
dynamics is described in the adiabatic local density approximation. Results
from the new scheme compare very favorably to exact ones in clusters. As an
application, we study Bloch oscillations in the 3D Hubbard model.
