We consider a first important parameter of spicules as observed above the
solar visible limb: their apparent diameter as a function of the height above
the limb which determines their aspect ratio and leads to the discussion of
their magnetic origin using the flux tube approximation. We found that indeed
spicules show a whole range of diameters, including unresolved "interacting
spicules" (I-S), depending of the definition chosen to characterize this
ubiquitous dynamical phenomenon occurring into a low coronal surrounding. 1-D
Fourier amplitude spectra (AS) made at different heights above the limb are
shown for the first time. A definite signature in the 0.18 to 0.25 Mm range
exists, corresponding to the occurrence of the newly discovered type II
spicules and, even more impressively, large Fourier amplitudes are observed in
the 0.3 to the 1.2 Mm range of diameters and spacing, in rough agreement with
what historical works were reporting. Additionally, some statistically
significant behavior, based on AS computed for different heights above the
limb, is discussed. "Time slice or x-t diagrams" revealing the dynamical
behavior of spicules are also analyzed. They show that most of spicules have
multiple structures (similarly to the doublet spicules) and they show
impressive transverse periodic fluctuations which were interpreted as upward
kink or Alfven waves. Evidence of the helical motion in spicules is now well
evidenced, the typical periods of the apparent oscillation being around 120
sec. A fine analysis of the time-slice diagram as a function of the effective
heights shows an interesting new feature near the 2 Mm height. We speculate on
the interpretation of this feature as being a result of the dynamical
specificities of the spicule helical motion as seen in these unprecedented high
resolution HCaII line emission time series.
