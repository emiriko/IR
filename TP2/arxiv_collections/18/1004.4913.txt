Scanning probe imaging and manipulation of matter is of crucial importance
for nanoscale science and technology. However, its resolution and ability to
manipulate matter at the atomic scale is limited by rather poor control over
the fine structure of the probe. In the present communication, a strategy is
proposed to construct a molecular nanomanipulator from ultrathin single-walled
carbon nanotubes. Covalent modification of a nanotube cap at predetermined
atomic sites makes the nanotube act as a support for a functional "tool-tip"
molecule. Then, a small bundle of nanotubes (3 or 4) with aligned ends can act
as an extremely high aspect ratio parallel nanomanipulator for a suspended
molecule, where protraction or retraction of individual nanotubes results in
controlled tilting of the tool-tip in two dimensions. Together with the usual
SPM three degrees of freedom and augmented with rotation of the system as a
whole, the design offers six degrees of freedom for imaging and manipulation of
matter with precision and freedom so much needed for advanced nanotechnology. A
similar design might be possible to implement with other high-aspect ratio
nanostructures, such as oxide nanowires.
