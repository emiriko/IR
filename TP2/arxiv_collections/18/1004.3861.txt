The idea that the dynamics of a spin is determined by the size of its
neighbouring domains was recently introduced (S. Biswas and P. Sen, Phys. Rev.
E {\bf 80}, 027101 (2009)) in a Ising spin model
  (henceforth, referred to as model I).
  A parameter $p$ is now defined to modify the dynamics such that a spin can
sense domain sizes up to $R = pL/2$ in a one dimensional system of size $L$.
For the cutoff factor $p$ \to 0$, the dynamics is Ising like and the domains
grow with time $t$ diffusively as $ t^{1/z}$ with $z=2$, while for $p=1$, the
original model I showed ballistic dynamics with $z \simeq 1$. For intermediate
values of $p$, the domain growth, magnetisation and persistence show model I
like behaviour up to a macroscopic crossover time $ t_1 \sim pL/2$. Beyond
$t_1$, characteristic power law variations of the dynamic quantities are no
longer observed. The total time to reach equilibrium is found to be $t = apL +
b(1-p)^3L^2$, from which we conclude that the later time behaviour is
diffusive. We also consider the case when a random but quenched value of $p$ is
used for each spin for which ballistic behaviour is once again obtained.
