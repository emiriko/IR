We show in this Letter that the ground state degeneracy associated with the
presence of non-Abelian anyons can be probed by using an adiabatic cooling
process based on the non-Abelian entropy. In particular, we show that when the
number of such anyons is increased adiabatically at sufficiently low
temperatures, the non-Abelian liquid undergoes cooling, whereas heating occurs
in the Abelian case. Estimates are provided for the cooling power produced by
the non-Abelian anyon refrigerator, and its implementation in non-Abelian
fractional quantum Hall liquids is discussed.
