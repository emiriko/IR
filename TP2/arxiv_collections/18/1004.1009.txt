The free Baker-Akhiezer modules on rational varieties obtained from ${\mathbb
C}P^{1}\times{\mathbb C}P^{n-1}$ by identification of two hypersurfaces are
constructed. The corollary of this construction is the existence of embedding
of meromorphic function ring with some fixed pole into the ring of matrix
differential operators in $n$ variables.
