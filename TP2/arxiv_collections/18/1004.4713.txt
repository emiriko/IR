Protocol sequences are used in channel access for the multiple-access
collision channel without feedback. A new construction of protocol sequences
with a guarantee of worst-case system throughput is proposed. The construction
is based on Chinese remainder theorem. The Hamming crosscorrelation is proved
to be concentrated around the mean. The sequence period is much shorter than
existing protocol sequences with the same throughput performance. The new
construction reduces the complexity in implementation and also shortens the
waiting time until a packet can be sent successfully.
