We report on the development of a GEM-based TPC prototype for the PANDA
experiment. The design and requirements of this device will be illustrated,
with particular emphasis on the properties of the recently tested GEM-detector,
the characterization of the read-out electronics and the development of the
tracking software that allows to evaluate the GEM-TPC data.
