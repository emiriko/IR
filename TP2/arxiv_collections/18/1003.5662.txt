We discuss possible signatures of Asymmetric Dark Matter (ADM) through dark
matter decays to neutrinos. We specifically focus on scenarios in which the
Standard Model (SM) baryon asymmetry is transferred to the dark sector (DS)
through higher dimensional operators in chemical equilibrium. In such cases,
the dark matter (DM) carries lepton and/or baryon number, and we point out that
for a wide range of quantum number assignments, by far the strongest
constraints on dark matter decays come from decays to neutrinos through the
"neutrino portal" operator HL. Together with the facts that ADM favors lighter
DM masses ~ a few GeV and that the decays would lead only to anti-neutrinos and
no neutrinos (or vice versa), the detection of such decays at neutrino
telescopes would provide compelling evidence for ADM. We discuss current and
future bounds on models where the DM decays to neutrinos through operators of
dimension <= 6. For dimension 6 operators, the scale suppressing the decay is
bounded to be >~ 10^12 - 10^13 GeV.
