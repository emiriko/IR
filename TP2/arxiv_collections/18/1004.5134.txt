(Abridged) Based on UV to X-ray and radio to UV flux ratios, some argue that
low ionization emission line regions (LINERs) and low luminosity AGN (LLAGN)
are a scaled-down version of their more luminous predecessors Seyfert galaxies.
Others, based on the lack of X-ray short (hours) time-scale variability, the
non-detection of an iron line at 6.4 keV, and the faint UV emission, suggest
the truncation of the classical thin accretion disk in the inner regions of the
AGN where a radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) structure forms. We
investigate the LINER-Seyfert connection by studying the unabsorbed, AGN
powered, LINER galaxy NGC 4278. We analyzed one XMM-Newton and seven Chandra
X-ray observations of NGC 4278 spread over a three year period. We detected a
flux increase by a factor of ~3 on a ~3 months time-scale and by a factor of 5
between the faintest and the brightest observation separated by ~3 years.
During only the XMM-Newton observation, where the highest flux level is
detected, we found a 10% flux increase on a ~1 hour time-scale. A combination
of an absorbed power law (N(H)~10^20 cm^-2, Gamma~2.2) plus a thermal component
(kT~0.6 keV) were able to fit the Chandra spectra. The XMM-Newton spectra,
where the highest X-ray flux is detected, are well fitted with a single
absorbed power-law. No Fe K(alpha) emission line is detected at 6.4 keV. We
constructed SEDs based on simultaneous or quasi simultaneous observations and
compared them to LINER, radio-loud, and radio-quiet quasar SEDs. We find that
at a low X-ray flux the NGC 4278 SED resembles that of typical LINER sources
where the radio to X-ray emission can be considered as originating from a jet
and/or RIAF, whereas at a high X-ray flux, NGC 4278 SED is more like a low
luminosity Seyfert SED. Consequently, NGC 4278 could exhibit both LINER and
Seyfert nuclear activity depending on the strength of its X-ray emission.
