The goal of this article is to understand some interesting features of
sequences of arbitrage operations, which look relevant to various processes in
Economics and Finances. In the second part of the paper, analysis of sequences
of arbitrages is reformulated in the linear algebra terms. This admits an
elegant geometric interpretation of the problems under consideration linked to
the asynchronous systems theory. We feel that this interpretation will be
useful in understanding more complicated, and more realistic, mathematical
models in economics.
