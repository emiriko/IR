Production of very high magnetic fields in the laboratory has relentlessly
increased in quantity and quality over the last five decades, and a shift
occurred from research focused in magnet technology to studies of the
fundamental physics of novel materials in high fields. New strategies designed
to understand microscopic mechanisms at play in materials surfaced, with
methods to extract fundamental energy scales and thermodynamic properties from
thermal probes up to 60 Tesla. Here we summarize developments in the area of
specific heat of materials in high magnetic fields, with focus in the original
study of the Kondo Insulator system Ce3Bi4Pt3.
