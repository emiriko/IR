The application of a classical approach to various quantum problems - the
secular perturbation approach to quantization of a hydrogen atom in external
fields and a helium atom, the adiabatic switching method for calculation of a
semiclassical spectrum of hydrogen atom in crossed electric and magnetic
fields, a spontaneous decay of excited states of a hydrogen atom, Gutzwiller's
approach to Stark problem, long-lived excited states of a helium atom recently
discovered with the help of Poincar$\acute{\mathrm{e}}$ section, inelastic
transitions in slow and fast electron-atom and ion-atom collisions - is
reviewed. Further, a classical representation in quantum theory is discussed.
In this representation the quantum states are treating as an ensemble of
classical states. This approach opens the way to an accurate description of the
initial and final states in classical trajectory Monte Carlo (CTMC) method and
a purely classical explanation of tunneling phenomenon. The general aspects of
the structure of the semiclassical series such as renormgroup symmetry,
criterion of accuracy and so on are reviewed as well. In conclusion, the
relation between quantum theory, classical physics and measurement is
discussed.
