In the present article we find a new class of solutions of Einstein's field
equations. It describes stationary, cylindrically symmetric spacetimes with
closed timelike geodesics everywhere outside the symmetry axis. These
spacetimes contain a magnetic field parallel to the axis, a perfect fluid with
constant density and pressure, and Lorentz invariant vacuum with energy density
represented by a negative cosmological constant.
