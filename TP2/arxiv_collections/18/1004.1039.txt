The white-light continuum emission of a solar flare remains a puzzle as
regards its height of formation and its emission mechanism(s). This continuum,
and its extension into the near UV, contain the bulk of the energy radiated by
a flare, and so its explanation is a high priority. We describe a method to
determine the optical depth of the emitting layer and apply it to the
well-studied flare of 2002 July~15, making use of MDI pseudo-continuum
intensity images. We find the optical depth of the visible continuum in all
flare images, including an impulsive ribbon structure to be small, consistent
with the observation of Balmer and Paschen edges in other events.
