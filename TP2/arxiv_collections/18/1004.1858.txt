Most of Calabi-Yau manifolds that have been considered by physicists are
complete intersection Calabi-Yau manifolds of toric varieties or some quotients
of product types. Purpose of this paper is to introduce a different and rather
new kind of construction method of Calabi-Yau manifolds by pasting two
non-compact Calabi-Yau manifolds. We will also in some details explain a
curious and mysterious similarity with construction of some $G_2$-manifolds
(also called Joyce manifolds), which are base spaces for M-theory.
