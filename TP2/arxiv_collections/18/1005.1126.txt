We propose a scheme for efficient cluster state quantum computation by using
imperfect polarization-entangled photon-pair sources, linear optical elements
and inefficient non-photon-number-resolving detectors. The efficiency threshold
for loss tolerance in our scheme requires the product of source and detector
efficiencies should be >1/2 - the best known figure. This figure applies to
uncorrelated loss. We further find that the loss threshold is unaffected by
correlated loss in the photon pair source. Our approach sheds new light on
efficient linear optical quantum computation with imperfect experimental
conditions.
