The production of hadrons in heavy ions collisions at high $p_T$ provides an
important information on mechanism of particle formation and constituent energy
loss in medium. Such information is needed for search of a Critical Point and
signatures of phase transition. Measurements by the STAR Collaboration of
charged hadron production in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt {s_{NN}}$=9.2 GeV over
a wide transverse momentum $p_T=0.2-4.$ GeV/c and at mid-rapidity range are
reported. It allows for a first measurement of the spectra for charged hadrons
at high $p_T$ at this energy. The spectra demonstrate the dependence on
centrality which enhances with $p_T$. The constituent energy loss and its
dependence on transverse momentum of particle, and centrality of collisions are
estimated in the $z$-scaling approach.
