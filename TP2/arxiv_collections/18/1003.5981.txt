We prove that many aspects of the differential geometry of embedded
Riemannian manifolds can be formulated in terms of a multi-linear algebraic
structure on the space of smooth functions. In particular, we find algebraic
expressions for Weingarten's formula, the Ricci curvature and the
Codazzi-Mainardi equations.
