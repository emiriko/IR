We present results of direct imaging observations for HAT-P-7 taken with the
Subaru HiCIAO and the Calar Alto AstraLux. Since the close-in transiting planet
HAT-P-7b was reported to have a highly tilted orbit, massive bodies such as
giant planets, brown dwarfs, or a binary star are expected to exist in the
outer region of this system. We show that there are indeed two candidates for
distant faint stellar companions around HAT-P-7. We discuss possible roles
played by such companions on the orbital evolution of HAT-P-7b. We conclude
that as there is a third body in the system as reported by Winn et al. (2009,
ApJL, 763, L99), the Kozai migration is less likely while planet-planet
scattering is possible.
