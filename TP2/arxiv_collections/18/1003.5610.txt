We introduce and investigate by numerical simulations a number of models of
emotional agents at the square lattice. Our models describe the most general
features of emotions such as the spontaneous emotional arousal, emotional
relaxation, and transfers of emotions between different agents. Group emotions
in the considered models are periodically fluctuating between two opposite
valency levels and as result the mean value of such group emotions is zero. The
oscillations amplitude depends strongly on probability ps of the individual
spontaneous arousal. For small values of relaxation times tau we observed a
stochastic resonance, i.e. the signal to noise ratio SNR is maximal for a
non-zero ps parameter. The amplitude increases with the probability p of local
affective interactions while the mean oscillations period increases with the
relaxation time tau and is only weakly dependent on other system parameters.
Presence of emotional antenna can enhance positive or negative emotions and for
the optimal transition probability the antenna can change agents emotions at
longer distances. The stochastic resonance was also observed for the influence
of emotions on task execution efficiency.
