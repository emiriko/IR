Superselection rules (SSRs) constrain the allowed states and operations in
quantum theory. They limit preparations and measurements hence impact upon our
ability to observe non-locality, in particular the violation of Bell
inequalities. We show that a reference frame compatible with a particle number
SSR does not allow observers to violate a Bell inequality if and only if it is
prepared using only local operations and classical communication. In
particular, jointly prepared separable reference frames are sufficient for
obtaining violations of a Bell inequality. We study the size and non-local
properties of such reference frames using superselection-induced variance.
These results suggest the need for experimental Bell tests in the presence of
superselection.
