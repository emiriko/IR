We derive the integrability conditions of nonautonomous nonlinear
Schr$\rm\ddot o$dinger equations using the Lax Pair and Similarity
Transformation methods. We present a comparative analysis of these
integrability conditions with those of the Painlev$\rm\acute{e}$ method. We
show that while the Painlev$\rm\acute{e}$ integrability conditions restrict the
dispersion, nonlinearity, and dissipation/gain coefficients to be
space-independent and the external potential to be only a quadratic function of
position, the Lax Pair and the Similarity Transformation methods allow for
space-dependent coefficients and an external potential that is not restricted
to the quadratic form. The integrability conditions of the
Painlev$\rm\acute{e}$ method are retrieved as a special case of our general
integrability conditions. We also derive the integrability conditions of
nonautonomous nonlinear Schr$\rm\ddot o$dinger equations for two- and
three-spacial dimensions.
