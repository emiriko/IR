We present a family of exact analytic solutions for non-linear quantum
dynamics of a two-level system (TLS) subject to a periodic-in-time external
field. In constructing the exactly solvable models, we use a "reverse
engineering" approach where the form of external perturbation is chosen to
preserve an integrability constraint, which yields a single non-linear
differential equation for the ac-field. A solution to this equation is
expressed in terms of Jacobi elliptic functions with three independent
parameters that allows one to choose the frequency, average value, and
amplitude of the time-dependent field at will. This form of the ac-drive is
especially relevant to the problem of dynamics of TLS charge defects that cause
dielectric losses in superconducting qubits. We apply our exact results to
analyze non-linear dielectric response of such TLSs and show that the position
of the resonance peak in the spectrum of the relevant correlation function is
determined by the quantum-mechanical phase accumulated by the TLS wave-function
over a time evolution cycle. It is shown that in the non-linear regime, this
resonance frequency may be shifted strongly from the value predicted by the
canonical TLS model. We also analyze the "spin" survival probability in the
regime of strong external drive and recover a coherent destruction of tunneling
phenomenon within our family of exact solutions, which manifests itself as a
strong suppression of "spin-flip" processes and suggests that such non-linear
dynamics in LC-resonators may lead to lower losses.
