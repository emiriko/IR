In the N=1 supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model, neutralinos
associated in supermultiplets with the neutral electroweak gauge and Higgs
bosons are, as well as gluinos, Majorana fermions. They can be paired with the
Majorana fermions of novel gaugino/scalar supermultiplets, as suggested by
extended N=2 supersymmetry, to Dirac particles. Matter fields are not extended
beyond the standard N=1 supermultiplets in N=1/N=2 hybrid supersymmetry to
preserve the chiral character of the theory. Complementing earlier analyses in
the color sector, central elements of such an electroweak scenario are analyzed
in the present study. The decay properties of the Dirac fermions and of the
scalar bosons are worked out, and the single and pair production channels of
the new particles are described for proton collisions at the LHC, and
electron/positron and photon-photon collisions at linear colliders. Special
attention is paid to modifications of the Higgs sector, identified with an N=2
hypermultiplet, by the mixing with the novel electroweak scalar sector.
