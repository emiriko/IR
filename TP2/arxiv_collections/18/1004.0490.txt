Direct comparisons between statistically sound simulations of ion-tracks and
published experimental measurements of range densities of iodine implants in
uranium dioxide have been made with implant energies in the range of 100-800
keV. Our simulations are conducted with REED-MD (Rare Event Enhanced
Domain-following Molecular Dynamics) in order to account for the materials
structure in both single crystalline and polycrystalline experimental samples.
We find near-perfect agreement between REED-MD results and experiments for
polycrystalline target materials.
