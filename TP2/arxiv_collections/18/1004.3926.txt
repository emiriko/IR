Several models of the electronic spectrum in the pseudogap state of
underdoped cuprates have been proposed to explain ARPES and STM measurements,
which reveal only truncated Fermi pockets instead of a full metallic Fermi
surface. We consider the transport properties expected of four physically
distinct models, and calculate the thermal and electrical conductivity of the
electronic quasiparticles. By proposing transport currents that reflect the
close correspondence between quasiparticles on the Fermi pockets in the
pseudogap and those near nodes in the superconducting state, we show that
measurable transport coefficients provide stringent tests of pseudogap models.
