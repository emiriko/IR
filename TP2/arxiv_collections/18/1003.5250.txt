We consider two different quantizations of the character variety consisting
of all representations of surface groups in SL_2. One is the skein algebra
considered by Przytycki-Sikora and Turaev. The other is the quantum Teichmuller
space introduced by Chekhov-Fock and Kashaev. We construct a homomorphism from
the skein algebra to the quantum Teichmuller space which, when restricted the
classical case, corresponds to the equivalence between these two algebras
through trace functions.
