A study is presented of the $s-$wave meson-meson interactions involving
members of the $\rho-$nonet and of the $\pi-$octet. The starting point is an
SU(6) spin-flavor extension of the SU(3) flavor Weinberg-Tomozawa Lagrangian.
SU(6) symmetry breaking terms are then included to account for the physical
meson masses and decay constants, while preserving partial conservation of the
axial current in the light pseudoscalar sector. Next, the $T-$matrix amplitudes
are obtained by solving the Bethe Salpeter equation in coupled-channel with the
kernel built from the above interactions. The poles found on the first and
second Riemann sheets of the amplitudes are identified with their possible
Particle Data Group (PDG) counterparts. It is shown that most of the low-lying
even parity PDG meson resonances, specially in the $J^P=0^+$ and $1^+$ sectors,
can be classified according to multiplets of the spin-flavor symmetry group
SU(6). The $f_0(1500)$, $f_1(1420)$ and some $0^+(2^{++})$ resonances cannot be
accommodated within this SU(6) scheme and thus they would be clear candidates
to be glueballs or hybrids. Finally, we predict the existence of five exotic
resonances ($I \ge 3/2$ and/or $|Y|=2$) with masses in the range 1.4--1.6 GeV,
which would complete the $27_1$, $10_3$, and $10_3^*$ multiplets of
SU(3)$\otimes$SU(2).
