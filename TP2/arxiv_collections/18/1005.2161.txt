In this paper, we reconsider some results by Nieto and Truax about generating
functions for arbitrary order coherent and squeezed states. These results were
obtained using the exponential of the Laplacian operator; more elaborated
operational identities were used by Dattoli et al. \cite{Dattoli} to extend
these results. In this note, we show that the operational approach can be
replaced by a purely probabilistic approach, in the sense that the exponential
of derivatives operators can be identified with equivalent expectation
operators. This approach brings new insight about the kinks between operational
and probabilistic calculus.
