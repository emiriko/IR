T-odd distributions like Sivers and Boer-Mulders functions are normally
modeled using few-body models. In the present work I want to follow the
completely opposite point of view, and study a high-energy proton-proton
Drell-Yan where both the annihilating partons are wee, and one (at least) comes
from a high-order Fok state of the parent proton, i.e. a state where a large
number N of partons is present. I show that rescattering between active and
spectator partons is modified, with suppression of those terms that are needed
to build T-odd parton distributions.
