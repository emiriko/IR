Based on the steady state equilibrium condition for
neutron-proton-electron-positron gas in the neutrino-driven wind from
protoneutron star, we estimate the initial electron fraction in the wind in a
simple and effective way. We find that the condition in the wind might be
propriate for the r-process nucleosynthesis.
