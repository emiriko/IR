The Vafa-Witten arguments on the realization of parity and flavour symmetries
in the QCD vacuum do not apply to two lattice regularizations of QCD which are
able to reproduce the chiral anomaly: Wilson fermions and Ginsparg-Wilson
fermions. We show here how using the last regularization one can get, from
first principles, that the more standard order parameters for these symmetries
take a vanishing vacuum expectation value for any number of flavours, if quarks
have a non-vanishing mass.
