We suggest a model for the magnetic dynamics of - plutonium and its alloys in
order to show that the dynamical fluctuations of the magnetization density, or
spin fluctuations, may be responsible for the anomalies of their observed
thermal expansion. We show that due to strong magneto-elastic coupling, spin
fluctuations may essentially contribute to the volume strain by giving a
negative magneto-volume contribution that is proportional to the squared local
magnetic moment and the magnetic Gruneisen constant which is negative in -
plutonium. In the presented model, the local magnetic moment increases as the
temperature rises, resulting in the interplay between the positive
contributions to the volume strain from the lattice and the negative
contribution from spin fluctuations, and finally leads to the Invar anomaly or
to the negative coefficient of thermal expansion. Our results agree closely
with the measured thermal expansion data for Pu-Ga alloys.
