We present an intermediate coupling scenario together with a model analytic
solution where the non-Fermi-liquid behavior in the underdoped cuprates emerges
through the mechanism of Fermi surface (FS) reconstruction. Even though the
fluctuation spectrum remains nearly isotropic, FS reconstruction driven by a
density wave order breaks the lattice symmetry and induces a strong momentum
dependence in the self-energy. As the doping is reduced to half-filling, we
find that quasiparticle (QP) dispersion becomes essentially unrenormalized, but
in sharp contrast the QP spectral weight renormalizes to nearly zero. This
opposite doping evolution of the renormalization factors for QP dispersion and
spectral weight conspires in such a way that the specific heat remains Fermi
liquid like at all dopings in accord with experiments.
