We report on an update of the test on the rotation of the plane of linear
polarization for light traveling over cosmological distances, using a
comparison between the measured direction of the UV polarization in 8 radio
galaxies at z>2 and the direction predicted by the model of scattering of
anisotropic nuclear radiation, which explains the polarization. No rotation is
detected within a few degrees for each galaxy and, if the rotation does not
depend on direction, then the all-sky-average rotation is constrained to be
\theta = -0.8 +/- 2.2. We discuss the relevance of this result for constraining
cosmological birefringence, when this is caused by the interaction with a
cosmological pseudo-scalar field or by the presence of a Cherns-Simons term.
