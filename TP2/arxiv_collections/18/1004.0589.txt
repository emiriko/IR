If the uncertainty principle applies to the Verlinde entropic idea, it leads
to a new term in the Newton's second law of mechanics in the Planck's scale.
This curious velocity dependence term inspires a frictional feature of the
gravity. In this short letter we address that this new term modifies the
effective mass and the Newtonian constant as the time dependence quantities.
Thus we must have a running on the value of the effective mass on the particle
mass $m$ near the holographic screen and the $G$. This result has a nigh
relation with the Dirac hypothesis about the large numbers hypothesis (L.N.H.)
[1]. We propose that the corrected entropic terms via Verlinde idea can be
brought as a holographic evidence for the authenticity of the Dirac idea.
