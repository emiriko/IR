In this paper we formulate the Least Action Principle for an Organized System
as the minimum of the total sum of the actions of all of the elements. This
allows us to see how this most basic law of physics determines the development
of the system towards states with less action - organized states. Also we state
that the metric tensor can describe the specific state of the constraints of
the system, which is its actual organization. With this the organization is
defined in two ways: 1. A quantitative: the action I. 2. A qualitative: the
metric tensor. These two measures can describe the level of development and the
specifics of the organization of a system. We consider closed and open systems.
