We study ballistic thermal transport in three-terminal atomic nanojunctions
by the nonequilibrium Green's function method. We find that there is ballistic
thermal rectification in asymmetric three-terminal structures because of the
incoherent phonon scattering from the control terminal. With spin-phonon
interaction, we also find the ballistic thermal rectification even in symmetric
three-terminal paramagnetic structures.
