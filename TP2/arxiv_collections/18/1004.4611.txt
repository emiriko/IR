A growing list of experiments show orthorhombic electronic anisotropy in the
iron pnictides, in some cases at temperatures well above the spin density wave
transition. These experiments include neutron scattering, resistivity and
magnetoresistance measurements, and a variety of spectroscopies. We explore the
idea that these anisotropies stem from a common underlying cause: orbital order
manifest in an unequal occupation of $d_{xz}$ and $d_{yz}$ orbitals, arising
from the coupled spin-orbital degrees of freedom. We emphasize the distinction
between the total orbital occupation (the integrated density of states), where
the order parameter may be small, and the orbital polarization near the Fermi
level which can be more pronounced. We also discuss light-polarization studies
of angle-resolved photoemission, and demonstrate how x-ray absorption linear
dichroism may be used as a method to detect an orbital order parameter.
