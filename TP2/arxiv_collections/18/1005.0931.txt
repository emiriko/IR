Time-to-market pressure and productivity gap force vendors and researchers to
improve embedded system design methodology. Current used design method,
Register Transfer Level (RTL), is no longer be adequate to comply with embedded
system design necessity. It needs a new methodology for facing the lack of RTL.
In this paper, a new methodology of hardware embedded system modeling process
is designed for improving design process performance using Transaction Level
Modeling (TLM). TLM is a higher abstraction design concept model above RTL
model. Parameters measured include design process time and accuracy of design.
For implementing RTL model used Avalon and Wishbone buses, both are System on
Chip bus. Performance improvement measured by comparing TLM and RTL model
process. The experiment results show performance improvements for Avalon RTL
using new design methodology are 1,03 for 3-tiers, 1,47 for 4-tiers and 1,69
for 5-tiers. Performance improvements for Wishbone RTL are 1,12 for 3-tiers,
1,17 for 4-tiers and 1,34 for 5-tiers. These results show the trend of design
process improvement.
