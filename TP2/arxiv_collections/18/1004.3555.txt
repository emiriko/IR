This paper investigates the performance of WPAN based on various topological
scenarios like: cluster, star and ring. The comparative results have been
reported for the performance metrics like: Throughput, Traffic sent, Traffic
received and Packets dropped. Cluster topology is best in comparison with star
and ring topologies as it has been shown that the throughput in case of cluster
topology (79.887 kbits / sec) as compared to star (31.815 kbits / sec) and ring
(1.179 kbits / sec).
