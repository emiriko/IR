We propose an algorithm for evaluation of the cumulative bivariate normal
distribution, building upon Marsaglia's ideas for evaluation of the cumulative
univariate normal distribution. The algorithm is mathematically transparent,
delivers competitive performance and can easily be extended to arbitrary
precision.
