Let $(X,C)$ be a germ of a threefold $X$ with terminal singularities along an
irreducible reduced complete curve $C$ with a contraction $f: (X,C)\to (Z,o)$
such that $C=f^{-1}(o)_{\red}$ and $-K_X$ is ample. Assume that a general
member $F\in |-K_X|$ meets $C$ only at one point $P$ and furthermore $(F,P)$ is
Du Val of type A if index$(X,P)=4$. We classify all such germs in terms of a
general member $H\in |O_X|$ containing $C$.
