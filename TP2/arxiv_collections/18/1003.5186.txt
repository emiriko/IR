We study CP asymmetries in two-body decays of bottom squarks into charginos
and tops. These asymmetries probe the SUSY CP phases of the sbottom and the
chargino sector in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. We identify the
MSSM parameter space where the CP asymmetries are sizeable, and analyze the
feasibility of their observation at the LHC. As a result, potentially
detectable CP asymmetries in sbottom decays are found, which motivates further
detailed experimental studies for probing the SUSY CP phases.
