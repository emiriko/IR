The dynamics of one species chemical kinetics is studied. Chemical reactions
are modelled by means of continuous time Markov processes whose probability
distribution obeys a suitable master equation. A large deviation theory is
formally introduced, which allows developing a Hamiltonian dynamical system
able to describe the system dynamics. Using this technique we are able to show
that the intrinsic fluctuations, originated in the discrete character of the
reagents, may sustain oscillations and chaotic trajectories which are
impossible when these fluctuations are disregarded. An important point is that
oscillations and chaos appear in systems whose mean-field dynamics has too low
a dimensionality for showing such a behavior. In this sense these phenomena are
purely induced by noise, which does not limit itself to shifting a bifurcation
threshold. On the other hand, they are large deviations of a short transient
nature which typically only appear after long waiting times. We also discuss
the implications of our results in understanding extinction events in
population dynamics models expressed by means of stoichiometric relations.
