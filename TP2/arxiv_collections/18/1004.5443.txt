We theoretically investigate the itinerant ferromagnetic transition of a
spherically trapped ultracold Fermi gas with spin imbalance under strongly
repulsive interatomic interactions. Our study is based on a self-consistent
solution of the Hartree-Fock mean-field equations beyond the widely used local
density approximation. We demonstrate that, while the local density
approximation holds in the paramagnetic phase, after the ferromagnetic
transition it leads to a quantitative discrepancy in various thermodynamic
quantities even with large atom numbers. We determine the position of the phase
transition by monitoring the shape change of the free energy curve with
increasing the polarization at various interaction strengths.
