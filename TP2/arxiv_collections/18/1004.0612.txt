In the last years we have witnessed a dramatic change in the research
infrastructures: Advances in communication networks, computational resources
and data storage devices are fostering new and more efficient science. In this
new scenario, the Virtual Observatory (VO) is the framework where a new
methodology for astronomical research is being built. This poster shows the
natural connection between Asteroseismology and VO. We describe the current
status of a project developed by the Spanish Virtual Observatory in which, for
the first time, asteroseismic models together with visualization tools for
asteroseismology are managed within VO.
