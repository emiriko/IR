The Bolztmann echo (BE) is a measure of irreversibility and sensitivity to
perturbations for non-isolated systems. Recently, different regimes of this
quantity were described for chaotic systems. There is a perturbative regime
where the BE decays with a rate given by the sum of a term depending on the
accuracy with which the system is time-reversed and a term depending on the
coupling between the system and the environment. In addition, a parameter
independent regime, characterised by the classical Lyapunov exponent, is
expected. In this paper we study the behaviour of the BE in hyperbolic maps
that are in contact with different environments. We analyse the emergence of
the different regimes and show that the behaviour of the decay rate of the BE
is strongly dependent on the type of environment.
