We investigate the ground state of a uniaxial ferromagnetic plate with
perpendicular easy axis and subject to an applied magnetic field normal to the
plate. Our interest is the asymptotic behavior of the energy in macroscopically
large samples near the saturation field. We establish the scaling of the
critical value of the applied field strength below saturation at which the
ground state changes from the uniform to a branched domain magnetization
pattern and the leading order scaling behavior of the minimal energy.
Furthermore, we derive a reduced sharp-interface energy giving the precise
asymptotic behavior of the minimal energy in macroscopically large plates under
a physically reasonable assumption of small deviations of the magnetization
from the easy axis away from domain walls. On the basis of the reduced energy,
and by a formal asymptotic analysis near the transition, we derive the precise
asymptotic values of the critical field strength at which non-trivial
minimizers (either local or global) emerge. The non-trivial minimal energy
scaling is achieved by magnetization patterns consisting of long slender
needle-like domains of magnetization opposing the applied field
