We propose a scheme for a cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) architecture
for a current-biased superconducting flux qubit with three Josephson junctions.
The qubit operation is performed by using a bias current coming from the
current mode of the circuit resonator. If the phase differences of junctions
are to be coupled with the bias current, the Josephson junctions should be
arranged in an asymmetric way in the qubit loop. Our QED scheme provides a
strong coupling between the flux qubit and the transmission line resonator of
the circuit.
