States that strongly violate Bell's inequalities are required in many quantum
informational protocols as, for example, in cryptography, secret sharing and
the reduction of communication complexity. We investigate families of such
states with a numerical method which allows to reveal non-classicality even
without direct knowledge of Bell's inequalities for the given problem. An
extensive set of numerical results is presented and discussed.
