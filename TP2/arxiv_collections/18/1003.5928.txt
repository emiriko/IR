Motivated by the excellent agreement between next-to-leading-order pQCD
calculations and the inclusive jet spectra measured by CDF, we cross-check
PYTHIA fragmentation functions. The convolution of the measured jet spectra
with unmodified PYTHIA fragmentation functions results in reasonable agreement
with the PYTHIA charged particle spectrum over the entire p_T range of
interest, while there is a sizable disagreement with the measured charged
particle spectrum above p_T=30 GeV/c. In an attempt to understand the source of
this discrepancy, we introduce a number of increasingly different toy-model
fragmentation functions for the convolution. However, even the most extreme
fragmentation functions result in an underestimate of the high-p_T CDF
spectrum, which remains irreconcilable with the measured jet spectra.
