We measure the dispersive energy-level shift of an $LC$ resonator
magnetically coupled to a superconducting qubit, which clearly shows that our
system operates in the ultrastrong coupling regime. The large mutual kinetic
inductance provides a coupling energy of $\approx0.82$~GHz, requiring the
addition of counter-rotating-wave terms in the description of the
Jaynes-Cummings model. We find a 50~MHz Bloch-Siegert shift when the qubit is
in its symmetry point, fully consistent with our analytical model.
