Employing photometric rotation periods for solar-type stars in NGC 1039 [M
34], a young, nearby open cluster, we use its mass-dependent rotation period
distribution to derive the cluster's age in a distance independent way, i.e.,
the so-called gyrochronology method. We present an analysis of 55 new rotation
periods,using light curves derived from differential photometry, for solar type
stars in M 34. We also exploit the results of a recently-completed,
standardized, homogeneous BVIc CCD survey of the cluster in order to establish
photometric cluster membership and assign B-V colours to each photometric
variable. We describe a methodology for establishing the gyrochronology age for
an ensemble of solar-type stars. Empirical relations between rotation period,
photometric colour and stellar age (gyrochronology) are used to determine the
age of M 34. Based on its position in a colour-period diagram, each M 34 member
is designated as being either a solid-body rotator (interface or I-star), a
differentially rotating star (convective or C-star) or an object which is in
some transitory state in between the two (gap or g-star). Fitting the period
and photometric colour of each I-sequence star in the cluster, we derive the
cluster's mean gyrochronology age.
  47/55 of the photometric variables lie along the loci of the cluster main
sequence in V/B-V and V/V-I space. We are further able to confirm kinematic
membership of the cluster for half of the periodic variables [21/55], employing
results from an on-going radial velocity survey of the cluster. For each
cluster member identified as an I-sequence object in the colour-period diagram,
we derive its individual gyrochronology age, where the mean gyro age of M 34 is
found to be 193 +/- 9 Myr, formally consistent (within the errors) with that
derived using several distance-dependent, photometric isochrone methods (250
+/- 67 Myr).
