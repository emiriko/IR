We predict theoretically that stable subwavelength plasmonic lattice solitons
(PLSs) are formed in arrays of metallic nanowires embedded in a nonlinear
medium. The tight confinement of the guiding modes of the metallic nanowires,
combined with the strong nonlinearity induced by the enhanced field at the
metal surface, provide the main physical mechanisms for balancing the wave
diffraction and the formation of PLSs. As the conditions required for the
formation of PLSs are satisfied in a variety of plasmonic systems, we expect
these nonlinear modes to have important applications to subwavelength
nanophotonics. In particular, we show that the subwavelength PLSs can be used
to optically manipulate with nanometer accuracy the power flow in ultracompact
photonic systems.
