Bipartite entanglement measures are fantastic tools to investigate quantum
phases of correlated electrons. Here, I analyze the entanglement spectrum of
**gapped** two-leg quantum Heisenberg ladders on a periodic ribbon partitioned
into two identical periodic chains. Comparison of various entanglement
entropies proposed in the literature is given. The entanglement spectrum is
shown to closely reflect the low-energy gapless spectrum of each individual
edge, for any sign of the exchange coupling constants. This extends the
conjecture initially drawn for Fractional Quantum Hall systems to the field of
quantum magnetism, stating a direct correspondence between the low-energy
entanglement spectrum of a partitioned system and the true spectrum of the
"virtual edges". A mapping of the reduced density matrix to a thermodynamic
density matrix is also proposed via the introduction of an effective
temperature.
