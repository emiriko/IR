This paper develops a matrix-variate adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
methodology for Bayesian Cointegrated Vector Auto Regressions (CVAR). We
replace the popular approach to sampling Bayesian CVAR models, involving griddy
Gibbs, with an automated efficient alternative, based on the Adaptive
Metropolis algorithm of Roberts and Rosenthal, (2009). Developing the adaptive
MCMC framework for Bayesian CVAR models allows for efficient estimation of
posterior parameters in significantly higher dimensional CVAR series than
previously possible with existing griddy Gibbs samplers. For a n-dimensional
CVAR series, the matrix-variate posterior is in dimension $3n^2 + n$, with
significant correlation present between the blocks of matrix random variables.
We also treat the rank of the CVAR model as a random variable and perform joint
inference on the rank and model parameters. This is achieved with a Bayesian
posterior distribution defined over both the rank and the CVAR model
parameters, and inference is made via Bayes Factor analysis of rank.
Practically the adaptive sampler also aids in the development of automated
Bayesian cointegration models for algorithmic trading systems considering
instruments made up of several assets, such as currency baskets. Previously the
literature on financial applications of CVAR trading models typically only
considers pairs trading (n=2) due to the computational cost of the griddy
Gibbs. We are able to extend under our adaptive framework to $n >> 2$ and
demonstrate an example with n = 10, resulting in a posterior distribution with
parameters up to dimension 310. By also considering the rank as a random
quantity we can ensure our resulting trading models are able to adjust to
potentially time varying market conditions in a coherent statistical framework.
