We consider uncorrelated Stein-Stein, Heston, and Hull-White models and their
perturbations by compound Poisson processes with jump amplitudes distributed
according to a double exponential law. Similar perturbations of the
Black-Scholes model were studied by S. Kou. For perturbed stochastic volatility
models, we obtain two-sided estimates for the stock price distribution density
and compare the tail behavior of this density before and after perturbation. It
is shown that if the value of the parameter, characterizing the right tail of
the double exponential law, is small, then the stock price density in the
perturbed model decays slower than the density in the original model. On the
other hand, if the value of this parameter is large, then there are no
significant changes in the behavior of the stock price distribution density.
