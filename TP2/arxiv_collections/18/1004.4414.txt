Particle stabilized emulsions are ubiquitous in the food and cosmetics
industry, but our understanding of the influence of microscopic fluid-particle
and particle-particle interactions on the macroscopic rheology is still
limited. In this paper we present a simulation algorithm based on a
multicomponent lattice Boltzmann model to describe the solvents combined with a
molecular dynamics solver for the description of the solved particles. It is
shown that the model allows a wide variation of fluid properties and arbitrary
contact angles on the particle surfaces. We demonstrate its applicability by
studying the transition from a "bicontinuous interfacially jammed emulsion gel"
(bijel) to a "Pickering emulsion" in dependence on the contact angle, the
particle concentration, and the ratio of the solvents.
