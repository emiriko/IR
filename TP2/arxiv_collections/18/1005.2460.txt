The top quark was discoverd at the CDF and D0 experiments in 1995. As the
partner of the bottom quark its properties within the Standard Model are fully
defined. Only the mass is a free parameter. The measurement of the top quark
mass and the verification of the expected properties have been an important
topic of experimental top quark physics since. In this review the recent
results on top quark properties obtained by the Tevatron experiments CDF and D0
are summarised. At the advent of the LHC special emphasis is given to the basic
measurement methods and the dominating systematic uncertainties.
