The magnetization process of the isotropic Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the
kagome lattice is studied. Data obtained from the numerical-diagonalization
method are reexamined from the viewpoint of the derivative of the magnetization
with respect to the magnetic field. We find that the behavior of the derivative
at approximately one-third of the height of the magnetization saturation is
markedly different from that for the cases of typical magnetization plateaux.
The magnetization process of the kagome-lattice antiferromagnet reveals a new
phenomenon, which we call the "magnetization ramp".
