Structural and magnetic properties of GaAs thin films with embedded MnAs
nanoclusters were investigated as function of the annealing temperature and
layers composition. The presence of two kinds of nanoclusters with different
dimensions and structure were detected. The fraction of Mn atoms in each kind
of cluster was estimated from the extended X-ray absorption fine structure
analysis. This analysis ruled out the possibility of the existence of
nanoclusters containing a hypothetic MnAs cubic compound - only (Mn,Ga)As cubic
clusters were detected. Change of the layer strain from the compressive to
tensile was related to the fraction of zinc blende and hexagonal inclusions.
Thus the zinc blende inclusions introduce much larger strain than hexagonal
ones. The explanation of observed thermal induced strain changes of the layers
from the compressive to tensile is proposed. The magnetic properties of the
samples were consistent with structural study results. Their showed that in
sample containing solely cubic (Mn,Ga)As inclusions Mn ions inside the
inclusions are still ferromagnetically coupled, even at room temperature. This
fact can be explained by existence in these clusters of GaMnAs solid solution
with content of Mn higher than 15 % as was found in theoretical calculations.
