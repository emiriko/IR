We consider C^2 families of C^4 unimodal maps f_t whose critical point is
slowly recurrent, and we show that the unique absolutely continuous invariant
measure of f_t depends differentiably on t, as a distribution of order 1. The
proof uses transfer operators on towers whose level boundaries are mollified
via smooth cutoff functions, in order to avoid artificial discontinuities. We
give a new representation of the acim for a Benedicks-Carleson map f_t, in
terms of a single smooth function and the inverse branches of f_t along the
postcritical orbit. Along the way, we prove that the twisted cohomological
equation v(x)=\alpha (f (x)) - f'(x) \alpha (x) has a continuous solution
\alpha, if f is Benedicks-Carleson and v is horizontal for f.
