Eigenvectors of tensors, as studied recently in numerical multilinear
algebra, correspond to fixed points of self-maps of a projective space. We
determine the number of eigenvectors and eigenvalues of a generic tensor, and
we show that the number of normalized eigenvalues of a symmetric tensor is
always finite. We also examine the characteristic polynomial and how its
coefficients are related to discriminants and resultants.
