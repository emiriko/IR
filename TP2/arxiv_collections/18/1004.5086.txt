Even though mutually unbiased bases and entropic uncertainty relations play
an important role in quantum cryptographic protocols they remain ill
understood. Here, we construct special sets of up to 2n+1 mutually unbiased
bases (MUBs) in dimension d=2^n which have particularly beautiful symmetry
properties derived from the Clifford algebra. More precisely, we show that
there exists a unitary transformation that cyclically permutes such bases. This
unitary can be understood as a generalization of the Fourier transform, which
exchanges two MUBs, to multiple complementary aspects. We proceed to prove a
lower bound for min-entropic entropic uncertainty relations for any set of
MUBs, and show that symmetry plays a central role in obtaining tight bounds.
For example, we obtain for the first time a tight bound for four MUBs in
dimension d=4, which is attained by an eigenstate of our complementarity
transform. Finally, we discuss the relation to other symmetries obtained by
transformations in discrete phase space, and note that the extrema of discrete
Wigner functions are directly related to min-entropic uncertainty relations for
MUBs.
