This paper discusses the knowledge integration of clinical information
extracted from distributed medical ontology in order to ameliorate a machine
learning-based multi-label coding assignment system. The proposed approach is
implemented using a decision tree based cascade hierarchical technique on the
university hospital data for patients with Coronary Heart Disease (CHD). The
preliminary results obtained show a satisfactory finding.
