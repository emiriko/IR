Phase diagram of electron and hole-doped SrFe2As2 single crystals is
investigated using Co and Mn substitution at the Fe-sites. We found that the
spin-density-wave state is suppressed by both dopants, but the superconducting
phase appears only for Co (electron)-doping, not for Mn (hole)-doping. Absence
of the superconductivity by Mn-doping is in sharp contrast to the hole-doped
system with K-substitution at the Sr sites. Distinct structural change, in
particular the increase of the Fe-As distance by Mn-doping is important to have
a magnetic and semiconducting ground state as confirmed by first principles
calculations. The absence of electron-hole symmetry in the Fe-site-doped
SrFe2As2 suggests that the occurrence of high-Tc superconductivity is sensitive
to the structural modification rather than the charge doping.
