We investigate super dense coding in the presence of noise, i.e. the
subsystems of the entangled resource state have to pass a noisy unital quantum
channel between the sender and the receiver. We discuss explicitly the case of
Pauli channels in arbitrary dimension and derive the super dense coding
capacity (i.e. the optimal information transfer) for some given resource
states. We also study the case that the initial resource state can be chosen:
for the qubit depolarizing channel we show that there is a threshold value for
the noise parameter, below which the super dense coding protocol is optimized
by a maximally entangled initial state, while above the threshold the dense
coding capacity for any entangled initial state is smaller than the one for a
product state. Finally, we provide an example of a noisy channel where
non-unitary pre-processing increases the super dense coding capacity, as
compared to only unitary encoding.
