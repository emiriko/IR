We observe that the electroweak one loop correction to the quark+gluon to
quark+Higgs amplitude at high energy involves both single and quadratic
logarithms of the energy in the SM case but only quadratic logarithms in the
MSSM case. We explore the origin of this special SUSY cancellation, both in a
diagrammatic way and through the splitting+Parameter Renormalization procedure.
We show that it is not an accident but a remarkableand general SUSY property of
the renormalized Higgs-fermion-fermion and Higgsino-sfermion-fermion vertices
which directly reflects in such processes, for example in $bg\to tH^-$, $bg\to
bH^0$, $bg\to bh^0$, $bg\to bA^0$, and through equivalence in $bg\to
tW^-_{long}$, $bg\to bZ_{long}$, as well as in $bg\to \tilde{t}\chi^-$,
$bg\to\tilde{b}\chi^0$. This simplification of the high energy behaviour (which
only leaves quadratic logarithms involving pure gauge couplings without any
free parameter) allows to write simple relations among these various processes
which constitute genuine tests of the assumed SUSY model.
