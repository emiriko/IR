We analytically show the percolation thresholds of the Fortuin-Kasteleyn
cluster for the Edwards-Anderson Ising model on random graphs with arbitrary
degree distributions. The results on the Nishimori line are shown. We obtain
the results for the +-J model, the diluted +-J model, and the Gaussian model,
by applying an extension of a criterion for the random graphs with arbitrary
degree distributions. The results for the infinite-range $\pm J$ model and the
Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model are also shown.
