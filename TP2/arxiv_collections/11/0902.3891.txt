A free vortex in excitable media can be displaced and removed by a
wave-train. However, simple physical arguments suggest that vortices anchored
to large inexcitable obstacles cannot be removed similarly. We show that
unpinning of vortices attached to obstacles smaller than the core radius of the
free vortex is possible through pacing. The wave-train frequency necessary for
unpinning increases with the obstacle size and we present a geometric
explanation of this dependence. Our model-independent results suggest that
decreasing excitability of the medium can facilitate pacing-induced removal of
vortices in cardiac tissue.
