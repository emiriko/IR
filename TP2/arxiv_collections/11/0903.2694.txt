Quantum fluctuations in the density of a fluid with a linear phonon
dispersion relation are studied. In particular, we treat the changes in these
fluctuations due to non-classical states of phonons and to the presence of
boundaries. These effects are analogous to similar effects in relativistic
quantum field theory, and we argue that the case of the fluid is a useful
analog model for effects in field theory. We further argue that the changes in
the mean squared density are in principle observable by light scattering
experiments.
