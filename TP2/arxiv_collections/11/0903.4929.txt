We investigate the effect of orientation-dependent selection effects on
galaxy clustering in redshift space. It is found that if galaxies are aligned
by large-scale tidal fields, then these selection effects give rise to a
dependence of the observed galaxy density on the local tidal field, in addition
to the well-known dependences on the matter density and radial velocity
gradient. This alters the galaxy power spectrum in a way that is different for
Fourier modes parallel to and perpendicular to the line of sight. These tidal
galaxy alignments can thus mimic redshift space distortions, and thus result in
a bias in the measurement of the velocity power spectrum. If galaxy
orientations are affected only by the local tidal field, then the tidal
alignment effect has exactly the same scale and angular dependence as the
redshift space distortions in the linear regime, so it cannot be projected out
or removed by masking small scales in the analysis. We consider several toy
models of tidal alignments and orientation-dependent selection, normalize their
free parameter (an amplitude) to recent observations, and find that they could
bias the velocity amplitude f(z)G(z) by 5--10 per cent in some models, although
most models give much smaller contamination. We conclude that tidal alignments
may be a significant systematic error in redshift space distortion measurements
that aim to test general relativity via the growth of large-scale structure. We
briefly discuss possible mitigation strategies.
