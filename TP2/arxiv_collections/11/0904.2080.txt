The Standard Model (SM) predictions for the lepton flavor-violating (LFV)
processes like mu->eg are well far from any realistic experimental resolution,
thus, the appearance of m->eg at the running MEG experiment would unambiguously
point towards a New Physics (NP) signal. In this article, we discuss the
phenomenological implications in case of observation/improved upper bound on
m->eg at the running MEG experiment for supersymmetric (SUSY) scenarios with a
see-saw mechanism accounting for the neutrino masses. We outline the role of
related observables to m->eg in shedding light on the nature of the SUSY LFV
sources providing useful tools i) to reconstruct some fundamental parameters of
the neutrino physics and ii) to test whether an underlying SUSY Grand Unified
Theory (GUT) is at work. The perspectives for the detection of LFV signals in
tau decays are also discussed.
