Non-coherent electronic transport in metallic nanowires exhibits different
carrier temperatures for the non-equilibrium forward and backward populations
in the presence of electric fields. Depending on the mean free path that
characterizes inter-branch carrier backscattering transport regimes vary
between the ballistic and diffusive limits. In particular, we show that the
simultaneous measurements of the electrical characteristics and the carrier
distribution function offer a direct way to extract the carrier mean free path
even when it is comparable to the conductor length. Our model is in good
agreement with the experimental work on copper nanowires by Pothier {\it et
al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 79}, 3490 (1997)] and provides an elegant
interpretation of the inhomogeneous thermal broadening observed in the local
carrier distribution function as well as its scaling with external bias.
