We present confusion limited submillimetre (submm) observations with the
SCUBA camera on the JCMT of the z=2.83 Lyman-break galaxy (LBG), Westphal-MM8,
reaching an 850um sensitivity even greater than that achieved in the SCUBA map
of the Hubble Deep Field region. The detection of Westphal-MM8 (S_{850um} =
1.98+-0.48mJy), along with the literature submm detections of lensed LBGs,
suggest that the LBG population may contribute significantly to the source
counts of submm selected galaxies in the 1-2mJy regime. Additionally,
submm-luminous LBGs are a viable progenitor population for the recently
discovered evolved galaxies at z~2-2.5. These observations represent an
important baseline for SCUBA2 observations which will regularly map large
regions of the sky to this depth.
