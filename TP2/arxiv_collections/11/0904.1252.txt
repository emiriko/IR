We argue that the mass, production, total decay width, and decay pattern of
the $\eta_2(1870)$ do not appear to contradict with the picture of it being the
conventional $2 ^1D_2$ $q\bar{q}$ state. The possibility of the $\eta_2(1870)$
being a mixture of the conventional $q\bar{q}$ and the hybrid is also
discussed.
