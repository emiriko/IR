This paper presents an approch for modeling with one single kinetic mechanism
the chemistry of the autoignition and combustion processes inside an internal
combustion engine, as well as the chemical kinetics governing the
post-oxidation of unburned hydrocarbons in engine exhaust gases. Therefore a
new kinetic model was developed, valid over a wide range of temperatures
including the negative temperature coefficient regime. The model simulates the
autoignition and the oxidation of engine surrogate fuels composed of n-heptane,
iso-octane and toluene, which are sensitized by the presence of nitric oxides.
The new model was obtained from previously published mechanisms for the
oxidation of alkanes and toluene where the coupling reactions describing
interactions between hydrocarbons and NOx were added. The mechanism was
validated against a wide range of experimental data obtained in jet-stirred
reactors, rapid compression machines, shock tubes and homogenous charge
compression ignition engines. Flow rate and sensitivity analysis were performed
in order to explain the low temperature chemical kinetics, especially the
impact of NOx on hydrocarbon oxidation.
