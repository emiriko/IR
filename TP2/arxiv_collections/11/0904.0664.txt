We consider the vacuum energy for a configuration of two cylinders and obtain
its asymptotic expansion if the radius of one of these cylinders becomes large
while the radius of the other one and their separation are kept fixed. We
calculate explicitly the next-to-leading order correction to the vacuum energy
for the radius of the other cylinder becoming large or small.
