We study self-trapped localized nonlinear states in the form of truncated
Bloch waves in one-dimensional optical lattices, which appear in the gaps of
the linear bandgap spectrum. We demonstrate the existence of families of such
localized states which differ by the number of intensity peaks. These families
do not bifurcate from the band edge, and their power curves exhibit double
branches. Linear stability analysis demonstrates that in deep lattice
potentials the states corresponding to the lower branches are stable, whereas
those corresponding to the upper branches are unstable, independently of the
number of peaks.
