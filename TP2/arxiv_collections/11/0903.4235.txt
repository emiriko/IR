We probe the droplet excitations in short range spin glasses by adding a
perturbative long range interaction that decays with distance as a power law:
$J/r^{\sigma}$. It is shown that if the power law exponent $\sigma$ is smaller
than the spatial dimension $d$, the perturbation induces large scale avalanches
which roll until they force the system to develop a pseudo gap in the
excitation spectrum of the stabilities. This makes the perturbative long range
interactions relevant for $\sigma < \sigma_c = d$. The droplet theory predicts
that the critical exponent $\sigma_c$ depends on the droplet stiffness exponent
as $\sigma_c=d-\theta$. Combining these two results leads to a zero stiffness
exponent $\theta = 0$ in the droplet theory of short range spin glasses.
