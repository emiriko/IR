We perform an analysis of the experimentally known temperature dependence of
the staggered magnetization in the antiferromagnetic phase. This analysis
allows us to put an upper limit on the unknown value of the spin wave velocity
along the stripes of equal spin direction (spin stripes). The velocity is about
ten times smaller than the velocity perpendicular to the spin stripes. The
strongly anisotropic spin-wave dispersion implies a high density of low energy
magnetic excitations. We demonstrate that this high density strongly enhances
the $^{75}$As NMR spin-lattice relaxation via the Raman scattering of magnons.
We derive the polarization dependence of this relaxation channel and find very
good agreement with experimental data. The high density of low energy magnetic
excitations deduced from our phenomenological analysis supports the scenario
that ferro-pnictides are close to a quantum phase transition.
