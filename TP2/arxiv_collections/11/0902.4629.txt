We present a catalog and imaging atlas of classical (collisional) RING
galaxies distilled from the Arp-Madore Atlas of Southern Peculiar Galaxies and
Associations and supplemented with other known RING galaxies from the published
literature. The catalog lists the original host object, compiles available
redshifts and presents newly determined positions for the central (target)
galaxy and its nearest companion(s). 127 collisional RING systems are
illustrated and their components identified. All of the RINGS have plausible
colliders identified; many are radial-velocity confirmed companions. Finally,
we make note of the existence of a rare sub-class of RING galaxies exemplified
by AM 2136-492, double/concentric RING galaxies. These objects are predicted by
numerical simulations, but they appear to be quite rare and/or short-lived in
nature.
