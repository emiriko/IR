This is a whitepaper submitted to the 2010 Astronomy Decadal Review process,
addressing the potential tests of gravity theory that could be made by
observations of gravitational waves in the milliHertz frequency band by the
proposed ESA-NASA gravitational wave observatory LISA. A key issue is that
observations in this band of binary systems consisting of black holes offer
very clean tests with high signal-to-noise ratios. Gravitational waves would
probe nonlinear gravity and could reveal small corrections, such as extra
long-range fields that arise in unified theories, deviations of the metric
around massive black holes from the Kerr solution, massive gravitons, chiral
effects, and effects of extra dimensions. The availability of strong signals
from massive black hole binaries as well as complex signals from extreme
mass-ratio binaries is unique to the milliHertz waveband and makes LISA a
particularly sensitive probe of the validity of general relativity.
