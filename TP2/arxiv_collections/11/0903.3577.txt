Asymptotic behaviour of gravitational and electromagnetic fields of exact
type D solutions from the large Plebanski-Demianski family of black hole
spacetimes is analyzed. The amplitude and directional structure of radiation is
evaluated in cases when the cosmological constant is non-vanishing, so that the
conformal infinities have either de Sitter-like or anti-de Sitter-like
character. In particular, explicit relations between the parameters that
characterize the sources (that is their mass, electric and magnetic charges,
NUT parameter, rotational parameter, and acceleration) and properties of the
radiation generated by them are presented. The results further elucidate the
physical interpretation of these solutions and may help to understand radiative
characteristics of more general spacetimes than those that are asymptotically
flat.
