A proper remote sensing device is required for automatic cruise control (ACC)
to avoid collision in transportation system. In this paper we proposed a direct
sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) radar for remote sensing in intelligent
transporation system(ITS). We have successfully detected single target and
through 1D radar imaging we are capable to separate multiple targets. We have
also implemented DSSS radar using software defined radio (SDR) and successfully
detected a single target.
