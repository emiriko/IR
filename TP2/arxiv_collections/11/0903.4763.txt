We demonstrate optical control of the polarization eigenstates of a neutral
quantum dot exciton without any external fields. By varying the excitation
power of a circularly polarized laser in micro-photoluminescence experiments on
individual InGaAs quantum dots we control the magnitude and direction of an
effective internal magnetic field created via optical pumping of nuclear spins.
The adjustable nuclear magnetic field allows us to tune the linear and circular
polarization degree of the neutral exciton emission. The quantum dot can thus
act as a tunable light polarization converter.
