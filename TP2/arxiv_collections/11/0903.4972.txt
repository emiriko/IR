We study the consequence of chiral SU(3) symmetry in the kaon-nucleon
phenomenology, by deriving the effective single-channel KbarK N potential. It
turns out that the pi Sigma interaction is strongly attractive and plays an
important role for the structure of the Lambda(1405) resonance. We discuss the
implication of effective potential for the few-body kaonic nuclei.
