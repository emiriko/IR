We provide a combinatorial approach to the largest power of $p$ in the number
of permutations $\pi$ with $\pi^p=1$, for a fixed prime number $p$. With this
approach, we find the largest power of $2$ in the number of involutions, in the
signed sum of involutions and in the numbers of even or odd involutions.
