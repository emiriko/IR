We discuss different schemes of neutrino oscillations and the time-energy
uncertainty relation. From the results of the K2K and MINOS accelerator
experiments follows that neutrino oscillations are a non-stationary phenomenon
and that the standard time-energy uncertainty relation is satisfied. Are these
properties a general feature of neutrino oscillations? In this paper we
demonstrate that a recently proposed tritium/helium-3 Moessbauer
neutrino-experiment could answer this question.
