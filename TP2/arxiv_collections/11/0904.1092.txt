The reduced cross sections for ep deep inelastic scattering have been
measured with the ZEUS detector at HERA at three different centre-of-mass
energies, 318, 251 and 225 GeV. From the cross sections, measured double
differentially in Bjorken x and the virtuality, Q^2, the proton structure
functions FL and F2 have been extracted in the region 5*10^-4 < x <0.007 and 20
< Q^2 < 130 GeV^2.
