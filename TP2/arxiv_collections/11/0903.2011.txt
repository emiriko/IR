We report $^{75}$As NMR measurements in CaFe$_2$As$_2$, made under applied
pressures up to 0.83 GPa produced by a standard clamp pressure cell. Our data
reveal phase segregation of paramagnetic (PM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM)
phases over a range of pressures, with the AFM phase more than 90 % dominant at
low temperatures. In situ RF susceptibility measurements indicate the presence
of superconductivity. $^{75}$As spin-lattice relaxation experiments indicate
that the $^{75}$As nuclei sample the superconductivity while in the
magnetically-ordered environment.
