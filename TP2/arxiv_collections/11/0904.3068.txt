We report on the detection of a population of Red Clump (RC) stars probably
associated with the recently discovered stellar system Bootes III. The RC is
identified as a 3 sigma peak in the Luminosity Function (LF) of colour-selected
stars extracted from the SDSS database. The peak is consistently detected in
the g,r,i and z LFs at the expected luminosity of a typical RC at the distance
of Bootes III. Moreover the stars around the LF peak show a maximum of surface
density nearly coincident with the reported center of the system. Assuming that
the detected feature is the genuine RC of Bootes III, we find that the system
has the HB morphology typical of old and metal-poor dwarf spheroidals, it has
an integrated magnitude M_V=-5.8 pm 0.5 and an ellipticity epsilon about 0.5,
quite typical of the recently identified new class of very faint dwarf
galaxies.
