We discuss the large gap anisotropy found for the A1g (s-wave) state in RPA
spin-fluctuation and functional renormalization group calculations and show how
the simple arguments leading to isotropic sign-switched s-wave states in these
systems need to be supplemented by a consideration of pair scattering within
Fermi surface sheets and between the individual electron sheets as well. In
addition, accounting for the orbital makeup of the states on the Fermi surface
is found to be crucial.
