The purpose of the MIPP experiment is to study the inclusive production of
photons, pions, kaons and nucleons in pi, K and p interactions on various
targets using beams from the Main Injector at Fermilab. The function of the
calorimeters is to measure the production of forward-going neutrons and
photons. The electromagnetic calorimeter consist of 10 lead plates interspersed
with proportional chambers. It was followed by the hadron calorimeter with 64
steel plates interspersed with scintillator. The data presented were collected
with a variety of targets and beam momenta from 5 GeV/c to 120 GeV/c. The
energy calibration of both calorimeters with electrons, pions, kaons, and
protons is discussed. The resolution for electrons was found to be
0.27/sqrt(E), and for hadrons the resolution was 0.554/sqrt(E) with a constant
term of 2.6%. The performance of the calorimeters was tested on a neutron
sample.
