The Split SUSY scenario with light Higgsino states is treated as an
application to the Dark Matter problem. We have considered the structure of the
neutralino-nucleon interaction and calculated cross-section of the
neutralino-nucleon scattering. The decay properties of the lightest chargino
and next lightest neutralino are analyzed in details.
