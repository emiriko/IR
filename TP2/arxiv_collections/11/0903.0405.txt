Using the tools of optimal control, semiconvex duality and \maxp algebra,
this work derives a unifying representation of the solution for the matrix
differential Riccati equation (DRE) with time-varying coefficients. It is based
upon a special case of the \maxp fundamental solution, first proposed in
\cite{FlemMac}. Such fundamental solution can extend a special solution of
certain bivariate DRE into the general solution, and can analytically solve the
DRE starting from any initial condition.
  This paper also shows that under a fixed duality kernel, the semiconvex dual
of a DRE solution satisfies another dual DRE, whose coefficients satisfy the
matrix compatibility conditions involving Hamiltonian and certain symplectic
matrices. For the time invariant DRE, this allows us to make dual DRE linear
and thereby solve the primal DRE analytically. This paper also derives various
kernel/duality relationships between the primal and time shifted dual DREs,
which leads to an array of DRE solutions. Time invariant analogue of one of
these methods was first proposed in \cite{Funda}.
