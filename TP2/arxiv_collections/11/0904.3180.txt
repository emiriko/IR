According to the classical special theory of relativity any nonstationary
system moving with velocity $v$ must evolve (e.g., decay) $1/\gamma$ times
slower than the system at rest, $\gamma =(1-v^2)^{-1/2}$ (the Einstein
retardation ER). Quantum mechanics allows one to calculate the evolution of
both systems separately and to compare them thus verifying ER. It is shown here
that ER is not valid for a simple system: the spreading packet of the free
spinless particle. Earlier it was shown that ER does not hold for some other
systems. So one may state that ER is not a universal kinematic law in quantum
mechanics.
