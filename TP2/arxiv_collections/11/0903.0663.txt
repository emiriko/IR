A new near-to-far-field transformation algorithm for three-dimensional
finite-different time-domain is presented in this article. This new approach is
based directly on the polarization current of the scatterer, not the scattered
near fields. It therefore eliminates the numerical errors originating from the
spatial offset of the E and H fields, inherent in the standard
near-to-far-field transformation. The proposed method is validated via direct
comparisons with the analytical Lorentz-Mie solutions of plane waves scattered
by large dielectric and metallic spheres with strong forward-scattering lobes.
