The generalizations of instantaneous frequency and instantaneous bandwidth to
a bivariate signal are derived. These are uniquely defined whether the signal
is represented as a pair of real-valued signals, or as one analytic and one
anti-analytic signal. A nonstationary but oscillatory bivariate signal has a
natural representation as an ellipse whose properties evolve in time, and this
representation provides a simple geometric interpretation for the bivariate
instantaneous moments. The bivariate bandwidth is shown to consist of three
terms measuring the degree of instability of the time-varying ellipse:
amplitude modulation with fixed eccentricity, eccentricity modulation, and
orientation modulation or precession. An application to the analysis of data
from a free-drifting oceanographic float is presented and discussed.
