An algorithm, based on the OPP reduction method, to automatically compute any
one-loop amplitude, for all momentum, color and helicity configurations of the
external particles, is presented. It has been implemented using the tree-order
matrix element code HELAC and the OPP reduction code CutTools. As a
demonstration of the potential of the current implementation, results for all
sub-processes included in the 2007 Les Houches wish list for LHC, are
presented.
