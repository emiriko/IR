Nonlocal two-qubit gates are geometrically represented by tetrahedron known
as Weyl chamber within which perfect entanglers form a polyhedron. We identify
that all edges of the Weyl chamber and polyhedron are formed by single
parametric gates. Nonlocal attributes of these edges are characterized using
entangling power and local invariants. In particular, SWAP (power)alpha family
of gates constitutes one edge of the Weyl chamber with SWAP-1/2 being the only
perfect entangler. Finally, optimal constructions of controlled-NOT using
SWAP-1/2 gate and gates belong to three edges of the polyhedron are presented.
