We consider a scalar field theory in AdS_{d+1}, and introduce a formalism on
surfaces at equal values of the radial coordinate. In particular, we define the
corresponding conjugate momentum. We compute the Noether currents for
isometries in the bulk, and perform the asymptotic limit on the corresponding
charges. We then introduce Poisson brackets at the border, and show that the
asymptotic values of the bulk scalar field and the conjugate momentum transform
as conformal fields of scaling dimensions \Delta_{-} and \Delta_{+},
respectively, where \Delta_{\pm} are the standard parameters giving the
asymptotic behavior of the scalar field in AdS. Then we consider the case d=2,
where we obtain two copies of the Virasoro algebra, with vanishing central
charge at the classical level. An AdS_3/CFT_2 prescription, giving the
commutators of the boundary CFT in terms of the Poisson brackets at the border,
arises in a natural way. We find that the boundary CFT is similar to a
generalized ghost system. We introduce two different ground states, and then
compute the normal ordering constants and quantum central charges, which depend
on the mass of the scalar field and the AdS radius. We discuss certain
implications of the results.
