The angular distribution of the 2H(6He,7Li)n reaction was measured with a
secondary 6He beam of 36.4 MeV for the first time. The proton spectroscopic
factor of 7Li ground state was extracted to be 0.41 +- 0.05 by the
normalization of the calculational differential cross sections with the
distorted-wave Born approximation to the experimental data. It was found that
the uncertainty of extracted spectroscopic factors from the one-nucleon
transfer reactions induced by deuteron may be reduced by constraining the
volume integrals of imaginary optical potentials.
