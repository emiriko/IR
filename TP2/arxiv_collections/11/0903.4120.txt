The main goal of our present work is to provide, for the first time, a simple
computational tool that can be used to compute the brightness, the spectral
index, the polarization, the time variability and the spectrum of the
non-thermal light (both synchrotron and inverse Compton, IC) associated with
the plasma dynamics resulting from given relativistic magnetohydrodynamics
(RMHD) simulations. The proposed method is quite general, and can be applied to
any scheme for RMHD and to all non-thermal emitting sources, e.g. pulsar wind
nebulae (PWNe), and in particular to the Crab Nebula (CN) as in the present
proceeding. Here only the linear optical and X-ray polarization that
characterizes the PWNe synchrotron emission is analyzed in order to infer
information on the inner bulk flow structure, to provide a direct investigation
of the magnetic field configuration, in particular the presence and the
strength of a poloidal component, and to understand the origin of some emitting
features, such as the knot, whose origins are still uncertain. The inverse
Compton radiation is examined to disentangle the different contributions to
radiation from the magnetic field and the particle energy distribution
function, and to search for a possible hadronic component in the emitting PWN,
and thus for the presence of ions in the wind. If hadronic radiation was found
in a PWN, young supernova remnants would provide a natural birth-place of the
cosmic-rays (CRs) up to the so-called knee in the CR spectrum.
