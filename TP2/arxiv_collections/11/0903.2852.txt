A deep wide-field image in the light of the Halpha+[N II] emission lines, of
the planetary nebula HFG1 which surrounds the precataclysmic binary system V664
Cas, has revealed a tail of emission at least 20' long, at a position angle of
316deg. Evidence is presented which suggests that this is an ~10^5 y old trail
of shocked material, left behind V664 Cas as it ejects matter whilst ploughing
through its local interstellar media at anywhere between 29 and 59 km/s
depending on its distance from the Sun.
