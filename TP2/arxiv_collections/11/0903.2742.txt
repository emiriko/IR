We investigate the possibility of proving upper bounds on Hadwiger's number
of a graph with partial information, mirroring several known upper bounds for
the chromatic number. For each such bound we determine whether the
corresponding bound for Hadwiger's number holds. Our results suggest that the
``locality'' of an inequality accounts for the existence of such an extension.
