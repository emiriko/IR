We solve the recently-proposed equations describing non-BPS extremal
multi-center configurations, and construct explicit solutions describing
non-supersymmetric extremal black rings in Taub-NUT, as well as the seed
solution for the most general extremal non-BPS under-rotating black hole in
four dimensions. We also find solutions that contain both a black hole and a
black ring, which descend to four-dimensional extremal non-BPS two-center black
holes with generic charges.
