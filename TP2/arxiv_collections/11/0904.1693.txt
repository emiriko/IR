We report the detection of super-hard (>10 keV) X-ray emission extending up
to 70 keV from the classical nova V2491 Cygni using the Suzaku observatory. We
conducted two ~20 ks target-of-opportunity observations 9 and 29 days after the
outburst on 2008 April 11, yielding wide energy range spectra by combining the
X-ray Imaging Spectrometer and the Hard X-ray Detector. On day 9, a spectrum
was obtained at 1.0-70 keV with the Fe XXV K\alpha line feature and a very flat
continuum, which is explained by thermal plasma with a 3 keV temperature and
power-law emission with a photon index of 0.1 attenuated by a heavy extinction
of 1.4x10^{23} cm^{-2}. The 15-70 keV luminosity at 10.5 kpc is 6x10^{35} ergs
s^{-1}. The super-hard emission was not present on day 29. This is the highest
energy at which X-rays have been detected from a classical nova. We argue a
non-thermal origin for the emission, which suggests the presence of accelerated
charged particles in the nova explosion.
