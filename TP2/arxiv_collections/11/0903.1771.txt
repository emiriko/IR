We formulate and study the effective low-energy quantum theory of interacting
long-wavelength acoustic phonons in carbon nanotubes within the framework of
continuum elasticity theory. A general and analytical derivation of all three-
and four-phonon processes is provided, and the relevant coupling constants are
determined in terms of few elastic coefficients. Due to the low dimensionality
and the parabolic dispersion, the finite-temperature density of noninteracting
flexural phonons diverges, and a nonperturbative approach to their interactions
is necessary. Within a mean-field description, we find that a dynamical gap
opens. In practice, this gap is thermally smeared, but still has important
consequences. Using our theory, we compute the decay rates of acoustic phonons
due to phonon-phonon and electron-phonon interactions, implying upper bounds
for their quality factor.
