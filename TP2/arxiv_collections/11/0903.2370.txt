In this talk, the causal patch measure based on black hole complementarity is
critically reviewed. By noticing the similarities between the causal structure
of an inflationary dS space and that of a black hole, we have considered the
complementarity principle between the inside and the outside of the causal
horizon as an attractive way to count the inflationary multiverse. Even though
the causal patch measure relieves the Boltzmann brain problem and stresses
physical reality based on observations, it could be challenged by the
construction of counterexamples, both on regular black holes and charged black
holes, to black hole complementarity.
