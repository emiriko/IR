We calculate the valley degeneracy ($g_v$) dependence of the many-body
renormalization of quasiparticle properties in multivalley 2D semiconductor
structures due to the Coulomb interaction between the carriers. Quite
unexpectedly, the $g_v$ dependence of many-body effects is nontrivial and
non-generic, and depends qualitatively on the specific Fermi liquid property
under consideration. While the interacting 2D compressibility manifests
monotonically increasing many-body renormalization with increasing $g_v$, the
2D spin susceptibility exhibits an interesting non-monotonic $g_v$ dependence
with the susceptibility increasing (decreasing) with $g_v$ for smaller (larger)
values of $g_v$ with the renormalization effect peaking around $g_v\sim 1-2$.
Our theoretical results provide a clear conceptual understanding of recent
valley-dependent 2D susceptibility measurements in AlAs quantum wells.
