In this paper we present quantitative results for coherent pion production by
neutrinos scattered off nuclei within the framework developed by Gounaris,
Kartavtsev and Paschos. The method is based on PCAC and uses helicity cross
sections for the scattering of weak gauge bosons on nuclei. The process relies
on experimental data for elastic pion-nucleus scattering. A detailed analysis
of the differential and integrated cross sections is presented for neutral and
charged currents, with special emphasis on the regions of integrations. The
results are extended to energies of 10.0 GeV and are compared with experimental
data.
