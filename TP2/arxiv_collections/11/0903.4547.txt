We propose a novel spin liquid state for a spin S=1 antiferromagnet in two
dimensions. The ground state violates P and T, is a spin-singlet, and is fully
invariant under the lattice symmetries. The spinon and holon excitations are
deconfined and obey non-abelian statistics. We present preliminary numerical
evidence that the universality class of this topological liquid can be
stabilized by a local Hamiltonian involving three-spin interactions. We
conjecture that spinons in spin liquids with spin larger than 1/2 obey
non-abelian statistics in general.
