We show that a multi-step quantum walk can be realized for a single trapped
ion with interpolation between quantum and random walk achieved by randomizing
the generalized Hadamard coin flip phase. The signature of the quantum walk is
manifested not only in the ion's position but also its phonon number, which
makes an ion trap implementation of the quantum walk feasible.
