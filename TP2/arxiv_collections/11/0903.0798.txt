We demonstrate the effects of geometric perturbation on the
Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) states in a long, thin, hollow cylinder whose
radius varies periodically. The variation in the surface curvature inherent to
the system gives rise to a significant increase in the power-law exponent of
the single-particle density of states. The increase in the TLL exponent is
caused by a curvature-induced potential that attracts low-energy electrons to
region that has large curvature.
