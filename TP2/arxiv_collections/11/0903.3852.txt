Numerical integration of stochastic differential equations is commonly used
in many branches of science. In this paper we present how to accelerate this
kind of numerical calculations with popular NVIDIA Graphics Processing Units
using the CUDA programming environment. We address general aspects of numerical
programming on stream processors and illustrate them by two examples: the noisy
phase dynamics in a Josephson junction and the noisy Kuramoto model. In
presented cases the measured speedup can be as high as 675x compared to a
typical CPU, which corresponds to several billion integration steps per second.
This means that calculations which took weeks can now be completed in less than
one hour. This brings stochastic simulation to a completely new level, opening
for research a whole new range of problems which can now be solved
interactively.
