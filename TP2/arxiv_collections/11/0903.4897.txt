We derive improved versions of the relations between supermassive black hole
mass (M_BH) and host-galaxy bulge velocity dispersion (sigma) and luminosity
(L) (the M-sigma and M-L relations), based on 49 M_BH measurements and 19 upper
limits. Particular attention is paid to recovery of the intrinsic scatter
(epsilon_0) in both relations. We find log(M_BH / M_sun) = alpha + beta *
log(sigma / 200 km/s) with (alpha, beta, epsilon_0) = (8.12 +/- 0.08, 4.24 +/-
0.41, 0.44 +/- 0.06) for all galaxies and (alpha, beta, epsilon_0) = (8.23 +/-
0.08, 3.96 +/- 0.42, 0.31 +/- 0.06) for ellipticals. The results for
ellipticals are consistent with previous studies, but the intrinsic scatter
recovered for spirals is significantly larger. The scatter inferred reinforces
the need for its consideration when calculating local black hole mass function
based on the M-sigma relation, and further implies that there may be
substantial selection bias in studies of the evolution of the M-sigma relation.
We estimate the M-L relationship as log(M_BH / M_sun) = alpha + beta * log(L_V
/ 10^11 L_sun,V) of (alpha, beta, epsilon_0) = (8.95 +/- 0.11, 1.11 +/- 0.18,
0.38 +/- 0.09); using only early-type galaxies. These results appear to be
insensitive to a wide range of assumptions about the measurement errors and the
distribution of intrinsic scatter. We show that culling the sample according to
the resolution of the black hole's sphere of influence biases the relations to
larger mean masses, larger slopes, and incorrect intrinsic residuals.
