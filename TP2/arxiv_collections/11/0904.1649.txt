Some physical aspects related to the limit operations of the Thomson lamp are
discussed. Regardless of the formally unbounded and even infinite number of
"steps" involved, the physical limit has an operational meaning in agreement
with the Abel sums of infinite series. The formal analogies to accelerated
(hyper-) computers and the recursion theoretic diagonal methods are discussed.
As quantum information is not bound by the mutually exclusive states of
classical bits, it allows a consistent representation of fixed point states of
the diagonal operator. In an effort to reconstruct the self-contradictory
feature of diagonalization, a generalized diagonal method allowing no quantum
fixed points is proposed.
