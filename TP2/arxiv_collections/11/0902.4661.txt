We study the evolution of cooperation in the prisoner's dilemma and the
snowdrift game on scale-free networks that are subjected to intentional and
random removal of vertices. We show that, irrespective of the game type,
cooperation on scale-free networks is extremely robust against random deletion
of vertices, but declines fast if vertices with the maximal degree are
targeted. In particular, attack tolerance is lowest if the temptation to defect
is largest, whereby a small fraction of removed vertices suffices to decimate
cooperators. The decline of cooperation can be directly linked to the decrease
of heterogeneity of scale-free networks that sets in due to the removal of high
degree vertices. We conclude that the evolution of cooperation is characterized
by similar attack and error tolerance as was previously reported for
information readiness and spread of viruses on scale-free networks.
