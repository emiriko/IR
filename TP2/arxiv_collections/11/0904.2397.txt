Based on the extended Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk formalism, the tunneling
conductance characteristics of a planar junction between a ferromagnet and a
noncentrosymmetric superconductor are studied. The effects of the Rashba
spin-orbit coupling (RSOC), the exchange energy, and the Fermi wave-vector
mismatch (FWM) on the conductance are all taken into account. In the absence of
the FWM, it is found that far away from the gap edge the conductance is
suppressed by the RSOC, while around the gap edge it is almost independent of
RSOC. The interplay of the RSOC and the exchange energy causes an enhancement
of the subgap conductance, which is more pronounced when the RSOC is small.
When the FWM is introduced, it is shown that the conductance is monotonically
enhanced as the FWM parameter decreases.
