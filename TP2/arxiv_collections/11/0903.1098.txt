We calculate $\gamma Z$ exchange corrections to the parity-violating
asymmetry of the elastic electron-proton scattering in a parton model using the
formalism of generalized parton distributions(GPDs). We also examine the
validity of the zero-momentum-transfer approximation adopted in the literatures
and find that it overestimates the $\gamma Z$ exchange effect significantly at
the forward scattering angles.
