We present two sets of computable entanglement measures for multipartite
systems where each subsystem can have different degrees of freedom (so-called
qudits). One set, called 'separability' measure, reveals which of the
subsystems are separable/entangled. For that we have to extend the concept of
k-separability for multipartite systems to a novel unambiguous separability
concept which we call \gamma_k-separability. The second set of entanglement
measures reveals the 'kind' of entanglement, i.e. if it is bipartite,
tripartite, ..., n-partite entangled and is denoted as the 'physical' measure.
We show how lower bounds on both sets of measures can be obtained by the
observation that any entropy may be rewritten via operational expressions known
as m-concurrences. Moreover, for different classes of bipartite or multipartite
qudit systems we compute the bounds explicitly and discover that they are often
tight or equivalent to positive partial transposition (PPT).
