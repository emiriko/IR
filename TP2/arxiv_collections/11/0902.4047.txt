It is known that when the steady state of a one-dimensional multispecies
system, which evolves via a random-sequential updating mechanism, is written in
terms of a linear combination of Bernoulli shock measures with random-walk
dynamics, it can be equivalently expressed as a matrix-product state. In this
case the quadratic algebra of the system always has a two-dimensional matrix
representation. Our investigations show that this equivalence exists at least
for the systems with deterministic sublattice-parallel update. In this paper we
consider the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process on a finite lattice
with open boundaries and sublattice-parallel update as an example.
