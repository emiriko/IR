We determine the commutation relations satisfied by the quantized
electromagnetic field in the presence of macroscopic dielectrics and
conductors, with arbitrary dispersive and dissipative properties. We consider
in detail the case of two plane-parallel material slabs, separated by an empty
gap, and we show that at all points in the empty region between the slabs,
including their surfaces, the electromagnetic fields always satisfy free-field
canonical equal-time commutation relations. This result is a consequence of
general analyticity and fall-off properties at large frequencies satisfied by
the reflection coefficients of all real materials. It is also shown that this
result does not obtain in the case of conductors, if the latter are modelled as
perfect mirrors. In such a case, the free-field form of the commutation
relations is recovered only at large distances from the mirrors, in agreement
with the findings of previous authors. Failure of perfect-mirror boundary
conditions to reproduce the correct form of the commutation relations near the
surfaces of the conductors, suggests that caution should be used when these
idealized boundary conditions are used in investigations of proximity phenomena
originating from the quantized electromagnetic field, like the Casimir effect.
