We present near-IR photo-spectroscopy in the H and K bands of the 2006
outburst of the recurrent nova RS Ophiuchi (RS Oph). The observations cover the
period between 1 to 94 days after the eruption. The near IR light curve and an
extensive set of spectra are presented, lines identified and the general
characteristics of the spectra discussed. Analysis of the HI line profiles show
the presence of broad wings on both flanks of a strong central component
indicating the presence of a bipolar velocity flow in the ejecta. Such a flow
is kinematically consistent with the bipolar structure that the object displays
in high-resolution spatial images. We discuss the behaviour and origin of the
Fe II lines at 1.6872 and 1.7414 micron and show that Lyman alpha and Lyman
continuum fluorescence are viable mechanisms to excite these lines. We draw
upon the result, that collisional excitation can also contribute in exciting
and significantly enhancing the strength of these Fe II lines, to propose that
these lines originate from a site of high particle density. Such a likely site
could be the high-density, low temperature contact surface that should exist in
the shockfront in between the shocked ejecta and red giant wind. Recombination
analysis of the HI lines indicate deviations from Case B conditions during most
of the span of our observations indicating optical depth effects. It appears
likely that the breakout of the shockfront had not yet occured till the end of
our observations. An analysis is made of the temporal evolution of the [Si VI]
1.9641 micron coronal line and another coronal line at 2.0894 micron which is
attributed to [Mn XIV]. Assuming collisional effects to dominate in the hot
coronal gas, estimates are made of the ion temperature in the gas.
