We investigate the effect of surface waves generated by the Faraday
instability on a shear-thickening surfactant solution under vertical
vibrations. We show that a prolonged oscillation of the surface above the
instability onset leads to an increase of the fluid viscosity. This phenomenon
is evidenced by comparing the time needed for the instability to develop in the
fluid at rest and once the fluid has been shaken above onset: pre-shaking may
delay the instability by two orders of magnitude. A simple model based on a
time-dependent viscosity is proposed which accounts quantitatively for the
experimental observations.
