We present the N_f=2+1 clover fermion lattice QCD calculation of the nucleon
strangeness form factors. We evaluate disconnected insertions using the Z(4)
stochastic method, along with unbiased subtractions from the hopping parameter
expansion. We find that increasing the number of nucleon sources for each
configuration improves the signal significantly. We obtain G_M^s(0) =
-0.017(25)(07), where the first error is statistical, and the second is the
uncertainties in Q^2 and chiral extrapolations. This is consistent with
experimental values, and has an order of magnitude smaller error.
