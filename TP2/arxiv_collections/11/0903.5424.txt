We report on further evidence that the Y(3940) and the recently observed
Y(4140) are heavy hadron molecule states with quantum numbers J(PC) = 0(++).
The Y(3940) state is considered to be a superposition of D*(+)D*(-) and D*(0)
barD*(0), while the Y(4140) is a bound state of Ds*(+) and Ds*(-) mesons. For
the first time we give predictions for the strong Y(3940) to Jpsi omega,
Y(4140) to Jpsi phi and radiative Y(3940)/Y(4140) to gamma gamma decay widths
in a phenomenological Lagrangian approach. Results for the strong Jpsi V (V =
omega, phi) decays clearly support the molecular interpretation of the Y(3940)
and Y(4140).
