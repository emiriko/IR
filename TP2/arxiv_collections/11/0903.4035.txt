A large part of the hidden web resides in weblog servers. New content is
produced in a daily basis and the work of traditional search engines turns to
be insufficient due to the nature of weblogs. This work summarizes the
structure of the blogosphere and highlights the special features of weblogs. In
this paper we present a method for ranking weblogs based on the link graph and
on several similarity characteristics between weblogs. First we create an
enhanced graph of connected weblogs and add new types of edges and weights
utilising many weblog features. Then, we assign a ranking to each weblog using
our algorithm, BlogRank, which is a modified version of PageRank. For the
validation of our method we run experiments on a weblog dataset, which we
process and adapt to our search engine. (http://spiderwave.aueb.gr/Blogwave).
The results suggest that the use of the enhanced graph and the BlogRank
algorithm is preferred by the users.
