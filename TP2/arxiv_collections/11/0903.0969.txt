We study the decay rate of process B->K l+ l- (l=e,mu) and some of its other
related observables, like forward backward asymmetry (A_{FB}), polarization
asymmetry (PA) and CP-asymmetry (A_{CP}) in R-parity violating (R_{p}) Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). The analysis shows that R_{p}Yukawa
coupling products contribute significantly to the branching fraction of B->K l+
l- within 1 sigma and 2 sigma. Study shows that PA and A_{FB} are sensitive
enough to R_{p}Yukawa coupling products and turn out to be good predictions for
measurement in future experiments.The CP-asymmetry calculated in this framework
agrees well with the recently reported value(i.e. 7%).
