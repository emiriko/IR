Ground state cooling of a nanomechanical resonator coupled to a
superconducting flux qubit is discussed. We show that by inducing quantum
interference to cancel detrimental carrier excitations, ground state cooling
becomes possible in the weak-confinement or non-resolved regime. The qubit is
modelled as a three-level system in lambda configuration, and the driving
fluxes are applied such that the qubit absorption spectrum exhibits
electromagnetically induced transparency, thereby cancelling the unwanted
carrier excitation. As our interference-based scheme allows to apply strong
cooling fields, fast and efficient cooling can be achieved.
