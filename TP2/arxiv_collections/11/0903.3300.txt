In this talk we present data analysis methods for reconstructing the mass and
couplings of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) by using directly
future experimental data (i.e., measured recoil energies) from direct Dark
Matter detection. These methods are independent of the model of Galactic halo
as well as of WIMPs. The basic ideas of these methods and the feasibility and
uncertainties of applying them to direct detection experiments with the next
generation detectors will be discussed.
