We perform a study of the exclusive production of $D \bar D$, $D \bar D^*$,
and $D^* \bar D^*$ in initial-state-radiation events, from $e^+ e^-$
annihilations at a center-of-mass energy near 10.58 GeV, to search for
charmonium and possible new resonances. The data sample corresponds to an
integrated luminosity of 384 $fb^{-1}$ and was recorded by the BaBar experiment
at the PEP-II storage rings. The $D \bar D$, $D \bar D^*$, and $D^* \bar D^*$
mass spectra show clear evidence of several $\psi$ resonances. However, there
is no evidence for $Y(4260) \to D \bar D^*$ or $Y(4260)\to D^* \bar D^*$.
