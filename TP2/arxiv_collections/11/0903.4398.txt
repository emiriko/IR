Electric field fluctuations play a major role in dissociation reactions in
liquid water and determine its vibrational spectroscopic response. Here, we
study the statistics of electric fields in liquid water using molecular
dynamics computer simulations with a particular focus on the strong but rare
fields that drive dissociation. Our simulations indicate that the important
contributions to the electric field acting on OH bonds stem from water
molecules less than 7 {\AA} away. Long-ranged contributions play a minor role.
