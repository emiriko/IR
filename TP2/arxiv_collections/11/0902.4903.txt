The next generation of long baseline neutrino experiments will aim at
determining the value of the unknown mixing angle, theta_{13}, the type of
neutrino mass hierarchy and the presence of CP-violation in the lepton sector.
Beta-beams and electron capture experiments have been studied as viable
candidates for long baseline experiments. They use a very clean electron
neutrino beam from the beta-decays or electron capture decays of boosted ions.
In the present article we consider an hybrid setup which combines a beta-beam
with an electron capture beam by using boosted Ytterbium ions. We study the
sensitivity to the CP-violating phase delta and the theta_{13} angle, the
CP-discovery potential and the reach to determine the type of neutrino mass
hierarchy for this type of long baseline experiment. The analysis is performed
for different neutrino beam energies and baselines. Finally, we also discuss
how the results would change if a better knowledge of some of the assumed
parameters was achieved by the time this experiment could take place.
