New physics at high energy scale often contributes to K-\bar K and D-\bar D
mixings in an approximately SU(2)_L invariant way. In such a case, the
combination of measurements in these two systems is particularly powerful. The
resulting constraints can be expressed in terms of misalignments and flavor
splittings.
