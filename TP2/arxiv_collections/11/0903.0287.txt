We reexamine relic abundance of a singlet fermion as a CDM candidate, which
contributes to the neutrino mass generation through radiative seesaw mechanism.
We search solutions for Yukawa couplings and the mass spectrum of relevant
fields to explain neutrino oscillation data. For such solutions, we show that
an abundance of a lightest singlet fermion can be consistent with WMAP data
without conflicting with both bounds of $\mu\to e\gamma$ and $\tau\to
\mu\gamma$. This reconciliation does not need any modification of the original
radiative seesaw model other than by specifying flavor structure of Yukawa
couplings and taking account of coannihilation effects.
