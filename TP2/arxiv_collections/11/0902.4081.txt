Superconducting gravimeters are the most sensitive instruments to measure
surface gravity changes at low frequencies. Currently, about twenty five
superconducting gravimeters are operating in the world and their global network
has been developed. We investigate possible applications of the superconducting
gravimeters to tests of gravitational physics. Previous experimental searches
for spatial anisotropies in the gravitational constant G and for gravitational
waves, performed with gravimeters in 1960's to 1970's, can be improved by
applications of the current superconducting gravimeters. Also, we describe
other proposed applications of testing the universality of free-fall and
searching for composition-dependent dilatonic waves, and discuss future works
necessary for these geophysical tests.
