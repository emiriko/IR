We apply the statefinder diagnostic to the torsion cosmology, in which an
accounting for the accelerated universe is considered in term of a
Riemann-Cartan geometry: dynamic scalar torsion. We find that there are some
typical characteristic of the evolution of statefinder parameters for the
torsion cosmology that can be distinguished from the other cosmological models.
Furthermore, we also show that statefinder diagnostic has a direct bearing on
the critical points. The statefinder diagnostic divides the torsion parameter
$a_1$ into differential ranges, which is in keeping with the requirement of
dynamical analysis. In addition, we fit the scalar torsion model to ESSENCE
supernovae data and give the best fit values of the model parameters.
