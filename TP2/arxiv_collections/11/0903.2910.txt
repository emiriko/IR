In this paper, we study the Kelly criterion in the continuous time framework
building on the work of E.O. Thorp and others. The existence of an optimal
strategy is proven in a general setting and the corresponding optimal wealth
process is found. A simple formula is provided for calculating the optimal
portfolio for a set of price processes satisfying some simple conditions.
Properties of the optimal investment strategy for assets governed by multiple
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes are studied. The paper ends with a short
discussion of the implications of these ideas for financial markets.
