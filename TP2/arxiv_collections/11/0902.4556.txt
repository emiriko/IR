We investigate the consequences of the stripe formation in the nickelate
La5/3Sr1/3NiO4 for the details of its crystal structure and electronic states.
Our data are based on numerical simulations within density functional theory
(DFT) and the generalized gradient approximation (GGA). The on-site Coulomb
interaction is included in terms of the LDA+U scheme. Structure optimization of
preliminary experimental data indicates a strong interaction between the
structural and electronic degrees of freedom. In particular, we find a
segregation of the diagonal filled stripes induced by a delicate interplay with
the magnetic coupling. Beyond the cooperative effect of stripe segregation and
spin order, distinct octahedral distortions are essential for the formation of
an insulating state.
