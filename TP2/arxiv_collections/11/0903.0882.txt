A relatively simple approach to noncommutative gravity utilizes the gauge
theory formulation of general relativity and involves replacing the Lorentz
gauge group by a larger group. This results in additional field degrees of
freedom which either must be constrained to vanish in a nontrivial way, or
require physical interpretation. With the latter in mind, we examine the
coupling of the additional fields to point particles. Nonstandard particle
degrees of freedom should be introduced in order to write down the most general
coupling. The example we study is the $GL(2,C)$ central extension of gravity
given by Chamseddine, which contains two U(1) gauge fields, and a complex
vierbein matrix, along with the usual spin connections. For the general
coupling one should then attach two U(1) charges and a complex momentum vector
to the particle, along with the spin. The momenta span orbits in a
four-dimensional complex vector space, and are classified by $GL(2,C)$
invariants and by their little groups. In addition to orbits associated with
standard massive and massless particles, a number of novel orbits can be
identified. We write down a general action principle for particles associated
with any nontrivial orbit and show that it leads to corrections to geodesic
motion. We also examine the classical and quantum theory of the particle in
flat space-time.
