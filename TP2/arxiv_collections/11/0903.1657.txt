Because of the double-helical structure of DNA, in which two strands of
complementary nucleotides intertwine around each other, a covalently closed DNA
molecule with no interruptions in either strand can be viewed as two
interlocked single-stranded rings. Two closed space curves have long been known
by mathematicians to exhibit a property called the linking number, a
topologically invariant integer, expressible as the sum of two other
quantities, the twist of one of the curves about the other, and the writhing
number, or writhe, a measure of the chiral distortion from planarity of one of
the two closed curves. We here derive expressions for the twist of supercoiled
DNA and the writhe of a closed molecule consistent with the modern view of DNA
as a sequence of base-pair steps. Structural biologists commonly characterize
the spatial disposition of each step in terms of six rigid-body parameters, one
of which, coincidentally, is also called the twist. Of interest is the
difference in the mathematical properties between this step-parameter twist and
the twist of supercoiling associated with a given base-pair step. For example,
it turns out that the latter twist, unlike the former, is sensitive to certain
translational shearing distortions of the molecule that are chiral in nature.
Thus, by comparing the values for the two twists for each step of a
high-resolution structure of a protein-DNA complex, the nucleosome considered
here, for example, we may be able to determine how the binding of various
proteins contributes to chiral structural changes of the DNA.
