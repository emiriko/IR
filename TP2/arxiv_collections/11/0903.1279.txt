We carry out global fits to the Non-Universal Higgs Model (NUHM), applying
all relevant present-day constraints. We present global probability maps for
the NUHM parameters and observables (including collider signatures, direct and
indirect detection quantities), both in terms of posterior probabilities and in
terms of profile likelihood maps. We identify regions of the parameter space
where the neutralino dark matter in the model is either bino-like, or else
higgsino-like with mass close to 1 TeV and spin-independent scattering cross
section ~ 10^{-9}-10^{-8} pb. We trace the occurrence of the higgsino-like
region to be a consequence of a mild focusing effect in the running of one of
the Higgs masses, the existence of which in the NUHM we identify in our
analysis. Although the usual bino-like neutralino is more prominent,
higgsino-like dark matter cannot be excluded, however its significance strongly
depends on the prior and statistics used to assess it. We note that, despite
experimental constraints often favoring different regions of parameter space to
the Constrained MSSM, most observational consequences appear fairly similar,
which will make it challenging to distinguish the two models experimentally
