We produce numerical evidence that spikes in the Mixmaster regime of G_2
cosmologies are transient and recurring, supporting the conjecture that the
generalized Mixmaster behavior is asymptotically non-local where spikes occur.
Higher order spike transitions are observed to split into separate first order
spike transitions.
