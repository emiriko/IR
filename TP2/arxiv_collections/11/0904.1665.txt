The experiments at LHC have shown that the SUSY (exotic) bound states are
likely to form bound states in an entirely similar fashion as ordinary quarks
form bound states, i.e., quarkonium. Also, the interaction between two squarks
is due to gluon exchange which is found to be very similar to that interaction
between two ordinary quarks. This motivates us to solve the Schr\"{o}dinger
equation with a strictly phenomenological static quark-antiquark potential:
$V(r)=-Ar^{-1}+\kappa \sqrt{r}+V_{0}$ using the shifted large $N$-expansion
method to calculate the low-lying spectrum of a heavy quark with
anti-sbottom\textbf{\}$(c\bar{\widetilde{b}},b% \bar{\widetilde{b}})$ and
sbottom with anti-sbottom $(\widetilde{b}% \bar{\widetilde{b}})$ bound states
with $m_{\widetilde{b}}$ is set free. To have a full knowledge on spectrum, we
also give the result for a heavier as well as for lighter sbottom masses. As a
test for the reliability of these calculations, we fix the parameters of this
potential by fitting the spin-triplet $(n^{3}S_{1})$ and center-of-gravity
$l\neq 0$ experimental spectrum of the ordinary heavy quarkonia
$c\bar{c},c\bar{b}$ and $b% \bar{b}$ to few $\mathrm{MeV.}$ Our results are
compared with other models to gauge the reliability of these predictions and
point out differences.
