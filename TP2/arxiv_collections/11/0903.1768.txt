The asteroseismology of rapidly rotating pulsating stars is hindered by our
poor knowledge of the effect of the rotation on the oscillation properties.
Here we present an asymptotic analysis of high-frequency acoustic modes in
rapidly rotating stars. We study the Hamiltonian dynamics of acoustic rays in
uniformly rotating polytropic stars and show that the phase space structure has
a mixed character, regions of chaotic trajectories coexisting with stable
structures like island chains or invariant tori. In order to interpret the ray
dynamics in terms of acoustic mode properties, we then use tools and concepts
developed in the context of quantum physics. Accordingly, the high-frequency
acoustic spectrum is a superposition of frequency subsets associated with
dynamically independent phase space regions. The sub-spectra associated with
stable structures are regular and can be modelled through EBK quantization
methods while those associated with chaotic regions are irregular but with
generic statistical properties. The results of this asymptotic analysis are
successfully confronted with the properties of numerically computed
high-frequency acoustic modes. The implications for the asteroseismology of
rapidly rotating stars are discussed.
