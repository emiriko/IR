We investigate the decay of entanglement of a generalized N-qudit GHZ state,
with each qudit passing through independently in a quantum noisy channel. By
studying the time at which the entanglement completely vanishes and the time at
which the entanglement becomes arbitrarily small, we try to find how the
robustness of entanglement is influenced by dimension d and the number of
particles N.
