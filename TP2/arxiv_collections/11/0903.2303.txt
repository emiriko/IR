Phase transition is observed between one-phase disordered phase and an
ordered phase with multi-lamellar (onion) structures in an off-critical mixture
of D$_2$O and 3-methylpyridine (3MP) containing a salt at 85mM. The salt
consists of hydrophilic cations and hydrophobic anions, which interact
asymmetrically with the solvent composition fluctuations inducing mesophases.
The structure factor of the composition distribution obtained from small-angle
neutron scattering has a peak at an intermediate wave number in the disordered
phase and multiple peaks in the ordered phase. Lamellar layers forming onions
are composed of solvation-induced charged membranes swollen by D$_2$O. The
onion phase is realized only for small volume fractions of 3MP (in D$_2$O-rich
solvent).
