In this paper it is shown that the steady-state weights of the asymmetric
simple exclusion process (ASEP) with open boundaries and parallel update can be
written as a product of a scalar pair-factorized and a matrix-product state.
This type of state is also obtained for an ASEP on a ring in which particles
can move one or two sites. The dynamics leads to the formation of an excess
hole that plays the role of a defect. We expect the process to play a similar
role for parallel dynamics as the well-known ASEP with a single defect-particle
(that is obtained in the continuous-time limit) especially for the study of
shocks. The process exhibits a first-order phase transition between two phases
with different defect velocities. These are calculated exactly from the
process-generating function.
