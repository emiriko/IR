Inspired by philosophical ideas of Boltzmann, which are briefly recalled, we
provide strong support for the possibility and convenience of a realistic world
picture, properly nuanced. The arguments have consequences for the
interpretation of quantum mechanics, and for relevant concepts of quantum field
and string theory, like monopoles and branes. Our view is illustrated with a
cybernetic analogy and complemented with a summary of the basic philosophical
concepts.
