Main objective of the present dissertation is the investigation for all the
possible low energy models which emerge in four dimensions by the dimensional
reduction of a gauge theory over multiple connected coset spaces. The higher
dimensional gauge theory is chosen to be the one that the Heterotic string
theory suggests: (i) it is defined in ten dimensions, (ii) it is based on the
E(8) x E(8) symmetry group and (iii) it is N=1 globally supersymmetric. The
search of all four-dimensional gauge theories resulting from the aforementioned
dimensional reduction, is restricted only to models which are potentially
interesting from a phenomenological point of view. This requirement constrain
these models to come from one of the known Grand Unified Theories (GUTs) in an
intermediate stage of the spontaneous symmetry breaking. Main result of my
study is that extensions of the Standard Model (SM) which are based on the
Pati-Salam group structure can be obtained in four dimensions. I furthermore
review some interesting noncommutative generalizations of the above ideas and
verify an important conclusion of a previous research work, namely that the
particle physics models resulting from this particular dimensional reduction
are renormalizable. Finally, assuming noncommutative characteristics for the
four-dimensional Minkowski space, M^{4}, I examine a particular approach of
noncommutative gravity. It turns out that the Ricci curvature tensor receives
non-trivial contributions due to the noncommutative structure of the algebra
describing the space, This conclusion suggests a possible fundamental
connection between the noncommutative geometry and the theory of gravity.
