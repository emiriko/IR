Ultra-cool dwarfs of the L spectral type (Teff=1400-2200K) are known to have
dusty atmospheres. Asymmetries of the dwarf surface may arise from
rotationally-induced flattening and dust-cloud coverage, and may result in
non-zero linear polarisation through dust scattering.
  We aim to study the heterogeneity of ultra-cool dwarfs' atmospheres and the
grain-size effects on the polarisation degree in a sample of nine late M, L and
early T dwarfs.
  We obtain linear polarimetric imaging measurements using FORS1 at the Very
Large Telescope, in the Bessel I filter, and for a subset in the Bessel R and
the Gunn z filters.
  We measure a polarisation degree of (0.31+/-0.06)% for LHS102BC. We fail to
detect linear polarisation in the rest of our sample, with upper-limits on the
polarisation degree of each object of 0.09% to 0.76% (95% CL). For those
targets we do not find evidence of large-scale cloud horizontal structure in
our data. Together with previous surveys, our results set the fraction of
ultra-cool dwarfs with detected linear polarisation to (30+10-6)% (1-sigma).
  For three brown dwarfs, our observations indicate polarisation degrees
different (at the 3-sigma level) than previously reported, giving hints of
possible variations.
  Our results fail to correlate with the current model predictions for
ultra-cool dwarf polarisation for a flattening-induced polarisation, or with
the variability studies for a polarisation induced by an hetereneous cloud
cover. This stresses the intricacy of each of those tasks, but may as well
proceed from complex and dynamic atmospheric processes.
