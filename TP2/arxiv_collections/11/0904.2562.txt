The paper investigates a significant part of the automorphic, in fact of the
so-called Eisenstein cohomology of split odd orthogonal groups over Q. The main
result provides a description of residual and regular Eisenstein cohomology
classes for maximal parabolic Q-subgroups in case of generic cohomological
cuspidal automorphic representations of their Levi subgroups. That is, such
identifying necessary conditions on these latter representations as well as on
the complex parameters in order for the associated Eisenstein series to
possibly yield non-trivial classes in the automorphic cohomology.
