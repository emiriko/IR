We present the largest, most homogeneous catalogue of merging galaxies in the
nearby universe obtained through the Galaxy Zoo project - an interface on the
world-wide web enabling large-scale morphological classification of galaxies
through visual inspection of images from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).
The method converts a set of visually-inspected classifications for each galaxy
into a single parameter (the `weighted-merger-vote fraction,' $f_m$) which
describes our confidence that the system is part of an ongoing merger. We
describe how $f_m$ is used to create a catalogue of 3003 visually-selected
pairs of merging galaxies from the SDSS in the redshift range $0.005 < z <0.1$.
We use our merger sample and values of $f_m$ applied to the SDSS Main Galaxy
Spectral sample (MGS) to estimate that the fraction of volume-limited ($M_r <
-20.55$) major mergers ($1/3 < {M}^*_1/{M}^*_2 < 3$) in the nearby universe is
$1 - 3 \times C%$ where $C \sim 1.5$ is a correction factor for spectroscopic
incompleteness. Having visually classified the morphologies of the constituent
galaxies in our mergers, we find that the spiral-to-elliptical ratio of
galaxies in mergers is higher by a factor $\sim 2$ relative to the global
population. In a companion paper, we examine the internal properties of these
merging galaxies and conclude that this high spiral-to-elliptical ratio in
mergers is due to a longer time-scale over which mergers with spirals are
detectable compared to mergers with ellipticals.
