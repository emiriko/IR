Using the generalisation of Zhu's recursion relations to N=2 superconformal
field theories we construct modular covariant differential operators for weak
Jacobi forms. We show that differential operators of this type characterise the
elliptic genera of N=2 superconformal minimal models, and sketch how they can
be used to constrain extremal N=2 superconformal field theories.
