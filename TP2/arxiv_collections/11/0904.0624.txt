We provide a new dynamic approach to scenario generation for the purposes of
risk management in the banking industry. We connect ideas from conventional
techniques -- like historical and Monte Carlo simulation -- and we come up with
a hybrid method that shares the advantages of standard procedures but
eliminates several of their drawbacks. Instead of considering the static
problem of constructing one or ten day ahead distributions for vectors of risk
factors, we embed the problem into a dynamic framework, where any time horizon
can be consistently simulated. Additionally, we use standard models from
mathematical finance for each risk factor, whence bridging the worlds of
trading and risk management.
  Our approach is based on stochastic differential equations (SDEs), like the
HJM-equation or the Black-Scholes equation, governing the time evolution of
risk factors, on an empirical calibration method to the market for the chosen
SDEs, and on an Euler scheme (or high-order schemes) for the numerical
evaluation of the respective SDEs. The empirical calibration procedure
presented in this paper can be seen as the SDE-counterpart of the so called
Filtered Historical Simulation method; the behavior of volatility stems in our
case out of the assumptions on the underlying SDEs. Furthermore, we are able to
easily incorporate "middle-size" and "large-size" events within our framework
always making a precise distinction between the information obtained from the
market and the one coming from the necessary a-priori intuition of the risk
manager.
  Results of one concrete implementation are provided.
