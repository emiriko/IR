The class of d-setting, d-outcome Bell inequalities proposed by Ji and
collaborators [Phys. Rev. A 78, 052103] are reexamined. For every positive
integer d > 2, we show that the corresponding non-trivial Bell inequality for
probabilities provides the maximum classical winning probability of the
Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt-like game with d inputs and d outputs. We also
demonstrate that the general classical upper bounds given by Ji et al. are
underestimated, which invalidates many of the corresponding correlation
inequalities presented thereof. We remedy this problem, partially, by providing
the actual classical upper bound for d less than or equal to 13 (including
non-prime values of d). We further determine that for prime value d in this
range, most of these probability and correlation inequalities are tight, i.e.,
facet-inducing for the respective classical correlation polytope. Stronger
lower and upper bounds on the quantum violation of these inequalities are
obtained. In particular, we prove that once the probability inequalities are
given, their correlation counterparts given by Ji and co-workers are no longer
relevant in terms of detecting the entanglement of a quantum state.
