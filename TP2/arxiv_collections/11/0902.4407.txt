The four-point integral of the minimal super Liouville gravity on the sphere
is evaluated numerically. The integration procedure is based on the effective
elliptic parameterization of the moduli space. The analysis is performed for a
few different gravitational four-point amplitudes. The results agree with the
analytic results recently obtained using the Higher super Liouville equations
of motion.
