We investigate nonlinear transport in electronic Fabry-Perot interferometers
in the integer quantum Hall regime. For interferometers sufficiently large that
Coulomb blockade effects are absent, a checkerboard-like pattern of conductance
oscillations as a function of dc bias and perpendicular magnetic field is
observed. Edge-state velocities extracted from the checkerboard data are
compared to model calculations and found to be consistent with a crossover from
skipping orbits at low fields to E x B drift at high fields. Suppression of
visibility as a function of bias and magnetic field is accounted for by
including energy- and field-dependent dephasing of edge electrons.
