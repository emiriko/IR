We re-consider the gravitino as dark matter in the framework of the
Constrained MSSM. We include several recently suggested improvements on: (i)
the thermal production of gravitinos, (ii) the calculation of the hadronic
spectrum from NLSP decay and (iii) the BBN calculation including stau
bound-state effects. In most cases we find an upper bound on the reheating
temperature $\treh\lsim {\rm a few}\times 10^7\gev$ from over-production of
$^6{\rm Li}$ from bound state effects. We also find an upper limit on the stau
lifetime of $3\times10^4 \sec$, which is nearly an order of magnitude larger
than the simple limit $5\times 10^3 \sec$ often used to avoid the effect of
bound-state catalysis. The bound on $\treh$ is relaxed to $\lsim {\rm a
few}\times 10^8\gev$ when we use a more conservative bound on ${^6}{\rm
Li}/{^7}{\rm Li}$, in which case a new region at small stau mass at $\sim
100\gev$ and much longer lifetimes opens up. Such a low stau mass region can be
easily tested at the LHC.
