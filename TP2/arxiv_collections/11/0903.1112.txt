The paper aims to discuss statistical properties of the multi-agent based
model of competitive growth. Each of the agents is described by growth (or
decay) rule of its virtual "mass" with the rate affected by the interaction
with other agents. The interaction depends on the strategy vector and mutual
distance between agents and both are subjected to the agent's individual
optimization process. Steady-state simulations yield phase diagrams with the
high and low competition phases (HCP and LCP, respectively) separated by
critical point. Particular focus has been made on the indicators of the
power-law behavior of the mass distributions with respect to the critical
regime. In this regime the study has revealed remarkable anomaly in the
optimization efficiency.
