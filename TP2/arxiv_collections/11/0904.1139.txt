We study the equation of state for symmetric nuclear matter using a
ring-diagram approach in which the particle-particle hole-hole ($pphh$) ring
diagrams within a momentum model space of decimation scale $\Lambda$ are summed
to all orders. The calculation is carried out using the renormalized
low-momentum nucleon-nucleon (NN) interaction $V_{low-k}$, which is obtained
from a bare NN potential by integrating out the high-momentum components beyond
$\Lambda$. The bare NN potentials of CD-Bonn, Nijmegen and Idaho have been
employed. The choice of $\Lambda$ and its influence on the single particle
spectrum are discussed. Ring-diagram correlations at intermediate momenta
($k\simeq$ 2 fm$^{-1}$) are found to be particularly important for nuclear
saturation, suggesting the necessity of using a sufficiently large decimation
scale so that the above momentum region is not integrated out. Using
$V_{low-k}$ with $\Lambda \sim 3$ fm$^{-1}$, we perform a ring-diagram
computation with the above potentials, which all yield saturation energies
$E/A$ and Fermi momenta $k_F^{(0)}$ considerably larger than the empirical
values. On the other hand, similar computations with the medium-dependent
Brown-Rho scaled NN potentials give satisfactory results of $E/A \simeq -15$
MeV and $k_F^{(0)}\simeq 1.4$ fm$^{-1}$. The effect of this medium dependence
is well reproduced by an empirical 3-body force of the Skyrme type.
