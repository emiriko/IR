We show that the statistics of a turbulent passive scalar at scales larger
than the pumping may exhibit multiscaling due to a weaker mechanism than the
presence of statistical conservation laws. We develop a general formalism to
give explicit predictions for the large scale scaling exponents in the case of
the Kraichnan model and discuss their geometric origin at small and large
scale.
