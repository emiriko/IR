The effect of confinement in the segmental relaxation of polymers is
considered. On the basis of a thermodynamic model we discuss the emerging
relevance of the fast degrees of freedom in stimulating the much slower
segmental relaxation, as an effect of the constraints at the walls of the
amorphous regions. In the case that confinement is due to the presence of
crystalline domains, a quasi-poissonian distribution of local constraining
conditions is derived as a result of thermodynamic equilibrium. This implies
that the average free energy barrier $\Delta F$ for conformational
rearrangement is of the same order of the dispersion of the barrier heights,
$\delta (\Delta F)$, around $\Delta F$. As an example, we apply the results to
the analysis of the $\alpha$-relaxation as observed by dielectric broad band
spectroscopy in semicrystalline poly(ethylene terephthalate) cold-crystallized
from either an isotropic or an oriented glass. It is found that in the latter
case the regions of cooperative rearrangement are significantly larger than in
the former.
