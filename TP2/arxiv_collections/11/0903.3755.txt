Solids with strong electron correlations generally develop exotic phases of
electron matter at low temperatures. Among such systems, the heavy-fermion
semi-metal URu2Si2 presents an enigmatic transition at To = 17.5 K to a `hidden
order' state whose order parameter remains unknown after 23 years of intense
research. Various experiments point to the reconstruction and partial gapping
of the Fermi surface when the hidden-order establishes. However, up to now, the
question of how this transition affects the electronic spectrum at the Fermi
surface has not been directly addressed by a spectroscopic probe. Here we show,
using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, that a band of heavy
quasi-particles drops below the Fermi level upon the transition to the
hidden-order state. Our data provide the first direct evidence of a large
reorganization of the electronic structure across the Fermi surface of URu2Si2
occurring during this transition, and unveil a new kind of Fermi-surface
instability in correlated electron systems
