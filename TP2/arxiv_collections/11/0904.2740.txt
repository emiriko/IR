(Abriged) We present the analysis of the baryonic content of 52 X-ray
luminous galaxy clusters observed with Chandra in the redshift range 0.3-1.273.
We use the deprojected X-ray surface brightness profiles and the measured
values of the gas temperature to recover the gas and total mass profiles. By
assuming that galaxy clusters are representative of the cosmic baryon budget,
the distribution of the cluster baryon fraction in the hottest (T> 4 keV)
systems as a function of redshift is used to constrain the cosmological
parameters. We discuss how our constraints are affected by several systematics,
namely the isothermality, the assumed baryon fraction in stars, the depletion
parameter and the sample selection. By using only the cluster baryon fraction
as a proxy for the cosmological parameters, we obtain that Omega is very well
constrained at the value of 0.35 with a relative statistical uncertainty of 11%
(1 sigma level; w=-1) and a further systematic error of about (-6,+7)%. On the
other hand, constraints on Lambda (without the prior of flat geometry) and w
(using the prior of flat geometry) are definitely weaker due to the presence of
larger statistical and systematic uncertainties (of the order of 40 per cent on
Lambda and larger than 50 per cent on w). If the WMAP 5-year best-fit results
are assumed to fix the cosmological parameters, we limit the contributions
expected from non-thermal pressure support and ICM clumpiness to be lower than
about 10 per cent, leaving also room to accommodate baryons not accounted for
either in the X-ray emitting plasma or in stars of the order of 18 per cent of
the total cluster baryon budget.
