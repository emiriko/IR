A Monte Carlo scheme is described where the secondary electron generation has
been incorporated. The initial position of a secondary electron due to Fermi
sea excitation is assumed to be where the inelastic collision took place, while
the polar and azimuth angles of secondary electrons can be calculated in two
different ways. The first one assumes a random direction of the secondary
electrons, corresponding to the idea that slow secondary electrons should be
generated with spherical symmetry. Such an approach violates momentum
conservation. The second way of calculating the polar and azimuth angles of the
secondary electrons takes into account the momentum conservation rules within
the classical binary collision model. The aim of this paper is to compare the
results of these two different approaches for the determination of the energy
distribution of the secondary electrons emitted by solid targets.
