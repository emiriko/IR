The hyperfine induced $2s2p ^3P_0, ^3P_2 \to 2s^2 ^1S_0$ E1 transition
probabilities of Be-like ions were calculated using grasp2K based on
multi-configuration Dirac-Fock method and HFST packages. It was found that the
hyperfine quenching rates are strongly affected by the interference for low-Z
Be-like ions, especially for $2s2p ^3P_0 \to 2s^2 ^1S_0$ transition. In
particular, the trends of interference effects with atomic number $Z$ in such
two transitions are not monotone. The strongest interference effect occurs near
Z=7 for $2s2p ^3P_0 \to 2s^2 ^1S_0$ E1 transition, and near Z=9 for $2s2p ^3P_2
\to 2s^2 ^1S_0$ E1 transition.
