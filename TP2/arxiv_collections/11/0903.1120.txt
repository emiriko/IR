We estimate the energy of the lowest Charmonium and Upsilon states with
hybrid admixtures using the method of QCD Sum Rules. Our results show that the
$\Psi'(2S)$ and $\Upsilon(3S)$ states both have about a 50% admixture of hybrid
and meson components. From this we find explanations of both the famous
$\rho-\pi$ puzzle for Charmonium, and the unusual pattern of $\sigma$ decays
that have been found in $\Upsilon$ decays. Moreover, this picture can be used
for predictions of heavy quark production with the octet model for RHIC.
