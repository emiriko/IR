The present article is a sequel of the article "Fislab the Fuzzy Inference
Tool-Box for Scilab" and it represents the practical application of:"The
development of the Fuzzy regulator with an input and an output in Fislab". The
article contains, besides this application, some functions to be used in the
program, namely Scilab functions for the fuzzification of the firm information,
functions for the operation of de-fuzzification and functions for the
implementation of.
