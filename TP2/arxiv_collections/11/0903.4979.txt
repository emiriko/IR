It is revealed that quantum repeating devices and quantum seals have a very
close relationship, thus the theory in one field can be applied to the other.
Consequently, it is shown that the fidelity bounds and optimality of quantum
repeating devices can be violated when they are used for decoding classical
information from quantum states, and security bounds for protocols sealing
quantum data exist.
