We analyze the linear absorption spectrum of regioregular
poly(3-hexylthiophene) films spun from a variety of solvents to probe directly
the film microstructure and how it depends on processing conditions. We
estimate the exciton bandwidth and the percentage of the film composed of
aggregates quantitatively using a weakly interacting H-aggregate model. This
provides a description of the degree and quality of crystallites within the
film and is in turn correlated with thin-film field-effect transistor
characteristics.
