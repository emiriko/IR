We present high-precision photometry of two transit events of the extrasolar
planetary system WASP-5, obtained with the Danish 1.54m telescope at ESO La
Silla. In order to minimise both random and flat-fielding errors, we defocussed
the telescope so its point spread function approximated an annulus of diameter
40 pixels (16 arcsec). Data reduction was undertaken using standard aperture
photometry plus an algorithm for optimally combining the ensemble of comparison
stars. The resulting light curves have point-to-point scatters of 0.50 mmag for
the first transit and 0.59 mmag for the second. We construct detailed signal to
noise calculations for defocussed photometry, and apply them to our
observations. We model the light curves with the JKTEBOP code and combine the
results with tabulated predictions from theoretical stellar evolutionary models
to derive the physical properties of the WASP-5 system. We find that the planet
has a mass of M_b = 1.637 +/- 0.075 +/- 0.033 Mjup, a radius of R_b = 1.171 +/-
0.056 +/- 0.012 Rjup, a large surface gravity of g_b = 29.6 +/- 2.8 m/s2 and a
density of rho_b = 1.02 +/- 0.14 +/- 0.01 rhojup (statistical and systematic
uncertainties). The planet's high equilibrium temperature of T_eq = 1732 +/- 80
K makes it a good candidate for detecting secondary eclipses.
