We introduce a general method to construct one-dimensional translationally
invariant valence bond solid states with a built-in Lie group $G$ and derive
their matrix product representations. The general strategies to find their
parent Hamiltonians are provided so that the valence bond solid states are
their unique ground states. For quantum integer spin-$S$ chains, we discuss two
topologically distinct classes of valence bond solid states: One consists of
two virtual SU(2) spin-$J$ variables in each site and another is formed by
using two $SO(2S+1)$ spinors. Among them, a new spin-1 fermionic valence bond
solid state, its parent Hamiltonian, and its properties are discussed in
detail. Moreover, two types of valence bond solid states with SO(5) symmetry
are further generalized and their respective properties are analyzed as well.
