We report the discovery of faint very high energy (VHE, E > 100 GeV)
gamma-ray emission from the radio galaxy Centaurus A in deep observations
performed with the H.E.S.S. experiment. A signal with a statistical
significance of 5.0 sigma is detected from the region including the radio core
and the inner kpc jets. The integral flux above an energy threshold of ~250 GeV
is measured to be 0.8% of the flux of the Crab Nebula and the spectrum can be
described by a power law with a photon index of 2.7 +/- 0.5_stat +/- 0.2_sys.
No significant flux variability is detected in the data set. The discovery of
VHE gamma-ray emission from Centaurus A reveals particle acceleration in the
source to >TeV energies and, together with M 87, establishes radio galaxies as
a class of VHE emitters.
