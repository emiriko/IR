We show that weakly-bound molecules can be probed by "shaking" in a pulsed
nonresonant laser field. The field introduces a centrifugal term which expels
the highest vibrational level from the potential that binds it. Our numerical
simulations applied to the Rb$_2$ and KRb Feshbach molecules indicate that
shaking by feasible laser pulses can be used to accurately recover the square
of the vibrational wavefunction and, by inversion, also the long-range part of
the molecular potential.
