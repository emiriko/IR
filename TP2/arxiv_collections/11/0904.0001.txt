We consider the detailed structure of low energy excitations in the periodic
spin-1/2 XXZ Heisenberg chain. By performing a perturbative calculation of the
non-linear corrections to the Gaussian model, we determine the exact
coefficients of asymptotic expansions in inverse powers of the system length N
for a large number of low-lying excited energy levels. This allows us to
calculate eigenenergies of the lattice model up to order order N^-4, without
having to solve the Bethe Ansatz equations. At the same time, it is possible to
express the exact eigenstates of the lattice model in terms of bosonic modes.
