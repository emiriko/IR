The formation of ultra-compact X-ray binaries (UCXBs) has not been well
understood. Previous works show that ultra-short orbital periods ($<1$ hr) may
be reached through mass transfer driven by magnetic braking in normal
low/intermediate-mass X-ray binaries (L/IMXBs) only for an extremely small
range of initial binary parameters, which makes it difficult to account for the
rather large population of UCXBs. In this paper we report the calculated
results on mass transfer processes in L/IMXBs with a circum-binary disk. We
show that when the orbital angular momentum loss due to a circum-binary disk is
included, ultra-short orbital periods could be reached for a relatively wide
range of initial binary parameters. The results of our binary models suggest an
alternative formation channel for UCXBs.
