Previously, a quantum "tidal" mechanism of polarization of the atoms of He-II
was proposed, according to which, as a result of interatomic interaction, each
atom of He-II acquires small fluctuating dipole and multipole moments, oriented
chaotically on the average. In this work, we show that, in the presence of a
temperature or density gradient in He-II, the originally chaotically oriented
tidal dipole moments of the atoms become partially ordered, which results in
volume polarization of He-II. It is found that the gravitational field of the
Earth induces electric induction U =10(-7)V in He-II (for vessel dimensions of
the order of 10 cm). We study also the connection of polarization and
acceleration, and discuss a possible nature of the electric signal dU = kdT/2e
observed by A.S. Rybalko in experiments with second sound.
