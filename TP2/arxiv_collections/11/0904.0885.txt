Sonoluminescence is the intriguing phenomenon of strong light flashes from
tiny bubbles in a liquid. The bubbles are driven by an ultrasonic wave and need
to be filled with noble gas atoms. Approximating the emitted light by blackbody
radiation indicates very high temperatures. Although sonoluminescence has been
studied extensively, the origin of the sudden energy concentration within the
bubble collapse phase is still controversial. It is hence difficult to further
increase the temperature inside the bubble for applications like sonochemistry
and table top fusion. Here we show that the strongly confined nobel gas atoms
inside the bubble can be heated very rapidly by a weak but highly inhomogeneous
electric field as it might occur naturally during rapid bubble deformations. An
indirect proof of the proposed quantum optical heating mechanism would be the
detection of the non-thermal emission of photons in the optical regime prior to
the light flash. Our model implies that it is possible to increase the
temperature inside the bubble with the help of appropriately detuned laser
fields.
