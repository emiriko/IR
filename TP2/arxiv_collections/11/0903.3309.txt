The well-known Tunguska-1908 phenomenon (TP) problems (the fast transfer of
the kinetic energy of the meteoroid W~10-50 Mt TNT to air, with its heating to
T>10^4 K at an altitude of 5-10 km, the final turn of the smoothly sloping,
~0-20^o to horizon, trajectory of the body through ~10^o to the West, the
pattern and area of the tree-fall and trees' scorching by heat radiation, etc.)
allow a simple solution within the New Explosive Cosmogony (NEC) of minor
bodies, as opposed to other approaches. The NEC considers the short-period (SP)
comet nuclei, to which the Tunguska body belonged, to be fragments produced in
explosions of massive icy envelopes of Ganymede-type bodies saturated by
products of bulk electrolysis of ices to the form of a 2H2+O2 solid solution.
The nearly tangent entry into the Earth's atmosphere with V~20 km/s of such a
nucleus, ~200-500 m in size and ~(5-50)x10^12 g in mass, also saturated by
2H2+O2, initiated detonation of its part of ~10^12 g at an altitude of 5-10 km.
This resulted in deflection of this fraction trajectory by 5^o-10^o, and fast
expansion with ~2 km/s of its detonation products brought about their fast
slowing down by the air, heating of the latter to T>10^4 K and a phenomenon of
high-altitude explosion. On crossing the Earth's atmosphere, the main part of
the unexploded nucleus escaped into space, and this body moving presently in an
SP orbit should eventually be identified in time. Its impact with W~250-3000 Mt
TNT on the Earth's surface (which could occur in 1908) would have produced a
crater up to ~3.5-8 km in size, with an ejection of dust that would have
brought about a climatic catastrophe. The processes involved in the TP are
resembling those accompanying falling P/Shoemaker-Levy 9 onto Jupiter and,
possibly, the impact-caused Younger Dryas cooling ~13 ka ago.
