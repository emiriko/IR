We study effects of weak nonlineary on localization of waves in disordered
Stark ladder corresponding to propagation in presence of disorder and a static
field. Our numerical results show that nonlinearity leads to delocalization
with subdiffusive spreading along the ladder. The exponent of spreading remains
close to its value in absence of the static field.
