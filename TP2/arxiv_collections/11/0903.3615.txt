Suspensions of small anisotropic particles, termed 'rheoscopic fluids', are
used for flow visualisation. By illuminating the fluid with light of three
different colours, it is possible to determine Poincare indices for vector
fields formed by the longest axis of the particles. Because this vector field
is non-oriented, half-integer Poincare indices are possible, and are observed
experimentally. An exact solution for the direction vector appears to preclude
the existence of topological singularities. However, we show that upon
averaging over the random initial orientations of particles, singularities with
half-integer Poincare index appear. We describe their normal forms.
