String instanton Yukawa corrections from Euclidean D-branes are investigated
in an effective Standard Model theory obtained from the minimal U(3)xU(2)xU(1)
D-brane configuration. In the case of the minimal chiral and Higgs spectrum, it
is found that superpotential contributions are induced by string instantons for
the perturbatively forbidden entries of the up and down quark mass matrices.
Analogous non-perturbative effects generate heavy Majorana neutrino masses and
a Dirac neutrino texture with factorizable Yukawa couplings. For this latter
case, a specific example is worked out where it is shown how this texture can
reconcile the neutrino data.
