Developments in dynamical systems theory provides new support for the
discretisation of \pde{}s and other microscale systems. By systematically
resolving subgrid microscale dynamics the new approach constructs
asymptotically accurate, macroscale closures of discrete models of the \pde.
Here we explore reaction-diffusion problems in two spatial dimensions. Centre
manifold theory ensures that slow manifold, holistic, discretisations exists,
are quickly attractive, and are systematically approximated. Special coupling
of the finite elements ensures that the resultant discretisations are
consistent with the \pde to as high an order as desired. Computer algebra
handles the enormous algebraic details as seen in the specific application to
the Ginzburg--Landau equation. However, higher order models in 2D appear to
require a mixed numerical and algebraic approach that is also developed. Being
driven by the residuals of the equations, the modelling here may be
straightforwardly adapted to a wide class of reaction-diffusion differential
and lattice equations in multiple space dimensions.
