We have determined Li abundances for eleven metal-poor turn-off stars, among
which eight have [Fe/H]<-3, based on LTE analyses of high-resolution spectra
obtained with the HDS on the Subaru telescope. The Li abundances for four of
these eight stars are determined for the first time by this study. Effective
temperatures are determined by a profile analysis of H-alpha and H-beta. While
seven stars have Li abundances as high as the Spite Plateau value, the
remaining four objects with [Fe/H] <-3 have A(Li)=log(Li/H)+12 ~< 2.0,
confirming the existence of extremely metal-poor turn-off stars having low Li
abundances, as reported by previous work. The average of the Li abundances for
stars with [Fe/H]<-3 is lower by 0.2 dex than that of the stars with higher
metallicity. No clear constraint on the metallicity dependence or scatter of
the Li abundances is derived from our measurements for the stars with
[Fe/H]<-3. Correlations of the Li abundance with effective temperatures, with
abundances of Na, Mg and Sr, and with the kinematical properties are
investigated, but no clear correlation is seen in the extremely metal-poor star
sample.
