A practical strategy for synchronizing the properties of compound Josephson
junction rf-SQUID qubits on a multiqubit chip has been demonstrated. The
impacts of small ($\sim1%$) fabrication variations in qubit inductance and
critical current can be minimized by the application of a custom tuned flux
offset to the CJJ structure of each qubit. This strategy allows for
simultaneous synchronization of the qubit persistent current and tunnel
splitting over a range of external bias parameters that is relevant for the
implementation of an adiabatic quantum processor.
