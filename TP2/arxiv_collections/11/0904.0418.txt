Quantum Darwinism recognizes that we - the observers - acquire our
information about the "systems of interest" indirectly from their imprints on
the environment. Here, we show that information about a system can be acquired
from a mixed-state, or hazy, environment, but the storage capacity of an
environment fragment is suppressed by its initial entropy. In the case of good
decoherence, the mutual information between the system and the fragment is
given solely by the fragment's entropy increase. For fairly mixed environments,
this means a reduction by a factor 1-h, where h is the haziness of the
environment, i.e., the initial entropy of an environment qubit. Thus, even such
hazy environments eventually reveal the state of the system, although now the
intercepted environment fragment must be larger by ~1/(1-h) to gain the same
information about the system.
