An easily accessible method is presented that permits to calculate spectra
involving atomic multiplets relevant to X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) and
Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering (RIXS) experiments. We present specific
examples and compare the calculated spectra with available experimental data
