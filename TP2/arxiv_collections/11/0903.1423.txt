The interaction between spherical magnetic nanoparticles is investigated from
micromagnetic simulations and ananlysed in terms of the leading dipolar
interaction energy between magnetic dipoles. We focus mainly on the case where
the particles present a vortex structure. In a first step the local magnetic
structure in the isolated particle is revisited. For particles bearing a
uniaxial magnetocrystaline anisotropy, it is shown that the vortex core
orientation relative to the easy axis depends on both the particle size and the
anisotropy constant. When the particles magnetization present a vortex
structure, it is shown that the polarization of the particles by the dipolar
field of the other one must be taken into account in the interaction. An
analytic form is deduced for the interaction which involves the vortex core
magnetization and the magnetic susceptibility which are obtained from the
magnetic properties of the isolated particle.
