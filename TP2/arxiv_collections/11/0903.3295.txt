For a positively graded artin algebra $A=\oplus_{n\geq 0}A_n$ we introduce
its Beilinson algebra $\mathrm{b}(A)$. We prove that if $A$ is well-graded
self-injective, then the category of graded $A$-modules is equivalent to the
category of graded modules over the trivial extension algebra
$T(\mathrm{b}(A))$. Consequently, there is a full exact embedding from the
bounded derived category of $\mathrm{b}(A)$ into the stable category of graded
modules over $A$; it is an equivalence if and only if the 0-th component
algebra $A_0$ has finite global dimension.
