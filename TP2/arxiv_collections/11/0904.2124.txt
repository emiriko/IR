Magnetic moments of heavy charmed baryons with $J^P=3/2^+$ are predicted
employing the concept of effective quark mass and screened charge of quark. We
also extend our scheme to predict the $3/2^+ --> 1/2^+$ transition magnetic
moments. A comparison of our results with the predictions obtained in recent
models is presented.
