According to popular progenitor models of gamma-ray bursts, twin jets should
be launched by the central engine, with a forward jet moving toward the
observer and a receding jet (or the counter jet) moving backwardly. However, in
calculating the afterglows, usually only the emission from the forward jet is
considered. Here we present a detailed numerical study on the afterglow from
the receding jet. Our calculation is based on a generic dynamical description,
and includes some delicate ingredients such as the effect of the equal arrival
time surface. It is found that the emission from the receding jet is generally
rather weak. In radio bands, it usually peaks at a time of $t \geq 1000$ d,
with the peak flux nearly 4 orders of magnitude lower than the peak flux of the
forward jet. Also, it usually manifests as a short plateau in the total
afterglow light curve, but not as an obvious rebrightening as once expected. In
optical bands, the contribution from the receding jet is even weaker, with the
peak flux being $\sim 8$ orders of magnitude lower than the peak flux of the
forward jet. We thus argue that the emission from the receding jet is very
difficult to detect. However, in some special cases, i.e., when the
circum-burst medium density is very high, or if the parameters of the receding
jet is quite different from those of the forward jet, the emission from the
receding jet can be significantly enhanced and may still emerge as a marked
rebrightening. We suggest that the search for receding jet emission should
mostly concentrate on nearby gamma-ray bursts, and the observation campaign
should last for at least several hundred days for each event.
