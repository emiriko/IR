The stochastic dynamics of colloidal particles with surface activity--in the
form of catalytic reaction or particle release--and self-phoretic effects is
studied analytically. Three different time scales corresponding to inertial
effects, solute redistribution, and rotational diffusion are identified and
shown to lead to a plethora of different regimes involving inertial,
propulsive, anomalous, and diffusive behaviors. For symmetric active colloids,
a regime is found where the mean-squared displacement has a super-diffusive
$t^{3/2}$ behavior. At the longest time scales, an effective diffusion
coefficient is found which has a non-monotonic dependence on the size of the
colloid.
