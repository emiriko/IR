We report on a complete set of early optical afterglows of gamma-ray bursts
(GRBs) obtained with the ROTSE-III telescope network from March 2005 through
June 2007. This set is comprised of 12 afterglows with early optical and
Swift/XRT observations, with a median ROTSE-III response time of 45 s after the
start of gamma-ray emission (8 s after the GCN notice time). These afterglows
span four orders of magnitude in optical luminosity, and the contemporaneous
X-ray detections allow multi-wavelength spectral analysis. Excluding X-ray
flares, the broadband synchrotron spectra show that the optical and X-ray
emission originate in a common region, consistent with predictions of the
external forward shock in the fireball model. However, the fireball model is
inadequate to predict the temporal decay indices of the early afterglows, even
after accounting for possible long-duration continuous energy injection. We
find that the optical afterglow is a clean tracer of the forward shock, and we
use the peak time of the forward shock to estimate the initial bulk Lorentz
factor of the GRB outflow, and find 100<Gamma_0<1000, consistent with
expectations.
