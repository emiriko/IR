In this paper we present a new method for dating the surface of the Moon,
obtained by modeling the incoming flux of impactors and converting it into a
size distribution of resulting craters. We compare the results from this model
with the standard chronology for the Moon showing their similarities and
discrepancies. In particular, we find indications of a non-constant impactor
flux in the last 500 Myr and also discuss the implications of our findings for
the Late Heavy Bombardment hypothesis. We also show the potential of our model
for accurate dating of other inner Solar System bodies, by applying it to
Mercury.
