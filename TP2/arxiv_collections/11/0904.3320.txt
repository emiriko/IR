The quality of training data for knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) and
data mining depends upon many factors, but handling missing values is
considered to be a crucial factor in overall data quality. Today real world
datasets contains missing values due to human, operational error, hardware
malfunctioning and many other factors. The quality of knowledge extracted,
learning and decision problems depend directly upon the quality of training
data. By considering the importance of handling missing values in KDD and data
mining tasks, in this paper we propose a novel Hybrid Missing values Imputation
Technique (HMiT) using association rules mining and hybrid combination of
k-nearest neighbor approach. To check the effectiveness of our HMiT missing
values imputation technique, we also perform detail experimental results on
real world datasets. Our results suggest that the HMiT technique is not only
better in term of accuracy but it also take less processing time as compared to
current best missing values imputation technique based on k-nearest neighbor
approach, which shows the effectiveness of our missing values imputation
technique.
