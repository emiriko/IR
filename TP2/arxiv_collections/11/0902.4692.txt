We discuss separate and integrated approaches to building scalable solar
power plants and wildlife sanctuaries. Both solar power plants and wildlife
sanctuaries need a lot of land. We quantify some of the requirements using
various estimates of the rate of solar power production as well as the rate of
adding wildlife to a sanctuary over the time range 2010-2050. We use population
dynamics equations to study the evolution of solar energy and tiger populations
up to and beyond 2050.
