In a bipartite system subject to decoherence from two separate reservoirs,
the entanglement is typically destroyed faster than for single reservoirs.
Surprisingly however, the existence of separate reservoirs can also have a
beneficial entangling effect: if the qubits are coupled and driven externally
by a classical field, the system ends up in a stationary state characterized by
a finite degree of entanglement. This phenomenon occurs only in a certain
region of the parameter space and the structure of the stationary state has a
universal form which does not depend on the initial state or on the specific
physical realization of the qubits. We show that the entanglement thus
generated can be propagated within a quantum network using simple local unitary
operations. We suggest the use of such systems as "batteries of entanglement"
in quantum circuits.
