We present a new method of visualizing the solar photospheric magnetic field
based on the "Magnetic Range of Influence" (MRoI). The MRoI is a simple
realization of the magnetic environment in the photosphere, reflecting the
distance required to balance the integrated magnetic field contained in any
magnetogram pixel. It provides a new perspective on where sub-terrestrial field
lines in a Potential Field Source Surface (PFSS) model connect to the
photosphere, and thus the source of Earth-directed solar wind (within the
limitations of PFSS models), something that is not usually obvious from a
regular synoptic magnetogram. In each of three sample solar rotations, at
different phases of the solar cycle, the PFSS footpoint either jumps between
isolated areas of high MRoI or moves slowly within one such area. Footpoint
motions are consistent with Fisk's interchange reconnection model.
