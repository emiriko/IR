We prove that if a set $X \subseteq \Z^2$ weakly self-assembles at
temperature 1 in a deterministic tile assembly system satisfying a natural
condition known as \emph{pumpability}, then $X$ is a finite union of
semi-doubly periodic sets. This shows that only the most simple of infinite
shapes and patterns can be constructed using pumpable temperature 1 tile
assembly systems, and gives evidence for the thesis that temperature 2 or
higher is required to carry out general-purpose computation in a tile assembly
system. Finally, we show that general-purpose computation \emph{is} possible at
temperature 1 if negative glue strengths are allowed in the tile assembly
model.
