The role of intruder configurations in the description of energy spectra and
B(E2) values in the Pt region is analyzed. In particular, we study the
differences between Interacting Boson Model calculations with or without the
inclusion of intruder states in the even Pt nuclei $^{172-194}$Pt. As a result,
it shows that for the description of a subset of the existing experimental
data, i.e., energy spectra and absolute B(E2) values up to an excitation energy
of about 1.5 MeV, both approaches seem to be equally valid. We explain these
similarities between both model spaces through an appropriate mapping. We point
out the need for a more extensive comparison, encompassing a data set as broad
(and complete) as possible to confront with both theoretical approaches in
order to test the detailed structure of the nuclear wave functions.
