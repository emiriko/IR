We present a photometric FUV to Ks-band study of the field around quasar SDSS
J092712.65+294344.0. The SDSS spectrum of this object shows various emission
lines with two distinct redshifts, at z=0.699 and z=0.712. Because of this
peculiar spectroscopic feature this source has been proposed as a candidate
recoiling or binary black hole. A third alternative model involves two galaxies
moving in the centre of a rich galaxy cluster. Here we present a study
addressing the possible presence of such a rich cluster of galaxies in the SDSS
J092712.65+294344.0 field. We observed the 3.6x2.6 square arcmin field in the
Ks-band and matched the NIR data with the FUV and NUV images in the GALEX
archive and the ugriz observations in the SDSS. From various colour-colour
diagrams we were able to classify the nature of 32 sources, only 6-11 of which
have colours consistent with galaxies at z~0.7. We compare these numbers with
the surface density of galaxies, stars & quasars, and the expectations for
typical galaxy clusters both at low and high redshift. Our study shows that the
galaxy cluster scenario is in clear disagreement with the new observations.
