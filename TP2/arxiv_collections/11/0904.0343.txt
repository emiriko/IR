The idea that an internal quantum number for quarks, eventually called color,
can explain the magnetic moments of baryons within the framework of standard
quantum theory, was explicitly stated in a 7th January, 1965 JINR publication
by Boris Struminsky (JINR P-1939). A complete translation into English of
Struminsky's letter is presented along with page images of the original booklet
found in the JINR Library.
