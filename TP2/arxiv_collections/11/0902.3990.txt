In the present paper, a theorem, which determines the linear stability of
multibreathers in Klein-Gordon chains, is proven. Specifically, it is shown
that for soft nonlinearities, and positive inter-site coupling, only structures
with adjacent sites excited out-of-phase may be stable, while only in-phase
ones may be stable for negative coupling. The situation is reversed for hard
nonlinearities. This theorem can be applied in $n$-site breathers, where $n$ is
any finite number and provides an $\cal{O}(\sqrt{\epsilon})$ estimation of the
characteristic exponents of the solution. To complement the analysis, we
perform numerical simulations and establish that the results are in excellent
agreement with the theoretical predictions, at least for small values of the
coupling constant $\epsilon$.
