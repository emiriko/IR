Galton boards are models of deterministic diffusion in a uniform external
field, akin to driven periodic Lorentz gases, here considered in the absence of
dissipation mechanism. Assuming a cylindrical geometry with axis along the
direction of the external field, the two-dimensional board becomes a model for
one-dimensional mass transport along the direction of the external field. This
is a purely diffusive process which admits fractal non-equilibrium stationary
states under flux boundary conditions. Analytical results are obtained for the
statistics of multi-baker maps modeling such a non-uniform diffusion process. A
correspondence is established between the local phase-space statistics and
their macroscopic counter-parts. The fractality of the invariant state is shown
to be responsible for the positiveness of the entropy production rate.
