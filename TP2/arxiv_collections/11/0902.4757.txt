We report on a search for the X(1812) state in the decay $B^{\pm} \to K^{\pm}
\omega \phi$ with a data sample of $657\times10^6$ $B\bar{B}$ pairs collected
with the Belle detector at the KEKB $e^+e^-$ collider. No significant signal is
observed. An upper limit ${\cal B}(B^{\pm} \to K^{\pm} X(1812),X(1812) \to
\omega \phi)<3.2\times 10^{-7}$ (90% C.L.) is determined. We also constrain the
three-body decay branching fraction to be ${\cal B}(B^{\pm} \to K^{\pm} \omega
\phi)$ $<$ 1.9 $\times 10^{-6}$ (90% C.L.).
