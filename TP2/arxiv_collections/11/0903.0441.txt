We have successfully built and operated a source deployment system for the
KamLAND detector. This system was used to position radioactive sources
throughout the delicate 1-kton liquid scintillator volume, while meeting
stringent material cleanliness, material compatibility, and safety
requirements. The calibration data obtained with this device were used to fully
characterize detector position and energy reconstruction biases. As a result,
the uncertainty in the size of the detector fiducial volume was reduced by a
factor of two. Prior to calibration with this system, the fiducial volume was
the largest source of systematic uncertainty in measuring the number of
anti-neutrinos detected by KamLAND. This paper describes the design, operation
and performance of this unique calibration system.
