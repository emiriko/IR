Jerry Fodor argues that Darwin was wrong about "natural selection" because
(1) it is only a tautology rather than a scientific law that can support
counterfactuals ("If X had happened, Y would have happened") and because (2)
only minds can select. Hence Darwin's analogy with "artificial selection" by
animal breeders was misleading and evolutionary explanation is nothing but
post-hoc historical narrative. I argue that Darwin was right on all counts.
