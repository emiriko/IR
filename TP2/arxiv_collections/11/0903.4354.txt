We report on the control of the spontaneous emission dynamics from InAsP
self-assembled quantum dots emitting in the telecommunications C-band and
weakly coupled to the mode of a double heterostructure cavity etched on a
suspended InP membrane at room temperature. The quality factor of the cavity
mode is 44x10^3 with an ultra-low modal volume of the order of 1.2 lambda/n)^3,
inducing an enhancement of the spontaneous emission rate of up a factor of 2.8
at 300 K.
