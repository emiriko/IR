We present results for excited meson spectra from $N_f=2$ clover-Wilson
configurations provided by the CP-PACS Collaboration. In our study we
investigate both low and high spin mesons. For spin-0 and spin-1 mesons, we are
especially interested in the excited states. To access these states we
construct several different interpolators from quark sources of different
spatial smearings and calculate a matrix of correlators. For this matrix we
then solve a generalized eigenvalue problem. For spin-2 and spin-3, we extract
only the lowest lying states.
