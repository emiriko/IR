We present an asteroseismological study on the two high-gravity pulsating
PG1159 (GW Vir or DOV) stars, PG 2131+066 and PG 1707+427, and on the pulsating
[WCE] star NGC 1501. We compute adiabatic $g$-mode pulsation periods on PG1159
evolutionary models with stellar masses ranging from 0.530 to 0.741 Msun. These
models take into account the complete evolution of progenitor stars, through
the thermally pulsing AGB phase, and born-again episode. We constrain the
stellar mass of PG 2131+066, PG 1707+427 and NGC 1501 by comparing the observed
period spacing with the asymptotic period spacing and with the average of the
computed period spacings. We also employ the individual observed periods in
search of representative seismological models for each star. This work closes
our short series of asteroseismological studies on pulsating pre-white dwarf
stars. Our results demonstrate the usefulness of asteroseismology for probing
the internal structure and evolutionary status of pre-white dwarf stars. In
particular, asteroseismology is able to determine stellar masses of PG1159
stars with an accuracy comparable or even better than spectroscopy.
