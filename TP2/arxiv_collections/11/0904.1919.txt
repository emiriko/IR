The representations of the world around in physics built with help of
causality are analyzed and seems incomplete. The observer's causal
representations form a closed logical system, i.e. the compact group related to
cause-effect chains. The space-time representations are exactly the background
of this closed system and the off-site phenomena exceeded the space-time
continuum of the observer are investigated. Off-site phenomena occur
responsible for `mysteries and paradoxes' in quantum physics and `dark
substances' in modern cosmology. The existing paradigm of cognoscibility is
reconsidered and specified. The theory of sets predicts an infinite number of
levels of cognition, where the world around seems more and more disordered and
chaotic. The possibilities of different levels of cognition are estimated from
this point of view. Relativistic and quantum theories operate on different
levels of cognition, so their unification in frames of rigorous logical theory
seems quite doubtful.
