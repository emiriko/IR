A novel frequency dependence of anomaly in dielectric constant versus
temperature plot, around the Neel temperature T_N (~150 K), has been observed
in a single crystal of bilayer manganite Pr(Sr0.1Ca0.9)2Mn2O7. The anomaly in
the permittivity (epsilon'||c) occurs at a temperature T_f which moves within a
temperature window (delT_f) of ~40 K around T_N for a frequency range 50 kHz-5
MHz. The capacitive component Cp of the dielectric response exhibits a clear
yet broad feature around T_N which establishes the intrinsic capacitive nature
of the anomaly.
