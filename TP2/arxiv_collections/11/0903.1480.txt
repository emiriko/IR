Using the Dissipation Theorem and a corollary of the Fluctuation Theorem,
namely the Second Law Inequality, we give a first-principles derivation of
Boltzmann's postulate of equal a priori probability in phase space for the
microcanonical ensemble. We show that if the initial distribution differs from
the uniform distribution over the energy hypersurface, then under very wide and
commonly satisfied conditions, the initial distribution will relax to that
uniform distribution. This result is somewhat analogous to the Boltzmann
H-theorem but unlike that theorem, applies to dense fluids as well as dilute
gases and also permits a nonmonotonic relaxation to equilibrium. We also prove
that in ergodic systems the uniform (microcanonical) distribution is the only
stationary, dissipationless distribution for the constant energy ensemble.
