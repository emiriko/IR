The linearly polarized gravitational waveforms from a certain type of
rotating, evaporating cosmic string - the Allen-Casper-Ottewill loop - are
constructed and plotted over the lifetime of the loop. The formulas for the
waveforms are simple and exact, and describe waves which attenuate
self-similarly, with the amplitude and period of the waves falling off linearly
with time.
