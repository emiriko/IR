In this paper, we undertake the study of the Tannaka duality construction for
the ordinary representations of a proper Lie groupoid on vector bundles. We
show that for each proper Lie groupoid G, the canonical homomorphism of G into
the reconstructed groupoid T(G) is surjective, although, contrary to what
happens in the case of groups, it may fail to be an isomorphism. We obtain
necessary and sufficient conditions in order that G may be isomorphic to T(G)
and, more generally, in order that T(G) may be a Lie groupoid. We show that if
T(G) is a Lie groupoid, the canonical homomorphism from G into T(G) is a
submersion and the two groupoids have isomorphic categories of representations.
