The question tackled here is the time allocation of radars in a multitarget
environment. At a given time radars can only observe a limited part of the
space; it is therefore necessary to move their axis with respect to time, in
order to be able to explore the overall space facing them. Such sensors are
used to detect, to locate and to identify targets which are in their
surrounding aerial space. In this paper we focus on the detection schema when
several targets need to be detected by a set of delocalized radars. This work
is based on the modelling of the radar detection performances in terms of
probability of detection and on the optimization of a criterion based on
detection probabilities. This optimization leads to the derivation of
allocation strategies and is made for several contexts and several hypotheses
about the targets locations.
