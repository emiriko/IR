Dynamical mean field theory and its cluster extensions provide a very useful
approach for examining phase transitions in model Hamiltonians, and, in
combination with electronic structure theory, constitute powerful methods to
treat strongly correlated materials. The key advantage to the technique is
that, unlike competing real space methods, the sign problem is well controlled
in the Hirsch-Fye (HF) quantum Monte Carlo used as an exact cluster solver.
However, an important computational bottleneck remains; the HF method scales as
the cube of the inverse temperature, $\beta$. This often makes simulations at
low temperatures extremely challenging. We present here a new method based on
determinant quantum Monte Carlo which scales linearly in $\beta$, and
demonstrate that the sign problem is identical to HF.
