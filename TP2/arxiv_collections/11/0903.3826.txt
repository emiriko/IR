The neutron-rich N=66 isotonic and A=106 isobaric chains, covering regions
with varying types of collectivity, are interpreted in the framework of the
interacting boson model. Level energies and electric quadrupole transition
probabilities are compared with available experimental information. The
calculations for the known nuclei in the two chains are extrapolated towards
the neutron-rich nucleus $^{106}$Zr.
