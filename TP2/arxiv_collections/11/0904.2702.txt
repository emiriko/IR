It is shown that Lewis' ontological doctrine of Humean supervenience
incorporates at its foundation the so-called separability principle of
classical physics. In view of the systematic violation of the latter within
quantum mechanics, the claim that contemporary physical science may posit
non-supervenient relations beyond the spatiotemporal ones is reinforced on a
foundational basis concerning constraints on the state-representation of
physical systems. Depending on the mode of assignment of states to physical
systems, unit state vectors versus statistical density operators, we
distinguish between strongly and weakly non-Humean, non-supervenient relations.
It is demonstrated that in either case the relations of quantum entanglement
constitute prototypical examples of irreducible physical relations that do not
supervene upon a spatiotemporal arrangement of Humean qualities, weakening,
thereby, the thesis of Humean supervenience. It is examined, in this respect,
the status of Lewis' recombination principle, whereas his conception of lawhood
is critically investigated. It is concluded that the assumption of ontological
reductionism, as expressed in Lewis' Humean doctrine, cannot be regarded as a
reliable code of the nature of the physical world and its contents. It is
proposed instead that, due to the undeniable existence of non-supervenient
relations, a metaphysic of relations of a moderate kind ought to be
acknowledged as an indispensable part of our understanding of the natural world
at a fundamental level.
