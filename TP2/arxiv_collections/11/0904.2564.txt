We report on the experimental observation of vortices tangle in an atomic BEC
of Rb-87 atoms when an external oscillatory perturbation is introduced in the
trap. The vortices tangle configuration is a signature of the presence of a
turbulent regime in the cloud. We also show that this turbulent cloud has
suppression of the aspect ratio inversion typically observed in quantum
degenerate bosonic gases during free expansion. Instead, the cloud expands
keeping the ratio between their axis constant. Turbulence in atomic superfluids
may constitute an alternative system to investigate decay mechanisms as well as
to test fundamental theoretical aspects in this field.
