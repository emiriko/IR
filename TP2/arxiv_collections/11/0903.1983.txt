Based on semiclassical tunneling method, we focus on charged fermions
tunneling from higher-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole. We first
simplify the Dirac equation by semiclassical approximation, and then a
semiclassical Hamilton-Jacobi equation is obtained. Using the Hamilton-Jacobi
equation, we study the Hawking temperature and fermions tunneling rate at the
event horizon of the higher-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole
spacetime. Finally, the correct entropy is calculation by the method beyond
semiclassical approximation.
