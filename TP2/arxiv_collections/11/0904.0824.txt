We have investigated the effect of Fe nonstoichiometry on properties of the
Fe1+y(Te, Se) superconductor system by means of resistivity, Hall coefficient,
magnetic susceptibility, and specific heat measurements. We find that the
excess Fe at interstitial sites of the (Te, Se) layers not only suppresses
superconductivity, but also results in a weakly localized electronic state. We
argue that these effects originate from the magnetic coupling between the
excess Fe and the adjacent Fe square planar sheets, which favors a short-range
magnetic order.
