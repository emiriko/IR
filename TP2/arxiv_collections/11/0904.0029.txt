In this paper a new dynamic subsumption technique for Boolean CNF formulae is
proposed. It exploits simple and sufficient conditions to detect during
conflict analysis, clauses from the original formula that can be reduced by
subsumption. During the learnt clause derivation, and at each step of the
resolution process, we simply check for backward subsumption between the
current resolvent and clauses from the original formula and encoded in the
implication graph. Our approach give rise to a strong and dynamic
simplification technique that exploits learning to eliminate literals from the
original clauses. Experimental results show that the integration of our dynamic
subsumption approach within the state-of-the-art SAT solvers Minisat and Rsat
achieves interesting improvements particularly on crafted instances.
