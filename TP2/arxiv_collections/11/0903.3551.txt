We present several results on the geometry of the quantum projective plane
CP2q. They include: explicit generators for the K-theory and the K-homology; a
real calculus with a Hodge star operator; anti-selfdual connections on line
bundles with explicit computation of the corresponding 'monopoles' and
'instanton' charges; complete diagonalization of gauged Laplacians on these
line bundles; quantum invariants via equivariant K-theory and q-indices.
