The coincidence detection efficiency of the TUNL--ITEP apparatus designed for
measuring half-life times of two-neutrino double-beta decay transitions to
excited final states in daughter nuclei has been measured with a factor of 2.4
improved accuracy. In addition, the previous measuring time of 455 days for the
study of the Mo-100 two-neutrino double-beta decay to the first excited 0+
state in Ru-100 has been increased by 450 days, and a new result (combined with
the previous measurement obtained with the same apparatus) for this transition
is presented: T_(1/2) = [5.5 (+1.2/-0.8) (stat) +/- 0.3 (syst)] x 10^20 y.
Measured two-neutrino double-beta decay half-life times to excited states can
be used to test the reliability of nuclear matrix element calculations needed
for determining the effective neutrino mass from zero-neutrino double-beta
decay data. We also present new limits for transitions to higher excited states
in Ru-100 which, if improved, may be of interest for more exotic conjectures,
like a bosonic component to neutrino statistics.
