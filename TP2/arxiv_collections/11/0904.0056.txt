We present two robust quantum key distribution protocols against two kinds of
collective noise, following some ideas in quantum dense coding. Three-qubit
entangled states are used as quantum information carriers, two of which forming
the logical qubit which is invariant with a special type of collective noise.
The information is encoded on logical qubits with four unitary operations,
which can be read out faithfully with Bell-state analysis on two physical
qubits and a single-photon measurement on the other physical qubit, not
three-photon joint measurements. Two bits of information are exchanged
faithfully and securely by transmitting two physical qubits through a noisy
channel. When the losses in the noisy channel is low, these protocols can be
used to transmit a secret message directly in principle.
