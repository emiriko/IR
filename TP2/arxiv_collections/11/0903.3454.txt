We examine the coexistence of the vortex state and the
Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state in quasi-two-dimensional type-II
superconductors and the crossover from the coexistence state to the pure FFLO
state when the Maki parameter \alpha increases. The pure FFLO state,
characterized by finite center-of-mass momenta q \ne 0 of Cooper pairs occurs
in the two-dimensional limit, when the magnetic field is parallel to the
conductive plane. The vectors q are determined from the Fermi-surface structure
and pairing anisotropy, and become finite below a temperature T^*. In
quasi-two-dimensions, because of the orbital pair-breaking effect, the
coexistence state characterized by (n,q//) occurs, where n and q// denote the
Landau level index of the vortex state and the wave number of the additional
FFLO modulation along the magnetic field. We obtain the \alpha dependence of
the upper critical field by numerical calculations. The upper critical field
exhibits a cascade curve in the H-T phase diagram. It is analytically shown
that n diverges in the two-dimensional limit \alpha \to \infty below T^*. In
this limit, the upper critical field equation of the coexistence state is
reduced to that of the FFLO state. A relation between n of the coexistence
state and q_{\perp} of the pure FFLO state is obtained, where q_{\perp} denotes
the component of q perpendicular to the magnetic field. It is found that the
pure FFLO state is nothing but the vortex state with infinitely large n as is
known in two-dimensional superconductors in a tilted magnetic field. The vortex
state with large n can be regarded as the FFLO state with non-zero q_{\perp} in
three dimensions.
