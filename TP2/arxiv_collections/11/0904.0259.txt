A statistical theory is presented which allows to calculate the stationary
state achieved by a driven system after a process of collisionless relaxation.
The theory is applied to study an electron beam driven by an external electric
field. The Vlasov equation with appropriate boundary conditions is solved
analytically and compared with the molecular dynamics simulation. A perfect
agreement is found between the theory and the simulations. The full
current-voltage phase diagram is constructed.
