The study of heavy flavor production is a central topic of research at HERA
and is an important testing ground for perturbative QCD. A selection of results
for charm and beauty production in gamma p, using different experimental
techniques and compared to different theoretical predictions, obtained by the
H1 and ZEUS collaborations will be presented.
