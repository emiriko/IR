An experimental pump-probe study of the photoassociative creation of
translationally ultracold rubidium molecules is presented together with
numerical simulations of the process. The formation of loosely bound
excited-state dimers is observed as a first step towards a fully coherent
pump-dump approach to the stabilization of Rb$_2$ into its lowest ground
vibrational states. The population that contributes to the pump-probe process
is characterized and found to be distinct from a background population of
pre-associated molecules.
