Using their relationship with the free boson and the free symplectic fermion,
we study the off-critical perturbation of SLE(4) and SLE(2) obtained by adding
a mass term to the action. We compute the off-critical statistics of the source
in the Loewner equation describing the two dimensional interfaces. In these two
cases we show that ratios of massive by massless partition functions,
expressible as ratios of regularised determinants of massive and massless
Laplacians, are (local) martingales for the massless interfaces. The
off-critical drifts in the stochastic source of the Loewner equation are
proportional to the logarithmic derivative of these ratios. We also show that
massive correlation functions are (local) martingales for the massive
interfaces. In the case of massive SLE(4), we use this property to prove a
factorisation of the free boson measure.
