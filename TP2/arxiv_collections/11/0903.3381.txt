We recap the main features of Minimal Dark Matter (MDM) and assess its status
in the light of the recent experimental data. The theory selects an electroweak
5-plet with hypercharge Y=0 as a fully successful DM candidate, automatically
stable against decay and with no free parameters: DM is a fermion with a 9.6
TeV mass. The direct detection cross-section, predicted to be 10^-44 cm2, is
within reach of next-generation experiments. DM is accompanied by a charged
fermion 166 MeV heavier: we discuss how it might manifest. Thanks to an
electroweak Sommerfeld enhancement of more than 2 orders of magnitude, DM
annihilations into W+W- give, in presence of a modest astrophysical boost
factor, a positron flux compatible with the PAMELA excess (but not with the
ATIC hint for a peak: MDM instead predicts a quasi-power-law spectrum), a
anti-proton flux concentrated at energies above 100 GeV, and to photon fluxes
comparable with present limits, depending on the DM density profile.
