We consider using a secret key and a noisy quantum channel to generate
noiseless public communication and noiseless private communication. The optimal
protocol for this setting is the publicly-enhanced private father protocol.
This protocol exploits random coding techniques and "piggybacking" of public
information along with secret-key-assisted private codes. The publicly-enhanced
private father protocol is a generalization of the secret-key-assisted protocol
of Hsieh, Luo, and Brun and a generelization of a protocol for simultaneous
communication of public and private information suggested by Devetak and Shor.
