One puzzling observed property of coronal loops is that they are of roughly
constant thickness along their length. Various studies have found no consistent
pattern of width variation along the length of loops observed by TRACE and
SOHO. This is at odds with expectations of magnetic flux tube expansion
properties, which suggests that loops are widest at their tops, and
significantly narrower at their footpoints. Coronal loops correspond to areas
of the solar corona which have been preferentially heated by some process, so
this observed property might be connected to the mechanisms that heat the
corona. One means of energy deposition is magnetic reconnection, which occurs
along field lines called separators. These field lines begin and end on
magnetic null points, and loops forming near them can therefore be relatively
wide at their bases. Thus, coronal energization by magnetic reconnection may
replicate the puzzling expansion properties observed in coronal loops. We
present results of a Monte Carlo survey of separator field line expansion
properties, comparing them to the observed properties of coronal loops.
