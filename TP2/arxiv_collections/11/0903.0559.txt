Two weak coupling Continuous Time Quantum Monte Carlo (CTQMC) methods are
shown to be equivalent for Hubbard-like interactions. A relation between these
CTQMC methods and the Hirsch-Fye Quantum Monte Carlo (HFQMC) method is
established, identifying the latter as an approximation within CTQMC and
providing a diagrammatic interpretation. Both HFQMC and CTQMC are shown to be
equivalent when the number of time slices in HFQMC becomes infinite, implying
the same degree of fermion sign problem in this limit.
