The newly developed multi-quasiparticle triaxial projected shell-model
approach is employed to study the high-spin band structures in
neutron-deficient even-even Ce- and Nd-isotopes. It is observed that
gamma-bands are built on each intrinsic configuration of the triaxial
mean-field deformation. Due to the fact that a triaxial configuration is a
superposition of several K-states, the projection from these states results in
several low-lying bands originating from the same intrinsic configuration. This
generalizes the well-known concept of the surface gamma-oscillation in deformed
nuclei based on the ground-state to gamma-bands built on multi-quasiparticle
configurations. This new feature provides an alternative explanation on the
observation of two I=10 aligning states in 134Ce and both exhibiting a neutron
character.
