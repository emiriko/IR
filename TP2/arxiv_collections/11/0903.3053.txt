Implementation of basic local Monte-Carlo algorithms on ATI Graphics
Processing Units (GPU) is investigated. The Ising model and pure SU(2)
gluodynamics simulations are realized with the Compute Abstraction Layer (CAL)
of ATI Stream environment using the Metropolis and the heat-bath algorithms,
respectively. We present an analysis of both CAL programming model and the
efficiency of the corresponding simulation algorithms on GPU. In particular,
the significant performance speed-up of these algorithms in comparison with
serial execution is observed.
