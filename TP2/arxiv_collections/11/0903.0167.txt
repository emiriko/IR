Building upon previous results in scalar field theory, a formalism is
developed that uses generalized Killing fields to understand the behavior of
extended charges interacting with their own electromagnetic fields. New notions
of effective linear and angular momenta are identified, and their evolution
equations are derived exactly in arbitrary (but fixed) curved spacetimes. A
slightly modified form of the Detweiler-Whiting axiom that a charge's motion
should only be influenced by the so-called "regular" component of its
self-field is shown to follow very easily. It is exact in some interesting
cases, and approximate in most others. Explicit equations describing the
center-of-mass motion, spin angular momentum, and changes in mass of a small
charge are also derived in a particular limit. The chosen approximations --
although standard -- incorporate dipole and spin forces that do not appear in
the traditional Abraham-Lorentz-Dirac or Dewitt-Brehme equations. They have,
however, been previously identified in the test body limit.
