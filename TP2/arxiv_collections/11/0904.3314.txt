We describe an apparatus for quickly and simply producing $\Rb87$
Bose-Einstein condensates. It is based on a magnetic quadrupole trap and a red
detuned optical dipole trap. We collect atoms in a magneto-optical trap (MOT)
and then capture the atom in a magnetic quadrupole trap and force rf
evaporation. We then transfer the resulting cold, dense cloud into a spatially
mode-matched optical dipole trap by lowering the quadrupole field gradient to
below gravity. This technique combines the efficient capture of atoms from a
MOT into a magnetic trap with the rapid evaporation of optical dipole traps;
the approach is insensitive to the peak quadrupole gradient and the precise
trapping beam waist. Our system reliably produces a condensate with
$N\approx2\times10^6$ atoms every $16\second$.
