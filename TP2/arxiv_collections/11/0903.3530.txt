We investigate the lifetime of angular momentum in an ultracold strongly
interacting Fermi gas, confined in a trap with controllable ellipticity. To
determine the angular momentum we measure the precession of the radial
quadrupole mode. We find that in the vicinity of a Feshbach resonance the
deeply hydrodynamic behavior in the normal phase leads to a very long lifetime
of the angular momentum. Furthermore, we examine the dependence of the decay
rate of the angular momentum on the ellipticity of the trapping potential and
the interaction strength. The results are in general agreement with the
theoretically expected behavior for a Boltzmann gas.
