In this paper we present the two-point angular correlation function of the
X-ray source population of 1063 XMM-Newton observations at high Galactic
latitudes, comprising up to ~30000 sources over a sky area of 125.5 sq. deg, in
three energy bands: 0.5-2 (soft), 2-10 (hard), and 4.5-10 (ultrahard) keV. We
have measured the angular clustering of our survey and find significant
positive clustering signals in the soft and hard bands, and a marginal
clustering detection in the ultrahard band. We find dependency of the
clustering strength on the flux limit and no significant differences in the
clustering properties between sources with high hardness ratios and those with
low hardness ratios. Our results show that obscured and unobscured objects
share similar clustering properties and therefore they both reside in similar
environments, in agreement with the unified model of AGN. We deprojected the
angular clustering parameters via Limber's equation to compute their typical
spatial lengths. From that we have inferred the typical mass of the dark matter
haloes in which AGN at redshifts of ~1 are embedded. The short AGN lifetimes
derived suggest that AGN activity might be a transient phase that can be
experienced several times by a large fraction of galaxies throughout their
lives.
