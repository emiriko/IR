We demonstrate the existence of stochastic resonance (SR) in confined systems
arising from entropy variations associated to the presence of irregular
boundaries. When the motion of a Brownian particle is constrained to a region
with uneven boundaries, the presence of a periodic input may give rise to a
peak in the spectral amplification factor and therefore to the appearance of
the SR phenomenon. We have proved that the amplification factor depends on the
shape of the region through which the particle moves and that by adjusting its
characteristic geometric parameters one may optimize the response of the
system. The situation in which the appearance of such entropic stochastic
resonance (ESR) occurs is common for small-scale systems in which confinement
and noise play an prominent role. The novel mechanism found could thus
constitute an important tool for the characterization of these systems and can
put to use for controlling their basic properties.
