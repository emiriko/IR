In this article we focus on a semiclassical Schr\"odinger equation with
matrix-valued potential presenting a symmetric conjoint crossing of three
eigenvalues. The potential we consider is well-known in the chemical literature
as a pseudo
  Jahn-Teller potential. We analyze the energy transfers which occur between
the three modes in terms of Wigner measures.
