Non-redundant masking (NRM) is a high contrast, high resolution technique
relevant to future space missions concerned with extrasolar planetary system
and star formation, as well as general high angular resolution galactic and
extragalactic astronomy. NRM enables the highest angular resolution science
possible given the telescope's diameter and operating wavelength. It also
provides precise information on a telescope's optical state. We must assess NRM
contrast limits realistically to understand the science yield of NRM in space,
and, simultaneously, develop NRM science for planet and star formation and
extragalactic science in the UV-NIR, to help steer high resolution space-based
astronomy in the coming decade.
