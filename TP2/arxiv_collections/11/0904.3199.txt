Chromospheric activity is widely used as an age indicator for solar-type
stars based on the early evidence that there is a smooth evolution from young
and active to old and inactive stars. We analysed chromospheric activity in
five solar-type stars in two open clusters, in order to study how chromospheric
activity evolves with time. We took UVES high-resolution, high S/N ratio
spectra of 3 stars in IC 4756 and 2 in NGC 5822, which were combined with a
previously studied data-set and reanalysed here. The emission core of the deep,
photospheric Ca II K line was used as a probe of the chromospheric activity.
All of the 5 stars in the new sample, including those in the 1.2 Gyr-old NGC
5822, have activity levels comparable to those of Hyades and Praesepe. A likely
interpretation of our data is that solar-type-star chromospheric activity, from
the age of the Hyades until that of the Sun, does not evolve smoothly. Stars
change from active to inactive on a short timescale. Evolution before and after
such a transition is much less significant than cyclical and long-term
variations. We show that data presented in the literature to support a
correlation between age and activity could be also interpreted differently in
the light of our results.
