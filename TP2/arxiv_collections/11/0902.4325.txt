We investigate theoretically electron dynamics under a VUV attosecond pulse
train which has a controlled phase delay with respect to an additional strong
infrared laser field. Using the strong field approximation and the fact that
the attosecond pulse is short compared to the excited electron dynamics, we
arrive at a minimal analytical model for the kinetic energy distribution of the
electron as well as the photon absorption probability as a function of the
phase delay between the fields. We analyze the dynamics in terms of electron
wave packet replicas created by the attosecond pulses. The absorption
probability shows strong modulations as a function of the phase delay for VUV
photons of energy comparable to the binding energy of the electron, while for
higher photon energies the absorption probability does not depend on the delay,
in line with the experimental observations for helium and argon, respectively.
