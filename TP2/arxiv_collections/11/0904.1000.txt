Besides using the laser beam, it is very tempting to directly testify the
Bell inequality at high energy experiments where the spin correlation is
exactly what the original Bell inequality investigates. In this work, we follow
the proposal raised in literature and use the successive decays
$J/\psi\to\gamma\eta_c\to \Lambda\bar\Lambda\to p\pi^-\bar p\pi^+$ to testify
the Bell inequality. Our goal is twofold, namely, we first make a Monte-Carlo
simulation of the processes based on the quantum field theory (QFT). Since the
underlying theory is QFT, it implies that we pre-admit the validity of quantum
picture. Even though the QFT is true, we need to find how big the database
should be, so that we can clearly show deviations of the correlation from the
Bell inequality determined by the local hidden variable theory. There have been
some critiques on the proposed method, so in the second part, we suggest some
improvements which may help to remedy the ambiguities indicated by the
critiques. It may be realized at an updated facility of high energy physics,
such as BES III.
