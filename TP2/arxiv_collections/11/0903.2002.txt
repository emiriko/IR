We employ a sequence of Doppler images obtained with the Coronal
Multi-channel Polarimeter (CoMP) instrument to perform time-distance seismology
of the solar corona. We construct the first k-omega diagrams of the region.
These allow us to separate outward and inward propagating waves and estimate
the spatial variation of the plane-of-sky projected phase speed, and the
relative amount of outward and inward directed wave power. The disparity
between outward and inward wave power and the slope of the observed power law
spectrum indicate that low-frequency Alfvenic motions suffer significant
attenuation as they propagate, consistent with isotropic MHD turbulence.
