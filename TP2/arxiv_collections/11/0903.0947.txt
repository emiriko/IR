In the very near future the first data from LHC will be available. The
searches for the Higgs boson and for new physics will require precise
predictions both for the signal and the background processes. Tree level
calculations typically suffer from large renormalization scale uncertainties. I
present an efficient implementation of an algorithm for the automated, Feynman
diagram based calculation of one-loop corrections to processes with many
external particles. This algorithm has been successfully applied to compute the
virtual corrections of the process $u\bar{u}\to b\bar{b}b\bar{b}$ in massless
QCD and can easily be adapted for other processes which are required for the
LHC.
