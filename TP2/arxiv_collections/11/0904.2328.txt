We first apply the transformation of mixing azimuthal with wrapped coordinate
to the 11D M-theory with a stack N M5-branes to find the spacetime of a stack
of N D4-branes with magnetic field in 10D IIA string theory, after the
Kaluza-Klein reduction. In the near-horizon limit the background becomes the
Melvin magnetic field deformed $AdS_6 \times S^4$. Although the solution
represents the D-branes under the Melvin RR one-form we use a simple
observation to see that it also describes the solution of D-branes under the
Maxwell magnetic field. As the magnetic field we consider is the part of the
background itself we have presented an alternative to previous literature,
because our method does not require the assumption of negligible back reaction.
Next, we use the found solution to investigate the meson property through D4/D8
system (Sakai-Sugimoto model) and compare it with those studied by other
authors. Finally, we present a detailed analysis about the Wilson loop therein
and results show that the external Maxwell magnetic field will enhance the
quark-antiquark potential.
