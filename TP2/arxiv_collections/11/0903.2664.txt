We study statistical signatures of composite bosons made of two fermions
using a new many-body approach. Extending number-states to composite bosons,
two-particle correlations as well as the dispersion of the probability
distribution are analyzed. We show that the particle composite nature reduces
the anti-bunching effect predicted for elementary bosons. Furthermore, the
probability distribution exhibits a dispersion which is greater for composite
bosons than for elementary bosons. This dispersion corresponds to the one of
sub-Poissonian processes, as for a quantum state, but, unlike its elementary
boson counterpart, it is not minimum. In general, our work shows that it is
necessary to take into account the Pauli exclusion principle which takes place
between fermionic components of composite bosons - along the line here used -
to possibly extract statistical properties in a precise way.
