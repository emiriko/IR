In this paper we analyse the street network of London both in its primary and
dual representation. To understand its properties, we consider three idealised
models based on a grid, a static random planar graph and a growing random
planar graph. Comparing the models and the street network, we find that the
streets of London form a self-organising system whose growth is characterised
by a strict interaction between the metrical and informational space. In
particular, a principle of least effort appears to create a balance between the
physical and the mental effort required to navigate the city.
