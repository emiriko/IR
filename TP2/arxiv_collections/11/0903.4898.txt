It is well known that the static caching algorithm that keeps the most
frequently requested documents in the cache is optimal in case when documents
are of the same size and requests are independent and equally distributed.
However, it is hard to develop explicit and provably optimal caching algorithms
when requests are statistically correlated. In this paper, we show that keeping
the most frequently requested documents in the cache is still optimal for large
cache sizes even if the requests are strongly correlated.
