We present a study of the morphological fractions and color-magnitude
relation in the most distant X-ray selected galaxy cluster currently known,
XMMXCS J2215.9-1738 at z=1.46, using a combination of optical imaging data
obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys, and
infrared data from the Multi-Object Infrared Camera and Spectrograph, mounted
on the 8.2m Subaru telescope. We find that the morphological mix of the cluster
galaxy population is similar to clusters at z~1: approximately ~62% of the
galaxies identified as likely cluster members are ellipticals or S0s; and ~38%
are spirals or irregulars. We measure the color-magnitude relations for the
early type galaxies, finding that the slope in the z_850-J relation is
consistent with that measured in the Coma cluster, some ~9 Gyr earlier,
although the uncertainty is large. In contrast, the measured intrinsic scatter
about the color-magnitude relation is more than three times the value measured
in Coma, after conversion to rest frame U-V. From comparison with stellar
population synthesis models, the intrinsic scatter measurements imply mean
luminosity weighted ages for the early type galaxies in J2215.9-1738 of ~3 Gyr,
corresponding to the major epoch of star formation coming to an end at z_f =
3-5. We find that the cluster exhibits evidence of the `downsizing' phenomenon:
the fraction of faint cluster members on the red sequence expressed using the
Dwarf-to-Giant Ratio (DGR) is 0.32+/-0.18. This is consistent with
extrapolation of the redshift evolution of the DGR seen in cluster samples at z
< 1. In contrast to observations of some other z > 1 clusters, we find a lack
of very bright galaxies within the cluster.
