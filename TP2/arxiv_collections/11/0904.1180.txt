We prove an upper bound on the optimal H\"older exponent for the chordal SLE
path parameterized by capacity and thereby establish the optimal exponent as
conjectured by J. Lind. We also give a new proof of the lower bound. Our proofs
are based on the sharp estimates of moments of the derivative of the inverse
map. In particular, we improve an estimate of the second author.
