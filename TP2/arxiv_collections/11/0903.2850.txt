We present a measurement of the $\ttbar$ differential cross section with
respect to the $\ttbar$ invariant mass, dSigma/dMttbar, in $\ppbar$ collisions
at $\sqrt{s}=1.96$ TeV using an integrated luminosity of $2.7\invfb$ collected
by the CDF II experiment. The $\ttbar$ invariant mass spectrum is sensitive to
a variety of exotic particles decaying into $\ttbar$ pairs. The result is
consistent with the standard model expectation, as modeled by \texttt{PYTHIA}
with \texttt{CTEQ5L} parton distribution functions.
