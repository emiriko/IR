The hardcore-Bose-Hubbard model with random chemical potential is
investigated using quantum Monte Carlo simulation. We consider two cases of
random distribution of the chemical potential: a uniformly random distribution
and a correlated distribution. The temperature dependences of the superfluid
density, the specific heat, and the correlation functions are calculated. If
the distribution of the randomness is correlated, there exists an intermediate
state, which can be thought of as a localized condensate state of bosons,
between the superfluid state and the normal state.
