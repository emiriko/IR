The Heisenberg-Weyl algebra, which underlies virtually all physical
representations of Quantum Theory, is considered from the combinatorial point
of view. We provide a concrete model of the algebra in terms of paths on a
lattice with some decomposition rules. We also discuss the rook problem on the
associated Ferrers board; this is related to the calculus in the normally
ordered basis. From this starting point we explore a combinatorial underpinning
of the Heisenberg-Weyl algebra, which offers novel perspectives, methods and
applications.
