We report on a new approach, entirely based on electron-beam lithography
technique, to contact electrically, in a four-probe scheme, single
nanostructures obtained by self-assembly. In our procedure, nanostructures of
interest are localised and contacted in the same fabrication step. This
technique has been developed to study the field-induced reversal of an internal
component of an asymmetric Bloch domain wall observed in elongated structures
such as Fe(110) dots. We have focused on the control, using an external
magnetic field, of the magnetisation orientation within N\'eel caps that
terminate the domain wall at both interfaces. Preliminary magneto-transport
measurements are discussed demonstrating that single Fe(110) dots have been
contacted.
