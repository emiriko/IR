In their first-principles calculations of the electronic band structure of
graphene under uniaxial strain, Gui, Li, and Zhong [Phys. Rev. B \textbf{78},
075435 (2008)] have found opening of band gaps at the Fermi level. This finding
is in conflict with the tight-binding description of graphene which is closed
gap for small strains. In this Comment, we present first-principles
calculations which refute the claim that strain opens band gaps in graphene.
