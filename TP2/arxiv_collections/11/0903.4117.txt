The particle number projected BCS (PBCS) approximation is tested against the
exact solution of the SO(5) Richardson-Gaudin model for isovector pairing in a
system of non-degenerate single particle orbits. Two isovector PBCS wave
functions are considered. One is constructed as a single proton-neutron pair
condensate, while the other corresponds to a product of a neutron pair
condensate and a proton pair condensate. The PBCS equations are solved using a
recurrence method and the analysis is performed for systems with an equal
number of neutrons and protons distributed in a sequence of equally spaced
4-fold (spin-isospin) degenerate levels. The results show that although PBCS
improves significantly over BCS, the agreement of PBCS with the exact solution
is less satisfactory than in the case of the SU(2) Richardson model for pairing
between like particles.
