We consider the distinguishability of Gaussian states from the view point of
continuous-variable quantum cryptography using post-selection. Specifically, we
use the probability of error to distinguish between two pure coherent
(squeezed) states and two particular mixed symmetric coherent (squeezed) states
where each mixed state is an incoherent mixture of two pure coherent (squeezed)
states with equal and opposite displacements in the conjugate quadrature. We
show that the two mixed symmetric Gaussian states (where the various components
have the same real part) never give an eavesdropper more information than the
two pure Gaussian states. Furthermore, when considering the distinguishability
of squeezed states, we show that varying the amount of squeezing leads to a
"squeezing" and "anti-squeezing" of the net information rates.
