We report on the first simultaneous observations that cover the optical,
X-ray, and high energy gamma-ray bands of the BL Lac object PKS 2155-304. The
gamma-ray bands were observed for 11 days, between 25 August and 6 September
2008, jointly with the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope and the H.E.S.S.
atmospheric Cherenkov array, providing the first simultaneous MeV-TeV spectral
energy distribution with the new generation of gamma-ray telescopes. The ATOM
telescope and the RXTE and Swift observatories provided optical and X-ray
coverage of the low-energy component over the same time period. The object was
close to the lowest archival X-ray and Very High Energy state, whereas the
optical flux was much higher. The light curves show relatively little (~30%$)
variability overall when compared to past flaring episodes, but we find a clear
optical/VHE correlation and evidence for a correlation of the X-rays with the
high energy spectral index. Contrary to previous observations in the flaring
state, we do not find any correlation between the X-ray and VHE components.
Although synchrotron self-Compton models are often invoked to explain the SEDs
of BL Lac objects, the most common versions of these models are at odds with
the correlated variability we find in the various bands for PKS 2155-304.
