We present a closest separable state to cluster states. We start by
considering linear cluster chains and extend our method to cluster states that
can be used as a universal resource in quantum computation. We reproduce known
results for pure cluster states and show how our method can be used in
quantifying entanglement in noisy cluster states. Operational meaning is given
to our method that clearly demonstrates how these closest separable states can
be constructed from two-qubit clusters in the case of pure states. We also
discuss the issue of finding the critical temperature at which the cluster
state becomes only classically correlated and the importance of this
temperature to our method.
