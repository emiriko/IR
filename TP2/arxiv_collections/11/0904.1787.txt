We report the first experimental observation of vector surface solitons,
which form at the edge and in the corner of two-dimensional laser-written
waveguide arrays. These elliptically polarized vector states are composed of
two orthogonally polarized components. They exist only above a power threshold
and bifurcate from scalar surface solitons. The components of a vector soliton
may have substantially different degrees of localization in certain parameter
ranges.
