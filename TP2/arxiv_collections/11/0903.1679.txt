In this paper we calculated the relativistic corrections to transition
frequencies (q factors) of Fe I for the transitions from the even- and
odd-parity states to the ground state. We also carried out isotope shift
calculations in Fe I and Fe II. To the best of our knowledge, the isotope shift
in Fe I was calculated for the first time.
