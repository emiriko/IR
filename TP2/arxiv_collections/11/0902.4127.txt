We introduce a new protocol for prediction with expert advice in which each
expert evaluates the learner's and his own performance using a loss function
that may change over time and may be different from the loss functions used by
the other experts. The learner's goal is to perform better or not much worse
than each expert, as evaluated by that expert, for all experts simultaneously.
If the loss functions used by the experts are all proper scoring rules and all
mixable, we show that the defensive forecasting algorithm enjoys the same
performance guarantee as that attainable by the Aggregating Algorithm in the
standard setting and known to be optimal. This result is also applied to the
case of "specialist" (or "sleeping") experts. In this case, the defensive
forecasting algorithm reduces to a simple modification of the Aggregating
Algorithm.
