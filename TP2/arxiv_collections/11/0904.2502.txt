We analyze optical spectra of high temperature superconductors using a
minimal model of electrons coupled to bosons. We consider the marginal Fermi
liquid theory and the spin fluctuation theory, as well as a histogram
representation of the bosonic spectral density. We find that the two theories
can both be used to describe the experimental data provided that we allow for
an additional scattering channel with an energy of 55 meV.
