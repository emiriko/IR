The cascading gauge theory of Klebanov et.al realizes a soluble example of
gauge/string correspondence in a non-conformal setting. Such a gauge theory has
a strong coupling scale Lambda, below which it confines with a chiral symmetry
breaking. A holographic description of a strongly coupled cascading gauge
theory plasma is represented by a black brane solution of type IIB supergravity
on a conifold with fluxes. A characteristic parameter controlling the high
temperature expansion of such plasma is 1/ln(T/Lambda). In this paper we study
the speed of sound and the bulk viscosity of the cascading gauge theory plasma
to order 1/ln(T/Lambda)^4. We find that the bulk viscosity satisfies the bound
conjectured in arXiv:0708.3459. We comment on difficulties of computing the
transport coefficients to all orders in T/Lambda. Previously, it was shown that
a cascading gauge theory plasma undergoes a first-order deconfinement
transition with unbroken chiral symmetry at T_c=0.6141111(3) Lambda. We show
here that a deconfined chirally symmetric phase becomes perturbatively unstable
at T_u=0.8749(0) T_c. Near the unstable point the specific heat diverges as c_V
~ |1-T_u/T|^(-1/2).
