We present a detailed study on triminimal parametrizations of quark and
lepton mixing matrices with different basis matrices. We start with a general
discussion on the triminimal expansion of the mixing matrix and on possible
unified quark and lepton parametrization using quark-lepton complementarity
(QLC). We then consider several interesting basis matrices and compare the
triminimal parametrizations with the Wolfenstein-like parametrizations. The
usual Wolfenstein parametrization for quark mixing is a triminimal expansion
around the unit matrix as the basis. The corresponding QLC lepton mixing matrix
is a triminimal expansion around the bimaximal basis. Current neutrino
oscillation data show that the lepton mixing matrix is very well represented by
the tri-bimaximal mixing. It is natural to take it as an expanding basis. The
corresponding zeroth order basis for quark mixing in this case makes the
triminimal expansion converge much faster than the usual Wolfenstein
parametrization. The triminimal expansion based on tri-bimaximal mixing can be
converted to the Wolfenstein-like parametrizations discussed in the literature.
We thus have a unified description between different kinds of parametrizations
for quark and lepton sectors: the standard parametrizations, the
Wolfenstein-like parametrizations, and the triminimal parametrizations.
