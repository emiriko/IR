It has recently been speculated that the solar neutrino mixing angle is
connected to the golden ratio phi. Two such proposals have been made, cot
theta_{12} = phi and cos theta_{12} = phi/2. We compare these Ansatze and
discuss a model leading to cos theta_{12} = phi/2 based on the dihedral group
D_{10}. This symmetry is a natural candidate because the angle in the
expression cos theta_{12} = phi/2 is simply pi/5, or 36 degrees. This is the
exterior angle of a decagon and D_{10} is its rotational symmetry group. We
also estimate radiative corrections to the golden ratio predictions.
