Using high statistics samples of charged current $\nu_\mu$ interactions,
MiniBooNE reports a measurement of the single charged pion production to
quasi-elastic cross section ratio on mineral oil (CH$_2$), both with and
without corrections for hadron re-interactions in the target nucleus. The
result is provided as a function of neutrino energy in the range 0.4 GeV $<
E_\nu <$ 2.4 GeV with 11% precision in the region of highest statistics. The
results are consistent with previous measurements and the prediction from
historical neutrino calculations.
