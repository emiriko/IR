Horava-Lifshitz gravity, a recent proposal for a UV-complete renormalizable
gravity theory, may lead to a bouncing cosmology. In this note we argue that
Horava-Lifshitz cosmology may yield a concrete realization of the matter bounce
scenario, and thus give rise to an alternative to inflation for producing a
scale-invariant spectrum of cosmological perturbations. In this scenario,
quantum vacuum fluctuations exit the Hubble radius in the pre-bounce phase and
the spectrum is transformed into a scale-invariant one on super-Hubble scales
before the bounce because the long wavelength modes undergo squeezing of their
wave-functions for a longer period of time than shorter wavelength modes. The
scale-invariance of the spectrum of curvature fluctuations is preserved during
and after the bounce. A distinctive prediction of this scenario is the
amplitude and shape of the bispectrum.
