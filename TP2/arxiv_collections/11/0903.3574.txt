We combine ultraviolet to near-infrared photometry with HI 21cm line
observations for a complete volume-limited sample of nearby galaxies in
different environments (from isolated galaxies to Virgo cluster members), to
study the migration of spirals from the blue to the red sequence. Although our
analysis confirms that, in the transition region between the two sequences, a
high fraction of spirals host active galactic nuclei (AGN), it clearly shows
that late-types with quenched star formation are mainly HI deficient galaxies
preferentially found in the Virgo cluster. This not only suggests that
environmental effects could play a significant role in driving the migration of
local galaxies from the blue sequence, but it also implies that a physical link
between AGN feedback and quenching may not be assumed from a correlation
between nuclear activity and colour.
