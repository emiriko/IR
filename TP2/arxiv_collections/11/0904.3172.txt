Current experimental data indicate that two unitarity triangles of the CKM
quark flavor mixing matrix V are almost the right triangles with \alpha \approx
90^\circ. We find that \alpha = 90^\circ actually points to {\rm
Re}(V_{tb}V_{ud}V^*_{td}V^*_{ub}) = 0. Considering a very suggestive
parametrization of V, we show that its CP-violating phase \phi is nearly equal
to \alpha (i.e., \phi - \alpha \approx 1.1^\circ). Both \phi and \alpha are
stable against the renormalizaton-group evolution from the electroweak scale
M_Z to a superhigh energy scale M_X or vice versa, and thus it is impossible to
obtain \alpha = 90^\circ at M_Z from \phi = 90^\circ at M_X. We conjecture that
there might also exist a maximal CP-violating phase \phi \approx 90^\circ in
the MNS lepton flavor mixing matrix U. The approximate quark-lepton
complementarity relations, which hold in the standard parametrizations of V and
U, can also hold in our particular parametrizations of V and U simply due to
the smallness of |V_{ub}| and |V_{e3}|.
