We investigate the multiple teleportation with some nonmaximally entangled
channels. The efficiencies of two multiple teleportation protocols, the
separate multiple teleportation protocol (SMTP) and the global multiple
teleportation protocol (GMTP), are calculated. We show that GMTP is more
efficient than SMTP.
