We analyze the spectrum of a self-adjoint operator on a Laakso space using
the projective limit construction originally given by Barlow and Evans. We will
use the hierarchical cell structure induced by the choice of approximating
quantum graphs to calculate the spectrum with multiplicities. We also extend
the method for using the hierarchical cell structure to more general projective
limits beyond Laakso spaces.
