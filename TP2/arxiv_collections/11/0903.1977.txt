We propose an alternative scheme for quantum repeater without phase
stabilization and polarization calibration of photons transmitted over
long-distance channel. We introduce time-bin photonic states and use a new
two-photon interference configuration to robustly generate entanglement between
distant atomic-ensemble-based memory qubits. Our scheme can be performed with
current experimental setups through making some simple adjustments.
