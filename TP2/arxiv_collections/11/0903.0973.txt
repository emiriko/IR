The observed almost complete dominance of prolate over oblate deformations in
the ground states of deformed even-even nuclei is related to the splitting of
high $\ell$ "surface" orbits in the Nilsson diagram: on the oblate side the
occurrence of numerous strongly avoided crossings which reduce the fanning out
of the low $\Lambda$ orbits, while on the prolate side the same interactions
increase the fanning out. It is further demonstrated that the prolate dominance
is rather special for the restricted particle number of available nuclei and is
not generic for finite systems with mean-field potentials resembling those in
atomic nuclei.
