Response time-delay is an ubiquitous phenomenon in biological systems. Here
we use a simple stochastic population model with time-delayed switching-rate
conversion to quantitatively study the biological influence of the response
time-delay on the survival fitness of cells living in periodically fluctuating
and stochastic environment, respectively. Our calculation and simulation show
that for the cells having a slow rate transition into fit phenotype and a fast
rate transition into unfit phenotype, the response time-delay can always
enhance their fitness during the environment change. Particularly, in the
periodic or stochastic environment with small variance, the optimal fitness
achieved by these cells is superior to that of cells with reverse switching
rates even if the latter exhibits rapid response. These results suggest that
the response time delay may be utilized by cells to enhance their adaptation to
the fluctuating environment.
