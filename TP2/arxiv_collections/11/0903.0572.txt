Keeping the health condition at the juvenile population is the concern of
both the medical staff and the physical education teachers. Considering the
steady tendency of the growth of the number of the youth with excessive weight
(overweighted or obese) the intervention to combat this phenomenon must be
initiated in the early stage when this condition occurs. The screening method
for evaluating the body weight presented in this study uses a calculus program
through which, based on the input data (age, sex, weight the width of the skin
fold) an evaluation regarding each juvenile's weight and the body structure can
be done. This program can be used in schools, high schools, universities, to
signal the weight excess and to appreciate the intervention results for getting
a normal weight.
