Two spherically symmetric, static Lorentzian wormholes are obtained in tetrad
theory of gravitation as a solution of the equation $\rho=\rho_t=0$, where
$\rho=T_{ij}u^iu^j, \rho_t=(T_{ij}-{1/2}Tg_{ij})u^iu^j$ and $u^iu_i=-1$. This
equation characterizes a class of spacetime which are "self-dual" (in the sense
of electrogravity duality). The obtained solutions are characterized by
two-parameters $k_1, k_2$ and have a common property that they reproduce the
same metric spacetime. This metric is the static Lorentzian wormhole and it
includes the Schwarzschild black hole. Calculating the energy content of these
tetrad fields using the {\it superpotential method given by M{\o}ller in the
context of teleparallel spacetime} we find that $E=m$ or $2m$ which does not
depend on the two parameters $k_1$ and $k_2$ characterize the wormhole.
