We present a concrete picture of spoof surface plasmons (SSPs) combined with
cavity resonance to clarify the basic mechanism underlying extraordinary light
transmission through metal films with subwavelength slits or holes. This
picture may indicate a general mechanism of metallic nanostructure optics: When
light is incident on a non-planar conducting surface, the free electrons cannot
move homogeneously in response to the incident electric field, i.e., their
movement can be impeded at the rough parts, forming inhomogeneous charge
distributions. The oscillating charges/dipoles then emit photons (similar to
Thomson scattering of x rays by oscillating electrons), and the interference
between the photons may give rise to anomalous transmission, reflection or
scattering.
