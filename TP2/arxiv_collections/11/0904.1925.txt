We introduce the concept of concatenated tensor networks to efficiently
describe quantum states. We show that the corresponding concatenated tensor
network states can efficiently describe time evolution and possess arbitrary
block-wise entanglement and long-ranged correlations. We illustrate the
approach for the enhancement of matrix product states, i.e. 1D tensor networks,
where we replace each of the matrices of the original matrix product state with
another 1D tensor network. This procedure yields a 2D tensor network, which
includes -- already for tensor dimension two -- all states that can be prepared
by circuits of polynomially many (possibly non-unitary) two-qubit quantum
operations, as well as states resulting from time evolution with respect to
Hamiltonians with short-ranged interactions. We investigate the possibility to
efficiently extract information from these states, which serves as the basic
step in a variational optimization procedure. To this aim we utilize known
exact and approximate methods for 2D tensor networks and demonstrate some
improvements thereof, which are also applicable e.g. in the context of 2D
projected entangled pair states. We generalize the approach to higher
dimensional- and tree tensor networks.
