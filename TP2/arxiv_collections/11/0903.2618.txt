We report on a search for the supersymmetric partner of the bottom quark
produced from gluino decays in data from 2.5 fb-1 of integrated luminosity
collected by the Collider Detector at Fermilab at sqrt(s)=1.96 TeV. Candidate
events are selected requiring two or more jets and large missing transverse
energy. At least two of the jets are required to be tagged as originating from
a b quark to enhance the sensitivity. The results are in good agreement with
the prediction of the standard model processes, giving no evidence for gluino
decay to sbottom quarks. This result constrains the gluino-pair-production
cross section to be less than 40fb at 95% credibility level for a gluino mass
of 350 GeV.
