We investigate the transport properties of narrow quantum wires realized in
disordered two-dimensional electron gases in the presence of k-linear Rashba
and Dresselhaus spin-orbit interaction (SOI), and an applied in-plane magnetic
field. Building on previous work [Scheid, et al., PRL 101, 266401 (2008)], we
find that in addition to the conductance, the universal conductance
fluctuations also feature anisotropy with respect to the magnetic field
direction. This anisotropy can be explained solely from the symmetries
exhibited by the Hamiltonian as well as the relative strengths of the Rashba
and Dresselhaus spin orbit interaction and thus can be utilized to detect this
ratio from purely electrical measurements.
