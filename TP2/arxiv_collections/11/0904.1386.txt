We present a theoretical study on the energy loss by protons in solid copper.
The ab initio shellwise local plasma approximation (SLPA) is employed for the
inner-shells, and the Mermin dielectric function for the valence electrons. The
partial contribution of each sub-shell of target electrons is calculated
separately, including the screening among the electrons of the same binding
energy. Present results are obtained using the SLPA and the known Hartree-Fock
wave functions for copper. The theoretical curves are compared with the
experimental data available and with the semi-empirical srim08 values, showing
very good agreement in a large energy region (5 keV-30 MeV).
