We present experimental and theoretical analysis of quantum fluctuation in a
vacuum field in the presence of orthogonal linearly polarized pump field
propagating through a Rb vapor cell. Previously reported theoretical and
experimental studies provided somewhat contradictory conclusions regarding the
possibility to observe the "squeezed vacuum" -- the reduction of vacuum
fluctuations below standard quantum limit -- in this system. Here, using the D1
transitions of Rb in a cell without buffer as as an example, we demonstrate
that vacuum squeezing is corrupted by incoherent processes (such as spontaneous
emission, elastic scattering, etc.), and its observation is only possible in a
specific small region of the experimental parameter space. Numerical
simulations, in good agreement with the experiment, demonstrate that the two
excited state hyperfine levels play a crucial role in the squeezing and excess
noise production. The significant influence of far-detuned atoms on the field
fluctuations at low noise frequencies imposes the explicit consideration of the
full velocity distribution of the atomic vapor.
