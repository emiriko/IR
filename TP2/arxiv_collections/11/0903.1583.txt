This report is dedicated to the investigation of radiative neutron decay. The
theoretical spectrum of radiative gamma quanta, calculated within the framework
of the standard electroweak interaction model, is compared with our
experimental value of branching ratio (B.R.) for radiative neutron decay. It is
noted that the study of radiative branches of elementary particle decay
occupies a central place in the fundamental problem of searching for deviations
from the standard electroweak model. Particular attention is paid to analyzing
the results of the experiment conducted at the FRMII reactor of the Technical
University of Munich in 2005.
