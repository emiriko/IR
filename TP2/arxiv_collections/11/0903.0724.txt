We report on the realization of dynamical control of transport for ultra-cold
Sr88 atoms loaded in an accelerated and amplitude-modulated 1D optical lattice.
We tailor the energy dispersion of traveling wave packets and reversibly switch
between Wannier-Stark localization and driven transport based on coherent
tunneling. Within a Loschmidt-echo scheme where the atomic group velocities are
reversed at once, we demonstrate a novel mirror for matter waves working
independently of the momentum state and discuss possible applications to force
measurements at micrometric scales.
