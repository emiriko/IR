We find an interpretation of the recent finding that the central charge
density of the neutron is negative by using models of generalized parton
distributions at zero skewness to relate the behavior of deep inelastic
scattering quark distributions, evaluated at large values of Bjorken x, to the
transverse charge density evaluated at small distances. The key physical input
of these models is the Drell-Yan-West relation We find that the d quarks
dominate the neutron structure function for large values of Bjorken x, where
the large longitudinal momentum of the struck quark has a significant impact on
determining the center-of-momentum of the system, and thus the "center" of the
nucleon in the transverse position plane.
