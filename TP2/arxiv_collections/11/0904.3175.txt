This article presents a review of the current state of the art in the
research field of cold and ultracold molecules. It serves as an introduction to
the Special Issue of the New Journal of Physics on Cold and Ultracold Molecules
and describes new prospects for fundamental research and technological
development. Cold and ultracold molecules may revolutionize physical chemistry
and few body physics, provide techniques for probing new states of quantum
matter, allow for precision measurements of both fundamental and applied
interest, and enable quantum simulations of condensed-matter phenomena.
Ultracold molecules offer promising applications such as new platforms for
quantum computing, precise control of molecular dynamics, nanolithography, and
Bose-enhanced chemistry. The discussion is based on recent experimental and
theoretical work and concludes with a summary of anticipated future directions
and open questions in this rapidly expanding research field.
