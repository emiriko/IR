We report on the temperature and field driven metal-insulator transition in
disordered Ge:Mn magnetic semiconductors accompanied by magnetic ordering,
magnetoresistance reaching thousands of percents and suppression of the
extraordinary Hall effect by a magnetic field. Magnetoresistance isotherms are
shown to obey a universal scaling law with a single scaling parameter depending
on temperature and fabrication. We argue that the strong magnetic disorder
leads to localization of charge carriers and is the origin of the unusual
properties of Ge:Mn alloys.
