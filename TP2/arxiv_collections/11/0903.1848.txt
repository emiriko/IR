We describe the weak localization correction to conductivity in ultra-thin
graphene films, taking into account disorder scattering and the influence of
trigonal warping of the Fermi surface. A possible manifestation of the chiral
nature of electrons in the localization properties is hampered by trigonal
warping, resulting in a suppression of the weak anti-localization effect in
monolayer graphene and of weak localization in bilayer graphene. Intervalley
scattering due to atomically sharp scatterers in a realistic graphene sheet or
by edges in a narrow wire tends to restore weak localization resulting in
negative magnetoresistance in both materials.
