Using numerical simulation, Holmstrom et al. (2008) proposed a plausible
alternative explanation of the observed Lyman-alpha absorption that was seen
during the transit of HD 209458b (Vidal-Madjar et al. 2003). They conclude that
radiation pressure alone cannot explain the observations and that a peculiar
stellar wind is needed. Here we show that radiation pressure alone can in fact
produce the observed high-velocity hydrogen atoms. We also emphasize that even
if the stellar wind is responsible for the observed hydrogen, to have a
sufficient number of atoms for charge exchange with stellar wind, the energetic
neutral atom (ENA) model also needs a significant escape from the planet
atmosphere of similar amplitude as quoted in Vidal-Madjar et al.(2003).
