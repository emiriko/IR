The relation between speed and density is connected with every
self-organization phenomenon of pedestrian dynamics and offers the opportunity
to analyze them quantitatively. But even for the simplest systems, like
pedestrian streams in corridors, this fundamental relation isn't completely
understood. Specifications of this characteristic in guidelines and text books
differ considerably reflecting the contradictory database and the controversial
discussion documented in the literature. In this contribution it is studied
whether cultural influences and length of the corridor can be the causes for
these deviations. To reduce as much as possible unintentioned effects, a system
is chosen with reduced degrees of freedom and thus the most simple system,
namely the movement of pedestrians along a line under closed boundary
conditions. It is found that the speed of Indian test persons is less dependent
on density than the speed of German test persons. Surprisingly the more
unordered behaviour of the Indians is more effective than the ordered behaviour
of the Germans. Without any statistical measure one cannot conclude about
whether there are differences or not. By hypothesis test it is found
quantitatively that these differences exist, suggesting cultural differences in
the fundamental diagram of pedestrians.
