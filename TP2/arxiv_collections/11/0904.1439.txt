We propose an explanatory and computational theory of transformative
discoveries in science. The theory is derived from a recurring theme found in a
diverse range of scientific change, scientific discovery, and knowledge
diffusion theories in philosophy of science, sociology of science, social
network analysis, and information science. The theory extends the concept of
structural holes from social networks to a broader range of associative
networks found in science studies, especially including networks that reflect
underlying intellectual structures such as co-citation networks and
collaboration networks. The central premise is that connecting otherwise
disparate patches of knowledge is a valuable mechanism of creative thinking in
general and transformative scientific discovery in particular.
