The first multifrequency radio observations of the very compact BAL quasar,
1045+352, were made using MERLIN and the VLBA in a snapshot mode. However, its
unusual radio structure was still very difficult to interpret, indicating a
scenario of intermittent activity or a jet precession. Here, we present some of
a new full-track radio observations of 1045+352 made with the EVN+MERLIN at 5
GHz. The new more sensitive high-resolution observations made possible to trace
the connection between the arcsecond structure and the radio core, and showed
the presence of strong interactions between the jet and the medium of the host
galaxy.
