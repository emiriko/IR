We present a comparison of the two-body invariant mass distributions for the
pp -> ppeta and pp -> ppeta-prime reactions, both measured at a nominal excess
energy value of Q = 15.5 MeV. For the pp -> ppeta reaction, in addition, the
differential cross sections were extracted for an excess energy of Q = 10 MeV.
The comparison of the results for the eta and eta-prime meson production rather
excludes the hypothesis that the enhancement observed in the invariant mass
distributions is due to the interaction of the meson and the proton.
