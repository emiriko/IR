We present a theory for spin-polarized transport through a generic organic
polymer connected to ferromagnetic leads with arbitrary angle theta between
their magnetization directions, taking into account the polaron and bipolaron
states as effective charge and spin carriers. Within a diffusive description of
polaron-bipolaron transport including polaron-bipolaron conversion, we find
that the bipolaron density depends on the angle theta. This is remarkable,
given the fact that bipolarons are spinless quasiparticles, and opens a new way
to probe spin accumulation in organic polymers.
