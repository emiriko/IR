The hypothesis that short GRBs arise from the coalescence of binary compact
stars has recently gained support. With this comes the expectation that the
afterglow should bear the characteristic signature of a tenuous intergalactic
medium (IGM). However, fits to the observational data suggest that some
detected afterglows arise in relatively dense gaseous environments rather than
in the low density IGM. Here we show that considering the effect of red giant
winds in the core of a star cluster may resolve this paradox if short GRB
progenitors are contained in such an environment and close encounters rather
than pure gravitational wave emission brings the compact objects together.
Clear confirmation is provided here of the important notion that the morphology
and visibility of short gamma-ray burst remnants are determined largely by the
state of the gas in the cluster's core.
