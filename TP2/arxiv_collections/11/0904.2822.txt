Non-mesonic decay of kaonic nuclei is investigated under a Lambda(1405)
doorway picture where the Kbar absorptions in nuclei take place through the
Lambda(1405) resonance. Calculating Lambda(1405) N to YN transitions in
one-meson exchange, we find that the non-mesonic decay ratio Gamma_{Lambda N} /
Gamma_{Sigma^{0} N} depends strongly on the ratio of the couplings
Lambda(1405)-Kbar N and Lambda(1405)-pi Sigma. Especially a larger
Lambda(1405)-Kbar N coupling leads to enhancement of the decay to Lambda N.
Using the chiral unitary approach for description of the Kbar N amplitudes, we
obtain Gamma_{Lambda N} / Gamma_{Sigma ^{0} N} \approx 1.2 almost independently
of the nucleon density, and find the total two-nucleon absorption of the Kbar
in uniform nuclear matter to be 22 MeV at the normal density.
