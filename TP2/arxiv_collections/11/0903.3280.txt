When a gravitational wave at microwave frequencies impinges on a thin, type I
superconducting film, the radical delocalization of the film's negatively
charged Cooper pairs, which is due to the Uncertainty Principle, causes them to
undergo non-geodesic motion relative to the geodesic motion of the decohered,
positively charged ions in the film's lattice, which is due to the Equivalence
Principle. The ensuing charge separation leads to a virtual plasma excitation.
This "Heisenberg-Coulomb" effect enormously enhances the interaction of a
gravitational wave with a superconductor relative to that of normal matter, so
that the wave will be reflected even from a very thin superconducting film.
This result is presented using the BCS theory and a superconducting plasma
model.
