By making use of the quantization rule of Raab and Friedrich [P. Raab and H.
Friedrich, Phys. Rev. A 78, 022707 (2008)], we derive simple and accurate
formulae for the number of rotational states supported by a weakly-bound
vibrational level of a diatomic molecule and the rotational constants of any
such levels up to the threshold, and provide a criterion for determining
whether a given weakly-bound vibrational level is rotationless. The results
depend solely on the long-range part of the molecular potential and are
applicable to halo molecules.
