Spatially homogeneous random walks in $(\mathbb{Z}_{+})^{2}$ with non-zero
jump probabilities at distance at most 1, with non-zero drift in the interior
of the quadrant and absorbed when reaching the axes are studied. Absorption
probabilities generating functions are obtained and the asymptotic of
absorption probabilities along the axes is made explicit. The asymptotic of the
Green functions is computed along all different infinite paths of states, in
particular along those approaching the axes.
