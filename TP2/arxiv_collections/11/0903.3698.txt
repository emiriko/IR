We will consider an explicit birational map between a quadric and the
projective variety X(J) of traceless rank one elements in a simple reduced
Jordan algebra J. X(J) is a homogeneous G-variety for the automorphism group
G=Aut(J). We will show that the birational map is a blow up followed by a blow
down. This will allow us to use the blow up formula for motives together with
Vishik's work on the motives of quadrics to give a motivic decomposition of
X(J).
