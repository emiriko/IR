We derive a model-independent integral formula for chiral susceptibility and
attempt to present a continuum model study of it within the framework of
Dyson-Schwinger Equations. An appropriate regularization is implemented to
remove the temperature-independent quadratic divergence inherent in this
quantity. While it demonstrates a second-order phase transition characteristic
in the chiral limit, the result obtained supports a crossover at physical
current quark masses, which is in good agreement with recent lattice studies.
