In this work, we present the following important results: 1) We introduce a
new Si source, liquid SiCl4, which is free of C, to significantly enhance the
irreversibility field (Hirr), the upper critical field (Hc2), and the critical
current density (Jc), with little reduction in the critical temperature (Tc).
2) Although Si can not incorporate into the crystal lattice, we found a
reduction in the a-axis lattice parameter, to the same extent as for carbon
doping. 3) The SiCl4 treated MgB2 shows much higher Jc with superior field
dependence above 20 K than undoepd MgB2 and MgB2 doped with various carbon
sources. 3) We provide an alternative interpretation for the reduction of the a
lattice parameter in C- and non-C doped MgB2. 4). We introduce a new parameter,
RHH (Hc2/Hirr), which can clearly reflect the degree of flux pinning
enhancement, providing us with guidance for further enhancing Jc. 5) We have
found that spatial variation in the charge carrier mean free path is
responsible for the flux pinning mechanism in the SiCl4 treated MgB2 with large
in-field Jc.
