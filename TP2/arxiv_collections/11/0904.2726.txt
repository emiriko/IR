Using the categorical description of supergeometry we give an explicit
construction of the diffeomorphism supergroup of a compact finite-dimensional
supermanifold. The construction provides the diffeomorphism supergroup with the
structure of a Frechet supermanifold. In addition, we derive results about the
structure of diffeomorphism supergroups.
