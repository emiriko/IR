Neutrinos of energy about 5-20 MeV are produced due to the stellar collapse
or merger events that trigger the Gamma-Ray Burst. Also low energy MeV
neutrinos are produced within the fireball due to electron positron
annihilation and nucleonic bremsstrahlung. Many of these neutrinos will
propagate through the dense and relativistic magnetized plasma of the fireball.
We have studied the possibility of resonant oscillation of
$\nu_e\leftrightarrow \nu_{\mu,\tau}$ by taking into account the neutrino
oscillation parameters from SNO, SuperKamiokande and Liquid Scintillator
Detector. Using the resonance condition we have calculated the resonance length
for these neutrinos and also the fireball observables like lepton asymmetry and
the baryon load are estimated based on the assumed fireball radius of 100 Km.
