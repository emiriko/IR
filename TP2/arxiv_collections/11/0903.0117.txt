The derivative polynomials for the hyperbolic and trigonometric tangent,
cotangent and secant are found in explicit form, where the coefficients are
given in terms of Stirling numbers of the second kind. As application, some
integrals are evaluated and the reflection formula for the polygamma function
is written in explicit form.
