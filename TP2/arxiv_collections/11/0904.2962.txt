This Chapter gives a brief introduction to some basic aspects metals and
superconductors in crystal without inversion symmetry. In a first part we
analyze some normal state properties which arise through antisymmetric
spin-orbit coupling existing in non-centrosymmetric materials and show its
influence on the de Haas-van Alphen effect. For the superconducting phase we
introduce a multi-band formulation which naturally arises due the spin
splitting of the bands by spin-orbit coupling. It will then be shown how the
states can be symmetry classified and their relation to the original
classification in even-parity spin-singlet and odd-parity spin-triplet pairing
states. The general Ginzburg-Landau functional will be derived and applied to
the nucleation of superconductivity in a magnetic field. It will be shown that
magneto-electric effects can modify the standard paramagnetic limiting behavior
drastically.
