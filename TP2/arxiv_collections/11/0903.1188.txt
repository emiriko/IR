In this paper we introduce (weakly) root graded Banach--Lie algebras and
corresponding Lie groups as natural generalizations of group like $\GL_n(A)$
for a Banach algebra $A$ or groups like $C(X,K)$ of continuous maps of a
compact space $X$ into a complex semisimple Lie group $K$. We study holomorphic
induction from holomorphic Banach representations of so-called parabolic
subgroups $P$ to representations of $G$ on holomorphic sections of homogeneous
vector bundles over $G/P$. One of our main results is an algebraic
characterization of the space of sections which is used to show that this space
actually carries a natural Banach structure, a result generalizing the finite
dimensionality of spaces of sections of holomorphic bundles over compact
complex manifolds. We also give a geometric realization of any irreducible
holomorphic representation of a (weakly) root graded Banach--Lie group $G$ and
show that all holomorphic functions on the spaces $G/P$ are constant.
