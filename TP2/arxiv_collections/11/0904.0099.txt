This paper deals with some thermodynamical aspects of Lorentzian wormholes,
including the formulation of the three main laws and the consideration of a
possible thermal emission made up of some sort of phantom radiation coming out
from the wormhole at a negative temperature. In order for these topics to be
consistently developed we have used a 2+2 formalism first advanced by Hayward
for spherically symmetric space-times, where a generalized surface gravity is
defined on the trapping horizon. Our results generalize still further those of
the already generalized gravitational thermodynamics.
