The exact solution of a quantum Bethe lattice model in the thermodynamic
limit amounts to solve a functional self-consistent equation. In this paper we
obtain this equation for the Bose-Hubbard model on the Bethe lattice, under two
equivalent forms. The first one, based on a coherent state path integral, leads
in the large connectivity limit to the mean field treatment of Fisher et al.
[Phys. Rev. B {\bf 40}, 546 (1989)] at the leading order, and to the bosonic
Dynamical Mean Field Theory as a first correction, as recently derived by
Byczuk and Vollhardt [Phys. Rev. B {\bf 77}, 235106 (2008)]. We obtain an
alternative form of the equation using the occupation number representation,
which can be easily solved with an arbitrary numerical precision, for any
finite connectivity. We thus compute the transition line between the superfluid
and Mott insulator phases of the model, along with thermodynamic observables
and the space and imaginary time dependence of correlation functions. The
finite connectivity of the Bethe lattice induces a richer physical content with
respect to its infinitely connected counterpart: a notion of distance between
sites of the lattice is preserved, and the bosons are still weakly mobile in
the Mott insulator phase. The Bethe lattice construction can be viewed as an
approximation to the finite dimensional version of the model. We show indeed a
quantitatively reasonable agreement between our predictions and the results of
Quantum Monte Carlo simulations in two and three dimensions.
