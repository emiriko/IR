Understanding the importance that the electronic medical health records
system has, with its various structural types and grades, has led to the
elaboration of a series of standards and quality control methods, meant to
control its functioning. In time, the electronic health records system has
evolved along with the medical data change of structure. Romania has not yet
managed to fully clarify this concept, various definitions still being
encountered, such as "Patient's electronic chart", "Electronic health file". A
slow change from functional interoperability (OSI level 6) to semantic
interoperability (level 7) is being aimed at the moment. This current article
will try to present the main electronic files models, from a functional
interoperability system's possibility to be created perspective.
