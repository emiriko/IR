We are entering an era where a number of large-scale lattice simulations of
four-dimensional supersymmetric theories are under way. Moreover, proposals for
how to approach such studies continue to progress. One particular line of
research in this direction is described here. General actions for super-QCD,
including counterterms required on the lattice, are given. We obtain the number
of fine-tunings that is required, once gauge and flavor symmetries are
accounted for, provided Ginsparg-Wilson fermions are used for the gauginos. We
also review and extend our recent work on lattice formulations of N=4
super-Yang-Mills and N=1 super-Yang-Mills that exploit Ginsparg-Wilson
fermions.
