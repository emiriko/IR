If interpreted in terms of decaying dark matter, the steep rise in the
positron fraction of cosmic rays above 10 GeV, as observed by the PAMELA
experiment, suggests an underlying production mechanism that favors leptonic
channels. We consider a scenario where a portion of the dark matter is made of
the gauginos of an unbroken hidden-sector U(1), which interact with the visible
sector only through a tiny kinetic mixing. The second component of the dark
matter is made of neutralinos, and depending on the mass spectrum, the lightest
neutralino or the hidden gaugino becomes unstable and subject to decay. We
analyze the cosmic rays, namely the contributions to the positron, the
extragalactic gamma-ray and the antiproton flux, which potentially result from
these decays and demonstrate that the production of antiprotons can be
naturally suppressed. Furthermore, we briefly discuss the apparent double-peak
structure of the ATIC data in light of cascade-decaying hidden gauginos, as
well as possible signatures at Fermi.
