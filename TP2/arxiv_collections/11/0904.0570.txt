We study the derivational complexity induced by the dependency pair method,
enhanced with standard refinements. We obtain upper bounds on the derivational
complexity induced by the dependency pair method in terms of the derivational
complexity of the base techniques employed. In particular we show that the
derivational complexity induced by the dependency pair method based on some
direct technique, possibly refined by argument filtering, the usable rules
criterion, or dependency graphs, is primitive recursive in the derivational
complexity induced by the direct method. This implies that the derivational
complexity induced by a standard application of the dependency pair method
based on traditional termination orders like KBO, LPO, and MPO is exactly the
same as if those orders were applied as the only termination technique.
