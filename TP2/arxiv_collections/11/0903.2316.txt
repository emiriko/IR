We use the soft-wall AdS/QCD model to investigate the finite-temperature
effects on the spectral function in the vector channel. The dissociation of the
vector meson tower onto the AdS black hole leads to the in-medium mass shift
and the width broadening in a way similar to the lattice QCD results for the
heavy quarkonium at finite temperature. We also show the momentum dependence of
the spectral function and find it consistent with screening in a hot wind.
