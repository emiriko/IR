Image processing can be used for digital restoration of ancient papyri, that
is, for a restoration performed on their digital images. The digital
manipulation allows reducing the background signals and enhancing the
readability of texts. In the case of very old and damaged documents, this is
fundamental for identification of the patterns of letters. Some examples of
restoration, obtained with an image processing which uses edges detection and
Fourier filtering, are shown. One of them concerns 7Q5 fragment of the Dead Sea
Scrolls.
