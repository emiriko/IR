Recently the inverse magnetocaloric effect is observed for different
compounds. However there is very rare for any manifestation of the effect to be
seen in manganites. We have found inverse magnetocaloric effect in the case of
polycrystalline La$_{0.125}$Ca$_{0.875}$MnO$_{3}$. Such phenomenon is
attributed to the stabilization of antiferromagnetic state associated with
inherent magnetic inhomogeneous phases for this compound.
