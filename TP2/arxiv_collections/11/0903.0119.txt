The ARGO-YBJ (Astrophysical Radiation Ground-based Observatory at YangBaJing)
experiment is designed for very high energy $\gamma$-astronomy and cosmic ray
researches. Due to the full coverage of a large area ($5600 m^2$) with
resistive plate chambers at a very high altitude (4300 m a.s.l.), the ARGO-YBJ
detector is used to search for transient phenomena, such as Gamma-ray bursts
(GRBs). Because the ARGO-YBJ detector has a large field of view ($\sim$2 sr)
and is operated with a high duty cycle ($>$90%), it is well suited for GRB
surveying and can be operated in searches for high energy GRBs following alarms
set by satellite-borne observations at lower energies. In this paper, the
sensitivity of the ARGO-YBJ detector for GRB detection is estimated. Upper
limits to fluence with 99% confidence level for 26 GRBs inside the field of
view from June 2006 to January 2009 are set in the two energy ranges 10$-$100
GeV and 10 GeV$-$1 TeV.
