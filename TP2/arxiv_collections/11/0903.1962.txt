The gravity fields and rotation curves of whirlpool galaxies with thin disc
distribution of material are calculated numerically. It is proved that the
gravity field of mass thin disc distribution is greatly different from that of
spherically symmetrical distribution. As long as the Newtonian theory of
gravity is used strictly, by the proper mass distributions of thin discs, the
flat rotation curves of whirlpool galaxies can be explained well. The rotating
curve of the Milky Galaxy is obtained which coincides with practical
observation. In this way, it is unnecessary for us to suppose the existence of
additional dark material in the illuminant discs of whirlpool galaxy again.
Meanwhile, in the space outside the illuminant disc, the quantity of dark
material needed to maintain the flatness of rotation curves is greatly
decreased. By considering the observation fact that the quantity of
non-luminous baryon material is 3~10 times more than luminous material, we can
explain the flatness of rotation curves of whirlpool galaxies well without the
hypotheses of non-baryon dark material. So it is unnecessary for us to suppose
that non-baryon dark material is about 5 times more than baryon material in a
single whirlpool galaxy, no mater whether non-baryon dark material exits or
not.
