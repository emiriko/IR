Circular microresonators (microdisks) are micron sized dielectric disks
embedded in a material of lower refractive index. They possess modes with
complex eigenvalues (resonances) which are solutions of analytically given
transcendental equations. The behavior of such eigenvalues in the small opening
limit, i.e. when the refractive index of the cavity goes to infinity, is
analysed. This analysis allows one to clearly distinguish between internal
(Feshbach) and external (shape) resonant modes for both TM and TE
polarizations. This is especially important for TE polarization for which
internal and external resonances can be found in the same region of the complex
wavenumber plane. It is also shown that for both polarizations, the internal as
well as external resonances can be classified by well defined azimuthal and
radial modal indices.
