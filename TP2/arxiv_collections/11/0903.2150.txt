It has been argued recently that parton showers based on colour dipoles
conflict with collinear factorization and do not lead to the correct DGLAP
equation. We show that this conclusion is based on an inappropriate assumption,
namely the choice of the gluon energy as evolution variable. We further show
numerically that Monte Carlo programs based on dipole showers with "infrared
sensible" evolution variables reproduce the DGLAP equation both in asymptotic
form as well as in comparison to the leading behaviour of second-order QCD
matrix elements.
