We use c-axis resistivity and magnetoresistance measurements to study the
interplay between antiferromagnetic (AF) and superconducting (SC) ordering in
underdoped RBa_2Cu_3O_{6+x} (R = Lu, Y) single crystals. Both orders are found
to emerge from an anisotropic 3D metallic state, upon which antiferromagnetism
opposes superconductivity by driving the doped holes towards localization.
Despite the competition, the superconductivity sets in before the AF order is
completely destroyed and coexists with latter in a certain range of hole
doping. We find also that strong magnetic fields affect the AF-SC interplay by
both suppressing the superconductivity and stabilizing the Neel order.
