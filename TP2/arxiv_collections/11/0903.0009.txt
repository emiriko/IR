Entanglement and non-locality are non-classical global characteristics of
quantum states important to the foundations of quantum mechanics. Recent
investigations have shown that environmental noise, even when it is entirely
local in influence, can destroy both of these properties in finite time despite
giving rise to full quantum state decoherence only in the infinite time limit.
These investigations, which have been carried out in a range of theoretical and
experimental situations, are reviewed here.
