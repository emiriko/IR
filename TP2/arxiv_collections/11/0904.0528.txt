The energy spectrum of cosmic rays (CR) exhibits power-like behavior with a
very characteristic "knee" structure. We consider a possibility that such a
spectrum could be generated by some specific nonstatistical temperature
fluctuations in the source of CR with the "knee" structure reflecting an abrupt
change of the pattern of such fluctuations. This would result in a generalized
nonextensive statistical model for the production of CR. The possible physical
mechanisms leading to these effects are discussed together with the resulting
chemical composition of the CR, which follows the experimentally observed
abundance of nuclei.
