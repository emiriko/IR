We summarize the top-quark mass measurements from the CDF and D0 experiments
at Fermilab. We combine published Run I (1992-1996) measurements with the most
recent preliminary Run II (2001-present) measurements using up to 3.6 fb-1 of
data per experiment. Taking correlated uncertainties properly into account the
resulting preliminary world average mass of the top quark is Mt = 173.1 +/- 0.6
(stat.) +/- 1.1 (syst.) GeV/c2, assuming Gaussian systematic uncertainties.
Adding in quadrature yields a total uncertainty of 1.3 GeV/c2, corresponding to
a relative precision of 0.75% on the top-quark mass.
