Renyi entropy associated with spin tomograms of quantum states is shown to
obey to new inequalities containing the dependence on quantum Fourier
transform. The limiting inequality for the von Neumann entropy of spin quantum
states and a new kind of entropy associated with quantum Fourier transform are
obtained. Possible connections with subadditivity and strong subadditivity
conditions for tomographic entropies and von Neumann entropies are discussed.
