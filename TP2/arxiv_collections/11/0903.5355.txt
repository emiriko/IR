High-contrast imaging of extrasolar planet candidates around a main-sequence
star has recently been realized from the ground using current adaptive optics
(AO) systems. Advancing such observations will be a task for the Gemini Planet
Imager, an upcoming "extreme" AO instrument. High-order "tweeter" and low-order
"woofer" deformable mirrors (DMs) will supply a >90%-Strehl correction, a
specialized coronagraph will suppress the stellar flux, and any planets can
then be imaged in the "dark hole" region. Residual wavefront error scatters
light into the DM-controlled dark hole, making planets difficult to image above
the noise. It is crucial in this regard that the high-density tweeter, a
micro-electrical mechanical systems (MEMS) DM, have sufficient stroke to deform
to the shapes required by atmospheric turbulence. Laboratory experiments were
conducted to determine the rate and circumstance of saturation, i.e. stroke
insufficiency. A 1024-actuator 1.5-um-stroke MEMS device was empirically tested
with software Kolmogorov-turbulence screens of r_0=10-15cm. The MEMS when
solitary suffered saturation ~4% of the time. Simulating a woofer DM with ~5-10
actuators across a 5-m primary mitigated MEMS saturation occurrence to a
fraction of a percent. While no adjacent actuators were saturated at opposing
positions, mid-to-high-spatial-frequency stroke did saturate more frequently
than expected, implying that correlations through the influence functions are
important. Analytical models underpredict the stroke requirements, so empirical
studies are important.
