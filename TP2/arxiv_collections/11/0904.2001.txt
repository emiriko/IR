We analyze new diffuse gamma-ray data from the Fermi Gamma-ray Space
Telescope, which do not confirm an excess in the EGRET data at galactic
mid-latitudes, in combination with measurements of electron and positron fuxes
from PAMELA, Fermi and HESS within the context of three possible sources: dark
matter (DM) annihilation or decay into charged leptons, and a continuum
distribution of pulsars. We allow for variations in the backgrounds, consider
several DM halo profiles, and account for systematic uncertainties in data
where possible. We find that all three scenarios represent the data well. The
pulsar description holds for a wide range of injection energy spectra. We
compare with ATIC data and the WMAP haze where appropriate, but do not fit
these data since the former are discrepant with Fermi data and the latter are
subject to large systematic uncertainties. We show that for cusped halo
profiles, Fermi could observe a spectacular gamma-ray signal of DM annihilation
from the galactic center while seeing no excess at mid-latitudes.
