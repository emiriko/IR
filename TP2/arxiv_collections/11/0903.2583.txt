We describe a film of highly-aligned single-walled carbon nanotubes that acts
as an excellent terahertz linear polarizer. There is virtually no attenuation
(strong absorption) when the terahertz polarization is perpendicular (parallel)
to the nanotube axis. From the data we calculated the reduced linear dichrosim
to be 3, corresponding to a nematic order parameter of 1, which demonstrates
nearly perfect alignment as well as intrinsically anisotropic terahertz
response of single-walled carbon nanotubes in the film.
