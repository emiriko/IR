The geometric frustration in a class of the mixed spin-1/2 and spin-S
Ising-Heisenberg diamond chains is investigated by combining three exact
analytical techniques: Kambe projection method, decoration-iteration
transformation and transfer-matrix method. The ground state, the magnetization
process and the specific heat as a function of the external magnetic field are
particularly examined for different strengths of the geometric frustration. It
is shown that the increase of the Heisenberg spin value S raises the number of
intermediate magnetization plateaux, which emerge in magnetization curves
provided that the ground state is highly degenerate on behalf of a sufficiently
strong geometric frustration. On the other hand, all intermediate magnetization
plateaux merge into a linear magnetization versus magnetic field dependence in
the limit of classical Heisenberg spin S -> infinity. The enhanced
magnetocaloric effect with cooling rate exceeding the one of paramagnetic salts
is also detected when the disordered frustrated phase constitutes the ground
state and the external magnetic field is small enough.
