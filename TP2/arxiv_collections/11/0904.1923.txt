A permutation graph is an intersection graph of segments lying between two
parallel lines. A Seidel complementation of a finite graph at one of it vertex
$v$ consists to complement the edges between the neighborhood and the
non-neighborhood of $v$. Two graphs are Seidel complement equivalent if one can
be obtained from the other by a successive application of Seidel
complementation.
  In this paper we introduce the new concept of Seidel complementation and
Seidel minor, we then show that this operation preserves cographs and the
structure of modular decomposition. The main contribution of this paper is to
provide a new and succinct characterization of permutation graphs i.e. A graph
is a permutation graph \Iff it does not contain the following graphs: $C_5$,
$C_7$, $XF_{6}^{2}$, $XF_{5}^{2n+3}$, $C_{2n}, n\geqslant6$ and their
complement as Seidel minor. In addition we provide a $O(n+m)$-time algorithm to
output one of the forbidden Seidel minor if the graph is not a permutation
graph.
