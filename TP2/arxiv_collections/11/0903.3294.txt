We investigate the total effect of correlations on photoionization of atomic
shells with nonzero orbital momentum, in the nonrelativistic high energy
asymptotic limit, considering the exclusive case of the dominant final state of
an initial neutral atom. We find that the substantial cancellation of the
dominant intra-shell carrelations, which had been reported earlier, can be
understood utilizing the closure properties satisfied by the eigen functions of
the nonrelativistic Hamiltonian. Considering the sum of correlations with all
states, occupied or not, we show that complete sum is equal to the contribution
of the high energy part of the continuum. Consequently there is a total
cancellation between the contributions of the bound states and the low energy
part of the continuum states. This means that the real correlations in the
physical atom can be obtained as the negative of the total contribution of low
energy states and continuum unoccupied states. We calculate this in framework
of the quantum defect number. The approach allows us to see that the dominant
intrashell correlation is going to be cancelled. We can also obtain some limits
on the correlation effects by considering calculations with the screened
Coulomb functions. The role of correlations in the exclusive photoionization
processes is discussed.
