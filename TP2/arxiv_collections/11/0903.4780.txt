The design, fabrication, and optical properties of a composite plasmonic
structure, a two-dimentional array of split-ring resonators inserted into
periodic square holes of a metal film, have been reported. A new type of
transmission resonance, which makes a significant difference from the
conventional peaks, has been suggested both theoretically and experimentally.
To understand this effect, a mechanism of ring- resonance induced dipole
emission is proposed.
