We identify a sample of 74 high-redshift quasars (z>3) with weak emission
lines from the Fifth Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and present
infrared, optical, and radio observations of a subsample of four objects at
z>4. These weak emission-line quasars (WLQs) constitute a prominent tail of the
Lya+NV equivalent width distribution, and we compare them to quasars with more
typical emission-line properties and to low-redshift active galactic nuclei
with weak/absent emission lines, namely BL Lac objects. We find that WLQs
exhibit hot (T~1000 K) thermal dust emission and have rest-frame 0.1-5 micron
spectral energy distributions that are quite similar to those of normal
quasars. The variability, polarization, and radio properties of WLQs are also
different from those of BL Lacs, making continuum boosting by a relativistic
jet an unlikely physical interpretation. The most probable scenario for WLQs
involves broad-line region properties that are physically distinct from those
of normal quasars.
