We have revealed from a numerical study that the optical Hall conductivity
$\sigma_{xy}(\omega)$ has a characteristic feature even in the ac ($\sim$ THz)
regime in that the Hall plateaus are retained both in the ordinary
two-dimensional electron gas and in graphene in the quantum Hall (QHE) regime,
although the plateau height is no longer quantized in ac. In graphene
$\sigma_{xy}(\omega)$ reflects the unusual Landau level structure. The effect
remains unexpectedly robust against a significant strength of disorder, which
we attribute to an effect of localization. We predict the ac quantum Hall
measurements are feasible through the Faraday rotation characterized by the
fine-structure constant $\alpha$.
