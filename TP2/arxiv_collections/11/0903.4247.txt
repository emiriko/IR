The recently developed self consistent {\it ab initio} lattice dynamical
method (SCAILD) has been applied to the high temperature bcc phase of La and Th
which are dynamically unstable at low temperatures. The bcc phase of these
metals is found to be stabilized by phonon-phonon interactions. The calculated
high temperature phonon frequencies for La are found to be in good agreement
with the corresponding experimental data.
