One-loop amplitudes may be expanded in a basis of scalar integrals multiplied
by rational coefficients. We relate the coefficient of the one-point integral
to the coefficients of higher-point integrals, by considering the effects of
introducing an additional, unphysical propagator, subject to certain
conditions.
