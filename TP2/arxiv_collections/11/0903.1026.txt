Planar brushes formed by end-grafted semiflexible polyampholyte chains, each
chain containing equal number of positively and negatively charged monomers is
studied using molecular dynamics simulations. Keeping the length of the chains
fixed, dependence of the average brush thickness and equilibrium statistics of
the brush conformations on the grafting density and the salt concentration are
obtained with various sequences of charged monomers. When similarly charged
monomers of the chains are arranged in longer blocks, the average brush
thickness is smaller and dependence of brush properties on the grafting density
and the salt concentration is stronger. With such long blocks of similarly
charged monomers, the anchored chains bond to each other in the vicinity of the
grafting surface at low grafting densities and buckle toward the grafting
surface at high grafting densities.
