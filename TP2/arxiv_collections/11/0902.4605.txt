A novel approach for GW-based calculations of quasiparticle properties for
finite systems is presented, in which the screened interaction is obtained
directly from a linear response calculation of the density-density correlation
function. The conserving nature of our results is shown by explicit evaluation
of the $f$-sum rule. As an application, energy renormalizations and level
broadenings are calculated for the closed-shell Na$_9^+$ and Na$_{21}^+$
clusters, as well as for Na$_4$. Pronounced improvements of conserving
approximations to RPA-level results are obtained.
