We discuss possible connections between the thermostatistical properties of a
gas of the two-parameter deformed bosonic particles called Fibonacci
oscillators and the properties of the Tsallis thermostatistics. In this
framework, we particularly focus on a comparison of the non-extensive entropy
functions expressed by these two generalized theories. We also show that the
thermostatistics of the two-parameter deformed bosons can be studied by the
formalism of Fibonacci calculus, which generalizes the recently proposed
formalism by Lavagno and Narayana Swamy of q-calculus for the one-parameter
deformed boson gas. As an application, we briefly summarize some of the recent
results on the Bose-Einstein condensation phenomenon for the present
two-parameter generalized boson gas.
