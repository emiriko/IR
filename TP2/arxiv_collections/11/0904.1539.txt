Recent work on some kinds of interacting binaries is summarized, with
emphasis on Cataclysmic Variables, Algol-like variables and the recently
discovered Double Periodic Variables (DPVs). The sequence W Serpentids (very
massive with irregular variability and large mass loss) $\to$ DPVs (less
massive with regular variability and ciclic mass loss) $\to$ Algols (even less
massive with small mass loss) could correspond to an evolutionary sequence, and
illustrate the importance of the mass transfer rate in shaping observable and
mass loss properties for these systems.
