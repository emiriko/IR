In this paper we show how to extend the known algorithm of nodal analysis in
such a way that, in the case of circuits without nullors and controlled sources
(but allowing for both, independent current and voltage sources), the system of
nodal equations describing the circuit is partitioned into one part, where the
nodal variables are explicitly given as linear combinations of the voltage
sources and the voltages of certain reference nodes, and another, which
contains the node variables of these reference nodes only and which moreover
can be read off directly from the given circuit. Neither do we need
preparational graph transformations, nor do we need to introduce additional
current variables (as in MNA). Thus this algorithm is more accessible to
students, and consequently more suitable for classroom presentations.
