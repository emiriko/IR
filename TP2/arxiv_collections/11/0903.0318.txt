There have been observations, first from the MAGIC Telescope (July 2005) and
quite recently (September 2008) from the FERMI Satellite Telescope, on
non-simultaneous arrival of high-energy photons from distant celestial sources.
In each case, the highest energy photons were delayed, as compared to their
lower-energy counterparts. Although the astrophysics at the source of these
energetic photons is still not understood, and such non simultaneous arrival
might be due to non simultaneous emission as a result of conventional physics
effects, nevertheless, rather surprisingly, the observed time delays can also
fit excellently some scenarios in quantum gravity, predicting Lorentz violating
space-time "foam" backgrounds with a non-trivial subluminal vacuum refractive
index suppressed linearly by a quantum gravity scale of the order of the
reduced Planck mass. In this pedagogical talk, I discuss the MAGIC and FERMI
findings in this context and I argue on a theoretical model of space-time foam
in string/brane theory that can accommodate the findings of those experiments
in agreement with all other stringent tests of Lorentz invariance. However, I
stress the current ambiguities/uncertainties on the source mechanisms, which
need to be resolved first before definite conclusions are reached regarding
quantum gravity foam scenarios.
