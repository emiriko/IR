Heat capacity measurements with significantly improved resolution find the
presence of a peak in a solid 4He sample in coexistence with liquid. With
improved crystallinity, the peak decreases in height and moves to lower
temperature. A hysteretic heat capacity signature consistent with 3He-4He phase
separation, not detected in an earlier work is clearly observed.
