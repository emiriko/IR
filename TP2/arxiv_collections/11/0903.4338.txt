We perform a fully self-consistent 3-D numerical simulation for a
compressible, dissipative magneto-plasma driven by large-scale perturbations,
that contain a fairly broader spectrum of characteristic modes, ranging from
largest scales to intermediate scales and down to the smallest scales, where
the energy of the system are dissipated by collisional (Ohmic) and viscous
dissipations. Additionally, our simulation includes nonlinear interactions
amongst a wide range of fluctuations that are initialized with random spectral
amplitudes, leading to the cascade of spectral energy in the inertial range
spectrum, and takes into account large scale as well as small scale
perturbation that may have been induced by the background plasma fluctuations,
also the non adiabatic exchange of energy leading to the migration of energy
from the energy containing modes or randomly injected energy driven by
perturbations and further dissipated by the smaller scales. Besides
demonstrating the comparative decays of total energy and dissipation rate of
energy, our results show the existence of a perpendicular component of current,
thus clearly confirming that the self-organized state is non-force free.
