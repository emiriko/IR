It is investigated that the lateral shifts of the ballistic electrons
transmitted through a semiconductor quantum slabs can be negative as well as
positive, which are analogous to the anomalous lateral shifts of the
transmitted light beam through a dielectric slab. The necessary condition for
the shift to be negative is advanced. It is shown that the lateral shifts
depend not only on the structure parameters of semiconductor quantum slab, but
also on the incidence angle and the incident energy. Numerical calculations
further indicate that the lateral shifts can be tuned from negative to positive
by the external applied electric field. The voltage-tunable lateral shifts may
lead to potential applications in quantum electronic devices.
