We explore the hypothesis that some high-velocity runaway stars attain their
peculiar velocities in the course of exchange encounters between hard massive
binaries and a very massive star (either an ordinary 50-100 Msun star or a more
massive one, formed through runaway mergers of ordinary stars in the core of a
young massive star cluster). In this process, one of the binary components
becomes gravitationally bound to the very massive star, while the second one is
ejected, sometimes with a high speed. We performed three-body scattering
experiments and found that early B-type stars (the progenitors of the majority
of neutron stars) can be ejected with velocities of $\ga$ 200-400 km/s (typical
of pulsars), while 3-4 Msun stars can attain velocities of $\ga$ 300-400 km/s
(typical of the bound population of halo late B-type stars). We also found that
the ejected stars can occasionally attain velocities exceeding the Milky Ways's
escape velocity.
