Using the random matrix theory, we investigate the ensemble statistics of
edge transport of a quantum spin Hall insulator with multiple edge states in
the presence of quenched disorder. Dorokhov-Mello-Pereyra-Kumar equation
applicable for such a system is established. It is found that a two-dimensional
quantum spin Hall insulator is effectively a new type of one-dimensional (1D)
quantum conductor with the different ensemble statistics from that of the
ordinary 1D quantum conductor or the insulator with an even number of Kramers
edge pairs. The ensemble statistics provides a physical manifestation of the
Z2-classification for the time-reversal invariant insulators.
