The present work describes an immersion in 5D of the interior Schwarzschild
solution of the general relativity equations. The model theory is defined in
the context of a flat 5D space time matter Minkowski model, using a Tolman like
technique, which shows via Lorentz transformations that the solution is
compatible with homogeneity and isotropy,thus obeying the cosmological
principle. These properties permit one to consider the solution in terms of a
cosmological model. In this model, the Universe may be treated as an idealized
star with constant density and variable pressure, where each observer can be
the center of the same. The observed redshift appears as a static gravitational
effect which obeys the sufficiently verified and generally accepted square
distance law. The Buchdahl stability theorem establishes a limit of distance
observation with density dependence.
