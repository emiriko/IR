We have constructed, numerically, both regular and black hole static
solutions to the simplest possible gravitating Yang-Mills--Higgs (YMH) in $4p$
spacetime dimensions. The YMH systems consist of $2p-$th power curvature fields
without a Higgs potential. The gravitational systems consist of the `Ricci
scalar' of the $p-$th power of the Riemann curvature. In 4 spacetime dimensions
this is the usual Einstein-YMH (EYMH) studied in \cite{Breitenlohner:1991aa,
Breitenlohner:1994di}, whose qualitative results we emulate exactly.
