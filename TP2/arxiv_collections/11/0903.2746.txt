Coherence is a familiar concept in physics: It is the driving force behind
wavelike phenomena such as the diffraction of light. Moreover, wave-particle
duality implies that all quantum objects can exhibit coherence, and this
quantum coherence is crucial to understanding the behaviour of a plethora of
systems.
  In this article, which is written at an undergraduate level, we shall briefly
introduce what is meant by coherence in a well-known classical setting, before
going on to describe its quantum version. We will show that coherence is
important in describing the properties of solid-state nanosystems, and
especially quantum dots. Simple experiments that reveal the coherent nature of
matter - and how this leads to some very powerful applications - will be
described. Finally, we shall discuss the fragility of coherence and shall
introduce a method for describing decoherence in open quantum systems.
