The results of measurements of the production of neutron-rich nuclei by the
fragmentation of a 76-Ge beam are presented. The cross sections were measured
for a large range of nuclei including fifteen new isotopes that are the most
neutron-rich nuclides of the elements chlorine to manganese (50-Cl, 53-Ar,
55,56-K, 57,58-Ca, 59,60,61-Sc, 62,63-Ti, 65,66-V, 68-Cr, 70-Mn). The enhanced
cross sections of several new nuclei relative to a simple thermal evaporation
framework, previously shown to describe similar production cross sections,
indicates that nuclei in the region around 62-Ti might be more stable than
predicted by current mass models and could be an indication of a new island of
inversion similar to that centered on 31-Na.
