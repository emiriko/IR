One of the well known effects of the asymptotic freedom is splitting of the
leading-$\log$ BFKL pomeron into a series of isolated poles in complex angular
momentum plane. Following our earlier works we explore the phenomenological
consequences of the emerging BFKL-Regge factorized expansion for the small-$x$
charm ($F_2^c$) and beauty ($F_{2}^{b}$) structure functions of the proton. As
we found earlier,the color dipole approach to the BFKL dynamics predicts
uniquely decoupling of subleading hard BFKL exchanges from $F_2^c$ at
moderately large $Q^{2}$. We predicted precocious BFKL asymptotics of
$F_2^c(x,Q^2)$ with intercept of the rightmost BFKL pole
$\alpha_{\Pom}(0)-1=\Delta_{\Pom}\approx 0.4$. High-energy open beauty photo-
and electro-production probes the vacuum exchange at much smaller distances and
detects significant corrections to the BFKL asymptotics coming from the
subleading vacuum poles. In view of the accumulation of the experimental data
on small-$x$ $F_{2}^{c}$ and $F_{2}^{b}$ we extended our early predictions to
the kinematical domain covered by new HERA measurements.Our structure functions
obtained in 1999 agree well with the determination of both $F_2^c$ and $F_2^b$
by the H1 published in 2006 but contradict to very recent (2008, preliminary)
H1 results on $F_2^b$. We present also comparison of our early predictions for
the longitudinal structure function $F_L$ with recent H1 data (2008) taken at
very low Bjorken $x$. We comment on the electromagnetic corrections to the
Okun-Pomeranchuk theorem.
