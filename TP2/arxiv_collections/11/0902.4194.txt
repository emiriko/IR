We present a proposed design for a pair-breaking photodetector for
far-infrared and sub-millimeter radiation. Antenna-coupled radiation generates
quasiparticles in a superconducting absorber, the density of which are measured
using a single Cooper-pair box. Readout is performed using an electromagnetic
oscillator or a microwave resonator, which is well suited for frequency
multiplexing in large arrays. Theoretical limits to detector sensitivity are
discussed and modeled, with predicted sensitivities rivaling transition-edge
sensors and microwave kinetic inductance detectors. We anticipate that this
detector can be used to address key scientific goals in far-infrared and
sub-millimeter astronomy.
