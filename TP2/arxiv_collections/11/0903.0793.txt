Two blue compact dwarf galaxies Mkn 104 and I Zw 97 are studied
photometrically and spectroscopically. Mkn 104 is found to contain three
distinct bright star forming regions, whereas I Zw 97 is found to contain three
bright and two faint star forming regions. Medium resolution spectra of three
bright HII regions in the two galaxies were obtained. Estimation of oxygen
abundance in these regions yields a value equal to log(O/H)+12 = 8.5
(Z=Z_sun/2.7). Star formation rates in these star forming regions are
estimated. The highest star formation rate for I Zw 97 is found to be 0.04
M_sun/yr and for Mkn 104, it is 0.02 M_sun/yr. A U-B vs V-I colour-colour mixed
population model is created using the Starburst99 evolutionary model curves.
The spectrum of the bright star forming knot of I Zw 97 does not show any
strong signature of an underlying relatively older stellar population, but the
U-B vs V-I two colour diagram indicates a strong contribution of a ~500 Myr
population. The age of the underlying population of Mkn 104 using the U-B vs
V-I two colour diagram is estimated to be ~500 Myr. The surface brightness
profile of both the galaxies can be represented well by a two-component Sersic
profile consisting of a near exponential distribution and a Gaussian nuclear
starburst. I Zw 97 is a cometary blue compact dwarf galaxy where the underlying
low surface brightness (LSB) galaxy is a dwarf irregular observed during a
major stochastic enhancement of its otherwise moderate star formation activity.
Both these galaxies are very similar in their stellar content, showing an older
4 Gyr population, an intermediate 500 Myr population and the current burst of
star formation of age 5-13 Myr.
