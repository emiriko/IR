We present the design and evaluation of a quantum carry-lookahead adder
(QCLA) using measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC), called MBQCLA. QCLA
was originally designed for an abstract, concurrent architecture supporting
long-distance communication, but most realistic architectures heavily constrain
communication distances. The quantum carry-lookahead adder is faster than a
quantum ripple-carry adder; QCLA has logarithmic depth while ripple adders have
linear depth. MBQCLA utilizes MBQC's ability to transfer quantum states in unit
time to accelerate addition. MBQCLA breaks the latency limit of addition
circuits in nearest neighbor-only architectures : compared to the $\Theta(n)$
limit on circuit depth for linear nearest-neighbor architectures, it can reach
$\Theta(log n)$ depth. MBQCLA is an order of magnitude faster than a
ripple-carry adder when adding registers longer than 100 qubits, but requires a
cluster state that is an order of magnitude larger. The cluster state resources
can be classified as computation and communication; for the unoptimized form,
$\approx$ 88 % of the resources are used for communication. Hand optimization
of horizontal communication costs results in a $\approx$ 12% reduction in
spatial resources for the in-place MBQCLA circuit. For comparison, a graph
state quantum carry-lookahead adder (GSQCLA) uses only $\approx$ 9 % of the
spatial resources of the MBQCLA.
