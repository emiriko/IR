The linear-programming decoding performance of a binary linear code crucially
depends on the structure of the fundamental cone of the parity-check matrix
that describes the code. Towards a better understanding of fundamental cones
and the vectors therein, we introduce the notion of absdet-pseudo-codewords and
perm-pseudo-codewords: we give the definitions, we discuss some simple
examples, and we list some of their properties.
