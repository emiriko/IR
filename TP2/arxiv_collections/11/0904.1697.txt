A simple model is presented to explain the high Galactic latitude anomalies
in the WMAP data recently reported by Diego et al (2009). It is suggested that
the anomalous deviation from a thermal spectrum could be caused by the
propagation of background thermal radiation through a foreground optically thin
HII cloud. The background radiation may be the remnant of cooling radio lobes
associated with once-active jets from Sgr A*.
