By applying a hybrid Molecular dynamics and mesoscopic simulation technique,
we study the classic convection-diffusion problem of Taylor dispersion for
colloidal discs in confined flow. We carefully consider the time and
length-scales of the underlying colloidal system. These are, by computational
necessity, altered in the coarse-grained simulation method, but as long as this
is carefully managed, the underlying physics can be correctly interpreted. We
find that when the disc diameter becomes non-negligible compared to the
diameter of the pipe, there are important corrections to the original Taylor
picture. For example, the colloids can flow more rapidly than the underlying
fluid, and their Taylor dispersion coefficient is decreased. The long-time
tails in the velocity autocorrelation functions are altered by the Poiseuille
flow. Some of the conclusions about coarse-graining the dynamics of colloidal
suspensions are relevant for a wider range of complex fluids.
