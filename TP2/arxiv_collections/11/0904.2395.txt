We announce the public release of the 'dark' stellar evolution code
DarkStars. The code simultaneously solves the equations of WIMP capture and
annihilation in a star with those of stellar evolution assuming approximate
hydrostatic equilibrium. DarkStars includes the most extensive WIMP
microphysics of any dark evolution code to date. The code employs detailed
treatments of the capture process from a range of WIMP velocity distributions,
as well as composite WIMP distribution and conductive energy transport schemes
based on the WIMP mean-free path in the star. We give a brief description of
the input physics and practical usage of the code, as well as examples of its
application to dark stars at the Galactic centre.
