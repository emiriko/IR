The current very high energy (VHE; E>100GeV) experiments have tremendously
increased the number of detected extragalactic sources. We present a
synchrotron self-Compton modeling tour of the active galactic nuclei currently
established as VHE emitters so far, and investigate possible correlations among
the intrinsic and derived parameters.
