We propose a general one-dimensional {\em continuous} formulation to analyze
the vibrational modes of antenna-like nanomechanical resonators consisting of
two symmetric arrays of cantilevers affixed to a central nano-beam. The
cantilever arrays can have arbitrary density and length profile along the beam.
We obtain the secular equation that allows for the determination of their
frequency spectrum and illustrate the results on the particular examples of
structures with constant or alternating cantilever length profiles. We show
that our analytical results capture the vibration spectrum of such resonators
and elucidate key relationships that could prove advantageous for experimental
device performance. Furthermore, using a perturbative approach to treat the
nonlinear and dissipative dynamics of driven structures, we analyze the
anharmonic coupling between two specific widely spaced modes of the
coupled-element device, with direct application to experiments.
