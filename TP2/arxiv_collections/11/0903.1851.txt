Using test particle simulations we examine the structure of the outer
Galactic disk as it is perturbed by a satellite in a tight eccentric orbit
about the Galaxy. A satellite of mass a few times 10^9 Msol can heat the outer
Galactic disk, excite spiral structure and a warp and induce streams in the
velocity distribution. We examine particle eccentricity versus the change in
mean radius between initial and current orbits. Correlations between these
quantities are reduced after a few satellite pericenter passages. Stars born in
the outer galaxy can be moved in radius from their birth positions and be
placed in low eccentricity orbits inside their birth radii. We propose that
mergers and perturbations from satellite galaxies and subhalos can induce
radial mixing in the stellar metallicity distribution.
