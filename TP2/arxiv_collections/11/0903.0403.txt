In this note, we explore the Tevatron and LHC detection prospects for a
nonstandard Higgs whose decays contain both missing and visible energy. In
particular, we consider the decay $h \to \chi_2 \chi_1$ where $\chi_1$ is
stable and $\chi_2$ decay back to $\chi_1$ and additional visible particles. We
focus on adapting standard searches for both Higgses and supersymmetry to these
decays. In these channels, the Tevatron has little reach, but the LHC has good
prospects for decays that involve leptons or neutrinos. In particular, the
standard WW* search for a Higgs produced in vector boson fusion has the largest
reach. Trilepton searches and invisible Higgs searches are less powerful, but
can give corroborating evidence. However, such standard searches could become
inefficient for these signals if the analyses adopt model dependent tools such
as matrix elements and neural nets.
