Science is a fundamental human activity and we trust its results because it
has several error-correcting mechanisms. Its is subject to experimental tests
that are replicated by independent parts. Given the huge amount of information
available, scientists have to rely on the reports of others. This makes it
possible for social effects to influence the scientific community. Here, an
Opinion Dynamics agent model is proposed to describe this situation. The
influence of Nature through experiments is described as an external field that
acts on the experimental agents. We will see that the retirement of old
scientists can be fundamental in the acceptance of a new theory. We will also
investigate the interplay between social influence and observations. This will
allow us to gain insight in the problem of when social effects can have
negligible effects in the conclusions of a scientific community and when we
should worry about them.
