Observations of distinct positions in Orion and W3 revealed ripples on the
HCN(1-0), HCO^+(1-0) and CO(1-0) line profiles which can be result of emission
of large number of unresolved thermal clumps in the beam that move with random
velocities. The total number of such clumps are ~(0.4-4) 10^5 for the areas
with linear sizes ~0.1-0.5 pc.
