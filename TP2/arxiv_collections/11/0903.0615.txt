We outline the case for a comprehensive wide and deep survey ultimately
targeted at obtaining 21-cm HI line emission spectroscopic observations of more
than a billion galaxies to redshift z=1.5 and greater over half the sky. This
survey provides a database of galaxy redshifts, HI gas masses, and galaxy
rotation curves that would enable a wide range of science, including
fundamental cosmology and studies of Dark Energy. This science requires the
next generation of radio arrays, which are being designed under the umbrella of
the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) project. We present a science roadmap,
extending to 2020 and beyond, that would enable this ambitious survey. We also
place this survey in the context of other multi-wavelength surveys.
