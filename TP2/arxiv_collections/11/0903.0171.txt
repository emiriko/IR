We analyze the nearest neighbor spacing distributions of low-lying 2+ levels
of even-even nuclei. We grouped the nuclei into classes defined by the
quadrupole deformation parameter (Beta2). We calculate the nearest neighbor
spacing distributions for each class. Then, we determine the chaoticity
parameter for each class with the help of the Bayesian inference method. We
compare these distributions to a formula that describes the transition to chaos
by varying a tuning parameter. This parameter appears to depend in a
non-trivial way on the nuclear deformation, and takes small values indicating
regularity in strongly deformed nuclei and especially in those having an oblate
deformation.
