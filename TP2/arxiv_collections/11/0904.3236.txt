We study the Anderson model in which a configuration with a doublet is
hybridized with another with a singlet and a triplet. We calculate the
conductance through the system as a function of temperature and bias voltage,
near the quantum critical line for which the system is exactly solvable. The
results explain recent transport measurements in a single-molecule quantum dot.
