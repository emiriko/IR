The interface between two immiscible polymers, polystyrene (PS) and
polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), was studied by neutron reflectivity and dewetting
by using free PS chains and PDMS brushes. Unexpectedly, we found that the PS
chains diffuse in the PDMS brushes at temperatures well below the glass
transition temperatures of PS, the dynamics being largely determined by the
grafting density of the brush. By this study, we demonstrate the major
influence of the chains interdiffusion on the friction properties for a couple
of immiscible polymers. By the way, the puzzling ageing of PS thin films
observed from dewetting experiments is found to be directly related to
modifications of the PS/PDMS interface.
