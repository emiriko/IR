Given a field F, one may ask which finite groups are Galois groups of field
extensions E/F such that E is a maximal subfield of a division algebra with
center F. This question was originally posed by Schacher, who gave partial
results over the field of rational numbers. Using patching, we give a complete
characterization of such groups in the case that F is the function field of a
curve over a complete discretely valued field with algebraically closed residue
field of characteristic zero, as well as results in related cases.
