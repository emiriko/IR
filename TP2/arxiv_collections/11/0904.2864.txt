Magneto-optical properties of the ferromagnetic semiconductor GaMnAs are
studied in a material specific multi-band tight-binding approach. Two realistic
models are compared: one has no impurity band while the other shows an impurity
band for low Mn concentrations. The calculated magnetic circular dichroism
(MCD) is positive for both models proving that, unlike previously asserted, the
observed positive MCD signal is inconclusive as to the presence or absence of
an impurity band in GaMnAs. The positive MCD is due to the antiferromagnetic
p-d coupling and the transitions into the conduction band.
