Current publicly available computer programs calculate the spectrum and
couplings of the minimal supersymmetric standard model under the assumption of
R-parity conservation. Here, we describe an extension to the SOFTSUSY program
which includes R-parity violating effects. The user provides a theoretical
boundary condition upon the high-scale supersymmetry breaking R-parity
violating couplings. Successful radiative electroweak symmetry breaking,
electroweak and CKM matrix data are used as weak-scale boundary conditions. The
renormalisation group equations are solved numerically between the weak scale
and a high energy scale using a nested iterative algorithm. This paper serves
as a manual to the R-parity violating mode of the program, detailing the
approximations and conventions used.
