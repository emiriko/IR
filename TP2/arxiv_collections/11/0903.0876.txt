The Ruelle operator theorem has been studied extensively both in dynamical
systems and iterated function systems. In this paper we study the Ruelle
operator theorem for nonexpansive systems. Our theorems give some sufficient
conditions for the Ruelle operator theorem to be held for a nonexpansive
system.
