The user-level brokers in grids consider individual application QoS
requirements and minimize their cost without considering demands from other
users. This results in contention for resources and sub-optimal schedules.
Meta-scheduling in grids aims to address this scheduling problem, which is NP
hard due to its combinatorial nature. Thus, many heuristic-based solutions
using Genetic Algorithm (GA) have been proposed, apart from traditional
algorithms such as Greedy and FCFS.
  We propose a Linear Programming/Integer Programming model (LP/IP) for
scheduling these applications to multiple resources. We also propose a novel
algorithm LPGA (Linear programming driven Genetic Algorithm) which combines the
capabilities of LP and GA. The aim of this algorithm is to obtain the best
metaschedule for utility grids which minimize combined cost of all users in a
coordinated manner. Simulation results show that our proposed integrated
algorithm offers the best schedule having the minimum processing cost with
negligible time overhead.
