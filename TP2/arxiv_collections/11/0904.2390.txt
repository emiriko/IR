The minimal SU(5) theory augmented by the fermionic adjoint representation
restores the coupling constant unification and gives realistic neutrino masses
and mixing through the hybrid Type I and Type III seesaw. The crucial
prediction of the theory is an SU(2) lepton triplet with the mass below TeV. We
study the signature of these heavy leptons and propose the strategy to test
this mechanism at the hadron and lepton colliders. The smoking gun evidence of
the theory is Delta L=2 lepton number violation through events of a pair of
like-sign leptons plus four jets without significant missing energy at hadron
colliders. We find that via this unique channel, the heavy lepton can be
searched for up to a mass of 200 GeV at the Tevatron with 8 fb^-1, and up to
450 (700) GeV at the LHC of 14 TeV C.M.energy with 10 (100) fb^-1. The signal
rate at the 10 TeV LHC is reduced to 60-35% for a mass of 200-700 GeV. We also
comment on how to distinguish this theory from other models with similar heavy
leptons. Finally, we compare the production rates and angular distributions of
heavy leptons in e+e- collisions for various models.
