We show that the density of energy levels of a wide class of
finite-dimensional quantum systems tends to a Gaussian distribution as the
number of degrees of freedom increases. Our result is based on a nontrivial
modification of the classical central limit theorem, and is especially suited
to models whose partition function is explicitly known. In particular, we
provide the first theoretical explanation of the fact that the level density of
several spin chains of Haldane-Shastry type is asymptotically Gaussian when the
number of sites tends to infinity.
