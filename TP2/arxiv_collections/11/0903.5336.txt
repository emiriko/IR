We present a simple geometric construction linking geometric to deformation
quantization. Both theories depend on some apparently arbitrary parameters,
most importantly a polarization and a symplectic connection, and for real
polarizations we find a compatibility condition restricting the set of
admissible connections. In the special case when phase space is a cotangent
bundle this compatibility condition has many solutions, and the resulting
quantum theory not only reproduces the well-known geometric quantization
scheme, but also allows to quantize all interesting observables. For K\"ahler
manifolds there is no compatibility condition, but a canonical choice for the
parameters. The explicit form of the observables however remains undetermined.
