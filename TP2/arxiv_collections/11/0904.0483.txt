We simulate the impact of a viscous liquid drop onto a smooth dry solid
surface. As in experiments, when ambient air effects are negligible, impact
flattens the falling drop without producing a splash. The no-slip boundary
condition at the wall produces a boundary layer inside the liquid. Later, the
flattening surface of the drop traces out the boundary layer. As a result, the
eventual shape of the drop is a "pancake" of uniform thickness except at the
rim, where surface tension effects are significant. The thickness of the
pancake is simply the height where the drop surface first collides with the
boundary layer.
