QCD predicts matter at high density should exhibit color superconductivity.
We review briefly several pertinent properties of color superconductivity and
then discuss how baryons are realized in color superconductors. Especially, we
explain an attempt to describe the color-flavor locked quark matter in terms of
bosonic degrees of freedom, where the gaped quarks and Fermi sea are realized
as Skyrmions, called superqualitons, and Q-matter, respectively.
