1-Nearest Neighbor with the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance is one of the
most effective classifiers on time series domain. Since the global constraint
has been introduced in speech community, many global constraint models have
been proposed including Sakoe-Chiba (S-C) band, Itakura Parallelogram, and
Ratanamahatana-Keogh (R-K) band. The R-K band is a general global constraint
model that can represent any global constraints with arbitrary shape and size
effectively. However, we need a good learning algorithm to discover the most
suitable set of R-K bands, and the current R-K band learning algorithm still
suffers from an 'overfitting' phenomenon. In this paper, we propose two new
learning algorithms, i.e., band boundary extraction algorithm and iterative
learning algorithm. The band boundary extraction is calculated from the bound
of all possible warping paths in each class, and the iterative learning is
adjusted from the original R-K band learning. We also use a Silhouette index, a
well-known clustering validation technique, as a heuristic function, and the
lower bound function, LB_Keogh, to enhance the prediction speed. Twenty
datasets, from the Workshop and Challenge on Time Series Classification, held
in conjunction of the SIGKDD 2007, are used to evaluate our approach.
