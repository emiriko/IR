A telescope with Fresnel Zone Plates has been contemplated to be an excellent
imaging mask in X-rays and gamma-rays for quite some time. With a proper choice
of zone plate material, spacing and an appropriate readout system it is
possible to achieve any theoretical angular resolution. We provide the results
of numerical simulations of how a large number of X-ray sources could be imaged
at a high resolution. We believe that such an imager would be an excellent tool
for a future survey mission for X-ray and gamma-ray sources which we propose.
