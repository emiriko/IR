We study the proximity effect in a ferromagnetic nanoparticle having a vortex
magnetization pattern. We show that for axisymmetric system consisting of a
circular particle and a magnetic vortex situated at the center of it no long
range superconducting correlations are induced. It means that induced
superconductivity is localized in the small area near the superconducting
electrode. However, in the real systems axial symmetry can be broken by either
a shift of the magnetic vortex from the origin or geometrical anisotropy of the
ferromagnetic particle. In this case a long range proximity effect is possible.
