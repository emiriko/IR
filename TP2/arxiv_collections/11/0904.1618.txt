The paper continues the analysis of vacuum Rabi oscillations we started in
Part I [Phys. Rev. A {\bf 79}, 033836 (2009)]. Here we concentrate on
experimental consequences for cavity QED of two different classes of
representations of harmonic oscillator Lie algebras. The zero-temperature
master equation, derived in Part I for irreducible representations of the
algebra, is reformulated in a reducible representation that models
electromagnetic fields by a gas of harmonic oscillator wave packets. The
representation is known to introduce automatic regularizations that in
irreducible representations would have to be justified by ad hoc arguments.
Predictions based on this representation are characterized in thermodynamic
limit by a single parameter $\varsigma$, responsible for collapses and revivals
of Rabi oscillations in exact vacuum. Collapses and revivals disappear in the
limit $\varsigma\to\infty$. Observation of a finite $\varsigma$ would mean that
cavity quantum fields are described by a non-Wightmanian theory, where vacuum
states are zero-temperature Bose-Einstein condensates of a finite-particle
bosonic oscillator gas and, thus, are non-unique. The data collected in the
experiment of Brune {\it et al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf{76}}, 1800 (1996)] are
consistent with any $\varsigma>400$.
