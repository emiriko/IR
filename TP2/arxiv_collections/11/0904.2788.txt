A critical review of previous investigations of the superconductivity with
enhanced Tc ~ 95K found in Sr2CuO4-v shows that new physics occurs in a highly
overdoped region of the cuprate phase diagram. Moreover, evidence is adduced
from the literature that 30% of the oxygen sites in the CuO2 layers are vacant,
a conclusion which is at odds with the universally made assumption that
superconductivity originates in stoichiometric CuO2 layers. While further
research is needed in order to identify the pairing mechanism(s) responsible
for the enhanced Tc, we suggest possible candidates.
