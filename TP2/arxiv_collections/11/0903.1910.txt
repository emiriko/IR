We review the geometrical-optics evolution of an electromagnetic wave
propagating along a curved ray trajectory in a gradient-index dielectric
medium. A Coriolis-type term appears in Maxwell equations under transition to
the rotating coordinate system accompanying the ray. This term describes the
spin-orbit coupling of light which consists of (i) the Berry phase responsible
for a trajectory-dependent polarization variations and (ii) the spin Hall
effect representing polarization-dependent trajectory perturbations. These
mutual phenomena are described within universal geometrical structures
underlying the problem and are explained by the dynamics of the intrinsic
angular momentum carried by the wave. Such close geometro-dynamical
interrelations illuminate a dual physical nature of the phenomena.
