To search for Tidal Dwarf Galaxies (TDGs) and to study star formation in
tidal features, we are conducting a large UV imaging survey of interacting
galaxies selected from the Arp (1996) Atlas using the GALEX telescope. As part
of that study, we present a GALEX UV and SDSS and SARA optical study of the
gas-rich interacting galaxy pair Arp 305 (NGC 4016/7). The GALEX UV data reveal
much extended diffuse UV emission and star formation outside the disks. This
includes a luminous star forming region between the two galaxies, and a number
of such regions in tidal tails. We have identified 45 young star forming clumps
in Arp 305, including several TDG candidates. By comparing the UV and optical
colors to population synthesis models, we determined that the clumps are very
young, with several having ages of about 6 Myr. We do not find many
intermediate age clumps in spite of the fact that the last closest encounter
was about 300 Myr ago. We have used a smooth particle hydrodynamics code to
model the interaction and determine the fate of the star clusters and candidate
TDGs.
