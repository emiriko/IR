A silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) array has been developed at FBK-irst having
32 channels and a dimension of 8.0 x 1.1 mm^2. Each 250 um wide channel is
subdivided into 5 x 22 rectangularly arranged pixels. These sensors are
developed to read out a modular high resolution scintillating fiber tracker.
Key properties like breakdown voltage, gain and photon detection efficiency
(PDE) are found to be homogeneous over all 32 channels of an SiPM array. This
could make scintillating fiber trackers with SiPM array readout a promising
alternative to available tracker technologies, if noise properties and the PDE
are improved.
