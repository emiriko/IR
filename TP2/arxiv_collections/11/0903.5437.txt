We give an overview of the two different methods that have been introduced in
order to describe the dynamics of constrained quantum systems; the symplectic
formulation and the metric formulation. The symplectic method extends the work
of Dirac on constrained classical systems to quantum systems, whereas the
metric approach is purely a quantum mechanical method having no immediate
classical counterpart. Two examples are provided that illustrate the nonlinear
motion induced by the constraint.
