We construct self-similar functions and linear operators to deduce a
self-similar variant of the Laplacian operator and of the D'Alembertian wave
operator. The exigence of self-similarity as a symmetry property requires the
introduction of non-local particle-particle interactions. We derive a
self-similar linear wave operator describing the dynamics of a quasi-continuous
linear chain of infinite length with a spatially self-similar distribution of
nonlocal inter-particle springs. The self-similarity of the nonlocal harmonic
particle-particle interactions results in a dispersion relation of the form of
a Weierstrass-Mandelbrot function which exhibits self-similar and fractal
features. We also derive a continuum approximation which relates the
self-similar Laplacian to fractional integrals and yields in the low-frequency
regime a power law frequency-dependence of the oscillator density.
