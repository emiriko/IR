In this paper we discussed the application and the implementation of
multipath routing and multiple description coding (MDC) extension of OLSR,
called MP-OLSR. It is based on the link state algorithm and employs periodic
exchange of messages to maintain topology information of the networks. In the
mean time, it updates the routing table in an on-demand scheme and forwards the
packets in multiple paths which have been determined at the source. If a link
failure is detected, the algorithm recovers the route automatically. Concerning
the instability of the wireless networks, the multiple description coding is
used to improve reliability of the network transmission, and several methods
are proposed to allocate the redundancy in different paths. The simulation in
NS2 shows that the new protocol can effectively improve the performance of the
networks. The implementation of MP-OLSR is also proposed in the end.
