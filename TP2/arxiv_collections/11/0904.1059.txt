We compute concurrence and negativity as measures of two-site entanglement
generated by a power-law quench (characterized by a rate 1/tau and an exponent
alpha) which takes an anisotropic XY chain in a transverse field through a
quantum critical point (QCP). We show that only the even-neighbor pairs of
sites get entangled in such a process. Moreover, there is a critical rate of
quench, 1/tau_c, above which no two-site entanglement is generated; the entire
entanglement is multipartite. The ratio of the two-site entanglements between
consecutive even neighbors can be tuned by changing the quench rate. We also
show that for large tau, the concurrence (negativity) scales as sqrt{alpha/tau}
(alpha/tau), and we relate this scaling behavior to defect production by the
quench through a QCP.
