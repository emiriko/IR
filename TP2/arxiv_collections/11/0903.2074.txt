We investigate the variation in the mode parameters obtained from time series
of length 9, 36, 72 and 108 days to understand the changes occurring on
different time-scales. The regression analysis between frequency shifts and
activity proxies indicates that the correlation and slopes are correlated and
both increase in going from time series of 9 to 108 days. We also observe that
the energy of the mode is anti-correlated with solar activity while the rate at
which the energy is supplied remains constant over the solar cycle.
