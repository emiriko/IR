We propose and study a constrained version of the Exceptional Supersymmetric
Standard Model (E6SSM), which we call the cE6SSM, based on a universal high
energy scalar mass m_0, trilinear scalar coupling A_0 and gaugino mass M_{1/2}.
We derive the Renormalisation Group (RG) Equations for the cE6SSM, including
the extra U(1)_{N} gauge factor and the low energy matter content involving
three 27 representations of E6. We perform a numerical RG analysis for the
cE6SSM, imposing the usual low energy experimental constraints and successful
Electro-Weak Symmetry Breaking (EWSB). Our analysis reveals that the sparticle
spectrum of the cE6SSM involves a light gluino, two light neutralinos and a
light chargino. Furthermore, although the squarks, sleptons and Z' boson are
typically heavy, the exotic quarks and squarks can also be relatively light. We
finally specify a set of benchmark points which correspond to particle spectra,
production modes and decay patterns peculiar to the cE6SSM, altogether leading
to spectacular new physics signals at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).
