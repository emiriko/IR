We study preparation of states for open quantum mechanics. For non-Markovian
systems that are initially correlated with the environment, the affects of the
preparation procedure are nontrivial. This is due to the indirect affects on
the state of the environment induced via the correlations with the system and
the act of preparation on the system. We give three concrete examples of
preparation procedure to elucidate our claims.
