Belyi's theorem asserts that a smooth projective curve $X$ defined over a
number field can be realized as a cover of the projective line unramified
outside three points. In this short paper we investigate the bejaviour of the
minimal degree of such a cover. More precisely, we start by defining the
absolute Belyi degree of X, which only depends on the $\bar{\bold
Q}$-isomorphism class of $X$. We then give a lower bound of this invariant,
only depending on the stable primes of bad reduction (as defined in the paper)
and we show that this bound is sharp. In the second part of the paper, we
introduce the relative Belyi degree of a curve X defined over a fixed number
field $K$. We first prove that there exist finitely many $K$-isomorphism
classes of curves of bounded (relative) Belyi degree and we then obtain a lower
bound, only depending on the primes of bad reduction of the minimal regular
model of $X$ over (the ring of integers of) $K$.
