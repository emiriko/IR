GALEV evolutionary synthesis models describe the evolution of stellar
populations in general, of star clusters as well as of galaxies, both in terms
of resolved stellar populations and of integrated light properties over
cosmological timescales of > 13 Gyr from the onset of star formation shortly
after the Big Bang until today.
  For galaxies, GALEV includes a simultaneous treatment of the chemical
evolution of the gas and the spectral evolution of the stellar content,
allowing for what we call a chemically consistent treatment: We use input
physics (stellar evolutionary tracks, stellar yields and model atmospheres) for
a large range of metallicities and consistently account for the increasing
initial abundances of successive stellar generations.
  Here we present the latest version of the galev evolutionary synthesis models
that are now interactively available at www.galev.org. We review the currently
used input physics, and also give details on how this physics is implemented in
practice. We explain how to use the interactive web-interface to generate
models for user-defined parameters and also give a range of applications that
can be studied using GALEV, ranging from star clusters, undisturbed galaxies of
various types E ... Sd to starburst and dwarf galaxies, both in the local and
the high-redshift universe.
