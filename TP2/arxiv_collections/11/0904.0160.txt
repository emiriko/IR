In this paper we describe an iterative operator-splitting method for
unbounded operators. We derive error bounds for iterative splitting methods in
the presence of unbounded operators and semigroup operators. Here mixed
applications of hyperbolic and parabolic type are allowed and discussed in the
applications. Mixed experiments are applied to ordinary differential equations
and evolutionary Schr\"odinger equations.
