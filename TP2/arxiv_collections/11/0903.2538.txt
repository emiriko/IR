Linear and nonlinear transport of quantum wires is investigated at a magnetic
field where spin-split one-dimensional (1D) subbands are equidistant in energy.
In this seldom-studied regime, experiments are consistent with a
density-dependent energy gap between spin subbands, and with a complete spin
polarization of the first 1D subband under a large source-drain bias at zero
field.
