To investigate the geometry of the accretion disk in the source H1743-322, we
have carried out a detailed X-ray temporal and spectral study using RXTE
pointed observations. We have selected all data pertaining to the Steep Power
Law (SPL) state during the 2003 outburst of this source. We find
anti-correlated hard X-ray lags in three of the observations and the changes in
the spectral and timing parameters (like the QPO frequency) confirm the idea of
a truncated accretion disk in this source. Compiling data from similar
observations from other sources, we find a correlation between the fractional
change in the QPO frequency and the observed delay. We suggest that these
observations indicate a definite size scale in the inner accretion disk (the
radius of the truncated disk) and we explain the observed correlation using
various disk parameters like Compton cooling time scale, viscous time scale
etc..
