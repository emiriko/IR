Motivated by the mysteries of the heavy fermion quantum critical point, we
investigate the competition between Kondo screening and magnetic ordering in
the honeycomb Kondo lattice at half filling. We examine the destruction of the
Kondo phase by proliferating vortex configurations in the Kondo hybridization
order parameter. We find that there are zero modes associated with Kondo
vortices. Condensing these vortices can lead to the antiferromagnetic phase.
