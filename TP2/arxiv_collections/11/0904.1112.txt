PKS J2310-437 is an AGN with bright X-ray emission relative to its weak radio
emission and optical continuum. It is believed that its jet lies far enough
from the line of sight that it is not highly relativistically beamed. It thus
provides an extreme test of AGN models. We present new observations aimed at
refining the measurement of the source's properties. In optical photometry with
the NTT we measure a central excess with relatively steep spectrum lying above
the bright elliptical galaxy emission, and we associate the excess wholly or in
part with the AGN. A new full-track radio observation with the ATCA finds that
the core 8.64GHz emission has varied by about 20 per cent over 38 months, and
improves the mapping of the weak jet. With Chandra we measure a
well-constrained power-law spectral index for the X-ray core, uncontaminated by
extended emission from the cluster environment, with a negligible level of
intrinsic absorption. Weak X-ray emission from the resolved radio jet is also
measured. Our analysis suggests that the optical continuum in this radio galaxy
has varied by at least a factor of four over a timescale of about two years,
something that should be testable with further observations. We conclude that
the most likely explanation for the bright central X-ray emission is
synchrotron radiation from high-energy electrons.
