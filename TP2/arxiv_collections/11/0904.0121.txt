We have calculated the chemical trend of magnetic exchange parameters
($J_{dd}$, $N \alpha$, and $N \beta$) of Zn-based II-VI semiconductors ZnA
(A=O, S, Se, and Te) doped with Co or Mn. We show that a proper treatment of
electron correlations by the LSDA+$U$ method leads to good agreement between
experimental and theoretical values of the nearest-neighbor exchange coupling
$J_{dd}$ between localized 3$d$ spins in contrast to the LSDA method. The
exchange couplings between localized spins and doped electrons in the
conduction band $N \alpha$ are in good agreement with experiment as well. But
the values for $N \beta$ (coupling to doped holes in the valence band) indicate
a cross-over from weak coupling (for A=Te and Se) to strong coupling (for A=O)
and a localized hole state in ZnO:Mn. That hole localization explains the
apparent discrepancy between photoemission and magneto-optical data for ZnO:Mn.
