A surface-acoustic-wave (SAW) driven light-emitting-diode structure that can
implement a single-photon-source for quantum-cryptography applications is
demonstrated. Our lateral n-i-p junction is realized starting from an undoped
GaAs/AlGaAs quantum well by gating. It incorporates interdigitated transducers
for SAW generation and lateral gates for current control. We demonstrate
acoustoelectric transport and SAW-driven electroluminescence. The
acoustoelectric current can be controlled down to complete pinch-off by means
of the lateral gates.
