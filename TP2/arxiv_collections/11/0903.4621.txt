Superconductivity appears to compete against the spin-density-wave in Fe
pnictides. However, optimally cobalt doped samples show a quasi-two-dimensional
spin excitation centered at the (0.5, 0.5, L) wavevector, "the spin resonance
peak", that is strongly tied to the onset of superconductivity. By inelastic
neutron scattering on single crystals we show the similarities and differences
of the spin excitations in BaFe1.84Co0.16As2, with respect to the spin
excitations in the high-temperature superconducting cuprates. As in the
cuprates the resonance occurs as an enhancement to a part of the spin
excitation spectrum which extends to higher energy transfer and higher
temperature. However, unlike in the cuprates, the resonance peak in this
compound is asymmetric in energy.
