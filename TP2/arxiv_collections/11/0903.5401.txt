The canonical equations of the optical cloaking proposed by Shurig, Pendry
and Smith has been proved to be equivalent to the geodesic in a 3-dimensional
curved space. Carrying out the argument we extend to the 4-dimensional
Riemannian space where the extra time item appears as the potential term in the
canonical equations. The physical meaning of the results is interpreted.
