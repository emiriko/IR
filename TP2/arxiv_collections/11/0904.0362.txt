We report on the explicit form of the equations of motion of pole-dipole
particles for a very large class of gravitational theories. The non-Riemannian
framework in which the equations are derived allows for a unified description
of nearly all known gravitational theories. The propagation equations are
obtained with the help of a multipole expansion method from the conservation
laws that follow from Noether's theorem. The well-known propagation equations
of general relativity, e.g., as given by Mathisson and Papapetrou, represent a
special case in our general framework. Our formalism allows for a direct
identification of the couplings between the matter currents and the
gravitational field strengths in gauge gravity models. In particular, it
illustrates the need for matter with microstructure for the detection of
non-Riemannian spacetime geometries.
