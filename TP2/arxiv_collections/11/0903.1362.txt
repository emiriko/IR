First-principles density functional theory calculations were carried out to
determine the low energy geometries of anatase TiO$_2$(001) with Pt implants in
the sublayers as substitutional and interstitial impurities as well as on the
surface in the form of adsorbates. We investigated the effect of such a
systematic Pt incorporation in the electronic structure of this surface for
isolated and interacting impurities with an emphasis on the reduction in the
band gap to visible region. Comprehensive calculations, for 1x1 surface, showed
that Pt ions at interstitial cavities result in local segregation, forming
metallic wires inside, while substitution for bulk Ti and adsorption drives
four strongly dispersed impurity states from valence-bands up in the gap with a
narrowing of ~1.5 eV. Hence, such a contiguous Pt incorporation drives anatase
into infrared regime. Pt substitution for the surface Ti, on the other hand,
metallizes the surface. Systematic trends for 2x2 surface revealed that Pt can
be encapsulated inside to form stable structures as a result of strong Pt-O
interactions as well as the adsorptional and substitutional cases. Dilute
impurities considered for 2x2 surface models exhibit flat-like defect states
driven from the valence bands narrowing the energy gap suitable to obtain
visible light responsive titania.
