An observer-based Hamiltonian identification algorithm for quantum systems
has been proposed recently by Bonnabel et al. The later paper provided a method
to estimate the dipole moment matrix of a quantum system requiring the
measurement of the populations on all states, which could be experimentally
difficult to achieve. We propose here an extension to a 3-level quantum system,
having access to the population of the ground state only. By more adapted
choice of the control field, we will show that a continuous measurement of this
observable, alone, is enough to identify the field coupling parameters (dipole
moment).
