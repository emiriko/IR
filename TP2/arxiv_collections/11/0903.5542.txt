In this paper we developed the model for the carbon dioxide emission from
forest fire. The master equation for the spreading of the carbon dioxide to
atmosphere is the hyperbolic diffusion equation. In the paper we study forest
fire ignited by lightning. In that case the fores fire has the well defined
front which propagates with finite velocity.
