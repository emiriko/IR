In this work we study the Ramsauer-Townsend effect.First, we use the Quantum
Mechanical Formalism of Schrodinger. After, it is calculated with the Quantum
Mechanical Formalism of de Broglie-Bohm. In this case, we use the Kostin
equation, taking into account the energy dissipation of the electrons scattered
by sharp edged potential wells.
