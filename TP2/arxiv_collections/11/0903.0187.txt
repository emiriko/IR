In this paper we study systematically the Euclidean renormalization in
configuration spaces. We investigate also the deviation from commutativity of
the renormalization and the action of all linear partial differential
operators. This deviation is the source of the anomalies in quantum field
theory, including the renormalization group action. It also determines a
Hochschild 1-cocycle and the renormalization ambiguity corresponds to a
nonlinear subset in the cohomology class of this renormalization cocycle. We
show that the related cohomology spaces can be reduced to de Rham cohomologies
of the so called "(ordered) configuration spaces". We find cohomological
differential equations that determine the renormalization cocycles up to the
renormalization freedom. This analysis is a first step towards a new approach
for computing renormalization group actions. It can be also naturally extended
to manifolds as well as to the case of causal perturbation theory. (This paper
is based on previous preprint arXiv:0712.2194, but it has been entirely
re-written and various new results are included.)
