This paper presents a new chemical kinetic model developed for the simulation
of auto-ignition and combustion of engine surrogate fuel mixtures sensitized by
the presence of NOx. The chemical mechanism is based on the PRF auto-ignition
model (n-heptane/iso-octane) of Buda et al. [1] and the NO/n-butane/n-pentane
model of Glaude et al. [2]. The later mechanism has been taken as a reference
for the reactions of NOx with larger alcanes (n-heptane, iso-octane). A
coherent two components engine fuel surrogate mechanism has been generated
which accounts for the influence of NOx on auto-ignition. The mechanism has
been validated for temperatures between 700 K and 1100 K and pressures between
1 and 10 atm covering the temperature and pressure ranges characteristic of
engine post-oxidation thermodynamic conditions. Experiments used for validation
include jet stirred reactor conditions for species evolution as a function of
temperature, as well as diesel HCCI engine experiments for auto-ignition delay
time measurements.
