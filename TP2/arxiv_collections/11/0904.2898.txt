We study an asymmetric in field magnetoresistance that is frequently observed
in magnetic films and, in particular, the odd longitudinal voltage peaks that
appear during magnetization reversal in ferromagnetic films, with out-of-plane
magnetic anisotropy. We argue that the anomalous signals result from small
variation of magnetization and Hall resistivity along the sample. Experimental
data can be well described by a simple circuit model, the latter being
supported by analytic and numerical calculations of current and electric field
distribution in films with a gradual variation of the magnetization and Hall
resistance.
