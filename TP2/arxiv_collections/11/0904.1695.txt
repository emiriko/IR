We discuss a muon anomalous magnetic moment in a five dimensional SU (3)
gauge- Higgs unification compactified on M^4 \times S^1 /Z_2 space-time
including Z_2 -odd bulk mass for a fermion. We calculate one-loop corrections
to the anomalous magnetic moment of muon and find a lower bound for the
compactification scale to be around 5 \sim 6 TeV by comparing nonzero
Kaluza-Klein mode contributions with the muon (g - 2) experiment at BNL.
