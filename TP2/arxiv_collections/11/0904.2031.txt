The absence of vacuum Cherenkov radiation for 104.5 GeV electrons and
positrons at LEP combined with the observed stability of 300 GeV photons at the
Tevatron constrains deviations of the speed of light relative to the maximal
attainable speed of electrons. Within the Standard-Model Extension (SME), the
limit $-5.8\times10^{-12} \leq \tilde{\kappa}_{\rm tr}-{4/3}c_e^{00} \leq
1.2\times10^{-11}$ is extracted, which sharpens previous bounds by more than 3
orders of magnitude. The potential for further refinements of this limit with
terrestrial experiments and astrophysical observations is discussed.
