We study the steady state of driven elastic strings in disordered media below
the depinning threshold. In the low-temperature limit, for a fixed sample, the
steady state is dominated by a single configuration, which we determine exactly
from the transition pathways between metastable states. We obtain the dynamical
phase diagram in this limit. At variance with a thermodynamic phase transition,
the depinning transition is not associated with a divergent length scale of the
steady state below threshold, but only of the transient dynamics. We discuss
the distribution of barrier heights, and check the validity of the dynamic
phase diagram at small but finite temperatures using Langevin simulations. The
phase diagram continues to hold for broken statistical tilt symmetry. We point
out the relevance of our results for experiments of creep motion in elastic
interfaces.
