The positronium state in quartz is described by a linear superposition of two
states: the first describing the free positron in the crystal and the second
corresponding to a positronium Bloch wavefunction in the lattice. The condition
for positronium formation in the electron gas is deduced by using variational
calculations of the positron binding energy to the electron system. The self
annihilation parameter $\kappa$ introduced in positron lifetime experiments can
be properly justified by using the mixed state. A variational method to
calculate $\kappa$ is proposed.
