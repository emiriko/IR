We consider arbitrary embeddings of surface operators in a pure,
non-supersymmetric abelian gauge theory on spin (non-spin) four-manifolds. For
any surface operator with a priori simultaneously non-vanishing parameters, we
explicitly show that the parameters transform naturally under an SL(2, Z) (or a
congruence subgroup thereof) duality of the theory. However, for
non-trivially-embedded surface operators, exact S-duality holds only if the
quantum parameter effectively vanishes, while the overall SL(2, Z) (or a
congruence subgroup thereof) duality holds up to a c-number at most,
regardless. Via the formalism of duality walls, we furnish an alternative
derivation of the transformation of parameters - found also to be consistent
with a switch from Wilson to 't Hooft loop operators under S-duality. With any
background embedding of surface operators, the partition function and the
correlation functions of non-singular, gauge-invariant local operators on any
curved four-manifold, are found to transform like modular forms under the
respective duality groups.
