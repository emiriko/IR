Multi Pomeron interactions are the main source of high mass diffraction.
Their role in high energy dynamics greatly influences the predictions for high
energy cross sections and survival probabilities of hard diffraction channels,
notably, diffractive Higgs production at the LHC. Our approach, is motivated by
the fact that we obtain a very small value for the fitted slope of the Pomeron
trajectory, which justifies the use of perturbative QCD for soft scattering.
Our suggested model differs from the proposal of the Durham KMR group which is
based on a parton model interpretation of the Reggeon calculus in the complex
J-plane in which multi Pomeron vertices are arbitrarily defined. The
theoretical input and predictions of the two groups, as well as their data
analysis and procedures are compared and evaluated.
