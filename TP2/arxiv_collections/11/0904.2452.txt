We describe an algorithm that takes as input a complex sequence $(u_n)$ given
by a linear recurrence relation with polynomial coefficients along with initial
values, and outputs a simple explicit upper bound $(v_n)$ such that $|u_n| \leq
v_n$ for all $n$. Generically, the bound is tight, in the sense that its
asymptotic behaviour matches that of $u_n$. We discuss applications to the
evaluation of power series with guaranteed precision.
