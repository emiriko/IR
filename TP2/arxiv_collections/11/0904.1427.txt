Stranski-Krastanov strained islands undergo a shape anisotropy transition as
they grow in size, finally evolving toward nanowires. This effect has been
explained until now via simple energetic models that neglect thermodynamics. We
investigate theoretically the stability of strained nanowires under thermal
fluctuations of the long side. We find phase transitions from nanowires back to
nanoislands as the temperature is increased and as the height of the
nanostructure is raised or lowered and we predict regions of phase coexistence.
Our results are general, but explain recent data on the growth of erbium
silicide on a vicinal Si surface.
