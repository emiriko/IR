The power spectral analyses of the Sun's surface equatorial rotation rate
determined from the Mt. Wilson daily Doppler velocity measurements during the
period 3 December 1985 to 5 March 2007 suggests the existence of 7.6 year, 2.8
year, 1.47 year, 245 day, 182 day and 158 day periodicities in the surface
equatorial rotation rate during the period before 1996.
  However, there is no variation of any kind in the more accurately measured
data during the period after 1995. That is, the aforementioned periodicities in
the data during the period before the year 1996 may be artifacts of the
uncertainties of those data due to the frequent changes in the instrumentation
of the Mt. Wilson spectrograph. On the other hand, the temporal behavior of
most of the activity phenomena during cycles 22 (1986-1996) and 23 (after 1997)
is considerably different. Therefore, the presence of the aforementioned
short-term periodicities during the last cycle and absence of them in the
current cycle may, in principle, be real temporal behavior of the solar
rotation during these cycles.
