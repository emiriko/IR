We apply a Hartree-Fock approximation to a two-orbital model proposed for Fe
pnictide superconductors. It is found that the antiferromagnetic (AFM) order
with the ordering vector Q=(pi,0) is realized. The AFM order appears
simultaneously with ferro-orbital order, the latter leads to a secondary
lattice distortion. We also investigate the influence of doping on the AFM
order. The size of the AFM moment changes continuously for lightly doped cases,
but when the amount of doped carriers exceeds a certain value the AFM state is
suddenly destroyed. We also show that Fermi surfaces remain and change
significantly on doping even in the AFM state. This behaviour is explained by
considering the nesting due to the multi-sheet Fermi-surface structure and
multiorbital nature of the electronic bands characteristic to Fe pnictides.
