It is shown that global climate exhibits chaotic response to solar forcing
variability in a vast range of timescales: from annual to multi-millennium.
Unlike linear systems, where periodic forcing leads to periodic response,
nonlinear chaotic response to periodic forcing can result in exponentially
decaying broad-band power spectrum with decay rate T_e equal to the period of
the forcing. It is shown that power spectrum of a reconstructed time series of
Northern Hemisphere temperature anomaly for the past 2,000 years has an
exponentially decaying broad-band part with T_e = 11 yr, i.e. the observed
decay rate T_e equals the mean period of the solar activity. It is also shown
that power spectrum of a reconstruction of atmospheric CO_2 time fluctuations
for the past 650,000 years, has an exponentially decaying broad-band part with
T_e = 41,000 years, i.e. the observed decay rate T_e equals the period of the
obliquity periodic forcing. A possibility of a chaotic solar forcing of the
climate has been also discussed. These results clarify role of solar forcing
variability in long-term global climate dynamics (in particular in the unsolved
problem of the glaciation cycles) and help in construction of adequate dynamic
models of the global climate.
