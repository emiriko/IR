We examine the problem of family size statistics (the number of individuals
carrying the same surname, or the same DNA sequence) in a given size subsample
of an exponentially growing population. We approach the problem from two
directions. In the first, we construct the family size distribution for the
subsample from the stable distribution for the full population. This latter
distribution is calculated for an arbitrary growth process in the limit of slow
growth, and is seen to depend only on the average and variance of the number of
children per individual, as well as the mutation rate. The distribution for the
subsample is shifted left with respect to the original distribution, tending to
eliminate the part of the original distribution reflecting the small families,
and thus increasing the mean family size. From the subsample distribution,
various bulk quantities such as the average family size and the percentage of
singleton families are calculated. In the second approach, we study the past
time development of these bulk quantities, deriving the statistics of the
genealogical tree of the subsample. This approach reproduces that of the first
when the current statistics of the subsample is considered. The surname
distribution from th e 2000 U.S. Census is examined in light of these findings,
and found to misrepresent the population growth rate by a factor of 1000.
