Relativistically-intense laser beam with large field gradient ("laser gate")
enables strong inelastic scattering of electrons crossing the beam. This
process allows for multi-MeV electron net acceleration per pass within the
wavelength space. Inelastic scattering even in low-gradient laser field may
also induce extremely tight temporal focusing and electron bunch formation down
to quantum, zepto-second limit.
