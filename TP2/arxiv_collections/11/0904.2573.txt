We present Keck LGS AO imaging and aperture masking observations of the M8+L7
binary LHS 2397aAB. Together with archival HST, Gemini-North, and VLT data, our
observations span 11.8 years of the binary's 14.2-year orbital period. We
determine a total dynamical mass of 0.146+/-0.014 MSun (153+/-15 MJup). Using
the combined observational constraints of the total mass and individual
luminosities, the Tucson (Lyon) evolutionary models give an age for the system
of 1.6 Gyr (1.8 Gyr), consistent with its space motion. We also use these
models to determine the mass ratio, giving individual masses of 0.0839+/-0.0011
MSun (0.0848+/-0.0011 MSun) for LHS 2397aA and 0.061+/-0.013 MSun
(0.060+/-0.010 MSun) for LHS 2397aB. Because LHS 2397aB is very close to the
theoretical mass-limit of lithium burning, measuring its lithium depletion
would uniquely test substellar models. We estimate a spectral type of L7+/-1
for LHS 2397aB, making it the first L/T transition object with a dynamical mass
determination. This enables a precise estimate of its effective temperature
from Tucson (Lyon) models of 1460+/-40 K (1440+/-40 K), which is 200 K higher
than estimates for young late-L companions but consistent with older late-L
field dwarfs, supporting the idea that the temperature of the L/T transition is
surface gravity dependent. Comparing our temperature estimate for LHS 2397aB to
those derived from spectral synthesis modeling for similar objects reveals
consistency between evolutionary and atmospheric models at the L/T transition,
despite the currently limited understanding of this phase of substellar
evolution. Future dynamical masses for L/T binaries spanning a range of surface
gravity and age will provide the next critical tests of substellar models at
the L/T transition.
