Discrete sampling theorem is formulated that refers to discrete signals
specified by a finite number of their samples and band-limited in a domain of a
certain orthogonal transform. Conditions of the recoverability of such signals
from their sparse samples are discussed for different transforms and
applications are illustrated by examples of image super-resolution from
multiple chaotically sampled frames and in image reconstruction from
projections. Experimental evidence is presented of the existence of discrete
signals sharply bounded both in space and DFT or DCT domains and of the family
of the corresponding basis functions
