We show how the recent discovery of a likely close white dwarf companion to
the well known star Regulus, one of the brightest stars in the sky, leads to
considerable insight into the prior evolutionary history of this star,
including the cause of its current rapid rotation. We infer a relatively narrow
range for the initial masses of the progenitor system: M_{10} = 2.3 +/- 0.2
M_sun and M_{20} = 1.7 +/- 0.2 M_sun, where M_{10} and M_{20} are the initial
masses of the progenitors of the white dwarf and Regulus, respectively. In this
scenario, the age of the Regulus system would exceed 1 Gyr. We also show that
Regulus, with a current orbital period of 40 days, has an interesting future
ahead of it. This includes (i) a common envelope phase, and, quite possibly,
(ii) an sdB phase, followed by (iii) an AM CVn phase with orbital periods < 1
hr. Binary evolution calculations are presented in support of this scenario. We
also discuss alternative possibilities, emphasizing the present uncertainties
in binary evolution theory. Thus, this one particular star system illustrates
many different aspects of binary stellar evolution.
