BCH (Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghen) error correcting codes ([1]-[2]) are now
widely used in communication systems and digital technology. Direct LFSR(linear
feedback shifted register)-based encoding of a long BCH code suffers from
serial-in and serial-out limitation and large fanout effect of some XOR gates.
This makes the LFSR-based encoders of long BCH codes cannot keep up with the
data transmission speed in some applications. Several parallel long parallel
encoders for long cyclic codes have been proposed in [3]-[8]. The technique for
eliminating the large fanout effect by J-unfolding method and some algebraic
manipulation was presented in [7] and [8] . In this paper we propose a
CRT(Chinese Remainder Theorem)-based parallel architecture for long BCH
encoding. Our novel technique can be used to eliminate the fanout bottleneck.
The only restriction on the speed of long BCH encoding of our CRT-based
architecture is $log_2N$, where $N$ is the length of the BCH code.
