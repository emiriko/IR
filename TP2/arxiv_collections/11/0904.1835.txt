Using the determinant representation for the field-field correlation
functions of impenetrable anyons at finite temperature obtained in a previous
paper, we derive a system of nonlinear partial differential equations
completely characterizing the correlators. The system is the same as the one
for impenetrable bosons but with different initial conditions. The
large-distance asymptotic behavior of the correlation functions is obtained
from the analysis of the Riemann-Hilbert problem associated with the system of
differential equations. We calculate both the exponential and pre-exponential
factors in the asymptotics of the field-field correlators. The asymptotics
derived in this way agree with those of the free fermions and impenetrable
bosons in the appropriate limits, $\kappa\to 1$ and $\kappa\to 0$, of the
statistics parameter $\kappa$, and coincide with the predictions of the
conformal field theory at low temperatures.
