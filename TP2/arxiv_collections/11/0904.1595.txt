Recently Horava proposed a non-relativistic renormalisable theory of
gravitation, which reduces to Einstein's general relativity at large distances,
and that may provide a candidate for a UV completion of Einstein's theory. In
this paper, we derive the full set of equations of motion, and then we obtain
spherically symmetric solutions and discuss their properties. We also obtain
solutions for the Friedman-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker cosmological metric.
