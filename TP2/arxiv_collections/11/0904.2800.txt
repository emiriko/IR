We examine the observational appearance of an optically thick, spherically
symmetric, relativistic wind (a black hole wind). In a relativistic flow, the
apparent optical depth becomes small in the downstream direction, while it is
large in the upstream direction due to the relativistic effect. Hence, the
apparent photosphere of the relativistic flow depends on the flow velocity and
direction as well as the density distribution. We calculate the temperature
distribution of the apparent photosphere of the optically thick black hole
wind, where the wind speed is assumed to be constant and radiation dominates
matter, for various values of the wind speed and mass-outflow rate. We found
that the limb-darkening effect is strongly enhanced in the relativistic regime.
We also found that the observed luminosities of the black hole wind become
large as the wind speed increases, but do not depend on the mass-outflow rate.
