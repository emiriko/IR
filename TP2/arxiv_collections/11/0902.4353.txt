The temperature and polarization inhomogeneities of the Cosmic Microwave
Background might bear the mark of pre-decoupling magnetism. The parameters of a
putative magnetized background are hereby estimated from the observed
temperature autocorrelation as well as from the measured
temperature-polarization cross-correlation.
