The goal of a small and dedicated satellite called the "Continuous
Spectro-Photometry of Black Holes" or CSPOB is to provide the essential tool
for the theoretical understanding of the hydrodynamic and magneto-hydrodynamic
flows around black holes. In its life time of about three to four years, only a
half a dozen black holes will be observed continuously with a pair of CSPOBs.
Changes in the spectral and temporal variability properties of the high-energy
emission would be caught as they happen. Several important questions are
expected to be answered and many puzzles would be sorted out with this mission.
