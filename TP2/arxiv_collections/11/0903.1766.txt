Alfven waves created by sub-photospheric motions or by magnetic reconnection
in the low solar atmosphere seem good candidates for coronal heating. However,
the corona is also likely to be heated more directly by magnetic reconnection,
with dissipation taking place in current sheets. Distinguishing observationally
between these two heating mechanisms is an extremely difficult task. We perform
1.5-dimensional MHD simulations of a coronal loop subject to each type of
heating and derive observational quantities that may allow these to be
differentiated.
