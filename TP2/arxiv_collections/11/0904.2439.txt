Experimental realization and quantitative investigation of
common-noise-induced synchronization of limit-cycle oscillations subject to
random telegraph signals are performed using an electronic oscillator circuit.
Based on our previous formulation [K. Nagai et al., Phys. Rev. E 71, 036217
(2005)], dynamics of the circuit is described as random-phase mappings between
two limit cycles. Lyapunov exponents characterizing the degree of
synchronization are estimated from experimentally determined phase maps and
compared with linear damping rates of phase differences measured directly.
Noisy on-off intermittency of the phase difference as predicted by the theory
is also confirmed experimentally.
