The X(3872) with quantum numbers J(PC) = 1(++) is considered as a composite
hadronic state comprised of the dominant molecular D(0) D*(0) component and
other hadronic pairs - D(+-) D*(-+), Jpsi omega and Jpsi rho. Applying the
compositeness condition we constrain the couplings of the X(3872) to its
constituents. We calculate two- and three-body hadronic decays of the X(3872)
to charmonium states chi(cJ) and pions using a phenomenological Lagrangian
approach. Next using the estimated X-Jpsi-omega and and X-Jpsi-rho couplings we
calculate the widths of X(3872) to Jpsi + h, where h = pi(+) pi(-), pi(+) pi(-)
pi(0), pi(0) gamma and gamma. The obtained results for the decay pattern of the
X(3872) in a molecular interpretation could be useful for running and planned
experiments.
