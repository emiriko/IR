Current fluctuations and related steady state fluctuation relation are
investigated in simple coarse-grained lattice-gas analogs of a non-Newtonian
fluid driven by a constant and uniform force field, in two regimes of small
entropy production. Non-Gaussian current fluctuations and deviations from
fluctuation relation are observed and related to the existence of growing
amorphous correlations and heterogeneous anomalous diffusion regimes.
