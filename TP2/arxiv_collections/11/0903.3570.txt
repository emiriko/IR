We use laser light near resonant with an optical bound-to-bound transition to
shift the magnetic field at which a Feshbach resonance occurs. We operate in a
regime of large detuning and large laser intensity. This reduces the
light-induced atom-loss rate by one order of magnitude compared to our previous
experiments [D.M. Bauer et al. Nature Phys. 5, 339 (2009)]. The experiments are
performed in an optical lattice and include high-resolution spectroscopy of
excited molecular states, reported here. In addition, we give a detailed
account of a theoretical model that describes our experimental data.
