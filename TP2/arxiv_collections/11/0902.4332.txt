Let F be a finite field and let b and N be integers. We prove explicit
estimates for the probability that the number of rational points on a randomly
chosen elliptic curve E over F equals b modulo N. The underlying tool is an
equidistribution result on the action of Frobenius on the N-torsion subgroup of
E. Our results subsume and extend previous work by Achter and Gekeler.
