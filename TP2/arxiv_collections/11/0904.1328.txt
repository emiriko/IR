General features of the formalism describing hydrodynamic evolution of
transversally thermalized matter possibly produced at the very early stages of
ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions are presented. Thermodynamical
consistency of the model is emphasized. The covariant formulas for the moments
of the phase-space distribution function are derived. The simple model for the
transition from purely transverse to standard perfect-fluid hydrodynamics is
proposed.
