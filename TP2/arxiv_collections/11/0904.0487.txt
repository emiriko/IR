The relativistic corrections to the magnetic dipole moment operator in the
Pauli approximation were derived originally by Drake (Phys. Rev. A 3(1971)908).
In the present paper, we derive their irreducible tensor-operator form to be
used in atomic structure codes adopting the Fano-Racah-Wigner algebra for
calculating its matrix elements.
