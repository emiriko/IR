We consider a smooth, rotationally invariant, centered gaussian process in
the plane, with arbitrary correlation matrix $C_{t t'}$. We study the winding
angle $\phi_t$ around its center. We obtain a closed formula for the variance
of the winding angle as a function of the matrix $C_{tt'}$. For most stationary
processes $C_{tt'}=C(t-t')$ the winding angle exhibits diffusion at large time
with diffusion coefficient $D = \int_0^\infty ds C'(s)^2/(C(0)^2-C(s)^2)$.
Correlations of $\exp(i n \phi_t)$ with integer $n$, the distribution of the
angular velocity $\dot \phi_t$, and the variance of the algebraic area are also
obtained. For smooth processes with stationary increments (random walks) the
variance of the winding angle grows as ${1/2} (\ln t)^2$, with proper
generalizations to the various classes of fractional Brownian motion. These
results are tested numerically. Non integer $n$ is studied numerically.
