The recombination of a free electron into a bound state of bare, heavy
nucleus under simultaneous production of bound-electron--free-positron pair is
studied within the framework of relativistic first--order perturbation theory.
This process, denoted as "negative-continuum dielectronic recombination" leads
to a formation of not only the ground but also the singly- and doubly-excited
states of the residual helium-like ion. The contributions from such an
excited--state capture to the total as well as angle-differential
cross-sections are studied in detail. Calculations are performed for the
recombination of (initially) bare uranium U$^{92+}$ ions and for a wide range
of collision energies. From these calculations, we find almost 75 % enhancement
of the total recombination probability if the excited ionic states are taken
into account.
