Dynamical disorder in negative thermal expansion compound Zn(CN)2 is
investigated by quasielastic neutron scattering technique in the temperature
range 170-320 K. Significant quasielastic broadening is observed above the
phase transition temperature of about 250 K, however no broadening is observed
at 220 K and below. Data at high temperatures are analyzed assuming the CN
reorientation. Characteristic time associated with the CN orientation is
estimated as 16 ps and 11 ps at 270 and 320 K respectively.
