We present a study of large-scale bars in field and cluster environments out
to redshifts of ~0.8 using a final sample of 945 moderately inclined disk
galaxies drawn from the EDisCS project. We characterize bars and their host
galaxies and look for relations between the presence of a bar and the
properties of the underlying disk. We investigate whether the fraction and
properties of bars in clusters are different from their counterparts in the
field. The total optical bar fraction in the redshift range z=0.4-0.8 (median
z=0.60), averaged over the entire sample, is 25% (20% for strong bars). For the
cluster and field subsamples, we measure bar fractions of 24% and 29%,
respectively. We find that bars in clusters are on average longer than in the
field and preferentially found close to the cluster center, where the bar
fraction is somewhat higher (~31%) than at larger distances (~18%). These
findings however rely on a relatively small subsample and might be affected by
small number statistics. In agreement with local studies, we find that
disk-dominated galaxies have a higher optical bar fraction (~45%) than
bulge-dominated galaxies (~15%). This result is based on Hubble types and
effective radii and does not change with redshift. The latter finding implies
that bar formation or dissolution is strongly connected to the emergence of the
morphological structure of a disk and is typically accompanied by a transition
in the Hubble type. (abridged)
