It is suggested that marked features of symmetry breaking mechanism and
elementary excitations in chiral helimagnet come up as visible effects in
electron spin resonance (ESR) profile. Under the magnetic field applied
parallel and perpendicular to the helical axis, elementary excitations are
respectively described by the helimagnon associated with rotational symmetry
breaking and the magnetic kink crystal phonon associated with translational
symmetry breaking. We demonstrate how the ESR spectra distinguish these
excitations.
