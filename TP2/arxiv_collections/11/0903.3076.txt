A novel concept for producing polarized positrons at Jefferson Lab using the
CEBAF polarized electron photo-injector is presented. This approach relies on
the polarization transfer from low energy highly polarized electrons to
positrons via bremsstrahlung followed by pair production in a conversion
target. An experiment to test this concept is discussed on the basis of GEANT4
simulations. It is shown that this low energy approach, which benefits from
recent advances in high current high polarization electron sources, can yield
positron longitudinal polarization up to 40%.
