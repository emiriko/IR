We study an integro-differential equation which generalizes the periodic
intermediate long wave (ILW) equation. The kernel of the singular integral
involved is an elliptic function written as a second order difference of the
Weierstrass zeta-function. Using Sato's formulation, we show the integrability
and construct some special solutions. An elliptic solution is also obtained. We
present a conjecture based on a Poisson structure that it gives an alternative
description of this integrable hierarchy. We note that this Poisson algebra in
turn is related to a quantum algebra related with the family of Macdonald
difference operators.
