We used a large, homogeneous sample of 4178 z <= 0.8 Seyfert 1 galaxies and
QSOs selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to investigate the strength of
Fe II emission and its correlation with other emission lines and physical
parameters of active galactic nuclei. We find that the strongest correlations
of almost all the emission-line intensity ratios and equivalent widths (EWs)
are with the Eddington ratio (L/L_{Edd}), rather than with the continuum
luminosity at 5100\AA\ (L_{5100}) or black hole mass (M_{BH}); the only
exception is the EW of ultraviolet Fe II emission, which does not correlate at
all with broad-line width, L_{5100}, M_{BH}, or L/L_{Edd}. By contrast, the
intensity ratios of both the ultraviolet and optical Fe II emission to Mg II
\lambda 2800 correlate quite strongly with L/L_{Edd}. Interestingly, among all
the emission lines in the near-UV and optical, the EW of narrow optical Fe II
emission has the strongest correlation with L/L_{Edd}. We suggest that the
variation of the emission-line strength in active galaxies is regulated by
L/L_{Edd} because it governs the global distribution of the column density of
the clouds gravitationally bound in the line-emitting region, as well as its
overall gas supply. The systematic dependence on L/L_{Edd} must be corrected
when using the FeII/MgII intensity ratio as a measure of the Fe/Mg abundance
ratio to study the history of chemical evolution in QSO environments.
