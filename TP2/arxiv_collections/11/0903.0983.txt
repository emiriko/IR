When localized spins on different d orbitals prefer different types of
antiferromagnetic ordering, the Hund's rule coupling creates frustration. Using
spin-wave theory we study the case of two such orbitals on a square lattice
coupled through Hund's rule, such that the first one couples
antiferromagnetically (AF) more strongly to its nearest neighbors, while the
second couples more strongly to its next nearest neighbors. We find that the
zero temperature phase diagram has four regions, one characterized by the
familiar $(\pi,\pi)$ AF order, a second by the columnar $(\pi,0)$ order, a
third by a {\it canted} order and a fourth region where a quantum-disordered
state emerges. We comment on the possible relevance of these findings for the
case of Fe-pnictide based antiferromagnets.
