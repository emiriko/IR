We study the normal and lateral effective critical Casimir forces acting on a
spherical colloid immersed in a critical binary solvent and close to a
chemically structured substrate with alternating adsorption preference. We
calculate the universal scaling function for the corresponding potential and
compare our results with recent experimental data [Soyka F., Zvyagolskaya O.,
Hertlein C., Helden L., and Bechinger C., Phys. Rev. Lett., 101, 208301
(2008)]. The experimental potentials are properly captured by our predictions
only by accounting for geometrical details of the substrate pattern for which,
according to our theory, critical Casimir forces turn out to be a sensitive
probe.
