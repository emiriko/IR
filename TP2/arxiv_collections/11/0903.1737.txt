We prove global internal controllability in large time for the nonlinear
Schr\"odinger equation on some compact manifolds of dimension 3. The result is
proved under some geometrical assumptions : geometric control and unique
continuation. We give some examples where they are fulfilled on $\Tot$, $S^3$
and $S^2\times S^1$. We prove this by two different methods both inherently
interesting. The first one combines stabilization and local controllability
near 0. The second one uses successive controls near some trajectories. We also
get a regularity result about the control if the data are assumed smoother. If
the $H^1$ norm is bounded, it gives a local control in $H^1$ with a smallness
assumption only in $L^2$. We use Bourgain spaces.
