We calculate the energy decay rate of Josephson qubits and superconducting
resonators from non-equilibrium quasiparticles. The decay rates from
experiments are shown to be consistent with predictions based on a prior
measurement of the quasiparticle density n_qp = 10/um^3, which suggests that
non-equilibrium quasiparticles are an important decoherence source for
Josephson qubits. Calculations of the energy-decay and diffusion of
quasiparticles also indicate that prior engineered gap and trap structures,
which reduce the density of quasiparticles, should be redesigned to improve
their efficacy. This model also explains a striking feature in Josephson qubits
and resonators - a small reduction in decay rate with increasing temperature.
