Detection of the Warm-Hot Intergalactic Medium (WHIM) using Sunyaev-Zeldovich
effect (SZE) surveys is an intriguing possibility, and one that may allow
observers to quantify the amount of "missing baryons" in the WHIM phase. We
estimate the necessary sensitivity for detecting low density WHIM gas with the
South Pole Telescope (SPT) and Planck Surveyor for a synthetic 100 square
degree sky survey. This survey is generated from a very large, high dynamic
range adaptive mesh refinement cosmological simulation performed with the Enzo
code. We find that for a modest increase in the SPT survey sensitivity (a
factor of 2-4), the WHIM gas makes a detectable contribution to the integrated
sky signal. For a Planck-like satellite, similar detections are possible with a
more significant increase in sensitivity (a factor of 8-10). We point out that
for the WHIM gas, the kinematic SZE signal can sometimes dominate the thermal
SZE where the thermal SZE decrement is maximal (150 GHz), and that using the
combination of the two increases the chance of WHIM detection using SZE
surveys. However, we find no evidence of unique features in the thermal SZE
angular power spectrum that may aid in its detection. Interestingly, there are
differences in the power spectrum of the kinematic SZE, which may not allow us
to detect the WHIM directly, but could be an important contaminant in
cosmological analyses of the kSZE-derived velocity field. Corrections derived
from numerical simulations may be necessary to account for this contamination.
