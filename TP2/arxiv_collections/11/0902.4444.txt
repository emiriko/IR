We have recently discovered a supermassive binary black hole system with a
projected separation between the two black holes of 7.3 parsecs in the radio
galaxy 0402+379. This is the most compact supermassive binary black hole pair
yet imaged by more than two orders of magnitude. We present Global VLBI
observations at 1.3464 GHz of this radio galaxy, taken to improve the quality
of the HI data. Two absorption lines are found toward the southern jet of the
source, one redshifted by 370 +/- 10 km/s and the other blueshifted by 700 +/-
10 km/s with respect to the systemic velocity of the source, which, along with
the results obtained for the opacity distribution over the source, suggests the
presence of two mass clumps rotating around the central region of the source.
We propose a model consisting of a geometrically thick disk, of which we only
see a couple of clumps, that reproduces the velocities measured from the HI
absorption profiles. These clumps rotate in circular Keplerian orbits around an
axis that crosses one of the supermassive black holes of the binary system in
0402+379. We find an upper limit for the inclination angle of the twin jets of
the source to the line of sight of 66 degrees, which, according to the proposed
model, implies a lower limit on the central mass of ~7 x 10^8 Msun and a lower
limit for the scale height of the thick disk of ~12 pc .
