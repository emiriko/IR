In linear transport, the fluctuation-dissipation theorem relates equilibrium
current correlations to the linear conductance coefficient. Theory and
experiment have shown that in small electrical conductors the non-linear
I-V-characteristic of two-terminal conductor exhibits terms which are
asymmetric in magnetic field and thus micro-reversibility is manifestly broken.
We discuss a non-equilibrium fluctuation dissipation theorem which is not based
on micro-reversibility. It connects the antisymmetric nonlinear conductance
with the third cumulant of equilibrium current fluctuations and a noise term
that is proportional to temperature, magnetic field and voltage.
