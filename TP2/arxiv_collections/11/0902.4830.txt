We report on the three Mathematica packages hexagon, CSectors, AMBRE. They
are useful for the evaluation of one- and two-loop Feynman integrals with a
dependence on several kinematical scales. These integrals are typically needed
for LHC and ILC applications, but also for higher order corrections at meson
factories. hexagon is a new package for the tensor reduction of one-loop
5-point and 6-point functions with rank R=3 and R=4, respectively; AMBRE is a
tool for derivations of Mellin-Barnes representations; CSectors is an interface
for the package sector_decomposition and allows a convenient, direct evaluation
of tensor Feynman integrals.
