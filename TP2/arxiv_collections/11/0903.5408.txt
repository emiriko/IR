We present an update of the parsec scale properties of the Bologna Complete
Sample consisting of 95 radio sources with z $<$ 0.1 from the B2 Catalog of
Radio Sources and the Third Cambridge Revised Catalog (3CR). Thanks to new data
obtained in phase reference mode, we have now parsec scale images for 76
sources of the sample. Most of them show a one-sided jet structure but we find
a higher fraction of two-sided sources in comparison with previous flux-limited
VLBI surveys. Results for two peculiar sources, 3C 293 and 3C 310, are
presented and discussed in more detail.
