In this letter, we demonstrate a non-volatile memory device in a graphene FET
structure using ferroelectric gating. The binary information, i.e. "1" and "0",
is represented by the high and low resistance states of the graphene working
channels and is switched by controlling the polarization of the ferroelectric
thin film using gate voltage sweep. A non-volatile resistance change exceeding
200% is achieved in our graphene-ferroelectric hybrid devices. The experimental
observations are explained by the electrostatic doping of graphene by electric
dipoles at the ferroelectric/graphene interface.
