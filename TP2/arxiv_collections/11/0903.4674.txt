We propose a scheme to split a cloud of cold non-interacting neutral atoms
based on their dipole interaction with a single structured light beam which
exhibits parabolic cylindrical symmetry. Using semiclassical numerical
simulations, we establish a direct relationship between the general properties
of the light beam and the relevant geometric and kinematic properties acquired
by the atomic cloud as its passes through the beam.
