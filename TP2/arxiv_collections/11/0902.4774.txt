The effect of edge-type dislocation wall strain field on the Hall mobility in
n-type epitaxial GaN was theoretically investigated through deformation
potential within the relaxation time approach. It was found that this channel
of scattering can play a considerable role in the low-temperature transport at
the certain set of the model parameters. The low temperature experimental data
were fitted by including this mechanism of scattering along with ionized
impurities and charge dislocation ones.
