We are presenting a new method of processing polystyrene-silica
nanocomposites, which results in a very well-defined dispersion of small
primary aggregates (assembly of 15 nanoparticles of 10 nm diameter) in the
matrix. The process is based on a high boiling point solvent, in which the
nanoparticles are well dispersed, and controlled evaporation. The filler's fine
network structure is determined over a wide range of sizes, using a combination
of Small Angle Neutron Scattering (SANS) and Transmission Electronic Microscopy
(TEM). The mechanical response of the nanocomposite material is investigated
both for small (ARES oscillatory shear and Dynamical Mechanical Analysis) and
large deformations (uniaxial traction), as a function of the concentration of
the particles. We can investigate the structure-property correlations for the
two main reinforcement effects: the filler network contribution, and a
filler-polymer matrix effect. Above a silica volume fraction threshold, we see
a divergence of the modulus correlated to the build up of a connected network.
Below the threshold, we obtain a new additional elastic contribution of much
longer terminal time than the matrix. Since aggregates are separated by at
least 60 nm, this new filler-matrix contribution cannot be described solely
with the concept of glassy layer (2nm).
