In quantum field theory, it is generally assumed that there is a lower bound
to the energy, which is normally assumed to the the vacuum state. While this
may be a reasonable assumption for a free field it is not necessarily the case
for interacting fields. In this paper I will examine a "toy" model of a neutral
scalar field interacting with a charged scalar field and show that there is no
lower bound to the energy in this case.
