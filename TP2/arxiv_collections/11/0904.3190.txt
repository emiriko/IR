We run mean-field shearing-box numerical simulations with a
temperature-dependent resistivity and compare them to a reduced dynamical
model. Our simulations reveal the co-existence of two quasi-steady states, a
`quiet' state and an `active' turbulent state, confirming the predictions of
the reduced model. The initial conditions determine on which state the
simulation ultimately settles. The active state is strongly influenced by the
geometry of the computational box and the thermal properties of the gas. Cubic
domains support permanent channel flows, bar-shaped domains exhibit eruptive
behaviour, and horizontal slabs give rise to infrequent channels. Meanwhile,
longer cooling time-scales lead to higher saturation amplitudes.
