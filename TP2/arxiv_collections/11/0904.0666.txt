We study the effect of fluctuations in opening angle of bent-core molecules
on stability of the nematic phases. The molecules are built out of two
Gay-Berne centers of $\kappa = 4$, $\kappa ' = 5$, $\mu = 1$ and $\nu = 2$,
each corresponding to one of the molecular arms. Constant-pressure Monte Carlo
(MC NPT) simulations are carried out for two versions of the model, with fixed-
and fluctuating opening angle, where fluctuations are taken harmonic about the
angle of 140o. The systems studied are first cooled down from the isotropic
liquid to a highly ordered crystalline smectic phase and then heated up all the
way back. The liquid crystalline phases found on cooling are uniaxial nematic,
biaxial nematic and crystalline, hexagonal biaxial smectic. On heating the
biaxial nematic is superseded by the metastable crystalline phase. Similar
system with molecules of shorter arms ($\kappa = 3$) was shown to exhibit a
wide range of reduced density, where the uniaxial nematic was absolutely stable
[Liq. Cryst. 29, 483 (2002)]. For molecules with rigid arms of $\kappa = 4$ and
opening angles of 125o, 130o, 135o and 140o a further broadening of the density
range of the uniaxial nematic phase is observed. However, the helical
superstructures reported for $\kappa = 3$ do not show up for $\kappa = 4$.
