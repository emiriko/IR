We compute a variety of operator-operator correlation functions to third
order in the MSbar scheme in the chiral limit. These include combinations of
quark bilinear currents with gauge invariant operators such as moments n = 2
and 3 of the flavour non-singlet Wilson operators of deep inelastic scattering
and moment n = 2 of the transversity operator, as well as the correlation
functions of the latter operators with themselves. The explicit values of these
gauge independent correlation functions are required to assist with
non-perturbative matching to lattice regularized calculations of the same
quantities. As part of the computation we determine the mixing matrix of
renormalization constants of these non-singlet currents with their associated
total derivative operators at the same twist to three loops in MSbar. Such
operators are crucial in extracting renormalization constants for the
operator-operator correlation functions which are consistent with the
corresponding renormalization group equation. As a by-product we deduce the
R-ratio for the tensor current to third order in the MSbar scheme.
