We review recent studies on spin decoherence of electrons and holes in
quasi-two-dimensional quantum dots, as well as electron-spin relaxation in
nanowire quantum dots. The spins of confined electrons and holes are considered
major candidates for the realization of quantum information storage and
processing devices, provided that sufficently long coherence and relaxation
times can be achieved. The results presented here indicate that this
prerequisite might be realized in both electron and hole quantum dots, taking
one large step towards quantum computation with spin qubits.
