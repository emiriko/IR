The production of $\omega$ mesons in the $pd \to{}^3$He$ \omega$ reaction has
been studied at two energies near the kinematic threshold, $T_p=1450$ MeV and
$T_p=1360$ MeV. The differential cross section was measured as a function of
the $\omega$ cm angle at both energies over the whole angular range. Whereas
the results at 1360 MeV are consistent with isotropy, strong rises are observed
near both the forward and backward directions at 1450 MeV. Calculations made
using a two-step model with an intermediate pion fail to reproduce the shapes
of the measured angular distributions and also underestimate the total cross
sections.
