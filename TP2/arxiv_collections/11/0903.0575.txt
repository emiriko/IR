The magnetic, transport and optical properties of EuFe$_2$As$_2$ single
crystals have been investigated parallel and perpendicular to the $ab$-plane.
The anisotropy $\rho_c/\rho_{ab}\approx 8$ depends only slightly on
temperature. In both orientations, the spin-density wave transition at $T_{\rm
SDW}=189$ K shows up as a considerable increase in the dc resistivity.
Susceptibility measurements evidence the magnetic order of the Eu$^{2+}$
moments at $T_N=19$ K with little influence on the electronic transport taking
place in the FeAs layers. Polarization-dependent infrared spectroscopy reveals
strongly anisotropic optical properties and yields a carrier density of only
$4.2\times 10^{21} {\rm cm}^{-3}$ and a bandmass of $m_b=2m_0$. A sizeable
Drude contribution is present at all temperatures and narrows upon cooling.
Below $T_{\rm SDW}$, the spin-density-wave gap develops in the in-plane optical
conductivity; no appreciable change is detected for the perpendicular
polarization. Modifications in the phonon features are associated with changes
of the electronic properties at $T_{\rm SDW}$. The extended Drude analysis
yields a linear behavior of the frequency-dependent scattering rate below
$T_{\rm SDW}$, indicating an interaction between the charge carriers and spin
fluctuations in the spin-density-wave state.
