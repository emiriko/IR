In this review we discuss the progress of the past decade in testing for a
possible temporal variation of the fine structure constant $\alpha$. Advances
in atomic sample preparation, laser spectroscopy and optical frequency
measurements led to rapid reduction of measurement uncertainties. Eventually
laboratory tests became the most sensitive tool to detect a possible variation
of $\alpha$ at the present epoch. We explain the methods and technologies that
helped make this possible.
