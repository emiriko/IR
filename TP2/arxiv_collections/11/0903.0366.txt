In high-energy nuclear collisions the degree of thermalization at the
partonic level is a key issue. Due to their large mass, heavy-quarks and their
participation in the collective flow of the QCD medium constitute a powerful
tool to probe thermalization. We propose measuring azimuthal correlations of
heavy-quark hadrons and products from their semi-leptonic decay. Modifications
or even the complete absence of initially, e.g. in p-p collisions, existing
azimuthal correlations in Pb-Pb collisions might indicate thermalization at the
partonic level. We present studies with PYTHIA for p-p collisions at the top
LHC energy using the two-particle transverse momentum correlator
${<\overline{\Delta}p_{t,1}\overline{\Delta}p_{t,2}>}$ as a sensitive measure
of azimuthal correlations.
