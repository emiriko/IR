In this paper a fast impurity solver is proposed for dynamical mean field
theory (DMFT) based on a decoupling of the equations of motion for the impurity
Greens function. The resulting integral equations are solved efficiently with a
method based on genetic algorithms. The Hubbard and periodic Anderson models
are studied with this impurity solver. The method describes the Mott metal
insulator transition and works for a large range of parameters at finite
temperature on the real frequency axis. This makes it useful for the
exploration of real materials in the framework of LDA+DMFT.
