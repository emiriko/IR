In measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC), local adaptive measurements
are performed on the quantum state of a lattice of qubits. Quantum gates are
associated with a particular measurement sequence, and one way of viewing MBQC
is that such a measurement sequence prepares a resource state suitable for
`gate teleportation'. We demonstrate how to quantify the performance of quantum
gates in MBQC by using correlation functions on the pre-measurement resource
state.
