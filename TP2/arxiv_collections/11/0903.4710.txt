Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are likely to have made a number of significant
impacts on the Earth during the last billion years. The gamma radiation from a
burst within a few kiloparsecs would quickly deplete much of the Earth's
protective ozone layer, allowing an increase in solar ultraviolet radiation
reaching the surface. This radiation is harmful to life, damaging DNA and
causing sunburn. In addition, NO2 produced in the atmosphere would cause a
decrease in visible sunlight reaching the surface and could cause global
cooling. Nitric acid rain could stress portions of the biosphere, but the
increased nitrate deposition could be helpful to land plants. We have used a
two-dimensional atmospheric model to investigate the effects on the Earth's
atmosphere of GRBs delivering a range of fluences, at various latitudes, at the
equinoxes and solstices, and at different times of day. We have estimated DNA
damage levels caused by increased solar UVB radiation, reduction in solar
visible light due to NO2 opacity, and deposition of nitrates through rainout of
HNO3. In this paper I give a concise review of this work and discuss current
and future work on extending and improving our estimates of the terrestrial
impact of a GRB.
