This review summarizes recent developments in the understanding of
high-energy cosmic rays. It focuses on galactic and presumably extragalactic
particles in the energy range from the knee (10^15 eV) up to the highest
energies observed (>10^20 eV). Emphasis is put on observational results, their
interpretation, and the global picture of cosmic rays that has emerged during
the last decade.
