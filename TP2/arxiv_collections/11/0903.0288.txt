In this work, we use the first-principle density-functional approach to study
the electronic structure of a H atom adsorbed on the ideal Pt(111) and vicinal
Pt(211) and Pt(331) surfaces. Full three-dimensional potential-energy surfaces
(3D PES's) as well as local electronic density of states on various adsorption
sites are obtained. The results show that the steps modify the PES
considerably. The effect is nonlocal and extends into the region of the (111)
terraces. We also find that different type of steps have different kind of
influence on the PES when compared to the one of the ideal Pt(111) surface. The
full 3D PES's calculated in this work provide a starting point for the
theoretical study of vibrational and diffusive dynamics of H adatoms adsorbed
on these vicinal surfaces.
