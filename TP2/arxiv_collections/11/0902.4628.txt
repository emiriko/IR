It is suggested that superfluid helium (condensate of 4-He atoms) may
stimulate nuclear alpha-decay in a situation when an alpha-emitter moves
through superfluid helium with fine-tuned velocity, so that the
backward-emitted alpha-particle is at rest in the laboratory frame. It is shown
that the probability of stimulated alpha-decay in this case may be sizable
enough to be detected.
