The adjustment of two different selfocs is considered using both exact
formulas for the mode-connection coefficients expressed in terms of Hermite
polynomials of several variables and a qualitative approach based on the
Frank-Condon principle. Several examples of the refractive-index dependence are
studied and illustrative plots for these examples are presented. The connection
with the tomographic approach to quantum states of a two-dimensional oscillator
and the Frank-Condon factors is established.
