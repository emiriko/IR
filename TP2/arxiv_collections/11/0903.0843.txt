The Pseudo-Boolean Optimization (PBO) and Maximum Satisfiability (MaxSAT)
problems are natural optimization extensions of Boolean Satisfiability (SAT).
  In the recent past, different algorithms have been proposed for PBO and for
MaxSAT, despite the existence of straightforward mappings from PBO to MaxSAT
and vice-versa. This papers proposes Weighted Boolean Optimization (WBO), a new
unified framework that aggregates and extends PBO and MaxSAT. In addition, the
paper proposes a new unsatisfiability-based algorithm for WBO, based on recent
unsatisfiability-based algorithms for MaxSAT. Besides standard MaxSAT, the new
algorithm can also be used to solve weighted MaxSAT and PBO, handling
pseudo-Boolean constraints either natively or by translation to clausal form.
Experimental results illustrate that unsatisfiability-based algorithms for
MaxSAT can be orders of magnitude more efficient than existing dedicated
algorithms. Finally, the paper illustrates how other algorithms for either PBO
or MaxSAT can be extended to WBO.
