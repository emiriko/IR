First principles calculations are used to investigate the effects of
epitaxial strain on the structure of the perovskite oxide CaTiO$_3$, with
particular focus on the stabilization of a ferroelectric phase related to a
polar instability hidden in the orthorhombic equilibrium bulk $Pbnm$ structure
but found in previous first-principles studies of the ideal cubic perovskite
high-symmetry reference structure. At 1.5% strain, we find an epitaxial
orientation transition between the $ab$-$ePbnm$ phase, favored for compressive
strains, and the $c$-$ePbnm$ phase. For larger tensile strains, a polar
instability develops in the $c$-$ePbnm$ phase and an epitaxial-strain-induced
ferroelectric phase is obtained with polarization along a $<$110$>$ direction
with respect to the primitive perovskite lattice vectors of the square
substrate.
