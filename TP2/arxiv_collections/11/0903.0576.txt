We describe the design and performance of IceTop, the air shower array on top
of the IceCube neutrino detector. After the 2008/09 antarctic summer season
both detectors are deployed at almost 3/4 of their design size. With the
current IceTop 59 stations we can start the study of showers of energy well
above 10$^{17}$ eV. The paper also describes the first results from IceTop and
our plans to study the cosmic ray composition using several different types of
analysis.
