Current strategies in system science with a focus on neuroscience do differ
in their methodological approach when exploring and trying to analyze a system
in order to detect supposed underlying principle processes in its inherent
actions, which one might would call rules or laws. The here suggested procedure
and measuring device, performs a mapping of characteristic parameters of the
regional output signal, of the supposed structural properties, onto a selected
regional part of the information processing system, in which the output signal
and its characteristics occur. Explicitly it is pointed out here: Here are not
considered input signals, which for instance might have an influence upon (few)
nuclear kernels of the atom, electrons, protons, spins of these atomic
structures or substructures, or phonons, or which in general represent the
physical basis for example of NMR-Physics (NMR = nuclear magnetic resonance) or
solid state physics. Examples for the type of input signals considered here are
visual, olfactory, tactile or auditory input signals or simply a verbal
instruction.
