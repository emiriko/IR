Both amorphous and crystalline materials frequently exhibit low temperature
specific heats in excess of what is predicted using the Debye model. The
signature of this excess specific heat is a peak observed in $C/T^3$
\textit{versus} $T$. To understand the curious absence of long-range ordering
of local distortions in the crystal structure of pyrochlore Bi$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$,
we have measured the specific heat of crystalline Bi$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ and related
compounds. We find that the peak in $C/T^3$ versus $T$ in Bi$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$
falls at a substantially lower temperature than other similar compounds,
consistent with the presence of disorder. This thermodynamic evidence for
disorder in crystalline Bi$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ is consistent with quenched
configurational disorder among Bi lone pairs produced by geometrical
frustration, which could represent a possible realization of "charge ice".
