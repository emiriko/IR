We explore quark-hadron duality in semi-inclusive pion electroproduction on
proton and neutron targets. Using the spin-flavor symmetric quark model, we
compute ratios of pi+ and pi- cross sections for both unpolarized and polarized
scattering, and discuss realizations of duality in several symmetry breaking
scenarios. The model calculations allow one to understand some of the key
features of recent data on semi-inclusive pion production at low energies.
