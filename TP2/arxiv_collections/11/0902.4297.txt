Ion-induced cell killing has been reported to depend on the irradiation dose
but also on the projectile parameters. In this paper we focus on two approaches
developed and extensively used to predict cell survival in response to ion
irradiation: the Local Effect Model and the Katz Model. These models are based
on a track-structure description summarized in the concept of radial dose. This
latter is sensitive to ion characteristics parameters and gives to both models
the ability to predict some important radiobiological features for ion
irradiations. Radial dose is however an average quantity, which does not
include stochastic effects. These radiation-intrinsic effects are investigated
by means of a Monte-Carlo simulation of dose deposition. We show that both
models are not fully consistent with the nanometric and microscopic dose
deposition statistics.
