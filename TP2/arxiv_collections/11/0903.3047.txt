Low-Mass X-ray Binaries (LMXRBs), believed to be the progenitors of recycled
millisecond pulsars (MSPs), occur abundantly in globular clusters (GCs). GCs
are therefore expected to host large numbers of MSPs. This is also confirmed
observationally. The MSPs continuously inject relativistic electrons into the
ambient region beyond their light cylinders, and these relativistic particles
produce unpulsed radiation via the synchrotron and inverse Compton (IC)
processes. It is thus possible, in the context of General Relativistic (GR)
frame-dragging MSP models, to predict unpulsed very high energy radiation
expected from nearby GCs. We use a period-derivative cleaned sample of MSPs in
47 Tucanae, where the effects of the cluster potential on the individual period
derivatives have been removed. Using a Monte Carlo process to include effects
of pulsar geometry, we obtain average injection spectra (with relatively small
errors) of particles leaving the MSPs. These spectra are next used to predict
cumulative synchrotron and IC spectra expected from 47 Tucanae, which is a
lower limit, as no reacceleration is assumed. We find that the IC radiation
from 47 Tucanae may be visible for H.E.S.S., depending on the nebular field B
as well as the number of MSPs N in the GC. Telescopes such as Chandra and
Hubble may find it difficult to test the SR component prediction of diffuse
radiation if there are many unresolved sources in the field of view. These
results may be rescaled for other GCs where less information is available,
assuming universal GC MSP characteristics.
