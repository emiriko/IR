The first part surveys the push forward formula for elliptic class and
various applications obtained in the papers by L.Borisov and the author. In the
remaining part we discuss the ring of quasi-Jacobi forms which allow to
characterize the functions which are the elliptic genera of almost complex
manifolds and extension of Ochanine elliptic genus to certain singular real
algebraic varieties.
