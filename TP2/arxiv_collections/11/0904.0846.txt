The tau function corresponding to the affine ring of a certain plane
algebraic curve, called (n,s)-curve, embedded in the universal Grassmann
manifold is studied. It is neatly expressed by the multivariate sigma function.
This expression is in turn used to prove fundamental properties on the series
expansion of the sigma function established in a previous paper in a different
method.
