By examining the absolute magnitude (H) distributions (hereafter HD) of the
cold and hot populations in the Kuiper belt and of the Trojans of Jupiter, we
find evidence that the Trojans have been captured from the outer part of the
primordial trans-Neptunian planetesimal disk. We develop a sketch model of the
HDs in the inner and outer parts of the disk that is consistent with the
observed distributions and with the dynamical evolution scenario known as the
`Nice model'. This leads us to predict that the HD of hot population should
have the same slope of the HD of the cold population for 6.5 < H < 9, both as
steep as the slope of the Trojans' HD. Current data partially support this
prediction, but future observations are needed to clarify this issue. Because
the HD of the Trojans rolls over at H~9 to a collisional equilibrium slope that
should have been acquired when the Trojans were still embedded in the
primordial trans-Neptunian disk, our model implies that the same roll-over
should characterize the HDs of the Kuiper belt populations, in agreement with
the results of Bernstein et al. (2004) and Fuentes and Holman (2008). Finally,
we show that the constraint on the total mass of the primordial trans-Neptunian
disk imposed by the Nice model implies that it is unlikely that the cold
population formed beyond 35 AU.
