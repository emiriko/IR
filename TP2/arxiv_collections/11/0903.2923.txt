The aim of this paper is to prove an uncertainty principle for the
representation of a vector in two bases. Our result extends previously known
qualitative uncertainty principles into quantitative estimates. We then show
how to transfer this result to the discrete version of the Short Time Fourier
Transform. An application to trigonometric polynomials is also given.
