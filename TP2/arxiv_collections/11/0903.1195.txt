The magnetostatic interaction between two oppositely charged transverse
domain walls (DWs)in adjacent Permalloy nanowires is experimentally
demonstrated. The dependence of the pinning strength on wire separation is
investigated for distances between 13 and 125 nm, and depinning fields up to 93
Oe are measured. The results can be described fully by considering the
interaction between the full complex distribution of magnetic charge within
rigid, isolated DWs. This suggests the DW internal structure is not appreciably
disturbed by the pinning potential, and that they remain rigid although the
pinning strength is significant. This work demonstrates the possibility of
non-contact DW trapping without DW perturbation and full continuous flexibility
of the pinning potential type and strength. The consequence of the interaction
on DW based data storage schemes is evaluated.
