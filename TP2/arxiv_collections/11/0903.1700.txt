We consider the prospects for probing low-mass dark matter with the
Super-Kamiokande experiment. We show that upcoming analyses including
fully-contained events with sensitivity to dark matter masses from 5 to 10 GeV
can test the dark matter interpretation of the DAMA/LIBRA signal. We consider
prospects of this analysis for two light dark matter candidates: neutralinos
and WIMPless dark matter.
