We describe a new exact relation for large $N_c$ QCD for the long-distance
behavior of baryon form factors in the chiral limit. This model-independent
relation is used to test the consistency of the structure of several baryon
models. All 4D semiclassical chiral soliton models satisfy the relation, as
does the Pomarol-Wulzer holographic model of baryons as 5D Skyrmions. However,
remarkably, we find that the holographic model treating baryons as instantons
in the Sakai-Sugimoto model does not satisfy the relation.
