We propose a new classical theory of gravity which is based on the principle
of equivalence and assumption that gravity, similarly to electrodynamics, is
described by a vector field in Minkowski space-time. We show that such
assumptions yield a unique theory of gravity; it passes all available tests and
free of singularities such as black holes. In the present theory, gravity is
described by four equations which have, e.g., exact analytical solution for
arbitrary static field. For cosmology our equations give essentially the same
evolution of the Universe as general relativity. Predictions of our theory can
be tested within next few years making more accurate measurement of the time
delay of radar signal traveling near the Sun or by resolving the supermassive
object at the center of our Galaxy with VLBA. If general relativity is correct
we must see a steady shadow from a black hole at the Galactic center. If the
present theory is right then likely the shadow will appear and disappear
periodically with a period of about 20 min as we predicted in JCAP 10 (2007)
018. Observation of such oscillations will also provide evidence for dark
matter axion with mass in meV range.
