We propose a new framework for first-principle calculations of heavy-fermion
materials. These are described in terms of the Kondo lattice Hamiltonian with
the parameters extracted from a realistic density functional based calculation
which is then solved using continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo method and
dynamical mean field theory. As an example, we show our results for the Neel
temperatures of Cerium-122 compounds (CeX2Si2 with X=Ru, Rh, Pd, Cu, Ag, and
Au) where the general trend around the magnetic quantum critical point is
successfully reproduced. Our results are organized on a universal Doniach phase
diagram in a semi-quantitative way.
