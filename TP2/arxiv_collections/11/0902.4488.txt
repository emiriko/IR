We study the properties of two-dimensional dilatonic black holes from the
viewpoint of geometrothermodynamics. We show that the thermodynamic curvature
of the equilibrium space vanishes only in the case of a flat spacetime, and it
reproduces correctly the behavior of the thermodynamic interaction and phase
transition structure of the corresponding black hole configurations.
