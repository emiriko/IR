We introduce a robust, error-tolerant adaptive training algorithm for
generalized learning paradigms in high-dimensional superposed quantum networks,
or \emph{adaptive quantum networks}. The formalized procedure applies standard
backpropagation training across a coherent ensemble of discrete topological
configurations of individual neural networks, each of which is formally merged
into appropriate linear superposition within a predefined, decoherence-free
subspace. Quantum parallelism facilitates simultaneous training and revision of
the system within this coherent state space, resulting in accelerated
convergence to a stable network attractor under consequent iteration of the
implemented backpropagation algorithm. Parallel evolution of linear superposed
networks incorporating backpropagation training provides quantitative,
numerical indications for optimization of both single-neuron activation
functions and optimal reconfiguration of whole-network quantum structure.
