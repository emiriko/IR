Magnetic order in graphene-related structures can arise from size effects or
from topological frustration. We introduce a rigorous classification scheme for
the types of finite graphene structures (nano-flakes) which lead to large net
spin or to antiferromagnetic coupling between groups of electron spins. Based
on this scheme, we propose specific examples of structures that can serve as
the fundamental (NOR and NAND) logic gates for the design of high-density
ultra-fast spintronic devices. We demonstrate, using ab initio electronic
structure calculations, that these gates can in principle operate at room
temperature with very low and correctable error rates.
