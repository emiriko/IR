We show that the chirality of triangular antiferromagnetic clusters can be
used as a qubit even if it is entirely decoupled from the total spin of the
cluster. In particular, we estimate the orbital moment associated to the
chirality, and we show that it can be large enough to allow a direct
measurement of the chirality with a field perpendicular to the cluster.
Consequences for molecular magnets are discussed, and an alternative
implementation with Cu atoms on a surface is proposed, for which one- and
two-qubit gates are worked out in detail. Decoherence effects are also
discussed.
