Using a three-dimensional quasiclassical technique we explore the double
ionization pathways of a diatomic molecule driven by an intense infrared
(800nm) ultrashort laser pulse. For intensities corresponding to the tunneling
regime, we find that the three main ionization mechanisms have distinct traces
when considering the sum of the momenta parallel to the laser field as a
function of the inter-electronic angle of escape. In addition, we find that the
previously observed "finger-like" structure in the correlated momenta of the
strongly driven He is also present for strongly driven diatomic molecules. We
show that it is mainly due to the strong interaction, backscattering, the
recolliding electron undergoes from the remaining core.
