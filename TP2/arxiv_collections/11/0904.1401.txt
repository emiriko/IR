By means of white noise analysis, we prove some limit theorems for nonlinear
functionals of a given Volterra process. In particular, our results apply to
fractional Brownian motion (fBm) and should be compared with the classical
convergence results of the 1980s due to Breuer, Dobrushin, Giraitis, Major,
Surgailis and Taqqu, as well as the recent advances concerning the construction
of a L\'{e}vy area for fBm due to Coutin, Qian and Unterberger.
