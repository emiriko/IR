The Born rule may be stated mathematically as the rule that probabilities in
quantum theory are expectation values of a complete orthogonal set of
projection operators. This rule works for single laboratory settings in which
the observer can distinguish all the different possible outcomes corresponding
to the projection operators. However, theories of inflation suggest that the
universe may be so large that any laboratory, no matter how precisely it is
defined by its internal state, may exist in a large number of very distantly
separated copies throughout the vast universe. In this case, no observer within
the universe can distinguish all possible outcomes for all copies of the
laboratory. Then normalized probabilities for the local outcomes that can be
locally distinguished cannot be given by the expectation values of any
projection operators. Thus the Born rule dies and must be replaced by another
rule for observational probabilities in cosmology. The freedom of what this new
rule is to be is the measure problem in cosmology. A particular volume-averaged
form is proposed.
