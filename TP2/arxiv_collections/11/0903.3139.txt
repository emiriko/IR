We reconsider the question of the relative importance of single particle
effects and correlations in the solvable interacting neutrino models introduced
by Friedland and Lunardini and by Bell, Rawlinson and Sawyer. We show, by an
exact calculation, that the two particle correlations are not "small", and that
they dominate the time evolution in these models, in spite of indications to
the contrary from the rate of equilibration. This result holds even after the
model in generalized from the original 2 flavor case to $N$ flavors. The
failure of the Boltzmann single particle approximation in this model is
tentatively attributed to the simplicity of the model, in particular to the
assumption that all neutrinos in the initial state are in flavor eigenstates.
