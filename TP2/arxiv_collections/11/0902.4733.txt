In quantum information theory, von Neumann entropy plays an important role.
The entropies can be obtained analytically only for a few states. In continuous
variable system, even evaluating entropy numerically is not an easy task since
the dimension is infinite. We develop the perturbation theory systematically
for calculating von Neumann entropy of non-degenerate systems as well as
degenerate systems. The result turns out to be a practical way of the expansion
calculation of von Neumann entropy.
