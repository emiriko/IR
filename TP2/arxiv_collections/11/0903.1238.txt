Let X be a complete, geometrically irreducible, singular, algebraic curve
defined over a field of characteristic p big enough. Given a local ring O_{P,X}
at a rational singular point P of X, we attached a universal zeta function
which is a rational function and admits a functional equation if O_{P,X} is
Gorenstein. This universal zeta function specializes to other known zeta
functions and Poincare series attached to singular points of algebraic curves.
In particular, for the local ring attached to a complex analytic function in
two variables, our universal zeta function specializes to the generalized
Poincare series introduced by Campillo, Delgado and Gusein-Zade.
