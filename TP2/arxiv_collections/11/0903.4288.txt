The subject of this paper is a quantification of the impact of uncertainties
in bias and bias evolution on the interpretation of measurements of the
integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect, in particular on the estimation of cosmological
parameters. We carry out a Fisher-matrix analysis for quantifying the
degeneracies between the parameters of a dark energy cosmology and bias
evolution, for the combination of the PLANCK microwave sky survey with the
EUCLID main galaxy sample, where bias evolution b(a)=b_0+(1-a)b_a is modelled
with two parameters b_0 and b_a. Using a realistic bias model introduces a
characteristic suppression of the iSW-spectrum on large angular scales, due to
the altered distance-weighting functions. The errors in estimating cosmological
parameters if the data with evolving bias is interpreted in the framework of
cosmologies with constant bias is quantified in an extended Fisher-formalism.
We find that the best-fit values of all parameters are shifted by an amount
comparable to the statistical accuracy: The estimation bias in units of the
statistical accuracy amounts to 1.19 for Omega_m, 0.27 for sigma_8, and 0.72
for w for bias evolution with b_a=1. Leaving b_a open as a free parameter
deteriorates the statistical accuracy, in particular on Omega_m and w.
