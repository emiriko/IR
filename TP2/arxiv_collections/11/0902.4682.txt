We give some lectures on the work on formal logic of Jacques Herbrand, and
sketch his life and his influence on automated theorem proving. The intended
audience ranges from students interested in logic over historians to logicians.
Besides the well-known correction of Herbrand's False Lemma by Goedel and
Dreben, we also present the hardly known unpublished correction of Heijenoort
and its consequences on Herbrand's Modus Ponens Elimination. Besides Herbrand's
Fundamental Theorem and its relation to the Loewenheim-Skolem-Theorem, we
carefully investigate Herbrand's notion of intuitionism in connection with his
notion of falsehood in an infinite domain. We sketch Herbrand's two proofs of
the consistency of arithmetic and his notion of a recursive function, and last
but not least, present the correct original text of his unification algorithm
with a new translation.
