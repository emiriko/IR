Light nuclei production as a result of nuclear coalescence effect can give
some signals on final state of Quark Gluon Plasma formation. We are studying
the behavior of nuclear modification factor as a function of different
variables using the simulated data coming from the FASTMC generator. This data
is necessary to extract information on coalescence mechanism from experimental
data on high energy nuclear-nuclear interactions.
