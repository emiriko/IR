We present a two-step exact remote state preparation protocol of an arbitrary
qubit with the aid of a three-particle Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state.
Generalization of this protocol for higher-dimensional Hilbert space systems
among three parties is also given. We show that only single-particle von
Neumann measurement, local operation and classical communication are necessary.
Moreover, since the overall information of the quantum state can be divided
into two different parts, which may be at different locations, this protocol
may be useful in the quantum information field.
