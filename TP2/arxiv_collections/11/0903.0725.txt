Investigations of the resistivity and the Hall effect as a function of
electric field and temperature in the normal state and upper part of the
superconducting transition of an optimally doped, very thin film of
YBa$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{7-\delta}$ are reported. Using a fast pulsed-current
technique allowed to reduce the self-heating of the sample and to reach
electric fields up to 1 kV/cm. An intrinsic non-Ohmic behavior of the Hall
conductivity above the critical temperature that appears to originate from two
different, partially counteracting effects is revealed. The major contribution
stems from the suppression of Aslamazov-Larkin superconducting fluctuations in
high electric fields.
