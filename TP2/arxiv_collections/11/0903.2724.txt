In recent years there has been a significant development of the dynamical map
formalism for initially correlated states of a system and its environment.
Based on some of these results, we study quantum process tomography for
initially correlated states of the system and the environment. This is beyond
the usual assumption that the state of the system and the environment are
initially uncorrelated. Since quantum process tomography is an experimental
procedure, we wind up having to study the role of preparation of input states
for open quantum experiments. We work out a theory for the general preparation
procedure, and study two preparation procedures in detail. In specific, we
study the stochastic preparation procedure and the projective preparation
procedure and apply them to quantum process tomography. The two preparation
procedures describe the ways to uncorrelate.....
