Let SL(2,q) be the group of 2X2 matrices with determinant one over a finite
field F of size q.
  We prove that if q is even, then the product of any two noncentral conjugacy
classes of SL(2,q) is the union of at least q-1 distinct conjugacy classes of
SL(2,q). On the other hand, if q>3 is odd, then the product of any two
noncentral conjugacy classes of SL(2,q) is the union of at least (q+3)/2
distinct conjugacy classes of SL(2,q).
