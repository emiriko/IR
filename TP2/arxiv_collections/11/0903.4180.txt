The status of the chiral tensor particles in the extended electroweak model,
their experimental constraints, signatures and the possibilities for their
detection at the new colliders are reviewed. The characteristic interactions of
the chiral tensor particles in the early Universe plasma and the corresponding
period of their cosmological influence is determined. The dynamical
cosmological effect, namely the speeding of the Friedmann expansion due to the
density increase caused by the introduction of the new particles, is evaluated.
  It is shown that the existence of the chiral tensor particles is allowed from
cosmological considerations and welcomed by the particle physics phenomenology.
