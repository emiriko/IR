In this paper, a new identity-based identification scheme based on
error-correcting codes is proposed. Two well known code-based schemes are
combined : the signature scheme by Courtois, Finiasz and Sendrier and an
identification scheme by Stern. A proof of security for the scheme in the
Random Oracle Model is given.
