We provide a straightforward and numerically efficient procedure to perform
local density approximation + Hubbard I (LDA+HIA) calculations, including
self-consistency over the charge density, within the full potential linearized
augmented plane wave (FP-LAPW) method. This implementation is all-electron,
includes spin-orbit interaction, and makes no shape approximations for the
charge density. The method is applied to calculate selected heavy actinides in
the paramagnetic phase. The electronic structure and spectral properties of Am
and Cm metals obtained are in agreement with previous dynamical mean-field
theory (LDA+DMFT) calculations and with available experimental data. We point
out that the charge density self-consistent LDA+HIA calculations predict the
$f$ charge on Bk to exceed the atomic integer $f^8$ value by 0.22.
