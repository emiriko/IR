States in quantum field theory (QFT) are represented by many-particle wave
functions, such that a state describing n particles depends on n spacetime
positions. Since a general state is a superposition of states with different
numbers of particles, the wave function lives in the configuration space
identified with a product of an infinite number of 4-dimensional Minkowski
spacetimes. The squared absolute value of the wave function is interpreted as
the probability density in the configuration space, from which the standard
probabilistic predictions of QFT can be recovered. Such a formulation and
probabilistic interpretation of QFT allows to interpret the wave function as a
pilot wave that describes deterministic particle trajectories, which
automatically includes a deterministic and continuous description of particle
creation and destruction. In particular, when the conditional wave function
associated with a quantum measurement ceases to depend on one of the spacetime
coordinates, then the 4-velocity of the corresponding particle vanishes,
describing a trajectory that stops at a particular point in spacetime. In a
more general situation a dependence on this spacetime coordinate is negligibly
small but not strictly zero, in which case the trajectory does not stop but the
measuring apparatus still behaves as if this particle has been destroyed.
