The interaction between a superconducting phase qubit and the two-level
systems locating inside the Josephson tunnel barrier is shown to be described
by the XY model, which is naturally used to implement the iSWAP gate. With this
gate, we propose a scheme to efficiently generate genuine multi-qubit entangled
states of such two-level systems, including multipartite W state and cluster
states. In particularly, we show that, with the help of the phase qubit, the
entanglement witness can be used to efficiently detect the produced genuine
multi-qubit entangled states. Furthermore, we analyze that the proposed
approach for generating multi-qubit entangled states can be used in a wide
class of candidates for quantum computation.
