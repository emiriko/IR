We investigate theoretically light scattering of photons by ultracold atoms
in an optical lattice in the linear regime. A full quantum theory for the
atom-photon interactions is developed as a function of the atomic state in the
lattice along the Mott-insulator -- superfluid phase transition, and the
photonic scattering cross section is evaluated as a function of the energy and
of the direction of emission. The predictions of this theory are compared with
the theoretical results of a recent work on Bragg scattering in time-of-flight
measurements [A.M. Rey, {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. A {\bf 72}, 023407 (2005)]. We
show that, when performing Bragg spectroscopy with light scattering, the photon
recoil gives rise to an additional atomic site to site hopping, which can
interfere with ordinary tunneling of matter waves and can significantly affect
the photonic scattering cross section.
