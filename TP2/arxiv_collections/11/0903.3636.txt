Recent observations on Type-Ia supernovae and low density ($\Omega_{m} =
0.3$) measurement of matter including dark matter suggest that the present-day
universe consists mainly of repulsive-gravity type `exotic matter' with
negative-pressure often said `dark energy' ($\Omega_{x} = 0.7$). But the nature
of dark energy is mysterious and its puzzling questions, such as why, how,
where and when about the dark energy, are intriguing. In the present paper the
authors attempt to answer these questions while making an effort to reveal the
genesis of dark energy and suggest that `the cosmological nuclear binding
energy liberated during primordial nucleo-synthesis remains trapped for a long
time and then is released free which manifests itself as dark energy in the
universe'. It is also explained why for dark energy the parameter $w = -
{2/3}$. Noting that $ w = 1$ for stiff matter and $w = {1/3}$ for radiation; $w
= - {2/3}$ is for dark energy because $"-1"$ is due to `deficiency of
stiff-nuclear-matter' and that this binding energy is ultimately released as
`radiation' contributing $"+ {1/3}"$, making $w = -1 + {1/3} = - {2/3}$. When
dark energy is released free at $Z = 80$, $w = -{2/3}$. But as on present day
at $Z = 0$ when radiation strength has diminished to $\delta \to 0$, $w = -1 +
\delta{1/3} = - 1$. This, thus almost solves the dark-energy mystery of
negative pressure and repulsive-gravity. The proposed theory makes several
estimates /predictions which agree reasonably well with the astrophysical
constraints and observations. Though there are many candidate-theories, the
proposed model of this paper presents an entirely new approach (cosmological
nuclear energy) as a possible candidate for dark energy.
