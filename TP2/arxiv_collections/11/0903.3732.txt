Observation of an anomalous temperature dependence of the spin
susceptibility, along with a spin gap in NMR, in the quantum paramagnetic
normal state of Iron Pnictides is a signature of an unusual metallic state. We
argue that both these anomalous features are associated with a wide
fluctuational regime dominated by dynamical, short-ranged and frustrated spin
correlations in a strongly correlated metal. Using LDA+DMFT, we show that both
these features can be quantitatively undertstood in the doped Fe-pnictides. We
argue that such spin correlations naturally arise in a Mottness scenario, where
an effective, dualistic description involves coexisting renormalized
quasiparticles and effectively localized moments, arising from the same set of
d bands.
