As part of the conceptual and preliminary design processes of the Thirty
Meter Telescope (TMT), the TMT site testing team has spent the last five years
measuring the atmospheric properties of five candidate mountains in North and
South America with an unprecedented array of instrumentation. The site testing
period was preceded by several years of analyses selecting the five candidates,
Cerros Tolar, Armazones and Tolonchar in northern Chile; San Pedro Martir in
Baja California, Mexico and the 13 North (13N) site on Mauna Kea, Hawaii. Site
testing was concluded by the selection of two remaining sites for further
consideration, Armazones and Mauna Kea 13N. It showed that all five candidates
are excellent sites for an extremely large astronomical observatory and that
none of the sites stands out as the obvious and only logical choice based on
its combined properties. This is the first article in a series discussing the
TMT site testing project.
