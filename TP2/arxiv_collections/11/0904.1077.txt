This article gives the perturbative NNLO results for the most commonly used
event shape variables associated to three-jet events in electron-positron
annihilation: Thrust, heavy jet mass, wide jet broadening, total jet
broadening, C parameter and the Durham three-to-two jet transition variable. In
addition the NNLO results for the jet rates corresponding to the Durham,
Geneva, Jade-E0 and Cambridge jet algorithms are presented.
