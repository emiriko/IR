This paper proposes an agent-based model which reproduces different
structures of animal groups. The shape and structure of the group is the effect
of simple interaction rules among individuals: each animal deploys itself
depending on the position of a limited number of close group mates. The
proposed model is shown to produce clustered formations, as well as lines and
V-like formations. The key factors which trigger the onset of different
patterns are argued to be the relative strength of attraction and repulsion
forces and, most important, the anisotropy in their application.
