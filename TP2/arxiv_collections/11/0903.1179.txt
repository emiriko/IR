We present a Bayesian approach to calculating the coefficients that convert
the outputs of ALMA 183 GHz water-vapour radiometers into estimates of path
fluctuations which can then be used to correct the observed interferometric
visibilities. The key features of the approach are a simple, thin-layer,
three-parameter model of the atmosphere; using the absolute measurements from
the radiometers to constrain the model; priors to incorporate physical
constraints and ancillary information; and a Markov Chain Monte Carlo
characterisation of the posterior distribution including full distributions for
the phase correction coefficients. The outcomes of the procedure are therefore
estimates of the coefficients and their confidence intervals. We illustrate the
technique with simulations showing some degeneracies that can arise and the
importance of priors in tackling them. We then apply the technique to an
hour-long test observation at the Sub-Millimetre Array and find that the
technique is stable and that, in this case, its performance is close to
optimal. The modelling is described in detail in the appendices and all of the
implementation source code is made publicly available under the GPL.
