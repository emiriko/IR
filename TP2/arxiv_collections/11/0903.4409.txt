We have recently examined a large number of points in the parameter space of
the phenomenological MSSM, the 19-dimensional parameter space of the
CP-conserving MSSM with Minimal Flavor Violation. We determined whether each of
these points satisfied existing experimental and theoretical constraints. This
analysis provides insight into general features of the MSSM without reference
to a particular SUSY breaking scenario or any other assumptions at the GUT
scale. This study opens up new possibilities for SUSY phenomenology both in
colliders and in astrophysical experiments. Here we shall discuss the
implications of this analysis relevant to the study of dark matter.
