Classical collisions with an ideal gas generate non-Maxwellian distribution
functions for a single ion in a radio frequency ion trap. The distributions
have power-law tails whose exponent depends on the ratio of buffer gas to ion
mass. This provides a statistical explanation for the previously observed
transition from cooling to heating. Monte Carlo results approximate a Tsallis
distribution over a wide range of parameters and have ab initio agreement with
experiment.
