B-modes in CMB polarization from patchy reionization arise from two effects:
generation of polarization from scattering of quadrupole moments by
reionization bubbles, and fluctuations in the screening of E-modes from
recombination. The scattering contribution has been studied previously, but the
screening contribution has not yet been calculated. We show that on scales
smaller than the acoustic scale (l>300), the B-mode power from screening is
larger than the B-mode power from scattering. The ratio approaches a constant
~2.5 below the damping scale (l>2000). On degree scales relevant for
gravitational waves (l<100), screening B-modes have a white noise tail and are
subdominant to the scattering effect. These results are robust to uncertainties
in the modeling of patchy reionization.
