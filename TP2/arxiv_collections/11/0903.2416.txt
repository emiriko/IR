We present numerical simulation studies of the steady-state magnetization
dynamics driven by a spin-polarized current in a point contact geometry for the
case of a relatively large contact diameter (D = 80 nm) and small external
field (H = 30 Oe). We show, that under these conditions the magnetization
dynamics is qualitatively different from the dynamics observed for small
contacts in large external fields. In particular, the 'bullet' mode with a
homogeneous mode core, which was the dominating localized mode for small
contacts, is not found here. Instead, all localized oscillation modes observed
in simulations correspond to different motion kinds of vortex-antivortex (V-AV)
pairs. These kinds include rotational and translational motion of pairs with
the V-AV distance d ~ D and creation/annihilation of much smaller (satellite)
V-AV pairs. We also show that for the geometry studied here the Oersted field
has a qualitative effect on the magnetization dynamics of a 'free' layer. This
effect offers a possibility to control magnetization dynamics by a suitable
electric contact setup, optimized to produce a desired Oersted field. Finally,
we demonstrate that when the magnetization dynamics of the 'fixed' layer
(induced only by the stray field interaction with the 'free' layer) is taken
into account, the threshold current for the oscillation onset is drastically
reduced and new types of localized modes appear. In conclusion, we show that
our simulations reproduce semiquantitatively several important features of the
magnetization dynamics in a point contact system for low external fields
reported experimentally.
