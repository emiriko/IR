The thermal pairwise entanglement (TE) of the S=1/2 XY chain in a transverse
magnetic field is exactly resolved by means of the Jordan-Wigner
transformation. It is found that the TE vanishes at a common temperature
Tc~0.4843J, which is irrelevant to the field. A thermal quantity is proposed to
witness the entangled state. Furthermore, the TE of the S=1/2
antiferromagnetic-ferromagnetic (AF-F) Heisenberg chain is studied by the
transfer-matrix renormalization group method.The TEs of the spins coupled by AF
and F interactions are found to behave distinctively. The vanishing temperature
of the field-induced TE of the spins coupled by F interactions is observed to
change with the magnetic field. The results are further confirmed and analyzed
by the mean-field theory.
