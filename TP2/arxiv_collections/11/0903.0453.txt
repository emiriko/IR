We study partially occupied lattice systems of classical magnetic dipoles
which point along randomly oriented axes. Only dipolar interactions are taken
into account. The aim of the model is to mimic collective effects in disordered
assemblies of magnetic nanoparticles. From tempered Monte Carlo simulations, we
obtain the following equilibrium results. The zero temperature entropy
approximately vanishes. Below a temperature T_c, given by k_B T_c= (0.95 +-
0.1)x e_d, where e_d is a nearest neighbor dipole-dipole interaction energy and
x is the site occupancy rate, we find a spin glass phase. In it, (1) the mean
value <|q|>, where q is the spin overlap, decreases algebraically with system
size N as N increases, and (2) D|q| = 0.5 <|q|> (T/x)^1/2, independently of N,
where D|q| is the root mean square deviation of |q|.
