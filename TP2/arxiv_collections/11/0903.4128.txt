We consider adapting the transmission rate to maximize the goodput, i.e., the
amount of data transmitted without error, over a continuous Markov flat-fading
wireless channel. In particular, we consider schemes in which transmitter
channel state is inferred from degraded causal error-rate feedback, such as
packet-level ACK/NAKs in an automatic repeat request (ARQ) system. In such
schemes, the choice of transmission rate affects not only the subsequent
goodput but also the subsequent feedback, implying that the optimal rate
schedule is given by a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP).
Because solution of the POMDP is computationally impractical, we consider
simple suboptimal greedy rate assignment and show that the optimal scheme would
itself be greedy if the error-rate feedback was non-degraded. Furthermore, we
show that greedy rate assignment using non-degraded feedback yields a total
goodput that upper bounds that of optimal rate assignment using degraded
feedback. We then detail the implementation of the greedy scheme and propose a
reduced-complexity greedy scheme that adapts the transmission rate only once
per block of packets. We also investigate the performance of the schemes
numerically, and show that the proposed greedy scheme achieves steady-state
goodputs that are reasonably close to the upper bound on goodput calculated
using non-degraded feedback. A similar improvement is obtained in steady-state
goodput, drop rate, and average buffer occupancy in the presence of data
buffers. We also investigate an upper bound on the performance of optimal rate
assignment for a discrete approximation of the channel and show that such
quantization leads to a significant loss in achievable goodput.
