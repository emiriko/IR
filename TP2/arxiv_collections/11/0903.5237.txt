We consider discrete minimal surface algebras (DMSA) as generalized
noncommutative analogues of minimal surfaces in higher dimensional spheres.
These algebras appear naturally in membrane theory, where sequences of their
representations are used as a regularization. After showing that the defining
relations of the algebra are consistent, and that one can compute a basis of
the enveloping algebra, we give several explicit examples of DMSAs in terms of
subsets of sl(n) (any semi-simple Lie algebra providing a trivial example by
itself). A special class of DMSAs are Yang-Mills algebras. The representation
graph is introduced to study representations of DMSAs of dimension d<=4, and
properties of representations are related to properties of graphs. The
representation graph of a tensor product is (generically) the Cartesian product
of the corresponding graphs. We provide explicit examples of irreducible
representations and, for coinciding eigenvalues, classify all the unitary
representations of the corresponding algebras.
