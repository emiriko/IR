The generalized symmetry method is applied to a class of completely discrete
equations including the Adler-Bobenko-Suris list. Assuming the existence of a
generalized symmetry, we derive a few integrability conditions suitable for
testing and classifying equations of this class. Those conditions are used at
the end to test for integrability discretizations of some well-known hyperbolic
equations.
