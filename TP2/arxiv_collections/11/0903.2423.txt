Recently we proposed a new approach to the testing of dark energy models
based on the observational data. In that work we focused particularly on
quintessence models for demonstration and invoked a widely used parametrization
of the dark energy equation of state. In this paper we take the more recent SN
Ia, CMB and BAO data, invoke the same parametrization, and apply this method of
consistency test to five categories of dark energy models, including the LCDM
model, the generalized Chaplygin gas, and three quintessence models:
exponential, power-law and inverse-exponential potentials. We find that the
exponential potential of quintessence is ruled out at the 95.4% confidence
level, while the other four models are consistent with data. This consistency
test can be efficiently performed since for all models it requires the
constraint of only a single parameter space that by choice can be easily
accessed.
