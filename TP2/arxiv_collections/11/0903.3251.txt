We present the discovery of the widest (~6700 AU) very low mass field binary
to date, found in a proper motion cross-match of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
and the Two Micron All Sky Survey. Our follow-up J-band imaging provides a
10-year baseline for measuring proper motions. Consequently, we are able to
confirm the common proper motion of the pair to within 10 mas, implying a 99.5%
probability of their physical association. Near infrared spectra of the
components indicate spectral types of M6+/-1 and M7+/-1. The system resides at
a spectroscopic distance of 105+/-13 pc and has an angular separation of
63.38+/-0.05 arcsec. We have used evolutionary models to infer component masses
of 0.105^{+0.029}_{-0.017} M_sun and 0.091^{+0.010}_{-0.007} Msun. The large
separation and low binding energy of this system can provide constraints for
formation models of very low mass stars.
