This paper studies the problem of the deterministic version of the
Verification Theorem for the optimal m-states switching in infinite horizon
under Markovian framework with arbitrary switching cost functions. The problem
is formulated as an extended impulse control problem and solved by means of
probabilistic tools such as the Snell envelop of processes and reflected
backward stochastic differential equations. A viscosity solutions approach is
employed to carry out a finne analysis on the associated system of m
variational inequalities with inter-connected obstacles. We show that the
vector of value functions of the optimal problem is the unique viscosity
solution to the system. This problem is in relation with the valuation of firms
in a financial market.
