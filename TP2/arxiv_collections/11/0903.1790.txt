A dielectric anomaly has been found near the incommensurate to commensurate
antiferromagnetic phase transition (TN2=230 K) in YBaCuFeO5 ceramics, a
compound which crystallizes in an ordered perovskite structure. The existence
of electric polarization below TN2 suggests the magnetism induced charge
polarization effect that is also confirmed by its strong magnetic field
dependence below TN2. Accordingly, the peak near TN2 of the magnetodielectric
effect indicates a maximum of magnetodielectric susceptibility near the spin
reorientation transition. Considering the abundance of magnetic compounds which
structures derive from the perovskite, these results might open up the way
toward the control of electric polarization near room temperature.
