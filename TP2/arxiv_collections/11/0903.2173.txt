This paper invents the notion of torified varieties: A torification of a
scheme is a decomposition of the scheme into split tori. A torified variety is
a reduced scheme of finite type over $\Z$ that admits a torification. Toric
varieties, split Chevalley schemes and flag varieties are examples of this type
of scheme. Given a torified variety whose torification is compatible with an
affine open covering, we construct a gadget in the sense of Connes-Consani and
an object in the sense of Soul\'e and show that both are varieties over $\F_1$
in the corresponding notion. Since toric varieties and split Chevalley schemes
satisfy the compatibility condition, we shed new light on all examples of
varieties over $\F_1$ in the literature so far. Furthermore, we compare
Connes-Consani's geometry, Soul\'e's geometry and Deitmar's geometry, and we
discuss to what extent Chevalley groups can be realized as group objects over
$\F_1$ in the given categories.
