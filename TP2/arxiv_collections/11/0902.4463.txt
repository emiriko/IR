We present Sapporo, a library for performing high-precision gravitational
N-body simulations on NVIDIA Graphical Processing Units (GPUs). Our library
mimics the GRAPE-6 library, and N-body codes currently running on GRAPE-6 can
switch to Sapporo by a simple relinking of the library. The precision of our
library is comparable to that of GRAPE-6, even though internally the GPU
hardware is limited to single precision arithmetics. This limitation is
effectively overcome by emulating double precision for calculating the distance
between particles. The performance loss of this operation is small (< 20%)
compared to the advantage of being able to run at high precision. We tested the
library using several GRAPE-6-enabled N-body codes, in particular with Starlab
and phiGRAPE. We measured peak performance of 800 Gflop/s for running with 10^6
particles on a PC with four commercial G92 architecture GPUs (two GeForce
9800GX2). As a production test, we simulated a 32k Plummer model with equal
mass stars well beyond core collapse. The simulation took 41 days, during which
the mean performance was 113 Gflop/s. The GPU did not show any problems from
running in a production environment for such an extended period of time.
