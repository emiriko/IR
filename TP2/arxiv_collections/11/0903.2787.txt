We perform a computational study of a variant of the ``train'' model for
earthquakes [PRA 46, 6288 (1992)], where we assume a static friction that is a
stochastic function of position rather than being velocity dependent. The model
consists of an array of blocks coupled by springs, with the forces between
neighbouring blocks balanced by static friction. We calculate the probability,
P(s), of the occurrence of avalanches with a size s or greater, finding that
our results are consistent with the phenomenology and also with previous models
which exhibit a power law over a wide range. We show that the train model may
be mapped onto a stochastic sandpile model and study a variant of the latter
for non-spherical grains. We show that, in this case, the model has critical
behaviour only for grains with large aspect ratio, as was already shown in
experiments with real ricepiles. We also demonstrate a way to introduce
randomness in a physically motivated manner into the model.
