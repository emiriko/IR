Quantum Darwinism describes the proliferation, in the environment, of
multiple records of selected states of a quantum system. It explains how the
fragility of a state of a single quantum system can lead to the classical
robustness of states of their correlated multitude; shows how effective
`wave-packet collapse' arises as a result of proliferation throughout the
environment of imprints of the states of quantum system; and provides a
framework for the derivation of Born's rule, which relates probability of
detecting states to their amplitude. Taken together, these three advances mark
considerable progress towards settling the quantum measurement problem.
