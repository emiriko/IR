We report on the generation of multiwavelength gain-guided soliton (GGS) in
an all normal dispersion birefringent fiber laser passively mode-locked with a
semiconductor saturable absorber mirror (SESAM). Determined by the cavity
birefringence, we observe the stable single-, dual- and triple- wavelength mode
locked GGSs, which is a natural consequence of the mutual nonlinear interaction
among the normal cavity dispersion, cavity fiber nonlinear Kerr effect, laser
gain saturation and bandwidth limitation resulting from the intra-cavity
birefringent filter.
