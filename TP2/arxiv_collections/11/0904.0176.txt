A cell dynamics method for domain separation of diblock copolymers (DBCPs)
interacting with nanoparticles (NPs) whose diffusion coefficients depend on
chain configuration is proposed for self-assembly of DBCP/NP composites.
Increasing NP concentration slows down domain separation, but matching NP
diffusion lengths and lamellar size of DBCPs reduces this effect. The model
also explains features of different nanocomposites, such as morphological
transitions induced by NPs, the coexistence of lamellar and hexagonal patterns
in a single sample and peaked NP density profiles across the parallel domains.
