Given the solution $f$ of the sequential fractional differential equation
$_{a}D_{t}^{\alpha}(_{a}D_{t}^{\alpha}f)+P(t)f=0$, $t\in[b,c]$, where
$-\infty<a<b<c<+\infty$, $\alpha\in({1/2},1)$ and
$P:[a,+\infty)\to[0,P_{\infty}]$, $P_{\infty}<+\infty$, is continuous, assume
that there exist $t_1,t_2\in[b,c]$ such that
$f(t_1)=(_{a}D_{t}^{\alpha}f)(t_2)=0$. Then, we establish here a positive lower
bound for $c-a$ which depends solely on $\alpha,P_{\infty}$. Such a result
might be useful in discussing disconjugate fractional differential equations
and fractional interpolation, similarly to the case of (integer order) ordinary
differential equations.
