We study triangular clusters of three spin-1/2 Kondo or Anderson impurities
that are coupled to two conduction leads. In the case of Kondo impurities, the
model takes the form of an antiferromagnetic Heisenberg ring with Kondo-like
exchange coupling to continuum electrons. We show that this model exhibits many
types of the behavior found in various simpler one and two-impurity models,
thereby enabling the study of crossovers between a number of Fermi-liquid (FL)
and non-Fermi-liquid (NFL) fixed points. In particular, we explore a direct
crossover between the two-impurity Kondo-model NFL fixed point and the
two-channel Kondo-model NFL fixed point. We show that the concept of the
two-stage Kondo effect applies even in the case when the first-stage Kondo
state is of NFL type. In the case of Anderson impurities, we consider the
transport properties of three coupled quantum dots. This class of models
includes as limiting cases the familiar serial double quantum dot and triple
quantum dot nanostructures. By extracting the quasiparticle scattering phase
shifts, we compute the low-temperature conductance as a function of the
inter-impurity tunneling-coupling. We point out that due to the existence of
exponentially low temperature scales, there is a parameter range where the
stable "zero-temperature" fixed point is essentially never reached (not even in
numerical renormalization group calculations). The "zero-temperature"
conductance is then of no interest and it may only be meaningful to compute the
conductance at finite temperature. This illustrates the perils of studying the
conductance in the ground state and considering thermal fluctuations only as a
small correction.
