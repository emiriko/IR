The Lipschitz and C^1 harmonic capacities K and K_c in R^n can be considered
as high-dimensional versions of the so-called analytic and continuous analytic
capacities G and A (respectively). In this paper we provide a dual
characterization of K_c in the spirit of the classical one for the capacity A
by means of the Garabedian function.
