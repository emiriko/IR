It is now increasingly realized that the underlying mechanism which governs
aging (ageing) is a complex interplay of genetic regulation and
damage-accumulation. "Aging as a result of accumulation of 'faults' on cellular
and molecular levels", has been proposed in the damage (fault)-accumulation
theory. However, this theory fails to explain some aging phenotypes such as
fibrosis and premature aging, since terms such as 'damage' and 'fault' are not
specified. Therefore we introduce some crucial modifications of this theory and
arrive at a novel theory: aging of the body is the result of accumulation of
Misrepair of tissue. It emphasizes: a) it is Misrepair, not the original
damage, that accumulates and leads to aging; and b) aging can occur at
different levels, however aging of the body takes place necessarily on the
tissue level, but not requiring the aging of cells/molecules. The
Misrepair-accumulation theory introduced in the present paper unifies the
understanding of the roles of environmental damage, repair, gene regulation,
and multicellular structure in the aging process. This theory gives
explanations for the aging phenotypes, premature aging, the difference of
longevity in different species, and it is consistent with the physical view on
complex systems.
