In this paper we mainly focus on the curvature perturbation generated at the
end of multi-field inflation, such as the multi-brid inflation. Since the
curvature perturbation is produced on the super-horizon scale, the bispectrum
and trispectrum have a local shape. The size of bispectrum is measured by
$f_{NL}$ and the trispectrum is characterized by two parameters $\tau_{NL}$ and
$g_{NL}$. For simplicity, the trajectory of inflaton is assumed to be a
straight line in the field space and then the entropic perturbations do not
contribute to the curvature perturbation during inflation. As long as the
background inflaton path is not orthogonal to the hyper-surface for inflation
to end, the entropic perturbation can make a contribution to the curvature
perturbation at the end of inflation and a large local-type non-Gaussiantiy is
expected. An interesting thing is that the non-Gaussianity parameters are
completely determined by the geometric properties of the hyper-surface of the
end of inflation. For example, $f_{NL}$ is proportional to the curvature of the
curve on this hyper-surface along the adiabatic direction and $g_{NL}$ is
related to the change of the curvature radius per unit arc-length of this
curve. Both $f_{NL}$ and $g_{NL}$ can be positive or negative respectively, but
$\tau_{NL}$ must be positive and not less than $({6\over 5}f_{NL})^2$.
