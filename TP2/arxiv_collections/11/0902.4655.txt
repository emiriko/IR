We investigate the ground state of one-dimensional few-atom Bose-Bose
mixtures under harmonic confinement throughout the crossover from weak to
strong inter-species attraction. The calculations are based on the numerically
exact multi-configurational time-dependent Hartree method. For repulsive
components we detail the condition for the formation of a molecular
Tonks-Girardeau gas in the regime of intermediate inter-species interactions,
and the formation of a molecular condensate for stronger coupling. Beyond a
critical inter-species attraction, the system collapses to an overall bound
state. Different pathways emerge for unequal particle numbers and intra-species
interactions. In particular, for mixtures with one attractive component, this
species can be viewed as an effective potential dimple in the trap center for
the other, repulsive component.
