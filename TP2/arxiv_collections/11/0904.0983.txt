We present new calculations for the Stark broadening of the hydrogen line
profiles in the dense atmospheres of white dwarf stars. Our improved model is
based on the unified theory of Stark broadening from Vidal, Cooper & Smith, but
it also includes non-ideal gas effects from the Hummer & Mihalas occupation
probability formalism directly inside the line profile calculations. This
approach improves upon previous calculations that relied on the use of an
ad-hoc free parameter to describe the dissolution of the line wing opacity in
the presence of high electric microfields in the plasma. We present here the
first grid of model spectra for hot Teff >~ 12,000 K DA white dwarfs that has
no free parameters. The atmospheric parameters obtained from optical and UV
spectroscopic observations using these improved models are shown to differ
substantially from those published in previous studies.
