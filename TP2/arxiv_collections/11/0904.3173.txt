A crystallographic and magnetic phase diagram of SmFeAsO1-xFx is determined
as a function of x in terms of temperature based on electrical transport and
magnetization, synchrotron powder x-ray diffraction, 57Fe Mossbauer spectra
(MS), and 149Sm nuclear resonant forward scattering (NRFS) measurements. MS
revealed that the magnetic moments of Fe were aligned antiferromagnetically at
~144 K (TN(Fe)). The magnetic moment of Fe (MFe) is estimated to be 0.34
myuB/Fe at 4.2 K for undoped SmFeAsO; MFe is quenched in superconducting
F-doped SmFeAsO. 149Sm NRFS spectra revealed that the magnetic moments of Sm
start to order antiferromagnetically at 5.6 K (undoped) and 4.4 K (TN(Sm)) (x =
0.069). Results clearly indicate that the antiferromagnetic Sm sublattice
coexists with the superconducting phase in SmFeAsO1-xFx below TN(Sm), while
antiferromagnetic Fe sublattice does not coexist with the superconducting
phase.
