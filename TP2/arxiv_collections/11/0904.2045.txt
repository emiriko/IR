Adaptive techniques make practical many quantum measurements that would
otherwise be beyond current laboratory capabilities. For example: they allow
discrimination of nonorthogonal states with a probability of error equal to the
Helstrom bound; they allow measurement of the phase of a quantum oscillator
with accuracy approaching (or in some cases attaining) the Heisenberg limit;
and they allow estimation of phase in interferometry with a variance scaling at
the Heisenberg limit, using only single qubit measurement and control. Each of
these examples has close links with quantum information, in particular
experimental optical quantum information: the first is a basic quantum
communication protocol; the second has potential application in linear optical
quantum computing; the third uses an adaptive protocol inspired by the quantum
phase estimation algorithm. We discuss each of these examples, and their
implementation in the laboratory, but concentrate upon the last, which was
published most recently [Higgins {\em et al.}, Nature vol. 450, p. 393, 2007].
