We compute the full one-loop Electro-Weak (EW) contributions of O(alpha_S
alpha_EM^3) entering the electron-positron into a quark-antiquark pair plus one
gluon cross section at the Z peak and LC energies in presence of polarisation
of the initial state and by retaining the event orientation of the final state.
We include both factorisable and non-factorisable virtual corrections, photon
bremsstrahlung but not the real emission of W^\pm and Z bosons. Their
importance for the final state orientation is illustrated for beam polarisation
setups achieved at SLC and foreseen at ILC and CLIC.
