Laser angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) is employed to
investigate the temperature (T) dependence of the electronic structure in
BaFe2As2 across the magneto-structural transition at TN ~ 140 K. A drastic
transformation in Fermi surface (FS) shape across TN is observed, as expected
by first-principles band calculations. Polarization-dependent ARPES and band
calculations consistently indicate that the observed FSs at kz ~ pi in the
low-T antiferromagnetic (AF) state are dominated by the Fe3dzx orbital, leading
to the two-fold electronic structure. These results indicate that
magneto-structural transition in BaFe2As2 accompanies orbital-dependent
modifications in the electronic structure.
