The dramatic slowdown of glass-forming liquids has been variously linked to
increasing dynamic and static correlation lengths. Yet, empirical evidence is
insufficient to decide among competing theories. The random first order theory
(RFOT) links the dynamic slowdown to the growth of amorphous static order,
whose range depends on a balance between configurational entropy and surface
tension. This last quantity is expected to vanish when the temperature
surpasses a spinodal point beyond which there are no metastable states. Here we
measure for the first time the surface tension in a model glass-former, and
find that it vanishes at the energy separating minima from saddles,
demonstrating the existence of a spinodal point for amorphous metastable order.
Moreover, the fluctuations of surface tension become smaller for lower
temperatures, in quantitative agreement with recent theoretical speculation
that spatial correlations in glassy systems relax nonexponentially because of
the narrowing of the surface tension distribution.
