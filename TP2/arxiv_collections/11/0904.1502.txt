Thin films of Fe(1+delta)Se(1-x)Te(x) (delta ~ 0.18 & x ~ 0.5) have been
successfully grown on (100) oriented single crystalline SrTiO3 and LaAlO3
substrates by pulsed laser deposition. The crystal structure was characterized
by x-ray diffraction, and the superconducting properties by electrical
resistivity measurements. X-ray diffraction analysis establishes the epitaxial
growth of the films with c-axis orientation. Atomic force microscopy showed a
smooth surface morphology for the films grown on SrTiO3 substrates. All the
films are observed to be superconducting with a Tc of ~ 8-14 K depending on the
deposition conditions. The deposition parameters were optimized to obtain good
quality films with Tc comparable to that of the target material.
