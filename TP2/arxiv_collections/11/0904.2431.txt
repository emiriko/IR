We construct N=1 A-D-E quiver gauge theory with the gauge kinetic term which
depends on the adjoint chiral superfields, as a low energy effective theory on
D5-branes wrapped on 2-cycles of Calabi-Yau 3-fold in IIB string theory. The
field-dependent gauge kinetic term can be engineered by introducing B-field
which holomorphically varies on the base space (complex plane) of Calabi-Yau.
We consider Weyl reflection on A-D-E node, which acts non-trivially on the
gauge kinetic term. It is known that Weyl reflection is related to N=1
electric-magnetic duality. Therefore, the non-trivial action implies an
extension of the electric-magnetic duality to the case with the field-dependent
gauge kinetic term. We show that this extended duality is consistent from the
field theoretical point of view. We also consider the duality map of the
operators.
