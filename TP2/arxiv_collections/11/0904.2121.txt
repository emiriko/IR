We study the collisional loss of atom-molecule coherence after coherently
dissociating a small fraction of a molecular Bose-Einstein condensate into
atoms. The obtained $n$-atoms states are two-atom (SU(1,1)) coherent states
with number variance $\Delta n\propto n$ compared to $\Delta n\propto \sqrt{n}$
for the spin (SU(2)) coherent states formed by coherent splitting of an atomic
condensate. Consequently, the Lorentzian atom-molecule phase-diffusion is
faster than the Gaussian phase-diffusion between separated atomic condensates,
by a $\sqrt{n}$ factor.
