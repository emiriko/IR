The present paper deals with the use of the so-called broken symmetry method
for the estimation of the Heisemberg exchange coupling constants. Tetra-nuclear
model (square-H4) and chemical
(Bis(di-mu-ethoxo-bis(3,5-di-tert-butylsemiquinonato)dicopper(II))) molecules
are considered for the analysis. The overdetermination of the problem at hand
was exploited to lead to intrinsic relationships between BS energies
(independent of spin or exchange couplings). It is demonstrated that only 2
sets of exchange coupling parameters can be obtained from the calculations. The
singular values decomposition (SVD) is proposed for the collection of the best
parameters that satisfy all linear equations, within modern computers accuracy.
Numerical applications as well as the composition of broken symmetry
determinants as function of real spin states are discussed.
