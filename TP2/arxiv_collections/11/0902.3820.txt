In minimal supergravity (mSugra), the neutrino sector is related to the
slepton sector by means of the renormalization group equations. This opens a
door to indirectly test the neutrino sector via measurements at the LHC.
Concretely, for the simplest seesaw type-I, we present the correlations between
seesaw parameters and ratio of stau lepton flavour violating (LFV) branching
ratios. We find some simple, extreme scenarios for the unknown right-handed
parameters, where ratios of LFV rates correlate with neutrino oscillation
parameters. On the other hand, we scan the mSugra parameter space, for both
seesaw type-I and II, to find regions where LFV stau decays can be maximized,
while respecting low-energy experimental bounds. We estimate the expected
number of events at the LHC for a sample luminosity of L = 100 fb^{-1}.
