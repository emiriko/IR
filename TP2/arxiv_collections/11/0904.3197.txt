We present two examples of how single-molecule experimental techniques
applied to biological systems can give insight into problems within the scope
of equilibrium and nonequilibrium mesoscopic thermodynamics. The first example
is the mapping of the free energy landscape of a macromolecule, the second the
experimental verification of Crooks' fluctuation theorem. In both cases the
experimental setup comprises optical tweezers and DNA molecules.
