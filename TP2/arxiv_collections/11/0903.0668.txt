We study a subspace of General Gauge Mediation (GGM) models which generalize
models of gauge mediation. We find superpartner spectra that are markedly
different from those of typical gauge and gaugino mediation scenarios. While
typical gauge mediation predictions of either a neutralino or stau
next-to-lightest supersymmetric particle (NLSP) are easily reproducible with
the GGM parameters, chargino and sneutrino NLSPs are generic for many
reasonable choices of GGM parameters.
