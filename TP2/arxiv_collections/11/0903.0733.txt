We propose a classical, i.e., local-real physical model of processes
underlying EPR experiments. The model leads to the prediction, that the
visibility of the output signal will exhibit increasing variation as the
coincidence window is increased, thus providing a testable criteria for its
validity. If it can be sustained, this model undermines the claim that Nature
has a fundamentally nonlocal feature or that irreal entities are required by
quantum theory.
