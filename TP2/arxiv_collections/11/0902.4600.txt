The Kepler-type dynamical symmetries of the Kaluza-Klein monopole are
reviewed. At the classical level, the conservation of the angular momentum and
of a Runge-Lenz vector imply that the trajectories are conic sections. The o(4)
algebra allows us to calculate the bound-state spectrum, and the o(3,1) algebra
yields the scattering matrix. The symmetry algebra extends to o(4,2).
