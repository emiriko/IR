We study the variation of the positions of two magnetically tuned Zero energy
Feshbach resonances when a parallel superimposed electric field is applied. We
show that their variation as a function of the electric field follows a simple
analytical law and is then predictable. We find that depending on the initial
state of the diatomic molecule the resonance is either shifted to higher or to
lower values of the magnetic field when the electric field is applied. We
calculate the Close Coupling lifetimes of these resonances and show that they
also follow a simple law as a function of both the magnetic and the electric
field. We demonstrate using this expression that the lifetime of the resonances
can be maximised by choosing an appropriate value of the applied electric and
found a good agreement with the results of our Close Coupling calculations.
These results could be checked in future experiments dedicated to the 3He + NH
collisions
