Methods are presented for measuring thrust using common force sensors and
data acquisition to construct a dynamic force plate. A spreadsheet can be used
to compute trajectory by integrating the equations of motion numerically. These
techniques can be used in college physics courses, and have also been used with
high school students concurrently enrolled in algebra 2.
