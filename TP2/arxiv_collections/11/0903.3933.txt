In the present work, we study the quantum cosmology description of closed
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker models in the presence of a positive cosmological
constant and a generic perfect fluid. We work in the Schutz's variational
formalism. If one uses the scale factor and its canonically conjugated momentum
as the phase space variables that describe the geometrical sector of these
models, one obtains Wheeler-DeWitt equations with operator ordering
ambiguities. In order to avoid those ambiguities and simplify the quantum
treatment of the models, we introduce new phase space variables. We explicitly
demonstrate that the transformation leading from the old set of variables to
the new one is canonical. In order to show that the above canonical
transformations simplify the quantum treatment of those models, we consider a
particular model where the perfect fluid is dust. We solve the Wheeler-DeWitt
equation numerically using the Crank-Nicholson scheme and determine the time
evolution of the initial wave function. Finally, we compare the results for the
present model with the ones for another model where the only difference is the
presence of a radiative perfect fluid, instead of dust.
