Let M be a compact manifold of dimension n with a strictly convex projective
structure. We consider the geodesic flow of the Hilbert metric on it, which is
known to be Anosov. We prove that its topological entropy is less than n-1,
with equality if and only if the structure is Riemannian, that is hyperbolic.
As a corollary, we get that the volume entropy of a divisible strictly convex
set is less than n-1, with equality if and only if it is an ellipsoid.
