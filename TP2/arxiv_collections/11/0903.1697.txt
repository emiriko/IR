Motivated by the presence of different orders in multilayered
high-temperature superconductors, we examine a model consisting of
nonequivalent two Hubbard chains coupled by interchain hopping by using the
density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) and a mean-field theory. As an
example, we consider a system with noninteracting chain without order and a
Hubbard chain with strong spin-density-wave correlation. We find that the
magnitude of the interchain hopping controls the strength of induced order as
well as that of original order and its fluctuation. It is also found that the
induced order decreases with increasing the magnitude of the original order.
Implications to the multilayered system are discussed.
