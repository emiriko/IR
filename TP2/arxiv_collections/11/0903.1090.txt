Many recent experiments employ several parametric down conversion (PDC)
sources to get multiphoton interference. Such interference has applications in
quantum information. We study here how effects due to photon statistics,
misalignment, and partial distinguishability of the PDC pairs originating from
different sources may lower the interference contrast in the multiphoton
experiments.
