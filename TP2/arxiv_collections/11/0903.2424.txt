An alternative theory of gravity has recently been proposed by Bekenstein,
named Tensor-Vector-Scalar (TeVeS) theory, which can explain many galactic and
cosmological observations without the need for dark matter. Whilst this theory
passes basic solar system tests, and has been scrutinized with considerable
detail in other weak-field regimes, comparatively little has been done in the
strong-field limit of the theory. In this article, with Cowling approximation,
we examine the oscillation spectra of neutron stars in TeVeS. As a result, we
find that the frequencies of fundamental modes in TeVeS could become lager than
those expected in general relativity, while the dependence of frequency of
higher overtone on gravitational theory is stronger than that of lower modes.
These imprints of TeVeS make it possible to distinguish the gravitational
theory in strong-field regime via the observations of gravitational waves,
which can provide unique confirmation of the existence of scalar field.
