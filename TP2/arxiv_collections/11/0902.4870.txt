The effects of fluctuating initial conditions are studied in the context of
relativistic heavy ion collisions where a rapidly evolving system is formed.
Two particle correlation analysis is applied to events generated with the
NEXSPHERIO hydrodynamic code, starting with fluctuating non-smooth initial
conditions (IC). Results show that the non-smoothness in the IC survives the
hydro-evolution and can be seen as topological features of the angular
correlation function of the particles emerging from the evolving system. A long
range correlation is observed in the longitudinal direction and in the
azimuthal direction a double peak structure is observed in the opposite
direction to the trigger particle. This analysis provides clear evidence that
these are signatures of the combined effect of tubular structures present in
the IC and the proceeding collective dynamics of the hot and dense medium.
