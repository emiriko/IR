We study heterostructures of singlet superconductors (SC) and strongly
spin-polarized ferromagnets (sFM) and show that a relative phase arises between
the superconducting proximity amplitudes in the two ferromagnetic spin bands.
We find a tunable pure spin supercurrent in a sFM contacted with only one SC
electrode. We show that Josephson junctions are most effective for a spin
polarization $P\sim 0.3$, and that critical currents for positive and negative
bias differ for a high transmission Josephson junction, due to a relative phase
between single and double pair transmission.
