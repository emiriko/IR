To quantify spatial protein-protein proximity (colocalization) in
fluorescence microscopic images, cross-correlation and autocorrelation
functions were decomposed into fast and slowly decaying components. The fast
component results from clusters of proteins specifically labeled and the slow
one from background/image heterogeneity. We show that the calculation of the
protein-protein proximity index and the correlation coefficient are more
reliably determined by extracting the fast-decaying component.
