The solidification process during squeeze casting is analyzed based on the
classical solidification and plastic deformation theory. The linear
relationship between punch velocity and the solidification rate is established
if the density change of molten meals is neglected. To obtain defect-free
castings, the punch velocity should be larger than the solidification rate. The
densification mechanism is also discussed. The plastic deformation will result
in the radical movement of the central molten metals, which reduces the
temperature gradient from the center to the mold wall, which provides the
condition to obtain defect-free castings: simultaneous nucleation.
