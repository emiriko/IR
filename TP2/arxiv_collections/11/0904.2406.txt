We review recent measurements of heavy B hadron states including masses and
lifetimes of the Bc meson as well as excited B states (B**, Bs**). We discuss
properties of the Bs meson such as lifetime, lifetime difference
delta_Gamma/Gamma and CP violation in Bs -> J/Psi Phi decays. We also summarize
new measurements of the masses and lifetimes of bottom baryons including the
Lambda_b baryon, the Sigma_b baryon states as well as the Xi_b and Omega_b
baryons.
