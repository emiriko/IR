In a recent Letter, Tachiki \emph{et al.} argued that the dynamic state of
superconductivity phase in multi junctions characterized by $\pm\pi$ kinks is
hard to realize from an energetic point of view. Instead, they proposed a
so-called "state without kink". In this Comment, we point out that their
energetic consideration is inconsistent with the well established treatment for
Josephson junctions, and that the results derived for their "state without
kink" cannot explain the radiations observed in the recent experiment.
