The unparticle has been suggested as a candidate of dark matter. We
investigated the growth rate of the density perturbation for the unparticle
dark matter in the flat Universe. First, we consider the model in which
unparticle is the sole dark matter and find that the growth factor can be
approximated well by $f=(1+3\omega_u)\Omega^{\gamma}_u$, where $\omega_u$ is
the equation of state of unparticle. Our results show that the presence of
$\omega_u$ modifies the behavior of the growth factor $f$. For the second model
where unparticle co-exists with cold dark matter, the growth factor has a new
approximation $f=(1+3\omega_u)\Omega^{\gamma}_u+\alpha \Omega_m$ and $\alpha $
is a function of $\omega_u$. Thus the growth factor of unparticle is quite
different from that of usual dark matter. These information can help us know
more about unparticle and the early evolution of the Universe.
