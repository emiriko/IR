We have generated accurate V and I template light curves using a combination
of Fourier decomposition and principal component analysis for a large sample of
Cepheid light curves. Unlike previous studies, we include short period Cepheids
and stars pulsating in the first overtone mode in our analysis. Extensive Monte
Carlo simulations show that our templates can be used to precisely measure
Cepheid magnitudes and periods, even in cases where there are few observational
epochs. These templates are ideal for characterizing serendipitously discovered
Cepheids and can be used in conjunction with surveys such as Pan-Starrs and
LSST where the observational sampling may not be optimized for Cepheids.
