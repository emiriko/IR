MARVELS, the Multi-Object APO Radial Velocity Exoplanet Large-area Survey, is
a 6-year program to characterize the distribution of gas giant planets with
orbital periods ranging from several hours to two years. MARVELS will use
multi-fiber interferometric spectrographs on the wide-field, 2.5-meter Sloan
Foundation telescope at Apache Point Observatory to monitor ~11,000 stars in
the magnitude range V=8-12, visiting each star ~30 times over an 18-month
interval, with velocity precision of 14, 18, and 35 m/s at V=8, 10, and 12.
MARVELS will survey far more stars with a wider range of spectral types and
metallicities than previous radial velocity searches, yielding a statistically
well defined sample of ~150 giant planets drawn from a host sample with well
understood selection biases. With a unique combination of large numbers and
well characterized sensitivity, MARVELS will provide a critical data set for
testing theories of the formation and dynamical evolution of giant planet
systems. The MARVELS detections will also be an ideal sample for follow-up
observations to identify multiple planet systems and understand the influence
of giant planet migration on the formation and survival of less massive
planets. MARVELS is one of four surveys that comprise SDSS-III (the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey III), a 6-year program that will use highly multiplexed
spectrographs on the Sloan Foundation Telescope to investigate cosmological
parameters, the history and structure of the Milky Way galaxy, and the
population of giant planet systems.
