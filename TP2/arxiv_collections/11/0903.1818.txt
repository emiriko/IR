Winfree (1998) showed that discrete Sierpinski triangles can self-assemble in
the Tile Assembly Model. A striking molecular realization of this
self-assembly, using DNA tiles a few nanometers long and verifying the results
by atomic-force microscopy, was achieved by Rothemund, Papadakis, and Winfree
(2004). Precisely speaking, the above self-assemblies tile completely
filled-in, two-dimensional regions of the plane, with labeled subsets of these
tiles representing discrete Sierpinski triangles. This paper addresses the more
challenging problem of the strict self-assembly of discrete Sierpinski
triangles, i.e., the task of tiling a discrete Sierpinski triangle and nothing
else. We first prove that the standard discrete Sierpinski triangle cannot
strictly self-assemble in the Tile Assembly Model. We then define the fibered
Sierpinski triangle, a discrete Sierpinski triangle with the same fractal
dimension as the standard one but with thin fibers that can carry data, and
show that the fibered Sierpinski triangle strictly self-assembles in the Tile
Assembly Model. In contrast with the simple XOR algorithm of the earlier,
non-strict self-assemblies, our strict self-assembly algorithm makes extensive,
recursive use of optimal counters, coupled with measured delay and
corner-turning operations. We verify our strict self-assembly using the local
determinism method of Soloveichik and Winfree (2007).
