The crystals of potassium hydrogen carbonate (KHCO3) and the KDCO3 analogue
are isomorphous. They are composed of hydrogen or deuterium bonded
centrosymmetric dimers (HCO3-)(2) or (DCO3-)(2). The space group symmetry of
KHpD1-pCO3 (p approximate to 0.75) determined with neutron diffraction is
identical to those of KHCO3 and KDCO3. This is at variance with a random
distribution of H and D nuclei. These crystals are macroscopic quantum systems
in which protons or/and deuterons merge into macroscopic states.
