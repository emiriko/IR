We have considered nonuniversal gaugino mass models of supergravity, arising
from a mixture of two superfield contributions to the gauge kinetic term,
belonging to a singlet and a nonsinglet representation of the GUT group. In
particular we analyse two models, where the contributing superfields belong to
the singlet and the 75-dimensional, and the singlet and the 200-dimensional
representations of SU(5). The resulting lightest superparticle is a mixed
bino-higgsino state in the first case and a mixed bino-wino-higgsino state in
the second. In both cases one obtains cosmologically compatible dark matter
relic density over broad regions of the parameter space. We predict promising
signals in direct dark matter detection experiments as well as in indirect
detection experiments via high energy neutrinos coming from their
pair-annihilation in the Sun. Besides, we find interesting $\gamma$-ray signal
rates that will be probed in the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. We also
expect promising collider signals at LHC in both cases.
