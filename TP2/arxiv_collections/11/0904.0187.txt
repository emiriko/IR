It is argued that black holes and the limit distributions of probability
theory share several properties when their entropy and information content are
compared. In particular the no-hair theorem, the entropy maximization and
holographic bound, and the quantization of entropy of black holes have their
respective analogues for stable limit distributions. This observation suggests
that the central limit theorem can play a fundamental role in black hole
statistical mechanics and in a possibly emergent nature of gravity.
