We study geometry and topology as complementary and dual aspects of the
mathematical space. The same is used to get a better understanding of the
Cosmological Constant. Having failed so far to include gravity in a proper
unified framework with the other three fundamental gauge forces, we are now
faced with an additional unwanted fifth force of repulsion, also envisaged as
the Dark Energy problem. How does one understand this 3+1+1 fundamental force
dilemma? We introduce here a novel idea of the Fundamental Forces. This will
give us an additional and an all-encompassing way of classifying these five
fundamental forces in a consistent manner and thereby strengthen the
geometry-topology complementarity concept. This also helps us to understand as
to what one actually means when substituting ${g_{\mu \nu}} = {\eta_{\mu \nu}}
+ {h_{\mu \nu}}$ with the last term being "small" in General Relativity. This
provides an understanding of the generic relationship and the complementarity
of the geometric and the topological structures which is then formalized as a
basic theorem enabling us to understand the underlying connection between the
physical reality and the pure mathematical structures.
