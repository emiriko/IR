We present the first Hinode/EIS observations of 5 min quasi-periodic
oscillations detected in a transition-region line (He II) and five coronal
lines (Fe X, Fe XII, Fe XIII, Fe XIV, and Fe XV) at the footpoint of a coronal
loop. The oscillations exist throughout the whole observation, characterized by
a series of wave packets with nearly constant period, typically persisting for
4-6 cycles with a lifetime of 20-30 min. There is an approximate in-phase
relation between Doppler shift and intensity oscillations. This provides
evidence for slow magnetoacoustic waves propagating upwards from the transition
region into the corona. We find that the oscillations detected in the five
coronal lines are highly correlated, and the amplitude decreases with
increasing temperature. The amplitude of Doppler shift oscillations decrease by
a factor of about 3, while that of relative intensity decreases by a factor of
about 4 from Fe X to Fe XV. These oscillations may be caused by the leakage of
the photospheric p-modes through the chromosphere and transition region into
the corona, which has been suggested as the source for intensity oscillations
previously observed by TRACE. The temperature dependence of the oscillation
amplitudes can be explained by damping of the waves traveling along the loop
with multithread structure near the footpoint. Thus, this property may have
potential value for coronal seismology in diagnostic of temperature structure
in a coronal loop.
