We prove that a rational linear combination of Chern numbers is an oriented
diffeomorphism invariant of smooth complex projective varieties if and only if
it is a linear combination of the Euler and Pontryagin numbers. In dimension at
least three we prove that only multiples of the top Chern number, which is the
Euler characteristic, are invariant under diffeomorphisms that are not
necessarily orientation-preserving. These results solve a long-standing problem
of Hirzebruch's. We also determine the linear combinations of Chern numbers
that can be bounded in terms of Betti numbers.
