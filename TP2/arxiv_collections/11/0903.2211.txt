Schroedinger's first proposal for the interpretation of quantum mechanics was
based on a postulate relating the wave function on configuration space to
charge density in physical space. Schroedinger apparently later thought that
his proposal was empirically wrong. We argue here that this is not the case, at
least for a very similar proposal with charge density replaced by mass density.
We argue that when analyzed carefully this theory is seen to be an empirically
adequate many-worlds theory and not an empirically inadequate theory describing
a single world. Moreover, this formulation--Schroedinger's first quantum
theory--can be regarded as a formulation of the many-worlds view of quantum
mechanics that is ontologically clearer than Everett's.
