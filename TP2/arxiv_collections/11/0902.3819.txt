Detection systems rely more and more on on-line or off-line comparison of
detected signals with basis signals in order to determine the characteristics
of the impinging particles. Unfortunately, these comparisons are very sensitive
to the random time shifts that may alter the signal delivered by the detectors.
We present two fast algebraic methods to determine the value of the time shift
and to enhance the reliability of the comparison to the basis signals.
