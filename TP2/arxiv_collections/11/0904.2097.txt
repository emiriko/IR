Some experimental results are discussed in connection with the properties of
the central heavy ion collisions. These experiments indicate the regime changes
and saturation at some values of the centrality. This phenomenon is considered
to be a signal of the percolation cluster formation in heavy ion collisions at
high energies.
  Keywords: heavy ion collisions, theoretical models, centrality, phase
transition.
