We scan for massive type IIA SU(3)-structure compactifications of the type
AdS4 x CP3 with internal symmetry group SO(4). This group acts on CP3 with
cohomogeneity one, so that one would expect new non-homogeneous solutions. We
find however that all such solutions enhance their symmetry group to Sp(2) and
form, in fact, the homogeneous family first described in arXiv:0712.1396. This
is in accordance with arXiv:0901.0969, which argues from the CFT-side that
although new vacua with SO(4) symmetry group and N=2 supersymmetry should
exist, they fall outside our ansatz of strict SU(3)-structure, and instead have
genuine SU(3)x SU(3)-structure. We do find that the SO(4)-invariant
description, which singles out one preferential direction in the internal
space, is well-adapted for describing the embedding of AdS4-filling
supersymmetric D8-branes on both the original ABJM configuration as its massive
Sp(2)-symmetric deformations.Supersymmetry requires these D-branes to be of the
coisotropic type, which means in particular that their world-volume gauge field
must be non-trivial.
