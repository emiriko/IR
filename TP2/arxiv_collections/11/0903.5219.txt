We present a list of "best possible" estimates of low-degree p-mode
frequencies, from 8640 days of observations made by the Birmingham
Solar-Oscillations Network (BiSON). This is the longest stretch of helioseismic
data ever used for this purpose, giving exquisite precision in the estimated
frequencies. Every effort has been made in the analysis to ensure that the
frequency estimates are also accurate. In addition to presenting the raw
best-fitting frequencies from our "peak bagging" analysis, we also provide
tables of corrected frequencies pertinent to the quiet-Sun and an intermediate
level of solar activity.
