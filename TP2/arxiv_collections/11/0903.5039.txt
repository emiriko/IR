Systems with long-range interactions display a short-time relaxation towards
Quasi Stationary States (QSSs) whose lifetime increases with system size. The
application of Lynden-Bell's theory of "violent relaxation" to the Hamiltonian
Mean Field model leads to the prediction of out-of-equilibrium first and second
order phase transitions between homogeneous (zero magnetization) and
inhomogeneous (non-zero magnetization) QSSs, as well as an interesting
phenomenon of phase re-entrances. We compare these theoretical predictions with
direct $N$-body numerical simulations. We confirm the existence of phase
re-entrance in the typical parameter range predicted from Lynden-Bell's theory,
but also show that the picture is more complicated than initially thought. In
particular, we exhibit the existence of secondary re-entrant phases: we find
un-magnetized states in the theoretically magnetized region as well as
persisting magnetized states in the theoretically unmagnetized region.
