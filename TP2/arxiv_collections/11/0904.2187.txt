The neutron-star X-ray transient XTE J1701-462 was observed for $\sim$3 Ms
with \xte during its 2006-2007 outburst. Here we report on the discovery of
three type-I X-ray bursts from XTE J1701-462. They occurred as the source was
in transition from the typical Z-source behavior to the typical atoll-source
behavior, at $\sim10%$ of the Eddington luminosity. The first burst was
detected in the Z-source flaring branch; the second in the vertex between the
flaring and normal branches; and the third in the atoll-source soft state. The
detection of the burst in the flaring branch cast doubts on earlier
speculations that the flaring branch is due to unstable nuclear burning of
accreted matter. The last two of the three bursts show photospheric radius
expansion, from which we estimate the distance to the source to be 8.8 kpc with
a 15% uncertainty. No significant burst oscillations in the range 30 to 4000 Hz
were found during these three bursts.
