We search for the neutrinoless, lepton-flavor-violating tau decays tau -> l
V^0, where l is an electron or muon and V^0 is a vector meson reconstructed as
phi -> K^+K^-, rho -> pi^+pi^-, K^* -> K^+pi^-, or K^*bar -> K^-pi^+. The
analysis has been performed using 451 fb^{-1} of data collected at an e^+e^-
center-of-mass energy near 10.58 GeV with the BaBar detector at the PEP-II
storage rings. The number of events found in the data is compatible with the
background expectation, and upper limits on the branching fractions are set in
the range (2.6-19) x 10^{-8} at the 90% confidence level.
