We investigate the scalar Green function for spherically symmetric spacetimes
expressed as a coordinate series expansion in the separation of the points. We
calculate the series expansion of the function $V(x,x')$ appearing in the
Hadamard parametrix of the scalar Green function to very high order. This
expansion is then used to investigate the convergence properties of the series
and to estimate its radius of convergence. Using the method of Pade
approximants, we show that the series can be extended beyond its radius of
convergence to within a short distance of the normal neighborhood boundary.
