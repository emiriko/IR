We present medium spectral resolution near-infrared (NIR) HK-band spectra for
8 low redshift (z<0.06) radio galaxies to study the NIR stellar properties of
their host galaxies. As a homogeneous comparison sample, we used 9 inactive
elliptical galaxies that were observed with similar resolution and wavelength
range. The aim of the study is to compare the NIR spectral properties of radio
galaxies to those of inactive early-type galaxies and, furthermore, produce the
first NIR HK-band spectra for low redshift radio galaxies. For both samples
spectral indices of several diagnostic absorption features, SiI(1.589microns),
CO(1.619microns), NaI(2.207microns), CaI(2.263microns), CO(>2.29microns), were
measured. To characterize the age of the populations, the measured EWs of the
absorption features were fitted with the corresponding theoretical evolutionary
curves of the EWs calculated by the stellar synthesis model. On average, EW(CO
2.29) of radio galaxies is somewhat greater than that of inactive ellipticals.
Most likely, EW(CO 2.29) is not significantly affected by dilution, and thus
indicating that elliptical galaxies containing AGN are in a different stage in
their evolution than inactive ellipticals. This is also supported by comparing
other NIR features, such as CaI and NaI, with each other. Absorption features
are consistent with the intermediate age stellar population, suggesting that
host galaxies contain both an old and intermediate age components. It is
consistent with previous optical spectroscopy studies which have shown evidence
on the intermediate age (~2 Gyr) stellar population of radio galaxies, and also
in some of the early-type galaxies. The existence of intermediate age
population is a link between the star formation episode, possibly induced by
interaction or merging event, and the triggering of the nuclear activity.
