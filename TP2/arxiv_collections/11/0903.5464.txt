We investigate the high energy behavior of QCD for different surface
topologies of color graphs. After a brief review of the planar limit (bootstrap
and gluon reggeization) and of the cylinder topology (BFKL) we investigate the
3 -> 3 scattering in the triple Regge limit which belongs to the pair-of-pants
topology. We re-derive the triple Pomeron vertex function and show that it
belongs to a specific set of graphs in color space which we identify as the
analogue of the Mandelstam diagram.
