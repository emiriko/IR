We determine the widths of three-body decays of sleptons, $\tilde{l}^- \to
\tilde{l}^{\pm} l^- l^{\mp}, \tilde{l}^- \nu \bar{\nu}, \tilde{l}^- q \bar{q}$,
in the presence of arbitrary slepton flavor violation and left-right mixing.
These decays are important in scenarios in which the lightest supersymmetric
particle is the gravitino, a generic possibility in models with gauge- and
gravity-mediated supersymmetry breaking. Three-body decays have been discussed
previously assuming flavor conservation and left-right mixing in only the stau
sector. Flavor violation and general left-right mixing open up many new decay
channels, which provide new avenues for precision mass measurements and may
play an essential role in solving the standard model flavor problem. We present
results for toy models with two-generation mixing, and discuss the
implementation of these results in SPICE, a program that simplifies collider
event simulations of flavor-violating supersymmetric models.
