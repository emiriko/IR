In this paper we analyze data of 8 elliptical galaxies in order to study the
difference between their globular cluster systems (GCSs) radial distributions
and those of the galactic stellar component. In all the galaxies studied here
the globular cluster system density profile is significantly flatter toward the
galactic centre than that of stars. If this difference is interpreted as a
depauperation of the initial GC population, the estimated number of missing
globular clusters is significant, ranging from 21% to 71% of their initial
population abundance in the eight galaxies examined. The corresponding mass
lost to the central galactic region is 7x10^7-1.85x10^9 solar masses. All this
mass carried toward central galactic regions have likely had an important
feedback on the innermost galactic region, including its violent transient
activity (AGN) and local massive black hole formation and growth.
