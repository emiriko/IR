We re-investigate the old problem of the survival of the five globular
clusters orbiting the Fornax dwarf galaxy in both standard and modified
Newtonian dynamics. For the first time in the history of the topic, we use
accurate mass models for the Fornax dwarf, obtained through Jeans modelling of
the recently published line of sight velocity dispersion data, and we are also
not resigned to circular orbits for the globular clusters. Previously conceived
problems stem from fixing the starting distances of the globulars to be less
than half the tidal radius. We relax this constraint since there is absolutely
no evidence for it and show that the dark matter paradigm, with either cusped
or cored dark matter profiles, has no trouble sustaining the orbits of the two
least massive globular clusters for a Hubble time almost regardless of their
initial distance from Fornax. The three most massive globulars can remain in
orbit as long as their starting distances are marginally outside the tidal
radius. The outlook for modified Newtonian dynamics is also not nearly as bleak
as previously reported. Although dynamical friction inside the tidal radius is
far stronger in MOND, outside dynamical friction is negligible due to the
absence of stars. This allows highly radial orbits to survive, but more
importantly circular orbits at distances more than 85% of Fornax's tidal radius
to survive indefinitely. The probability of the globular clusters being on
circular orbits at this distance compared with their current projected
distances is discussed and shown to be plausible. Finally, if we ignore the
presence of the most massive globular (giving it a large line of sight
distance) we demonstrate that the remaining four globulars can survive within
the tidal radius for the Hubble time with perfectly sensible orbits.
