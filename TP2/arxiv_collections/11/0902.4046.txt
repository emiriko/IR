The electromagnetic properties of the baryon decuplet are calculated in
quenched QCD on a 20^3 x 40 lattice with a lattice spacing of 0.128 fm using
the fat-link irrelevant clover (FLIC) fermion action with quark masses
providing a pion mass as low as 300 MeV. Magnetic moments and charge radii are
extracted from the electric and magnetic form factors for each individual quark
sector. From these, the corresponding baryon properties are constructed. We
present results for the higher order moments of the spin-3/2 baryons, including
the electric quadrupole moment E2 and the magnetic octupole moment M3. The
world's first determination of a non-zero M3 form factor for the Delta baryon
is presented. With these results we provide a conclusive analysis which shows
that decuplet baryons are deformed. We compare the decuplet baryon results from
a similar lattice calculation of the octet baryons. We establish that the
environment sensitivity is far less pronounced in the case of the decuplet
baryons compared to that in the octet baryons. A surprising result is that the
charge radii of the decuplet baryons are generally smaller than that of the
octet baryons. The magnetic moment of the Delta^+ reveals a turn over in the
low quark mass region, making it smaller than the proton magnetic moment. These
results are consistent with the expectations of quenched chiral perturbation
theory. A similar turn over is also noticed in the magnetic moment of the
Sigma^*0, but not for Xi^* where only kaon loops can appear in quenched QCD.
The electric quadrupole moment of the Omega^- baryon is positive when the
negative charge factor is included, and is equal to 0.86 +- 0.12 x 10^-2 fm^2,
indicating an oblate shape.
