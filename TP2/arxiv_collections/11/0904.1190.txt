Observations by laser interferometric detectors of gravitational waves from
inspiraling compact binary systems can be used to search for a dependence of
the waves' propagation speed on wavelength, and thereby to bound the mass or
Compton wavelength of a putative graviton. We study the effect of including
higher harmonics, as well as their post-Newtonian amplitude corrections, in the
template gravitational waveforms employed in the process of parameter
estimation using matched filtering. We consider the bounds that could be
achieved using advanced LIGO, a proposed third generation instrument called
Einstein Telescope, and the proposed space interferometer LISA. We find that in
all cases, the bounds on the graviton Compton wavelength are improved by almost
an order of magnitude for higher masses when amplitude corrections are
included.
