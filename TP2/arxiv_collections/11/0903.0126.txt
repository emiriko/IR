With deeper study of the Game Theory, some conditions of Prisoner's Dilemma
is no longer suitable of games in real life. So we try to develop a new
model-Villager's Dilemma which has more realistic conditions to stimulate the
process of game. It is emphasize that Prisoner's Dilemma is an exception which
is lack of universality and the importance of rules in the game. And it puts
forward that to let the rule maker take part in the game and specifies game
players can stop the game as they like. This essay describes the basic model,
the villager's dilemma (VD) and put some extended use of it, and points out the
importance of rules and the effect it has on the result of the game. It briefly
describes the disadvantage of Prisoner's Dilemma and advantage Villager's
Dilemma has. It summarizes the premise and scope of application of Villager's
Dilemma, and provides theory foundation for making rules for game and forecast
of the future of the game.
