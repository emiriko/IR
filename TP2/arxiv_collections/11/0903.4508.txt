We consider a discrete-time quantum walk W_t given by the Grover
transformation on the Cayley tree. We reduce W_t to a quantum walk X_t on a
half line with a wall at the origin. This paper presents two types of limit
theorems for X_t. The first one is X_t as t\to\infty, which corresponds to a
localization in the case of an initial qubit state. The second one is X_t/t as
t\to\infty, whose limit density is given by the Konno density function [1-4].
The density appears in various situations of discrete-time cases. The
corresponding similar limit theorem was proved in [5] for a continuous-time
case on the Cayley tree.
