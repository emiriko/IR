It is well-known that expectation values in de Sitter space are afflicted by
infra-red divergences. Long ago, Starobinsky proposed that infra-red effects in
de Sitter space could be accommodated by evolving the long-wavelength part of
the field according to the classical field equations plus a stochastic source
term. I argue that--when quantum-mechanical loop corrections are taken into
account--the separate-universe picture of superhorizon evolution in de Sitter
space is equivalent, in a certain leading-logarithm approximation, to
Starobinsky's stochastic approach. In particular, the time evolution of a box
of de Sitter space can be understood in exact analogy with the DGLAP evolution
of partons within a hadron, which describes a slow logarithmic evolution in the
distribution of the hadron's constituent partons with the energy scale at which
they are probed.
