We show that the Ginzburg-Landau expansion of the grand potential for the
Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian is determined by the integrable nonlinear
equations of the AKNS hierarchy, and that this provides the natural
mathematical framework for a hidden nonlinear quantum mechanical supersymmetry
underlying the dynamics.
