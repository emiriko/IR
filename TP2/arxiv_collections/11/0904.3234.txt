Nanoscale lithography on La$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$MnO$_{3}$ (LSMO) thin film
surfaces has been performed by scanning tunneling microscopy under ambient
conditions. From line-etching experiments we found that the line depth is
increasing in a step-wise fashion with increasing bias voltage as well as with
decreasing scan speed. On average, the depth of the etched lines is an integral
multiple of the LSMO out-of-plane lattice constant about 0.4 nm. A minimum wall
thickness of 1.5 nm was obtained between etched lines. We have utilized the
ability to control the etched line depths to create complicated inverse-pyramid
nanostructure. Our work shows the feasibility of using STM lithography to
create controllable and complex nanoscale structures in LSMO thin film.
