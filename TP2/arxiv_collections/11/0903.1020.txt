We describe the new version (v2.38j) of the code HFODD which solves the
nuclear Skyrme-Hartree-Fock or Skyrme-Hartree-Fock-Bogolyubov problem by using
the Cartesian deformed harmonic-oscillator basis. In the new version, we have
implemented: (i) projection on good angular momentum (for the Hartree-Fock
states), (ii) calculation of the GCM kernels, (iii) calculation of matrix
elements of the Yukawa interaction, (iv) the BCS solutions for state-dependent
pairing gaps, (v) the HFB solutions for broken simplex symmetry, (vi)
calculation of Bohr deformation parameters, (vii) constraints on the Schiff
moments and scalar multipole moments, (viii) the D2h transformations and
rotations of wave functions, (ix) quasiparticle blocking for the HFB solutions
in odd and odd-odd nuclei, (x) the Broyden method to accelerate the
convergence, (xi) the Lipkin-Nogami method to treat pairing correlations, (xii)
the exact Coulomb exchange term, (xiii) several utility options, and we have
corrected two insignificant errors.
