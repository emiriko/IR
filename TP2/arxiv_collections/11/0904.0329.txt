Utilization of current pyroelectric accelerators (PEA) is limited due to low
ion current and neutron generation yields. Current design, using pyroelectrics
(PE) with high pyrocoefficient (p), having high dielectric constant (e), limits
the figure-of-merit. We present detailed analysis of a modified structure of
PEA, providing the highest attainable voltage and ion current. In the paired
configuration, using metal plates covering the polar faces, with grounded back
plates, the accelerating voltage and electric field are proportional to p and
do not depend on e. Therefore, in the modified structure, PE with high p
significantly increases the ion and neutron yields.
