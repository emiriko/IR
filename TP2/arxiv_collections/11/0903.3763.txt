We study uncertainty principles for orthonormal bases and sequences in
$L^2(\R^d)$. As in the classical Heisenberg inequality we focus on the product
of the dispersions of a function and its Fourier transform. In particular we
prove that there is no orthonormal basis for $L^2(\R)$ for which the time and
frequency means as well as the product of dispersions are uniformly bounded.
The problem is related to recent results of J. Benedetto, A. Powell, and Ph.
Jaming.
  Our main tool is a time frequency localization inequality for orthonormal
sequences in $L^2(\R^d)$. It has various other applications.
