We investigate the possibility of observing very small amplitude low
frequency solar oscillations with the proposed laser interferometer space
antenna (LISA). For frequencies $\nu$ below $3\times 10^{-4} {\rm Hz}$ the
dominant contribution is from the near zone time dependent gravitational
quadrupole moments associated with the normal modes of oscillation. For
frequencies $\nu$ above $ 3\times 10^{-4} {\rm Hz}$ the dominant contribution
is from gravitational radiation generated by the quadrupole oscillations which
is larger than the Newtonian signal by a factor of the order $(2 \pi r \nu/
c)^4$, where $r$ is the distance to the Sun, and $c$ is the velocity of light.
  The low order solar quadrupole pressure and gravity oscillation modes have
not yet been detected above the solar background by helioseismic velocity and
intensity measurements. We show that for frequencies $\nu \lesssim 2\times
10^{-4} {\rm Hz}$, the signal due to solar oscillations will have a higher
signal to noise ratio in a LISA type space interferometer than in
helioseismology measurements. Our estimates of the amplitudes needed to give a
detectable signal on a LISA type space laser interferometer imply surface
velocity amplitudes on the sun of the order of 1-10 mm/sec in the frequency
range $1\times 10^{-4} -5\times 10^{-4} {\rm Hz}$. If such modes exist with
frequencies and amplitudes in this range they could be detected with a LISA
type laser interferometer.
