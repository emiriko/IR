A method is reported for creating, generating, and measuring parametrically
shaped pulses for time-bandwidth product >>5, which consists of a parametric
pulse-shaping algorithm, a spatial light modulation system and a single shot
interferometric characterization scheme (SEA TADPOLE) . The utilization of
these tools marks the inception of a new method called SPECIFIC, shaped-pulse
electric-field construction and interferometric characterization, capable of
producing complex shaped laser pulses for coherent control experiments.
