Mixed level orthogonal arrays are basic structures in experimental design. We
develop three algorithms that compute Rao and Gilbert-Varshamov type bounds for
mixed level orthogonal arrays. The computational complexity of the terms
involved in these bounds can grow fast as the parameters of the arrays increase
and this justifies the construction of these algorithms. The first is a
recursive algorithm that computes the bounds exactly, the second is based on an
asymptotic analysis and the third is a simulation algorithm. They are all based
on the representation of the combinatorial expressions that appear in the
bounds as expectations involving a symmetric random walk. The Markov property
of the underlying random walk gives the recursive formula to compute the
expectations. A large deviation (LD) analysis of the expectations provide the
asymptotic algorithm. The asymptotically optimal importance sampling (IS) of
the same expectation provides the simulation algorithm. Both the LD analysis
and the construction of the IS algorithm uses a representation of these
problems as a sequence of stochastic optimal control problems converging to a
limit calculus of variations problem. The construction of the IS algorithm uses
a recently discovered method of using subsolutions to the Hamilton Jacobi
Bellman equation associated with the limit problem.
