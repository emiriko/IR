We report on double-differential inclusive cross-sections of the production
of secondary protons and charged pions, in the interactions with a 5%
interaction length thick stationary beryllium target, of proton and pion beams
with momentum from +/-3 GeV/c to +/-15 GeV/c. Results are given for secondary
particles with production angles between 20 and 125 degrees.
