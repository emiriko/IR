Carbonaceous grains represent a major component of cosmic dust. In order to
understand their formation pathways, they have been prepared in the laboratory
by gas-phase condensation reactions such as laser pyrolysis and laser ablation.
Our studies demonstrate that the temperature in the condensation zone
determines the formation pathway of carbonaceous particles. At temperatures
lower than 1700 K, the condensation by-products are mainly polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons (PAHs), that are also the precursors or building blocks for the
condensing soot grains. The low-temperature condensates contain PAH mixtures
that are mainly composed of volatile 3-5 ring systems. At condensation
temperatures higher than 3500 K, fullerene-like carbon grains and fullerene
compounds are formed. Fullerene fragments or complete fullerenes equip the
nucleating particles. Fullerenes can be identified as soluble components.
Consequently, condensation products in cool and hot astrophysical environments
such as cool and hot AGB stars or Wolf Rayet stars should be different and
should have distinct spectral properties.
