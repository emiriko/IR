In this paper we present a Prolog plugin for Eclipse based upon BE4, and
providing many features such as semantic-aware syntax highlighting, outline
view, error marking, content assist, hover information, documentation
generation, and quick fixes. The plugin makes use of a Java parser for full
Prolog with an integrated Prolog engine, and can be extended with further
semantic analyses, e.g., based on abstract interpretation.
