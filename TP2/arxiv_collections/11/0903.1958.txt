In the arrival time problem in quantum mechanics, a standard formula that
frequently emerges as the probability for crossing the origin during a given
time interval is the current integrated over that time interval. This is
semiclassically correct but can be negative due to backflow. Here, we show that
this formula naturally arises in a decoherent histories analysis of the arrival
time problem. For a variety of initial states, we show that histories crossing
during different time intervals are approximately decoherent. Probabilities may
therefore be assigned and coincide with the standard formula (in a
semiclassical approximation), which is therefore positive for these states.
However, for initial states for which there is backflow, we show that there
cannot be decoherence of histories, so probabilities may not be assigned.
