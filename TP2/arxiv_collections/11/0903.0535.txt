We present a systematic analysis of backward pion photoproduction for the
reactions gamma p -> pi0 p and gamma p -> pi+ n. Regge phenomenology is applied
at invariant collision energies above 3 GeV in order to fix the reaction
amplitude. A comparision with older data on pi0- and pi+ photoproduction at
theta = 180 degrees indicates that the high-energy limit as given by the Regge
calculation could be reached possibly at energies of around sqrt{s} = 3 GeV. In
the energy region of sqrt{s} < 2.5 GeV, covered by the new measurements of
gamma p -> pi0 p differential cross sections at large angles at ELSA, JLab, and
LEPS, we see no clear signal for a convergence towards the Regge results. The
baryon trajectories obtained in our analysis are in good agreement with those
given by the spectrum of excited baryons.
