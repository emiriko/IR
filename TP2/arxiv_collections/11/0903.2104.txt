First principles density functional calculations for Fe$_{2}$O$_{3}$ has been
performed over a wide range of pressures. The ground state is corundum-type
hematite and is an antiferromagnetic insulator. This is in good agreement with
experiment and other theoretical studies. On increasing pressure, the
ground-state high-spin magnetic phase transforms to low spin via the closure of
the charge transfer gap. The system also evolves to a new orthorhombic
structure. Distorted corundum or Rh$_{2}$O$_{3}$(II) type structure with Pbcn
symmetry and Pbnm type perovskite structure are two known competitive
candidates for this structural phase, based on {\it single}--cationic type and
{\it two}--cationic type picture, respectively. In our calculations, at about
38 GPa, Rh$_{2}$O$_{3}$(II) type structure becomes more stable with respect to
the ground state hematite. Relative stability of Pbnm type perovskite is ruled
out by our calculations in this pressure regime. The Rh$_{2}$O$_{3}$(II) type
structure remains in its low spin state, with 1 $\mu_{B}/$Fe atom, up to about
120 GPa. At this pressure the nonmagnetic solution in Rh$_{2}$O$_{3}$(II) type
structure becomes more favorable with respect to the low spin one. By further
increasing the pressure at about 330 GPa, the system evolves to yet another new
structural phase. This new orthorhombic structural phase is nonmagnetic and has
Pmc2$_{1}$ symmetry, a subgroup of Cmcm. Surprisingly, on furthering rising the
pressure, a Pbnm type nonmagnetic solution becomes competitive with the
Pmc2$_{1}$ type structure and finally becomes stable at about 880 GPa.
