We study magnetotransport in a high mobility Si two-dimensional electron
system by in situ tilting of the sample relative to the magnetic field. A
pronounced dip in the longitudinal resistivity is observed during the Landau
level crossing process for noninteger filling factors. Together with a Hall
resistivity change which exhibits the particle-hole symmetry, this indicates
that electrons or holes in the relevant Landau levels become localized at the
coincidence where the pseudospin-unpolarized state is expected to be stable.
