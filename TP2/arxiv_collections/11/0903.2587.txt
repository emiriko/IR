We report a comprehensive small angle neutron scattering study (SANS) of the
magnetic phase diagram of the doped semiconductor Fe_{1-x}Co_{x}Si for x=0.2
and 0.25. For magnetic field parallel to the neutron beam we observe a six-fold
intensity pattern under field-cooling, which identifies the A-phase of
Fe_{1-x}Co_{x}Si as a skyrmion lattice. The regime of the skyrmion lattice is
highly hysteretic and extents over a wide temperature range, consistent with
the site disorder of the Fe and Co atoms. Our study identifies Fe_{1-x}Co_{x}Si
is a second material after MnSi in which a skyrmion lattice forms and
establishes that skyrmion lattices may also occur in strongly doped
semiconductors.
