Using the formula of chiral anomaly, we discuss the pair production of quarks
under color electric field $\vec{E}$ without addressing explicit formula of
quark's wavefunctions. The production is assumed to occur under the effect of
color magnetic field $\vec{B}$ as well as the color electric field. We obtain
the life time $t_c$ of the color electric field in the limit of $B\gg E$.
Applying it to the glasma in high-energy heavy-ion collisions, we find that
$t_c\simeq 10Q_s^{-1}$ with saturation momentum $Q_s$.
