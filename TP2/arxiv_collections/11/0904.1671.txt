The validity of some rules in the classical theory of spin, which are
followed by the Bargmann--Michel--Telegdi formula for a relativistic particle
spin rotation in a constant homogeneous magnetic field, is analyzed. In the
framework of the quantum theory, we give examples where these rules are
violated. Consequences for polarization experiments are discussed.
