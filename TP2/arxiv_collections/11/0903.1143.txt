The physics case for studying top-quark physics at the International Linear
Collider is well established. This summary places in context the top-quark
physics goals, examines the current state-of-the art in understanding of the
top-quark mass, and identifies some areas in which the study of the top-quark
mass enhances our understanding of new techniques.
