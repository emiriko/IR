We report on the current simulation studies regarding the reconstruction of
Jets and Missing Transverse Energy (MET) with the CMS detector at the CERN
proton-proton LHC accelerator. The performance of various jet algorithms is
compared, when using calorimeter energy deposits as inputs to the algorithm.
The plan for obtaining jet energy corrections is outlined and data-driven
correction methods are described. Finally, the performance of MET
reconstruction is summarized.
