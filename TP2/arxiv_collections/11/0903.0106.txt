Let $A$ be an abelian variety with commutative endomorphism algebra over a
finite field $k$. The $k$-isogeny class of $A$ is uniquely determined by a Weil
polynomial $f_A$ without multiple roots. We give a classification of the groups
of $k$-rational points on varieties from this class in terms of Newton polygons
of $f_A(1-t)$.
