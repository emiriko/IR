We revisit the Riemann-Cartan geometry in the context of recent
higher-dimensional theories of spacetime. After introducing the concept of
torsion in a modern geometrical language we present some results that represent
extensions of Riemannian theorems. We consider the theory of local embeddings
and submanifolds in the context of Riemann-Cartan geometries and show how a
Riemannian spacetime may be locally and isometrically embedded in a bulk with
torsion. As an application of this result, we discuss the problem of classical
confinement and the stability of motion of particles and photons in the
neighbourhood of branes for the case when the bulk has torsion. We illustrate
our ideas considering the particular case when the embedding space has the
geometry of a warped product space . We show how the confinement and stability
properties of geodesics near the brane may be affected by the torsion of the
embedding manifold. In this way we construct a classical analogue of quantum
confinement inspired in theoretical-field models by replacing a scalar field
with a torsion field.
