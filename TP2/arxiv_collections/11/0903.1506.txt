In this paper we describe the channel impairments and equalization methods
currently used in WiFi, WiMax and WCDMA. After a review of channel model for
Intelligent Transportation System (ITS), we proposed an equalization method
which will be useful for the estimation of strong multipath channel at a high
velocity.
