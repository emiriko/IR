We propose the use of a superconducting waveguide formed from an array of
dc-SQUID's for investigating analogue Hawking radiation. Biasing the array with
a space-time varying flux modifies the propagation velocity of the waveguide,
leading to an effective metric with an horizon. Being a fundamentally quantum
mechanical device, this setup allows for investigations of quantum effects such
as back-reaction and analogue space-time fluctuations on the Hawking process.
