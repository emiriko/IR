We present the self-consistent, non-perturbative analysis of isospin mixing
using the nuclear density functional approach and the rediagonalization of the
Coulomb interaction in the good-isospin basis. The largest isospin-breaking
effects are predicted for N = Z nuclei and they quickly fall with the neutron
excess. The unphysical isospin violation on the mean-field level, caused by the
neutron excess, is eliminated by the proposed method. We find a significant
dependence of the magnitude of isospin breaking on the parametrization of the
nuclear interaction term. A rough correlation has been found between the
isospin mixing parameter and the difference of proton and neutron rms radii.
The theoretical framework described in this study is well suited to describe a
variety of phenomena associated with isospin violation in nuclei, in particular
the isospin symmetry-breaking corrections to superallowed Fermi beta decays.
