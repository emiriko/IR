The low-temperature electrical resistivity of corrugated semiconductor films
is theoretically considered. Nanoscale corrugation enhances the
electron-electron scattering contribution to the resistivity, resulting in a
stepwise resistivity development with increasing corrugation amplitude. The
enhanced electron scattering is attributed to the curvature-induced potential
energy that affects the motion of electrons confined to a thin curved film.
Geometric conditions and microscopic mechanism of the stepwise resistivity are
discussed in detail.
