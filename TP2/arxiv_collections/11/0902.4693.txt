We report on the first axion search results from the Cryogenic Dark Matter
Search (CDMS) experiment at the Soudan Underground Laboratory. An energy
threshold of 2 keV for electron-recoil events allows a search for possible
solar axion conversion into photons or local Galactic axion conversion into
electrons in the germanium crystal detectors. The solar axion search sets an
upper limit on the Primakov coupling $g_{a\gamma\gamma}$ of 2.4$ \times
10^{-9}$ GeV$^{-1}$ at the 95% confidence level for an axion mass less than 0.1
keV/c$^2$. This limit benefits from the first precise measurement of the
absolute crystal plane orientations in this type of experiment. The Galactic
axion search analysis sets a world-leading experimental upper limit on the
axio-electric coupling $g_{a\bar{e}e}$ of 1.4$ \times 10^{-12}$ at the 90 %
confidence level for an axion mass of 2.5 keV/c$^2$. This analysis excludes an
interpretation of the DAMA annual modulation result in terms of Galactic axion
interactions for axion masses above 1.4 keV/c$^2$.
