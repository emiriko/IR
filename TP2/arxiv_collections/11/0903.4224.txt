We report robust vortex matching effects in antidot arrays fabricated on thin
films of NbN. The near absence of hysteresis between field sweep directions
indicates a negligible residual pinning in the host thin film. Owing to the
very small coherence length of NbN thin films ($\xi < 5 nm$), the observations
suggests the possibility of probing physics of vortices at true nanometer
length scales in suitably fabricated structures.
