The near threshold production of K+K- pairs in proton-proton collisions has
been investigated at the cooler synchrotron COSY below and above the threshold
for the \phi meson production. The experimental excitation function determined
for the pp-->ppK+K- reaction differs from theoretical expectations including
proton-proton final state interaction. The discrepancy may be assigned to the
influence of K+K- or pK interaction. In this article we present distributions
of the cross section for the pp-->ppK+K- reaction as a function of the
invariant masses of two and three particle subsystems at excess energies of
Q=10 MeV and 28 MeV.
