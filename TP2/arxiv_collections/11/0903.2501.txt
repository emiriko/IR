If the color Coulomb potential is confining, then the Coulomb field energy of
an isolated color charge is infinite on an infinite lattice, even if the usual
UV divergence is lattice regulated. A simple criterion for Coulomb confinement
is that the expectation value of timelike link variables vanishes in Coulomb
gauge, but it is unclear how this criterion is related to the spectrum of the
corresponding Faddeev-Popov operator, which can be used to formulate a quite
different criterion for Coulomb confinement. The purpose of this article is to
connect the two seemingly different Coulomb confinement criteria, and explain
the geometrical basis of the connection.
