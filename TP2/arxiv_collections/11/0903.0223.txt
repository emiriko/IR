First, it is demonstrated that the Froolich Hamiltonian of system in the
superconductivity, proposed by the model of a phonon gas and an electron gas
mixture, contains a subtle error. In this respect, we present a correct form of
the Froolich Hamiltonian of system where the term of the interaction between
the phonon modes and the density modes of the electron modes is described by
the term of scattering, introduced by the Froolich in a phonon gas electron gas
mixture. The later is removed by a canonical transformation of the Froolich
Hamiltonian by an appearance of the attractive interaction mediated via the
electron modes, which leads to a bound state on a spinless electron pairs. In
this letter, we show that the Cooper approximation as the constancy of the
density states within around of the Fermi level has a flaw because the
effective attractive forces cannot create the Cooper pairs into energetic gap
at the Fermi level. In this letter, we find a condition for density metal which
determines metal as superconductor.
