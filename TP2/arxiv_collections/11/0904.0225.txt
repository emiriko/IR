Calculations relating to two experiments that demonstrate coherent control of
preformed rubidium-85 molecules in a magneto-optical trap using ultrafast laser
pulses are presented. In the first experiment, it is shown that pre-associated
molecules in an incoherent mixture of states can be made to oscillate
coherently using a single ultrafast pulse. A mechanism that can transfer
molecular population to more deeply bound vibrational levels is used in the
second. Optimal parameters of the control pulse are presented for the
application of the mechanism to molecules in a magneto-optical trap. The
calculations make use of an experimental determination of the initial state of
molecules photoassociated by the trapping lasers in the magneto-optical trap
and use shaped pulses consistent with a standard ultrafast laser system.
