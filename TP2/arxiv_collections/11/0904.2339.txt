Spontaneous pattern formation is a phenomenon ubiquitous in nature, examples
ranging from Rayleigh-Benard convection to the emergence of complex organisms
from a single cell. In physical systems, pattern formation is generally
associated with the spontaneous breaking of translation symmetry and is closely
related to other symmetry-breaking phenomena, of which (anti-)ferromagnetism is
a prominent example. Indeed, magnetic pattern formation has been studied
extensively in both solid-state materials and classical liquids. Here, we
report on the spontaneous formation of wave-like magnetic patterns in a spinor
Bose-Einstein condensate, extending those studies into the domain of quantum
gases. We observe characteristic modes across a broad range of the magnetic
field acting as a control parameter. Our measurements link pattern formation in
these quantum systems to specific unstable modes obtainable from linear
stability analysis. These investigations open new prospects for controlled
studies of symmetry breaking and the appearance of structures in the quantum
domain.
