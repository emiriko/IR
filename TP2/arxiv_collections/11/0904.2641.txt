The form factor of partially sulfonated polystyrene PSSNa (degree of
sulfonation f =1, 0.72, 0.64 and 0.36), at polymer concentration 0.17M and
0.34M, without or with added salt (0 M, 0.34M, & 0.68M), is measured by Small
Angle Neutron Scattering using the Zero Average Contrast method. The total
scattering function is also measured, allowing extracting the distinct
interchain function and an apparent structure factor. The main result is the
behavior of the form factor which shows contributions of spherical entities as
well as extended chain parts. This is striking for 0.64, while for f = 0.36 the
sphere contribution is more dominant. The conformation does not depend on
polymer concentration. When salt is added, the sphere sizes do not vary, but
the contribution attributed to the stretched parts does vary very much like for
fully sulfonated PSSNa. Discussion of the interchain contribution establishes
that chains are interpenetrated for f= 0.64, and at the overlap limit for
f=0.36. The pearl necklace model appears very suitable. Comparisons are made
with analytical calculation and simulation data. While the roles of Rayleigh
transition, heterogeneous architecture, and strong hydrophobicity of non
sulfonated PS monomers remain to discuss, data give an accurate 3 d image of
the pearl necklace.
