Original quantum repeater protocols based on single-photon interference
suffer from phase noise of the channel, which makes the long-distance quantum
communication infeasible. Fortunately, two-photon interference type quantum
repeaters can be immune to phase noise of the channel. However, this type
quantum repeaters may still suffer from polarization disturbance of the
channel. Here we propose a quantum repeaters protocol which is free of
polarization disturbance of the channel based on the invariance of the
anti-symmetric Bell state $|\psi^->=(|H>|V>-|V>|H>)/\sqrt{2}$ under collective
noise. Our protocol is also immune to phase noise with the Sagnac
interferometer configuration. Through single-atom cavity-QED technology and
linear optics, this scheme can be implemented easily.
