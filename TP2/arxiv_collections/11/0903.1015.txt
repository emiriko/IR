Matrix models of Yang-Mills type induce an effective gravity theory on
4-dimensional branes, which are considered as models for dynamical space-time.
We review recent progress in the understanding of this emergent gravity. The
metric is not fundamental but arises effectively in the semi-classical limit,
along with nonabelian gauge fields. This leads to a mechanism for protecting
certain geometries from corrections due to the vacuum energy.
