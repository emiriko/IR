Ray-tracing exercise and full-wave analysis were performed to validate the
performance of a new type of cloak composed of isotropic metamaterials. It is
shown that objects inside the folded region of this cloak appear invisible to
the incoming light from a ray tracing exercise, but exhibit magnified and
shifted scattering under a plane wave illumination from a full wave analysis.
Gaussian beams are introduced to resolve this interesting paradox resulted from
these two methods. We show that at the time-harmonic state, small energy can be
diffracted into the folded region and contribute to the resonant state even
when the Gaussian beam is steered away from the cloak with an object inside. A
scattering pattern identical to that scattered from the image of the object
will be formed, which agrees well with the phenomenon in the plane wave
incidence case.
