We show that, when graphene is subjected to an appropriate one-dimensional
external periodic potential, additional branches of massless fermions are
generated with nearly the same electron-hole crossing energy as that at the
original Dirac point of graphene. Because of these new zero-energy branches,
the Landau levels at charge neutral filling becomes 4(2N+1)-fold degenerate
(with N=0,1,2,..., tunable by the potential strength and periodicity) with the
corresponding Hall conductivity $\sigma_{xy}$ showing a step of size
4(2N+1)$e^2/h$. These theoretical findings are robust against variations in the
details of the external potential and provide measurable signatures of the
unusual electronic structure of graphene superlattices.
