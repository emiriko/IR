In the cell, protein complexes form relying on specific interactions between
their monomers. Excluded volume effects due to molecular crowding would lead to
correlations between molecules even without specific interactions. What is the
interplay of these effects in the crowded cellular environment? We study
dimerization of a model homodimer both when the mondimers are free or tethered
to each other. We consider a structured environment: Two monomers first diffuse
into a cavity of size $L$ and then fold and bind within the cavity. The folding
and binding are simulated using molecular dynamics based on a simplified
topology based model. The {\it confinement} in the cell is described by an
effective molecular concentration $C \sim L^{-3}$. A two-state coupled folding
and binding behavior is found. We show the maximal rate of dimerization
occurred at an effective molecular concentration $C^{op}\simeq 1m$M which is a
relevant cellular concentration. In contrast, for tethered chains the rate
keeps at a plateau when $C<C^{op}$ but then decreases sharply when $C>C^{op}$.
For both the free and tethered cases, the simulated variation of the rate of
dimerization and thermodynamic stability with effective molecular concentration
agrees well with experimental observations. In addition, a theoretical argument
for the effects of confinement on dimerization is also made.
