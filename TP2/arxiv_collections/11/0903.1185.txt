First we review some of the attempts made to find exact spherically symmetric
solutions of Einstein field equations in the presence of scalar fields .Wyman
solution in both static and non static scalar field is discussed briefly and it
is show that why in the case of non static homogenous matter field, static
metric can not be represented in terms of elementary functions. We mention here
that if our spacetime be static, according to EFE there is two option for
choose scalar field matter: static (time independent) and non static (time
dependent). All these solutions are limited to the minimally coupled massless
scalar fields and also in the absence of the cosmological constant . Then we
show that if we are interesting to have a homogenous isotropic scalar field
matter one can construct a series solution in terms of scalar field's mass and
cosmological constant. This metric is static and posses a locally flat case as
a special chooses of mass of scalar field and can be interpreted as an
effective vacuum. Therefore mass of scalar field eliminates any locally
gravitational effect as tidal forces. Finally we describe why this system is
unstable in the language of dynamical systems.
