The X-ray spectra of accreting compact objects often exhibit discrete
emission features associated with fluorescent emission in the accretion disk,
the strongest of which is the Fe Kalpha fluorescence line at 6.4--6.97keV.
These reflection features are amongst the best tools in the study of the inner
region of accretion flow around a compact object. Here we report on three
Suzaku observations of the neutron star X-ray binary 4U1705-44 where a broad,
skewed Fe Kalpha emission line is clearly visible above the continuum. By using
a relativistically-blurred reflection model we find that in 4U1705-44 the inner
disk radius extends down to rin=10.5^{+1.0}_{-1.7} GM/c^2 and is at an angle of
29.8^{+1.1}_{-1.0} degrees to the line of sight. Furthermore, we find that the
level of ionisation in the surface layers of the accretion disk changes by two
orders of magnitude between the three observations, however the inner radius
obtained from the line profile remains stable.
