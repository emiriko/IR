Using the StarTrack binary population synthesis code we model the population
of double neutron stars in the Galaxy. We include a detailed treatment of the
spin evolution of each pulsar due to processes such as spin-down and spin-up
during accretion events as well as magnetic field decay. We also model the
spatial distribution of double neutron stars by including their natal kicks and
subsequent propagation in the Galactic gravitational potential. This synthetic
pulsar population is compared to the observed sample of double neutron stars
taking into account the selection effects of detection in the radio band, to
determine the most likely evolutionary parameters. With these parameters we
determine the properties of the double neutron star binaries detectable in
gravitational waves by the high frequency interferometers LIGO and VIRGO. In
particular, we discuss the distributions of chirp masses and mass ratios in
samples selected by their radio or gravitational wave emission.
