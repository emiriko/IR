In this paper, we investigate continuous-time quantum walk on star graphs. It
is shown that quantum central limit theorem for a continuous-time quantum walk
on star graphs for $N$-fold star power graph, which are invariant under the
quantum component of adjacency matrix, converges to continuous-time quantum
walk on $K_2$ graphs (Complete graph with two vertices) and the probability of
observing walk tends to the uniform distribution.
