Computations based on explicit 4-periodic resolutions are given for the
cohomology of the finite groups G known to act freely on S^3, as well as the
cohomology rings of the associated 3-manifolds (spherical space forms) M =
S^3/G. Chain approximations to the diagonal are constructed, and explicit
contracting homotopies also constructed for the cases G is a generalized
quaternion group, the binary tetrahedral group, or the binary octahedral group.
Some applications are briefly discussed.
