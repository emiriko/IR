A semi-classical mechanism which leads to the isotropization of the Mixmaster
Universe is developed. A wave function of this Universe, which has a meaningful
probabilistic interpretation, is constructed and it describes the evolution of
the anisotropies of the Universe with respect to the isotropic scale factor,
which plays the external observer-like role. We show that, once large volume
regions are investigated, the closed Friedmann-Robertson-Walker configuration
is deeply privileged.
