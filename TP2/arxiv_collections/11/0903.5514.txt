We consider a thin superconducting film with randomly magnetized dots on top
of it. The dots produce a disordered pinning potential for vortices in the
film. We show that for dots with permanent and random magnetization normal or
parallel to the film surface, our system is an experimental realization of the
two-dimensional XY model with random phase shifts. The low-temperature
superconducting phase, that exists without magnetic dots, survives in the
presence of magnetic dots for sufficiently small disorder.
