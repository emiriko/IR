Here the probability density of relativistic particles coordinates,
satisfying the formal conditions of the quantum mechanics and the special
relativity, is determined (under textbooks view, such density does not exist).
It is specified for the boson, neutral and charged, scalar and vector,
including the photon, the electron. Uniqueness of this design has been proved.
This is a relativistic invariant, describing the probability of the particle
observation in points of space-time. The time is deprived of his role of a
dynamic parameter of distribution and formally equalized with other
coordinates. Also the meaning of the energy-momentum distribution is clarified.
Conditions of such distributions observation are described. As applied to the
quantum field these structures are transformed into new characteristics of
particles distribution in space-time in addition to those for momentum states.
Their operators for free fields are obtained. Under such model the Heisenberg's
uncertainty relations are grounded for the relativistic particle; both
particles and antiparticles turn out to be different states of a single
particle; vacuum state of boson quantum field has zero energy.
