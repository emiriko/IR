We investigate the role of non-thermal electrons in the formation regions of
Halpha, Hbeta, and Hgamma lines in order to unfold their influence on the
formation of these lines. We concentrate on pulse-beam heating varying on a
subsecond timescale. Furthermore, we theoretically explore possibility that a
new diagnostic tool exists indicating the presence of non-thermal electrons in
the flaring chromosphere based on observations of optical hydrogen lines. To
model the evolution of the flaring atmosphere and the time-dependent hydrogen
excitation and ionisation, we used a 1-D radiative hydrodynamic code combined
with a test-particle code that simulates the propagation, scattering, and
thermalisation of a power-law electron beam in order to obtain the flare
heating and the non-thermal collisional rates due to the interaction of the
beam with the hydrogen atoms. All calculated models have shown a
time-correlated response of the modelled Balmer line intensities on a subsecond
timescale, with a subsecond timelag behind the beam flux. Depending on the beam
parameters, both line centres and wings can show pronounced intensity
variations. The non-thermal collisional rates generally result in an increased
emission from a secondary region formed in the chromosphere.
