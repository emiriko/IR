New hypothetical field equations (Eqs. (1) and (2)) are further discussed,
unifying Maxwell's equations of the Standard Model (after the electroweak
symmetry is spontaneously broken) with the dynamics of hidden sector (expected
to be responsible for the cold dark matter). The hidden sector is represented
by sterile spin-1/2 Dirac fermions ("sterinos") and sterile spin-0 bosons
("sterons") whose masses are spontaneously generated by a nonzero vacuum
expectation value of the steron field, while sterino and steron interactions
are mediated by sterile spin-1 quanta of an antisymmetric-tensor field with a
large mass scale ("A bosons"). These interactions are presumed to be weak, but
stronger than the universal gravity. Beside sterinos and sterons, the
Standard-Model photons are included into the source of sterile A bosons and so,
they become a link between the hidden and Standard-Model sectors ("photonic
portal" to the hidden sector). The relativistic structure of
antisymmetric-tensor field of sterile A bosons can be split into a vector and
an axial three-dimensional fields (of spin 1 and parities - and +) in such a
way that the Standard-Model electric and magnetic fields become involved
separately in the sources of these two kinds of sterile A-boson radiation,
respectively.
