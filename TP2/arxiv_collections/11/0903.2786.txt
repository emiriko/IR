We study the ground-state properties of a dilute gas of strongly-interacting
fermions in the framework of the coupled-cluster expansion (CCE). We
demonstrate that properties such as universality, opening of a gap in the
excitation spectrum and applicability of s-wave approximations appear naturally
in the CCE approach. In the zero-density limit, we show that the ground-state
energy density depends on only one parameter which in turn may depend at most
on the spatial dimensionality of the system.
