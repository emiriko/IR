There has been recent debate over the use of the Boltzmann property in the
kinetic equations describing dense neutrino systems such as early Universe and
Supernova core. A technique developed by Bell, Rawlinson, and Sawyer utilises
the flavour evolution timescales of the neutrino systems to test the validity
of this assumption. The Friedland-McKellar-Okuniewicz (FMO) many-body neutrino
model was developed to conduct this test. It was concluded by its authors,
using the Bell-Rawlinson-Sawyer timescale test, that the model lent support to
the Boltzmann property assumption. We developed kinetic equations for the FMO
model. By direct analysis of the kinetic equations we find, in stark contrast
to Friedland et al., that in fact the Boltzmann property assumption does
breakdown in the FMO model. We have shown that the Bell-Rawlinson-Sawyer
timescale technique can only be used to invalidate the Boltzmann property but
not validate it.
