Mutual uncrossability of polymers generates topological constraints on their
conformations and dynamics, which are generally described using the tube model.
We imaged confinement tubes for individual polymers within a F-actin solution
by sampling over many successive micrographs of fluorescently labeled probe
filaments. The resulting average tube width shows the predicted scaling
behavior. Unexpectedly, we found an exponential distribution of tube curvatures
which is attributed to transient entropic trapping in network void spaces.
