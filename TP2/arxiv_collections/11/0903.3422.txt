We address the problem of non-Abelian super-QCD, with a Fayet-Iliopoulos
term, as seen from the vortex worldsheet perspective. Together with the FI term
$\xi$, also a mass $\mu$ for the adjoint superfield $\Phi$ enters in the game.
This mass allows the interpolation between $\N=2$ and $\N=1$ super-QCD. While
the phenomenology of the $\N=2$ case ($\mu=0$) is pretty much understood, much
remains to be clarified for the finite-$\mu$ case. We distinguish, inside the
parameter space spanned by the FI term and the mass $\mu$, four different
corners where some quantitative statements can be made. These are the regions
where the strong dynamics can, in some approximation, be quantitatively
analyzed. We focus in particular on two questions: 1) Is the quantum vortex BPS
or non-BPS? 2) What is the phase of the internal non-Abelian moduli? We find
that the answer to these questions strongly depends upon the choice of the
linear term in the superpotential. We also try to explain what happens in the
most unexplored, and controversial, region of parameters, that of the quantum
heterotic vortex, where $\Lambda \ll \sqrt{\xi} \ll \mu$.
