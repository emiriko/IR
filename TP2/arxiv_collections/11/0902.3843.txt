The effective mass approximation is used to consider plasma and magnetoplasma
waves in an electron system on the surface of the semiconductor cylindrical
nanotube. The electron-electron coupling is taken into account in the random
phase approach. In the case of a degenerate electron gas the spectral windows
on the wavevector-frequency plane and the spectra of the waves are obtained.
Their frequencies undergo quantum oscillations of the de Haas-van Alfven type
which are attributed to the Fermi level traversing the sub-zone boundaries in
the electron energy spectrum. The spectrum and the damping of waves in the
non-degenerate electron gas were found. In a magnetic field parallel to the
cylinder axis the frequencies of the magnetoplasma waves sustain the
Aharonov-Bohm type oscillations that appear with changing magnetic field
strength.
