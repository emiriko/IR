Purpose: To determine whether alternative HDR prostate brachytherapy catheter
patterns can result in improved dose distributions while providing better
access and reducing trauma.
  Methods: Prostate HDR brachytherapy uses a grid of parallel needle positions
to guide the catheter insertion. This geometry does not easily allow the
physician to avoid piercing the critical structures near the penile bulb nor
does it provide position flexibility in the case of pubic arch interference. On
CT data from ten previously-treated patients new catheters were digitized
following three catheter patterns: conical, bi-conical, and fireworks. The
conical patterns were used to accommodate a robotic delivery using a single
entry point. The bi-conical and fireworks patterns were specifically designed
to avoid the critical structures near the penile bulb. For each catheter
distribution, a plan was optimized with the inverse planning algorithm, IPSA,
and compared with the plan used for treatment. Irrelevant of catheter geometry,
a plan must fulfill the RTOG-0321 dose criteria for target dose coverage.
  Results: Thirty plans from ten patients were optimized. All non-standard
patterns fulfilled the RTOG criteria when the clinical plan did. In some cases,
the dose distribution was improved by better sparing the organs-at-risk.
  Conclusion: Alternative catheter patterns can provide the physician with
additional ways to treat patients previously considered unsuited for
brachytherapy treatment (pubic arch interference) and facilitate robotic
guidance of catheter insertion. In addition, alternative catheter patterns may
decrease toxicity by avoidance of the critical structures near the penile bulb
while still fulfilling the RTOG criteria.
