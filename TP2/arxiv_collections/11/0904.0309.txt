The capacitance between arbitrary nodes in perfect infinite networks of
identical capacitors is studied. We calculate the capacitance between the
origin and the lattice site (l,m)for an infinite linear chain, and for an
infinite square network consisting of identical capacitors using the lattice
green's function. The asymptotic behavior of the capacitance for an infinite
square lattice is investigated for large separation between the origin and the
site (l,m). We point out the relation between the capacitance of the lattice
and the van Hove singularity of the tight- binding Hamiltonian. This method can
be applied to other types of lattice structures.
