Doppler and transit surveys are finding extrasolar planets of ever smaller
mass and radius, and are now sampling the domain of superEarths (1-3 Earth
radii). Recent results from the Doppler surveys suggest that discovery of a
transiting superEarth in the habitable zone of a lower main sequence star may
be possible. We evaluate the prospects for an all-sky transit survey targeted
to the brightest stars, that would find the most favorable cases for
photometric and spectroscopic characterization using the James Webb Space
Telescope (JWST). We use the proposed Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite
(TESS) as representative of an all-sky survey. We couple the simulated TESS
yield to a sensitivity model for the MIRI and NIRSpec instruments on JWST. We
focus on the TESS planets with radii between Earth and Neptune. Our simulations
consider secondary eclipse filter photometry using JWST/MIRI, comparing the 11-
and 15-micron bands to measure CO2 absorption in superEarths, as well as
JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy of water absorption from 1.7-3.0 microns, and CO2
absorption at 4.3-microns. We project that TESS will discover about eight
nearby habitable transiting superEarths. The principal sources of uncertainty
in the prospects for JWST characterization of habitable superEarths are
superEarth frequency and the nature of superEarth atmospheres. Based on our
estimates of these uncertainties, we project that JWST will be able to measure
the temperature, and identify molecular absorptions (water, CO2) in one to four
nearby habitable TESS superEarths.
