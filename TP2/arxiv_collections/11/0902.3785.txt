The paper discusses the fundamental characteristics distinguishing the
natural and social systems from each other. It considers in detail the basic
approaches, prospects, and possibilities of constructing mathematical
description for social systems as well as develops the appropriate notions
required to do this. The main attention is focused on systems with motion
treated as a characteristic example of social systems where the development of
mathematical description should demonstrate the crucial ideas of fusing natural
and social sciences.
