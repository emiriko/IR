We study the conductivity, density of states, and magnetic correlations of a
two dimensional, two band fermion Hubbard model using determinant Quantum Monte
Carlo (DQMC) simulations. We show that an orbitally selective Mott transition
(OSMT) occurs in which the more weakly interacting band can be metallic despite
complete localization of the strongly interacting band. The DQMC method allows
us to test the validity of the use of a momentum independent self-energy which
has been a central approximation in previous OSMT studies. In addition, we show
that long range antiferromagnetic order (LRAFO) is established in the
insulating phase, similar to the single band, square lattice Hubbard
Hamiltonian. Because the critical interaction strengths for the onset of
insulating behavior are much less than the bandwidth of the itinerant orbital,
we suggest that the development of LRAFO plays a key role in the transitions.
