The recently discovered coeval, moving groups of young stellar objects in the
solar neighborhood represent invaluable laboratories to study recent star
formation and to search for high metallicity stars which can be included in
future exo-planet surveys. In this study we derived through an uniform and
homogeneous method stellar atmospheric parameters and abundances for iron,
silicium and nickel in 63 Post T-Tauri Stars from 11 nearby young associations.
We further compare the results with two different pre-main sequence (PMS) and
main sequence (MS) star populations. The stellar atmospheric parameters and the
abundances presented here were derived using the equivalent width of individual
lines in the stellar spectra through the excitation/ionization equilibrium of
iron. Moreover, we compared the observed Balmer lines with synthetic profiles
calculated for model atmospheres with a different line formation code. We found
that the synthetic profiles agree reasonably well with the observed profiles,
although the Balmer lines of many stars are substantially filled-in, probably
by chromospheric emission. Solar metallicity is found to be a common trend on
all the nearby young associations studied. The low abundance dispersion within
each association strengthens the idea that the origin of these nearby young
associations is related to the nearby Star Forming regions (SFR). Abundances of
elements other than iron are consistent with previous results on Main Sequence
stars in the solar neighborhood. The chemical characterization of the members
of the newly found nearby young associations, performed in this study and
intended to proceed in subsequent works, is essential for understanding and
testing the context of local star formation and the evolutionary history of the
galaxy.
