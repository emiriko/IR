The paper is a survey of notions and results related to classical and new
generalizations of the notion of a periodic sequence. The topics related to
almost periodicity in combinatorics on words, symbolic dynamics, expressibility
in logical theories, algorithmic computability, Kolmogorov complexity, number
theory, are discussed.
