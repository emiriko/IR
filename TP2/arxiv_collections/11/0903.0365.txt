Interval analysis, when applied to the so called problem of experimental data
fitting, appears to be still in its infancy. Sometimes, partly because of the
unrivaled reliability of interval methods, we do not obtain any results at all.
Worse yet, if this happens, then we are left in the state of complete ignorance
concerning the unknown parameters of interest. This is in sharp contrast with
widespread statistical methods of data analysis. In this paper I show the
connections between those two approaches: how to process experimental data
rigorously, using interval methods, and present the final results either as
intervals (guaranteed, rigorous results) or in a more familiar probabilistic
form: as a mean value and its standard deviation.
