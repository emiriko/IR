We extend the Spectral Construction, a technique used with great success to
study and construct vector bundles on elliptically fibered varieties, to a
special family of abelian surface fibered varieties. The results are motivated
by requirements from Heterotic String Phenomenology where vector bundles with
specified chern class are required to produce a realistic particle spectrum.
Although only certain (1,8)-polarized families of abelian surfaces are
considered here we expect the main ideas to carry over to other families of
abelian varieties with a uniform relative polarization type.
