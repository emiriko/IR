We formulate the QCD critical point focusing effect on transverse velocity
($\beta_{t}$) dependence of antiproton to proton ($\bar{p}/p$) ratio, which was
recently proposed by Asakawa {\it et al.} as an experimental signature of QCD
critical point in high energy heavy ion collisions (HICs). For quantitative
analysis, Ultra-relativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics (UrQMD) transport model
and THERMal heavy-IoN generATOR (THERMINATOR) are applied to calculate the
corresponding $\beta_{t}$ dependence of $\bar{p}/p$ ratio for three gedanken
focused isentropic trajectories with different focusing degree on QCD phase
diagram. Finally, we obtained an observable anomaly in $\beta_{t}$ dependence
of $\bar{p}/p$ ratio, which can be employed as a signature of QCD critical
point.
