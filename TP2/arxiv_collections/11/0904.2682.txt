The expected rate for Multiple Parton Interactions (MPI) at the LHC is large.
This requires an estimate of their impact on all measurement foreseen at the
LHC while opening unprecendented opportunities for a detailed study of these
phenomena. In this paper we examine the MPI background to top-antitop
production, in the semileptonic channel, in the early phase of data taking when
the full power of $b$--tagging will not be available. The MPI background turns
out to be small but non negligible, of the order of 20% of the background
provided by W+4j production through a Single Parton Interaction. We then
analyze the possibility of studying Multiple Parton Interactions in the W+4j
channel, a far more complicated setting than the reactions examined at lower
energies. The MPI contribution turns out to be dominated by final states with
two energetic jets which balance in transverse momentum, and it appears
possible, thanks to the good angular resolution of ATLAS and CMS, to separate
the Multiple Parton Interactions contribution from Single Parton Interaction
processes. The large cross section for two jet production suggests that also
Triple Parton Interactions (TPI) could provide a non negligible contribution.
Our preliminary analysis suggests that it might be indeed possible to
investigate TPI at the LHC.
