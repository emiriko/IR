It has been suggested that the interactions of energetic particles with the
foamy structure of space-time thought to be generated by quantum-gravitational
(QG) effects might violate Lorentz invariance, so that they do not propagate at
a universal speed of light. We consider the limits that may be set on a linear
or quadratic violation of Lorentz invariance in the propagation of energetic
neutrinos, v/c=[1 +- (E/M_\nuQG1)] or [1 +- (E/M_\nu QG2}^2], using data from
supernova explosions and the OPERA long-baseline neutrino experiment.
