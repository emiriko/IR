The solution space of a K-satisfiability (K-SAT) formula is a collection of
solution clusters, each of which contains all the solutions that are mutually
reachable through a sequence of single-spin flips. Knowledge of the statistical
property of solution clusters is valuable for a complete understanding of the
solution space structure and the computational complexity of the random K-SAT
problem. This paper explores single solution clusters of random 3- and 4-SAT
formulas through unbiased and biased random walk processes and the
replica-symmetric cavity method of statistical physics. We find that the giant
connected component of the solution space has already formed many different
communities when the constraint density of the formula is still lower than the
solution space clustering transition point. Solutions of the same community are
more similar with each other and more densely connected with each other than
with the other solutions. The entropy density of a solution community is
calculated using belief propagation and is found to be different for different
communities of the same cluster. When the constraint density is beyond the
clustering transition point, the same behavior is observed for the solution
clusters reached by several stochastic search algorithms. Taking together, the
results of this work suggests a refined picture on the evolution of the
solution space structure of the random K-SAT problem; they may also be helpful
for designing new heuristic algorithms.
