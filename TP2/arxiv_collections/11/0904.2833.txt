We discuss renormalizability of a recently established, massive gravity
theory with particular higher derivative terms in three space-time dimensions.
It is shown that this massive gravity is certainly renormalizable as well as
unitary, so it gives us a physically interesting toy model of perturbative
quantum gravity in three dimensions.
