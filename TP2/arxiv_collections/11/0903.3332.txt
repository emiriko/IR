In this paper we address questions of continuity and atomicity of conformal
ending measures for arbitrary non-elementary Kleinian groups. We give
sufficient conditions under which such ending measures are purely atomic.
Moreover, we will show that if a conformal ending measure has an atom which is
contained in the big horospherical limit set, then this atom has to be a
parabolic fixed point. Also, we give detailed discussions of non-trivial
examples for purely atomic as well as for non-atomic conformal ending measures.
