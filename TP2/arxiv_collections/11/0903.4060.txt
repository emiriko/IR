Accretion shocks have been recognized as important X-ray emission mechanism
for pre-main sequence stars. Yet the X-ray properties of FUor outbursts, events
that are caused by violent accretion, have been given little attention. We have
observed the FUor object Z CMa during optical outburst and quiescence with
Chandra. No significant changes in X-ray brightness and spectral shape are
found, suggesting that the X-ray emission is of coronal nature. Due to the
binary nature of Z CMa the origin of the X-ray source is ambiguous. However,
the moderate hydrogen column density derived from our data makes it unlikely
that the embedded primary star is the X-ray source. The secondary star, which
is the FUor object, is thus responsible for both the X-ray emission and the
presently ongoing accretion outburst, which seem however to be unrelated
phenomena. The secondary is also known to drive a large outflow and jet, that
we detect here for the first time in X-rays. The distance of the X-ray emitting
outflow source to the central star is higher than in jets of low-mass stars.
