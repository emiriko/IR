We have learnt that the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of supersymmetric black
holes in five-dimensional minimal supergravity can be reproduced from
microstate counting via the AdS/CFT and Kerr/CFT correspondence. In this note,
we demostrate the coincidence of both formalisms for extremal and near-extremal
black holes in five-dimensional minimal supergravity. Connection to AdS_2
gravity is also mentioned.
