We present the results of experimental and numerical study of the
distribution of the reflection coefficient P(R) and the distributions of the
imaginary P(v) and the real P(u) parts of the Wigner's reaction K matrix for
irregular fully connected hexagon networks (graphs) in the presence of strong
absorption. In the experiment we used microwave networks, which were built of
coaxial cables and attenuators connected by joints. In the numerical
calculations experimental networks were described by quantum fully connected
hexagon graphs. The presence of absorption introduced by attenuators was
modelled by optical potentials. The distribution of the reflection coefficient
P(R) and the distributions of the reaction K matrix were obtained from the
measurements and numerical calculations of the scattering matrix S of the
networks and graphs, respectively. We show that the experimental and numerical
results are in good agreement with the exact analytic ones obtained within the
framework of random matrix theory (RMT).
