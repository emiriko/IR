I critically review recent lattice QCD results relevant for kaon
phenomenology, as well as the methods that are used to obtain them. The focus
is on calculations with N_f=2 and N_f=2+1 flavors of sea quarks. Concerning
methodology, the subjects covered include a discussion of how best to
extrapolate and/or interpolate results to the physical quark-mass point, a
scheme for assessing the extent to which a lattice QCD calculation includes the
various effects required to compute a given quantity reliably and a procedure
for averaging lattice results. The phenomenological topics that I review
comprise leptonic and semileptonic kaon decays, as well as neutral kaon mixing
and CP violation in K->\pi\pi decays.
