The theory of holographic algorithms, which are polynomial time algorithms
for certain combinatorial counting problems, yields insight into the hierarchy
of complexity classes. In particular, the theory produces algebraic tests for a
problem to be in the class P. In this article we streamline the implementation
of holographic algorithms by eliminating one of the steps in the construction
procedure, and generalize their applicability to new signatures. Instead of
matchgates, which are weighted graph fragments that replace vertices of a
natural bipartite graph G associated to a problem P, our approach uses only
only a natural number-of-edges by number-of-edges matrix associated to G. An
easy-to-compute multiple of its Pfaffian is the number of solutions to the
counting problem. This simplification improves our understanding of the
applicability of holographic algorithms, indicates a more geometric approach to
complexity classes, and facilitates practical implementations. The generalized
applicability arises because our approach allows for new algebraic tests that
are different from the "Grassmann-Plucker identities" used up until now.
Natural problems treatable by these new methods have been previously considered
in a different context, and we present one such example.
