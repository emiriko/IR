We have compared the results of a number of published class I methanol maser
surveys with the catalogue of high-mass outflow candidates identified from the
GLIMPSE survey (known as extended green objects or EGOs). We find class I
methanol masers associated with approximately two-thirds of EGOs. Although the
association between outflows and class I methanol masers has long been
postulated on the basis of detailed studies of a small number of sources, this
result demonstrates the relationship for the first time on a statistical basis.
Despite the publication of a number of searches for class I methanol masers, a
close physical association with another astrophysical object which could be
targeted for the search is still lacking. The close association between class I
methanol masers and EGOs therefore provides a large catalogue of candidate
sources, most of which have not previously been searched for class I methanol
masers. Interstellar masers and outflows have both been proposed to trace an
evolutionary sequence for high-mass star formation, therefore a better
understanding of the relationship between class I methanol masers and outflow
offers the potential for comparison and amalgamation of these two evolutionary
sequences.
