Paul Erdos claimed that mathematics is not yet ready to settle the 3x+1
conjecture. I agree, but very soon it will be! With the exponential growth of
computer-generated mathematics, we (or rather our silicon brethrern) would have
a shot at it. Of course, not by number crunching, but by symbol crunching and
automatic deduction. In the present article, I taught my computer how to use
the brilliant ideas of four human beings (Amal Amleh, Ed Grove, Candy Kent, and
Gerry Ladas) to prove two-dimensional analogs of this notorious conjecture.
Once programmed (using my Maple package LADAS) it reproduced their ten
theorems, and generated 134 new ones, complete with proofs. All by itself! I
believe that the proof of the original 3x+1 conjecture would be in the same
vein, but one would need a couple of extra human ideas, and better computers.
