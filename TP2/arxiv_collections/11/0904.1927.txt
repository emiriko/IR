We investigate how the criticality of the quantum Hall plateau transition in
disordered graphene differs from those in the ordinary quantum Hall systems,
based on the honeycomb lattice with ripples modeled as random hoppings. The
criticality of the graphene-specific n=0 Landau level is found to change
dramatically to an anomalous, almost exact fixed point as soon as we make the
random hopping spatially correlated over a few bond lengths. We attribute this
to the preserved chiral symmetry and suppressed scattering between K and K'
points in the Brillouin zone. The results suggest that a fixed point for random
Dirac fermions with chiral symmetry can be realized in free-standing, clean
graphene with ripples.
