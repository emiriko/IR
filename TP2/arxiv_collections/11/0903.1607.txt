The anisotropy in electrical transport and thermal behavior of single
crystalline R$_{2}$CoGa$_{8}$ series of compounds is presented. These compounds
crystallize in a tetragonal structure with space gropup P4/mmm. The nonmagnetic
counterparts of the series namely Y$_{2}$CoGa$_{8}$ and Lu$_{2}$CoGa$_{8}$show
a behavior consistent with the low density of states at the fermi level. In
Y$_{2}$CoGa$_{8}$, a possibility of charge density wave transition is observed
at $\approx$ 30 K. Gd$_{2}$CoGa$_{8}$ and Er$_{2}$CoGa$_{8}$ show a presence of
short range correlation above the magnetic ordering temperature of the
compound. In case of Gd$_{2}$CoGa$_{8}$, the magnetoresistance exhibits a
significant anisotropy for current parallel to {[}100{]} and {[}001{]}
directions. Compounds with other magnetic rare earths (R = Tb, Dy, Ho and Tm)
show the normal expected magnetic behavior whereas Dy$_{2}$CoGa$_{8}$ exhibits
the possibility of charge density wave (CDW) transition at approximately same
temperature as that of Y$_{2}$CoGa$_{8}$. The thermal property of these
compounds is analysed on the basis of crystalline electric field (CEF)
calculations.
