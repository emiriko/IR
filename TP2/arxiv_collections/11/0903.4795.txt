Hardy's paradox is analysed within Feynman's formulation of quantum
mechanics. A transition amplitude is represented as a sum over virtual paths
which different intermediate measurements convert into different sets of real
pathways. Contradictory statements emerge when applying to the same statistical
ensemble. The "strange" weak values result is also investigated in this
context.
