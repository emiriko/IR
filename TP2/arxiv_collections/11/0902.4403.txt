We summarise the motivation for, and the status of, the tools developed by
CEDAR/MCnet for validating and tuning Monte Carlo event generators for the LHC
against data from previous colliders. We then present selected preliminary
results from studies of event shapes and hadronisation observables from e+e-
colliders, and of minimum bias and underlying event observables from the
Tevatron, and comment on the approach needed with early LHC data to best
exploit the potential for new physics discoveries at the LHC in the next few
years.
