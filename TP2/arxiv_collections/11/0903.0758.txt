For an $(n-1)$-Auslander algebra $\Lambda$ with global dimension $n$, we give
some necessary conditions for $\Lambda$ admitting a maximal $(n-1)$-orthogonal
subcategory in terms of the properties of simple $\Lambda$-modules with
projective dimension $n-1$ or $n$. For an almost hereditary algebra $\Lambda$
with global dimension 2, we prove that $\Lambda$ admits a maximal 1-orthogonal
subcategory if and only if for any non-projective indecomposable
$\Lambda$-module $M$, $M$ is injective is equivalent to that the reduced grade
of $M$ is equal to 2. We give a connection between the Gorenstein Symmetric
Conjecture and the existence of maximal $n$-orthogonal subcategories of
$^{\bot}T$ for a cotilting module $T$. For a Gorenstein algebra, we prove that
all non-projective direct summands of a maximal $n$-orthogonal module are
$\Omega ^n\tau$-periodic. In addition, we study the relation between the
complexity of modules and the existence of maximal $n$-orthogonal subcategories
for the tensor product of two finite-dimensional algebras.
