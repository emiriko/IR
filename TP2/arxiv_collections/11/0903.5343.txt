We study ferromagnetism in a repulsively interacting two-component Fermi gas
in a harmonic trap. Within a local density approximation, the two components
phase-separate beyond a critical interaction strength, with one species having
a higher density at the trap center. We discuss several easily observable
experimental signatures of this transition. The mean field release energy, its
separate kinetic and interaction contributions, as well as the potential
energy, all depend on the interaction strength and contain a sharp signature of
this transition. In addition, the conversion rate of atoms to molecules,
arising from three-body collisions, peaks at an interaction strength just
beyond the ferromagnetic transition point. We then go beyond the local density
approximation, and derive an energy functional which includes a term that
depends on the local magnetization gradient and acts as a `surface tension'.
Using this energy functional, we numerically study the energetics of some
candidate spin textures which may be stabilized in a harmonic trapping
potential at zero net magnetization. We find that a hedgehog state has a lower
energy than an `in-out' domain wall state in an isotropic trap. Upon inclusion
of trap anisotropy we find that the hedgehog magnetization profile gets
distorted due to the surface tension term, this distortion being more apparent
for small atom numbers. We estimate that the magnetic dipole interaction does
not play a significant role in this system. We consider possible implications
for experiments on trapped Li-6 and K-40 gases.
