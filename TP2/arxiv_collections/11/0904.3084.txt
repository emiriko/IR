In an SU(9) model of gauged family unification, we propose an explanation for
why angles observed in the lepton flavor ({\it PMNS}) mixing matrix are
significantly larger than those measured for any analagous quark flavor ({\it
KM}) mixing angle. It is directly related to a see-saw mechanism that we assume
to be responsible for the generation of neutrino masses. Our model is more
constrained and therefore even more predictive than a model previously proposed
by Barr.
