We employ two different statistical tests to examine whether, in the
framework of the Constrained MSSM, the experimentally determined values of
BR(b->s gamma) and the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, (g-2), are
consistent with each other. Our tests are designed to compare the theoretical
predictions of the CMSSM in data space with the actual measurements, once all
of the CMSSM free parameters have been integrated out and constrained using all
other available data. We investigate the value of (g-2) as obtained by using
e+e- data alone (which shows a ~3sigma discrepancy with the SM prediction) and
as obtained based on tau decay data (which shows a much milder, 1sigma
discrepancy). We find that one of our tests returns either a statistically
inconclusive result or shows weak evidence of tension between BR(b->s gamma)
and the e+e- data based value of (g-2). On the other hand, our second test,
which is more stringent in this application, reveals that the joint
observations of BR(b->s gamma) and (g-2) from e+e- data alone are incompatible
within the CMSSM at the ~2sigma level. On the other hand, for both tests we
find no significant tension between BR(b->s gamma) and the value of (g-2)
evaluated using tau decay data. These results are only weakly dependent on the
three different priors that we employ in the analysis. We conclude that, if the
discrepancy between the Standard Model and the experimental determinations of
(g-2) is confirmed at the 3sigma level, this could be interpreted as strong
evidence against the CMSSM.
