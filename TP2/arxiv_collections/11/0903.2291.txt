Unconventional superconductors such as the high-transition temperature
cuprates, heavy-fermion systems and iron arsenide-based compounds exhibit
antiferromagnetic fluctuations that are dominated by a resonance, a collective
spin-one excitation mode in the superconducting state. Here we demonstrate the
existence of a universal linear relation, $Er \propto 2\Delta$, between the
magnetic resonance energy (Er) and the superconducting pairing gap ($\Delta$),
spanning two orders of magnitude in energy. This relation is valid for
materials that range from being close to the Mott-insulating limit to being on
the border of itinerant magnetism. Since the common excitonic picture of the
resonance has not led to such universality, our observation suggests a much
deeper connection between antiferromagnetic fluctuations and unconventional
superconductivity.
