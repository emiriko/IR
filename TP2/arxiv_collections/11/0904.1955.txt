Based on the assumption of two-quark structure of the scalar meson
$K_0^*(1430)$, we calculate the CP-averaged branching ratios for $B \to
K_0^*(1430) \etap$ decays in the framework of the perturbative QCD (pQCD)
approach here. We perform the evaluations in two scenarios for the scalar meson
spectrum. We find that: (a) the pQCD predictions for $Br(B \to K_0^*(1430)
\eta^{(\prime)})$ is $10^{-5} - 10^{-6}$, basically agree with the data within
large theoretical uncertainty; (b) the agreement between the pQCD predictions
and the data in the scenario I is better than that in the scenario II, which
can be tested by the forthcoming LHC experiments; (c) the annihilation
contributions play an important role for these considered decays.
