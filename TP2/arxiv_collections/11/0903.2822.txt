This is an invited summary of a seminar talk given at various institutions in
the United States and Canada. After a brief introduction, a review of the
minimal R-symmetric supersymmetric standard model is given, and the benefits to
the flavor sector are discussed. R-symmetric gauge mediation is an attempt to
realize this model using metastable supersymmetry breaking techniques. Sample
low energy spectra are presented and tuning is discussed. Various other
phenomenological results are summarized.
