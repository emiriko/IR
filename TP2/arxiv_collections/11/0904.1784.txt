To unite quantum theory and general relativity, in a new access it is shown
that from a theory of an abstract quantum information - called Protyposis - the
theory of general relativity can be deduced by means of few and physically good
founded reasons. "Abstract" quantum information means that primarily no special
meaning is connected with it. The resulting cosmology has an isotropic and
homogeneous metric and solves the so-called cosmological problems. For the
Protyposis it follows an equation of states for energy density and pressure
that fulfils all the energy conditions and that also gives an explanation for
the dark energy. If it is demanded that the relations between spacetime
structure and the material contend also hold for deviations from this ideal
cosmology than General relativity results as a description for local
inhomogenities.
