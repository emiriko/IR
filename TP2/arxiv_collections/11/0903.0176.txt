A surface M is called p-minimal if one of the coordinate functions is
p-harmonic in the inner metric. We show that in the twodimensional case the
Gaussian map of such surfaces is quasiconformal. In the case when the surface
is a tube we study the geometrical structure of such surfaces. In particularly,
we establish the second order differential inequality for the form of the
sections of M which generalizes the known ones in the minimal surfaces theory.
