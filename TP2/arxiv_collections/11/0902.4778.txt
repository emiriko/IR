By using the multifiber spectrograph FLAMES mounted at the ESO-VLT, we have
obtained high-resolution spectra for 18 giant stars, belonging to 3 old
globular clusters of the Large Magellanic Cloud (namely NGC 1786, 2210 and
2257). While stars in each cluster showed quite homogeneous iron content,
within a few cents of dex (the mean values being Fe/H]= -1.75+-0.01 dex,
-1.65+-0.02 dex and -1.95+-0.02 dex for NGC 1786, 2210 and 2257, respectively),
we have detected significant inhomogeneities for the [Na/Fe], [Al/Fe], [O/Fe]
and [Mg/Fe] abundance ratios, with evidence of [O/Fe] vs [Na/Fe] and [Mg/Fe] vs
[Al/Fe] anticorrelations. The trends detected nicely agree with those observed
in Galactic Globular Clusters, suggesting that such abundance anomalies are
ubiquitous features of old stellar systems and they do not depend on the parent
galaxy environment. In NGC 1786 we also detected two extreme O-poor, Na-rich
stars. This is the first time that a firm signature of extreme chemical
abundance anomalies has been found in an extragalactic stellar cluster.
