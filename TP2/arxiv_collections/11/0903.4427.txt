We present measurements of the thermal fluctuations of the free surface of an
aging colloidal suspension, Laponite. The technique consists in measuring the
fluctuations of the position of a laser beam that reflects from the free
surface. Analysing the data statistics, we show that, as the fluid ages, the
dynamics becomes intermittent. The intermittent events correspond to large
changes in the local slope of the free surface over a few milliseconds. We show
that those quakes are uncorrelated, although they are kept in memory by the
surface over short time scales.
