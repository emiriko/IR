We discuss stationary light created by a pair of counter-propagating control
fields in Lambda-type atomic gases with electromagnetically induced
transparency for the case of negligible Doppler broadening. In this case the
secular approximation used in the discussion of stationary light in hot vapors
is no longer valid. We discuss the quality of the effective light-trapping
system and show that in contrast to previous claims it is finite even for
vanishing ground-state dephasing. The dynamics of the photon loss is in general
non exponential and can be faster or slower than in hot gases.
