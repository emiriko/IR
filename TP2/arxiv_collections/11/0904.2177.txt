Human motor activities are known to exhibit scale-free long-term correlated
fluctuations over a wide range of timescales, from few to thousands of seconds.
The fundamental processes originating such fractal-like behavior are not yet
understood. To untangle the most significant features of these fluctuations, in
this work the problem is oversimplified by studying a much simpler system: the
spontaneous motion of rodents, recorded during several days. The analysis of
the animal motion reveals a robust scaling comparable with the results
previously reported in humans. It is shown that the most relevant features of
the experimental results can be replicated by the statistics of the
activation-threshold model proposed in another context by Davidsen and
Schuster.
