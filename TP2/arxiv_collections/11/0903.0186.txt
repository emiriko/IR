This is a paper in a series to study vertex algebra-like structures arising
from various algebras including quantum affine algebras and Yangians. In this
paper, we develop a theory of what we call (weak) quantum vertex
$\F((t))$-algebras with $\F$ a field of characteristic zero and $t$ a formal
variable, and we give a conceptual construction of (weak) quantum vertex
$\F((t))$-algebras and their modules. As an application, we associate weak
quantum vertex $\F((t))$-algebras to quantum affine algebras, providing a
solution to a problem posed by Frenkel and Jing. We also explicitly construct
an example of quantum vertex $\F((t))$-algebras from a certain quantum
$\beta\gamma$-system.
