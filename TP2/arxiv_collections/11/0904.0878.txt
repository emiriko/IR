Nanoflares, short and intense heat pulses within spatially unresolved
magnetic strands, are now considered a leading candidate to solve the coronal
heating problem. However, the frequent occurrence of nanoflares requires that
flare-hot plasma be present in the corona at all times. Its detection has
proved elusive until now, in part because the intensities are predicted to be
very faint. Here we report on the analysis of an active region observed with
five filters by Hinode/XRT in November 2006. We have used the filter ratio
method to derive maps of temperature and emission measure both in soft and hard
ratios. These maps are approximate in that the plasma is assumed to be
isothermal along each line-of-sight. Nonetheless, the hardest available ratio
reveals the clear presence of plasma around 10 MK. To obtain more detailed
information about the plasma properties, we have performed Monte Carlo
simulations assuming a variety of non-isothermal emission measure distributions
along the lines-of-sight. We find that the observed filter ratios imply
bi-modal distributions consisting of a strong cool (log T ~ 6.3-6.5) component
and a weaker (few percent) and hotter (6.6 < log T < 7.2) component. The data
are consistent with bi-modal distributions along all lines of sight, i.e.,
throughout the active region. We also find that the isothermal temperature
inferred from a filter ratio depends sensitively on the precise temperature of
the cool component. A slight shift of this component can cause the hot
component to be obscured in a hard ratio measurement. Consequently, temperature
maps made in hard and soft ratios tend to be anti-correlated. We conclude that
this observation supports the presence of widespread nanoflaring activity in
the active region.
