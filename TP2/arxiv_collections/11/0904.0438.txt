The bacterial flagellar motor is a highly efficient rotary machine used by
many bacteria to propel themselves. It has recently been shown that at low
speeds its rotation proceeds in steps [Sowa et al. (2005) Nature 437,
916--919]. Here we propose a simple physical model that accounts for this
stepping behavior as a random walk in a tilted corrugated potential that
combines torque and contact forces. We argue that the absolute angular position
of the rotor is crucial for understanding step properties, and show this
hypothesis to be consistent with the available data, in particular the
observation that backward steps are smaller on average than forward steps. Our
model also predicts a sublinear torque-speed relationship at low torque, and a
peak in rotor diffusion as a function of torque.
