We calculated for the nearest active galactic nucleus (AGN), Centaurus A (Cen
A), the flux of high energy cosmic rays and of accompanying secondary photons
and neutrinos expected from hadronic interactions in the source. We used as two
basic models for the generation of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays (UHECR) shock
acceleration in the radio jet and acceleration in the regular electromagnetic
field close to the core of the AGN, normalizing the UHECR flux to the
observations of the Auger experiment. Here we compare the previously obtained
photon fluxes with the recent data reported by the Fermi LAT and H.E.S.S.
collaborations. In the case of the core model, we find good agreement both for
the predicted spectral shape and the overall normalization between our earlier
results and the H.E.S.S. observations for a primary proton energy $dN/dE\propto
E^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha\sim 2$ or smaller. A broken-power law with
high-energy part $\alpha=-2.7$ leads to photon fluxes in excess of the Fermi
measurements. The energy spectrum of the photon fluxes obtained by us for the
jet scenario is in all cases at variance with the H.E.S.S. and Fermi
observations.
