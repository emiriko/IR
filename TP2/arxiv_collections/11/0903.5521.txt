Starting from the continuum Dirac operator, I construct a renormalisation
group blocking which transforms the continuum action into a lattice action, and
I specifically consider the Wilson and overlap formalisms. For Wilson fermions
the inverse blocking is non-local and thus invalid. However, I proceed to
demonstrate that it is possible to construct a valid, local, blocking which,
though dependent on the lattice spacing, generates the lattice overlap fermion
action from the continuum action.
  Using this renormalisation group blocking for overlap fermions, I derive the
Ginsparg-Wilson equations and the lattice chiral symmetry. I suggest how the
construction of a lattice chiral gauge theory could follow naturally from this
approach.
