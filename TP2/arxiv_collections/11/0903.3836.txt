The fate of the cosmological singularity in the Taub model is discussed
within the two frameworks. An internal time variable is ruled out and the only
remaining degree of freedom (the anisotropy) of the Universe is quantized
according to such schemes. The resulting GUP Taub Universe is singularity-free,
differently from the second case, where the classical singularity is not tamed
by the polymer-loop quantum effects.
