This paper analyses 3.5 years of site testing data obtained at Dome C,
Antarctica, based on measurements obtained with three DIMMs located at three
different elevations. Basic statistics of the seeing and the isoplanatic angle
are given, as well as the characteristic time of temporal fluctuations of these
two parameters, which we found to around 30 minutes at 8 m. The 3 DIMMs are
exploited as a profiler of the surface layer, and provide a robust estimation
of its statistical properties. It appears to have a very sharp upper limit
(less than 1 m). The fraction of time spent by each telescope above the top of
the surface layer permits us to deduce a median height of between 23 m and 27
m. The comparison of the different data sets led us to infer the statistical
properties of the free atmosphere seeing, with a median value of 0.36 arcsec.
The C_n^2 profile inside the surface layer is also deduced from the seeing data
obtained during the fraction of time spent by the 3 telescopes inside this
turbulence. Statistically, the surface layer, except during the 3-month summer
season, contributes to 95 percent of the total turbulence from the surface
level, thus confirming the exceptional quality of the site above it.
