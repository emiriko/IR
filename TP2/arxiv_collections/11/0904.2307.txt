We present an update of the orbital ephemeris of the binary X-ray pulsar Her
X-1 and determine an improved value for the rate of orbital decay. In addition,
we report the first measurement of the orbital eccentricity. We have analyzed
pulse timing data of Her X-1 from X-ray observations by RXTE (Rossi X-Ray
Timing Explorer) and INTEGRAL over the period 1996-2007. Accurate pulse arrival
times were determined from solar system bary-centered photon arrival times by
generating pulse profiles averaged over appropriately short integration times.
Applying pulse phase connection techniques, it was possible to determine
sufficiently accurate local ephemeris data for seven observation periods
distributed over 12 years. Combining the new local T90 values with historical
values from the literature we update the orbital ephemeris of Her X-1 to T90 =
MJD 46359.871940(6) and Porb = 1.700167590(2) d and measure a continuous change
of the orbital period of dPorb/dt = -(4.85 +/- 0.13) x 10-11 s/s. For the first
time, a value for the eccentricity of the orbit of Her X-1 is measured to be e
= (4.2 +/- 0.8) x 10-4.
