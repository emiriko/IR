Single-scale quantities, like the QCD anomalous dimensions and Wilson
coefficients, obey difference equations. Therefore their analytic form can be
determined from a finite number of moments. We demonstrate this in an explicit
calculation by establishing and solving large scale recursions by means of
computer algebra for the anomalous dimensions and Wilson coefficients in
unpolarized deeply inelastic scattering from their Mellin moments to 3-loop
order.
