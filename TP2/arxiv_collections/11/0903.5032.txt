We study the pseudoscalar glueball candidates in a chiral effective
Lagrangian model proposed by 't hooft, motived by taking into account the
instanton effects, which can describe not only the chiral symmetry breaking,
but also the solution of $U_A(1)$. We study the parameter space allowed by
constraints from vacuum conditions and unitary bounds. By considering two
scenarios in $0^{++}$ sector, we find that parameter space which can
accommodate the $0^{-+}$ sector is sensitive to the conditions in $0^{++}$
sector. From our analysis, it is found that three $\eta$ states, i.e.
$\eta(1295)$, $\eta(1405)$, $\eta(1475)$, can be glueball candidates if we
assume that the lightest $0^{++}$ glueball has a mass 1710 MeV. While there is
no $0^{-+}$ glueball candidate found in experiments if we assume that the
lightest $0^{++}$ glueball has a mass 660 MeV.
