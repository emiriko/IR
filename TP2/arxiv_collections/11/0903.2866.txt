We show that the average and typical ranks in a certain parametric family of
elliptic curves described by D. Ulmer tend to infinity as the parameter $d
\to\infty$. This is perhaps unexpected since by a result of A. Brumer, the
average rank for all elliptic curves over a function field of positive
characteristic is asymptotically bounded above by 2.3.
