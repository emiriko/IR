We have shown that resonant quantum tunnelling of the magnetisation (QTM),
until now observed only in 0D cluster systems (SMMs), occurs in the molecular
Ising spin chain, CoTAC ([(CH_3)_3NH]CoCl_3 - 2H_2O) which orders as a canted
3D-antiferromagnet at T_C=4.15 K. This effect was observed around a resonant
like field value of 1025 Oe. We present here measurements of the relaxation of
the magnetisation as a function of time, from the zero field cooled (ZFC)
antiferromagnet state and from the saturated ferromagnet state. We show that,
at the resonant field, the relaxation from the saturated state occurs in a
complicated process, whereas, surprisingly, in the case of the ZFC state, the
relaxation is exponential.
