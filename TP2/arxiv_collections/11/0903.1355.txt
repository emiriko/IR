We show that in cosmology the gravitational action of the far away matter has
quite relevant effects, if retardation of the forces and discreteness of matter
(with its spatial correlation) are taken into account. The expansion rate is
found to be determined by the density of the far away matter, i.e., by the
density of matter at remote times. This leads to the introduction of an
effective density, which has to be five times larger than the present one, if
the present expansion rate is to be accounted for. The force per unit mass on a
test particle is found to be of the order of 0.2cH_0. The corresponding
contribution to the virial of the forces for a cluster of galaxies is also
discussed, and it is shown that it fits the observations if a decorrelation
property of the forces at two separated points is assumed. So it appears that
the gravitational effects of the far away matter may have the same order of
magnitude as the corresponding local effects of dark matter.
