We predict the existence of spatial-spectral vortex solitons in
one-dimensional periodic waveguide arrays with quadratic nonlinear response. In
such vortices the energy flow forms a closed loop through the simultaneous
effects of phase gradients at the fundamental frequency and second-harmonic
fields, and the parametric frequency conversion between the spectral
components. The linear stability analysis shows that such modes are stable in a
broad parameter region.
