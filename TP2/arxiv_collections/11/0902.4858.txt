A good particle candidate for Cold Dark Matter (CDM) is the supersymmetric
neutralino or more generally a weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP). The
expected interaction rate of WIMPs with the detector medium in the direct
detection experiments is below 0.01 events/kg/day. This makes a good knowledge
of the background conditions highly important, especially with ever increasing
sensitivity of the detectors. One of the background components is related to
cosmic muons and in particular to muon-induced neutrons. Detailed studies
carried out by the Edelweiss collaboration in this respect are presented. This
activity includes GEANT4 simulations with full event topology as well as a
dedicated measurement with a new neutron counter installed in the fall of 2008
in LSM (Laboratoire Souterrain de Modane, France). This counter is incorporated
into the existing muon veto system thus allowing to monitor neutrons in
coincidence with the incoming muons.
