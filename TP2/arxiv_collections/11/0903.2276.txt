Thermal ($C_P$), magnetic ($M$ and $\chi_{ac}$) and transport ($\rho$)
measurements on Ce$_{2}$Pd$_{2}$Sn are reported. High temperature properties
are well described by the presence of two excited crystal field levels at
$(65\pm 5)$K and $(230\pm 20)$K, with negligible hybridization (Kondo) effects.
According to literature, two transitions were observed at $T_M=4.8$K and $T_C
=2.1$K respectively. The upper transition cannot be considered as a standard
anti-ferromagnetic because of frustration effects in a triangular network of
Ce-atoms and the positive sign of the paramagnetic temperature $\theta_P^{LT} =
4.4$K. The nature of the this intermediated phase is described accounting for
the formation of ferromagnetic (F) Ce-dimers disposed in a quasi-2D square
lattice, resembling a Shastry-Sutherland pattern. According to hysteretic
features in $\rho(T)$ and $\chi_{ac}(T)$, the lower F-transition is of first
order, with $C_P(T<T_C)$ revealing a gap of anisotropy $E_g\approx 7$K.
