We reconsider some important foundational problems of quantum mechanics.
After reviewing the measurement problem and discussing its unavoidability, we
analyze some proposals to overcome it. This analysis leads us to reconsider the
current debate on our best theory, i.e. quantum mechanics itself. We stress
that, after the remarkable interest and the many efforts which have lead, in
the last years of the past century, to a revival of the subject, and, more
important, to new interesting results, we are now witnessing a re-emergence of
the vague and unprofessional positions which have characterized the debate in
the second quarter of the XXth century. In particular we consider as extremely
serious the fact that a completely mistaken position concerning the real
meaning of Bell's theorem seems to have been taken by many scientists in the
field.
