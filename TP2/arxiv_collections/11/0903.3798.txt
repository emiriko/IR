The resonant interaction between two two-level atoms and m- electromagnetic
modes in a cavity is considered. Entanglement dynamics between two atoms is
examined. In particular we compare dynamical variations for different cavity
modes as well as for different cavity photon numbers. The collapse and revival
of entanglement is exhibited by varying the atom-photon interaction times.
