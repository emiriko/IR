he multiqubit entangled states are coherently controlled in the quantum spin
systems composed of $N+1$ interacting antiferromagnetic molecular rings. The
tunable intermolecular couplings arise from the local exchange interactions
between electron spins of $N$ circumjacent magnets and those of one central
molecular ring. The quantum dynamics of such system is analytically deduced by
the effective spin hamiltonian with anisotropic Heisenberg couplings. It is
found that entangled $W$ states can be generated with a high precision under
the circumstance of quantum fluctuations. The multiqubit entangled state is
also transferred from some molecular rings to others by the selection of
intermolecular couplings.
