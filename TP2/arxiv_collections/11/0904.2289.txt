In this paper, the dynamics of bias stress phenomenon in Sexithiophene (T6)
Field Effect Transistors (FETs) has been investigated. T6 FETs have been
fabricated by vacuum depositing films with thickness from 10 nm to 130 nm on
Si/SiO2 substrates. After the T6 film structural analysis by X-Ray diffraction
and the FET electrical investigation focused on carrier mobility evaluation,
bias stress instability parameters have been estimated and discussed in the
context of existing models. By increasing the film thickness, a clear
correlation between the stress parameters and the structural properties of the
organic layer has been highlighted. Conversely, the mobility values result
almost thickness independent.
