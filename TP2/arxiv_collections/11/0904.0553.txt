This paper supplements Jiang et al. (2003), who studied 172 M31 globular
clusters (GCs) and globular cluster candidates from Battistini et al. (1987) on
the basis of integrated photometric measurements in the
Beijing-Arizona-Taiwan-Connecticut (BATC) photometric system. Here, we present
multicolor photometric CCD data (in the BATC system) for the remaining 39 M31
GCs and candidates. In addition, the ages of 35 GCs are constrained by
comparing our accurate photometry with updated theoretical stellar synthesis
models. We use photometric measurements from GALEX in the far- and
near-ultraviolet and 2MASS infrared $JHK_s$ data, in combination with optical
photometry. Except for two clusters, the ages of the other sample GCs are all
older than 1 Gyr. Their age distribution shows that most sample clusters are
younger than 6 Gyr, with a peak at ~3 Gyr, although the `usual' complement of
well-known old GCs (i.e., GCs of similar age as the majority of the Galactic
GCs) is present as well.
