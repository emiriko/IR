We investigate the connection between local minima in the problem Hamiltonian
and first order quantum phase transitions during an adiabatic quantum
computation. We demonstrate how some properties of the local minima can lead to
an extremely small gap that is exponentially sensitive to the Hamiltonian
parameters. Using perturbation expansion, we derive an analytical formula that
can not only predict the behavior of the gap, but also provide insight on how
to controllably vary the gap size by changing the parameters. We show agreement
with numerical calculations for a weighted maximum independent set problem
instance.
