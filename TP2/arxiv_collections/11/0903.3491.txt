The authors apply the generalized master equation to analyze time-dependent
transport through a finite quantum wire with an embedded subsystem. The
parabolic quantum wire and the leads with several subbands are described by a
continuous model. We use an approach originally developed for a tight-binding
description selecting the relevant states for transport around the bias-window
defined around the values of the chemical potential in the left and right leads
in order to capture the effects of the nontrivial geometry of the system in the
transport. We observe a partial current reflection as a manifestation of a
quasi-bound state in an embedded well and the formation of a resonance state
between an off-set potential hill and the boundary of the system.
