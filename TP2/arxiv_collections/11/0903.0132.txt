We extend an argument of S.Lichtenbaum involving codimension one cycles to
higher codimensions and obtain a generalization of the well-known Picard-Brauer
exact sequence for a smooth variety X. The resulting exact sequence connects
the codimension n Chow group of X with a certain "Brauer-like" group.
