We deform the N=6 Chern Simons theory by adding extra matter hypermultiplets
in a fundamental representation of one or both gauge groups. We compute the
quantum corrected moduli space. We verify that the holographic dual of the
modified theory consists of the usual AdS4 x CP3 background in presence of AdS4
filling D6 branes which wrap RP3 in CP3. We extend the correspondence to a
similar modification of more general known N=3 dual pairs
