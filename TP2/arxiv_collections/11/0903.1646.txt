We investigate the open spin chain describing the scalar sector of the Y=0
giant graviton brane at weak coupling. We provide a direct proof of
integrability in the SU(2) and SU(3) sectors by constructing the transfer
matrices. We determine the eigenvalues of these transfer matrices in terms of
roots of the corresponding Bethe ansatz equations (BAEs). Based on these
results, we propose BAEs for the full SO(6) sector. We find that, in the
weak-coupling limit, the recently-proposed all-loop BAEs essentially agree with
those proposed in the present work.
