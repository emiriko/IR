Some quantum cryptographic protocols can be implemented with specially
prepared chocolate balls, others protected by value indefiniteness cannot.
Similarities and differences of cryptography with quanta and chocolate are
discussed. Motivated by these considerations it is proposed to certify quantum
random number generators and quantum cryptographic protocols by value
indefiniteness. This feature, which derives itself from Bell- and
Kochen-Specker type arguments, is only present in systems with three or more
mutually exclusive outcomes.
