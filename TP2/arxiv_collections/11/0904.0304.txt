We find that the one-loop correction to the ratio of Yukawa coupling and
gauge coupling in the gauge-Higgs unification, "gauge-Yukawa universality
violation", is finite and calculable in any space-time dimension. Applying this
result to the ratio of top quark and W-boson masses, we show that the order one
correction required to generate a viable top quark mass is indeed possible if
the fermion embedding top quark belongs to the large dimensional representation
of the gauge group and a vacuum expectation value of Higgs scalar field is very
small comparing to the compactification scale.
