It is suggested that the vacuum expectation of the quantum vacuum
energy-momentum is zero, but quantum fluctuations give rise to a space-time
curvature equivalent to that of a cosmological constant or dark energy.
Calculations within quantized gravity, following a few plausible hypotheses,
provide results compatible with cosmological observations.
