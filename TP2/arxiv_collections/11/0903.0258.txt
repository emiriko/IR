Take a cellular automaton, consider that each configuration is a basis vector
in some vector space, and linearize the global evolution function. If lucky,
the r esult could actually make sense physically, as a valid quantum evolution;
but do es it make sense as a quantum cellular automaton? That is the main
question we a ddress in this paper. In every model with discrete time and
space, two things ar e required in order to qualify as a cellular automaton:
invariance by translatio n and locality. We prove that this locality condition
is so restrictive in the q uantum case that every quantum cellular automaton
constructed in this way - i. e., by linearization of a classical one - must be
reversible. We also discuss some subtleties about the extent of nonlocality
that can be encountered in the o ne-dimensional case; we show that, even when
the quantized version is non local, still, under some conditions, we may be
unable to use this nonlocality to trans mit information nonlocally.
