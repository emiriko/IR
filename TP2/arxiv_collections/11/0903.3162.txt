Analyzing exact solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell equations in the
Kerr-Schild formalism we show that black hole horizon is instable with respect
to electromagnetic excitations. Contrary to perturbative smooth harmonic
solutions, the exact solutions for electromagnetic excitations on the Kerr
background are accompanied by singular beams which have very strong back
reaction to metric and break the horizon, forming the holes which allow
radiation to escape interior of black-hole. As a result, even the weak vacuum
fluctuations break the horizon topologically, covering it by a set of
fluctuating microholes. We conclude with a series of nontrivial consequences,
one of which is that there is no information loss inside of black-hole.
