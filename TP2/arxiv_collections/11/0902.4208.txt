We report on temperature dependence of acoustic phonon-induced resistance
oscillations in very high mobility two-dimensional electron systems. We observe
that the temperature dependence is non-monotonic and that higher order
oscillations are best developed at progressively lower temperatures. Our
analysis shows that, in contrast to Shubnikov-de Haas effect, phonon-induced
resistance oscillations are sensitive to electron-electron interactions
modifying the single particle lifetime.
