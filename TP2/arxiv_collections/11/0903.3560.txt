Single crystal neutron diffraction is used to investigate the magnetic and
structural phase diagram of the electron doped superconductor
Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$)$_2$As$_2$. Heat capacity and resistivity measurements have
demonstrated that Co doping this system splits the combined antiferromagnetic
and structural transition present in BaFe$_2$As$_2$ into two distinct
transitions. For $x$=0.025, we find that the upper transition is between the
high-temperature tetragonal and low-temperature orthorhombic structures with
($T_{\mathrm{TO}}=99 \pm 0.5$ K) and the antiferromagnetic transition occurs at
$T_{\mathrm{AF}}=93 \pm 0.5$ K. We find that doping rapidly suppresses the
antiferromagnetism, with antiferromagnetic order disappearing at $x \approx
0.055$. However, there is a region of co-existence of antiferromagnetism and
superconductivity. The effect of the antiferromagnetic transition can be seen
in the temperature dependence of the structural Bragg peaks from both neutron
scattering and x-ray diffraction. We infer from this that there is strong
coupling between the antiferromagnetism and the crystal lattice.
