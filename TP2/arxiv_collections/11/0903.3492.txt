The solar surface dynamo has become an active area of research in an attempt
to understand the origin of a variety of magnetic field structures on the sun.
The major modification that needs to be incorporated in the standard dynamo
process is the inclusion of the partial ionization of the gas in the layers
underlying and overlaying the photosphere along with the effects associated
with the multifluid nature of the system. This not only changes the inertia
carrying species but also substantially modifies the temporal and spatial
evolution of the magnetic induction. The energy equation also carries the
import of these non-ideal effects. The effects such as the Hall effect and the
ambipolar diffusion take the dynamo study beyond the realm of the ideal
magnetohydrodynamics. In this paper, a first principle formulation of the solar
surface dynamo problem has been attempted.
