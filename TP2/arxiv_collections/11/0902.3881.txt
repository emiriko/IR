We resolve the long standing question of temperature dependence of uniformly
moving bodies by means of a quantum statistical treatment centred on the zeroth
law of thermodynamics. The key to our treatment is the result, established by
Kossakowski et al, that a macroscopic body behaves as a thermal reservoir with
well-defined temperature, in the sense of the zeroth law, if and only if its
state satisfies the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) condition. In order to relate
this result to the relativistic thermodynamics of moving bodies, we employ the
Tomita-Takesaki modular theory to prove that a state cannot satisfy the KMS
conditions with respect to two different inertial frames whose relative
velocity is non-zero. This implies that the concept of temperature stemming
from the zeroth law is restricted to states of bodies in their rest frames and
thus that there is no law of temperature transformations under Lorentz boosts.
The corresponding results for nonrelativistic Galilean systems have also been
established.
