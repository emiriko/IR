The moduli space of N=1 type II warped compactions to flat space with generic
internal fluxes is studied. Using the underlying integrable generalized complex
structure that characterizes these vacua, the different deformations are
classified by H-twisted generalized cohomologies and identified with chiral and
linear multiplets of the effective four-dimensional theory. The Kaehler
potential for chiral fields corresponding to classically flat moduli is
discussed. As an application of the general results, type IIB warped Calabi-Yau
compactifications and other SU(3)-structure subcases are considered in more
detail.
