We present a simpler derivation of the exact solution of a spin-polaron in a
ferromagnet and generalize it to complex lattices and/or longer range exchange
interactions. As a specific example, we analyze a two-dimensional MnO$_2$-like
lattice (as in the ferromagnetic layers in LaMnO$_3$) and discuss the
properties of the resulting spin-polaron in various regimes. At strong
couplings the solution is reminiscent of the Zhang-Rice singlet, however the
electronic wavefunction involved in the singlet is dependent on the momentum of
the singlet, and multiple bands may appear.
