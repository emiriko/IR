In a weakly ionized plasma, the evolution of the magnetic field is described
by a "generalized Ohm's law" that includes the Hall effect and the ambipolar
diffusion terms. These terms introduce additional spatial and time scales which
play a decisive role in the cascading and the dissipation mechanisms in
magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. We determine the Kolmogorov dissipation scales
for the viscous, the resistive and the ambipolar dissipation mechanisms. The
plasma, depending on its properties and the energy injection rate, may
preferentially select one of the these dissipation scales. thus determining the
shortest spatial scale of the supposedly self-similar spectral distribution of
the magnetic field. The results are illustrated taking the partially ionized
part of the solar atmosphere as an example. Thus the shortest spatial scale of
the supposedly self-similar spectral distribution of the solar magnetic field
is determined by any of the four dissipation scales given by the viscosity, the
Spizer resistivity (electron-ion collisions), the resistivity due to
electron-neutral collisions and the ambipolar diffusivity. It is found that the
ambipolar diffusion dominates for resonably large energy injection rate. The
robustness of the magnetic helicity in the partially ionized solar atmosphere
would facilitate the formation of self-organized vortical structures.
