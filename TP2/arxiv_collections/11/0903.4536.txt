An RD-space ${\mathcal X}$ is a space of homogeneous type in the sense of
Coifman and Weiss with the additional property that a reverse doubling
condition holds in ${\mathcal X}$. Let $\rho$ be an admissible function on
RD-space ${\mathcal X}$. The authors first introduce the localized spaces
$\mathrm{BMO}_\rho({\mathcal X})$ and $\mathrm{BLO}_\rho({\mathcal X})$ and
establish their basic properties, including the John-Nirenberg inequality for
$\mathrm{BMO}_\rho({\mathcal X})$, several equivalent characterizations for
$\mathrm{BLO}_\rho({\mathcal X})$, and some relations between these spaces.
Then the authors obtain the boundedness on these localized spaces of several
operators including the natural maximal operator, the Hardy-Littlewood maximal
operator, the radial maximal functions and their localized versions associated
to $\rho$, and the Littlewood-Paley $g$-function associated to $\rho$, where
the Littlewood-Paley $g$-function and some of the radial maximal functions are
defined via kernels which are modeled on the semigroup generated by the
Schr\"odinger operator. These results apply in a wide range of settings, for
instance, to the Schr\"odinger operator or the degenerate Schr\"odinger
operator on ${{\mathbb R}}^d$, or the sub-Laplace Schr\"odinger operator on
Heisenberg groups or connected and simply connected nilpotent Lie groups.
