The argument from naturalness is widely employed in contemporary quantum
field theory. Essentially a formalized aesthetic criterion, it received a
meaning in the debate on the Higgs mechanism, which goes beyond aesthetics. We
follow the history of technical definitions of fine tuning at the scale of
electroweak symmetry breaking. It is argued that they give rise to a special
interpretation of probability, which we call Gedankenfrequency. By extension of
its original meaning, the argument from naturalness is used to compare
different models beyond the Standard Model. We show that in this case
naturalness cannot be defined objectively. Rather, it functions as
socio-historical heuristics in particle physics and it contributes to the
advent of a probabilistic version of Popper's falsificationism.
