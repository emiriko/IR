It has been shown by Versraete et. al [F. Versraete, J. Dehaene, B. De Moor,
and H. Verschelde, Phys. Rev. A65, 052112 (2002)] that by stochastic local
operations and classical communication (SLOCC), a pure state of four qubits can
be transformed to a state belonging to one of a set of nine families of states.
By using selective partial transposition, we construct partial K-way
negativities to measure the genuine 4-partite, tripartite, and bi-partite
entanglement of single copy states belonging to the nine families of four qubit
states. Partial K-way negativities are polynomial functions of local invariants
characterizing each family of states as such entanglement monotones.
