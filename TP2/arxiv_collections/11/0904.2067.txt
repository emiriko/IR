The present work reports the results of 30S radioactive beam development for
a future experiment directly measuring data to extrapolate the 30S(alpha,p)
stellar reaction rate in Type I X-ray bursts, a phenomena where nuclear
explosions occur repeatedly on the surface of accreting neutron stars. We
produce the radioactive ion 30S via the 3He(28Si,30S)n reaction, by bombarding
a cryogenically cooled target of 3He at 400 Torr and 80 K with 28Si beams of
6.9 and 7.54 MeV/u. In order to perform a successful future experiment which
allows us to calculate the stellar 30S(alpha, p) reaction rate, Hauser-Feshbach
calculations indicate we require a 30S beam of ~10^5 particles per second at
~32 MeV. Based on our recent beam development experiments in 2006 and 2008, it
is believed that such a beam may be fabricated in 2009 according to the results
presented. We plan to measure the 4He(30S,p) cross-section at astrophysical
energies in 2009, and some brief remarks on the planned (alpha,p) technique are
also elucidated.
