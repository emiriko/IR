Three Wave Hypothesis (TWH) is of a relativistic quantum foundation. The
formulation of TWH has perfect similarities with bevel gear model. The rest
mass is considered within TWH and as a consequence of similarity, between TWH
and the gear model, it is found that rest mass frequency is related the
frequency of touch point of the gear in relative to the large wheel. In
regarding this frequency instead of the small wheel frequency, the gear model
leads to four-vector representation of a particle.
