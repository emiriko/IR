We define a family of 'no signaling' bipartite boxes with arbitrary inputs
and binary outputs, and with a range of marginal probabilities. The defining
correlations are motivated by the Klyachko version of the Kochen-Specker
theorem, so we call these boxes Kochen-Specker-Klyachko boxes or, briefly,
KS-boxes. The marginals cover a variety of cases, from those that can be
simulated classically to the superquantum correlations that saturate the
Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality, when the KS-box is a generalized PR-box
(hence a vertex of the `no signaling' polytope). We show that for certain
marginal probabilities a KS-box is classical with respect to nonlocality as
measured by the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt correlation, i.e., no better than
shared randomness as a resource in simulating a PR-box, even though such
KS-boxes cannot be perfectly simulated by classical or quantum resources for
all inputs. We comment on the significance of these results for contextuality
and nonlocality in 'no signaling' theories.
