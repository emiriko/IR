A number of problems in a variety of fields are characterised by target
distributions with a multimodal structure in which the presence of several
isolated local maxima dramatically reduces the efficiency of Markov Chain Monte
Carlo sampling algorithms. Several solutions, such as simulated tempering or
the use of parallel chains, have been proposed to facilitate the exploration of
the relevant parameter space. They provide effective strategies in the cases in
which the dimension of the parameter space is small and/or the computational
costs are not a limiting factor. These approaches fail however in the case of
high-dimensional spaces where the multimodal structure is induced by
degeneracies between regions of the parameter space. In this paper we present a
fully Markovian way to efficiently sample this kind of distribution based on
the general Delayed Rejection scheme with an arbitrary number of steps, and
provide details for an efficient numerical implementation of the algorithm.
