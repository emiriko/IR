We exploit the quantum coherence between pair-produced D0 and D0B in
psi(3770) decays to make a first determination of the relative strong phase
differences between D0--> K0Spi+pi- and D0B--> K0Spi+pi-, which are of great
importance in determining the CKM angle gamma/phi3 in B- --> D0 (D0B) K-
decays. Using 818 1/pb of e+e- collision data collected with the CLEO-c
detector at Ecm = 3.77 GeV, we employ a binned Dalitz-plot analysis of K0S
pi+pi- and K0Lpi+pi- decays recoiling against flavor-tagged, CP-tagged and
K0Spi+pi- tagged events to determine these strong phase differences.
