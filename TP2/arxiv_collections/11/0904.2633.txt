Hubble's name is associated closely with the idea of an expanding universe as
he discovered the relation between the recession velocity and distances of
galaxies. Hubble also did a lot of pioneering work on the distribution of
galaxies in the universe. In this article we take a look at Hubble's law and
discuss how it relates with models of the universe. We also give a historical
perspective of the discoveries that led to the Hubble's law.
