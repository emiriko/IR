This paper develops the theory of affine Lie-Poisson reduction and applies
this process to Yang-Mills and Hall magnetohydrodynamics for fluids and
superfluids. As a consequence of this approach, the associated Poisson brackets
are obtained by reduction of a canonical cotangent bundle. A Kelvin-Noether
circulation theorem is presented and is applied to these examples.
