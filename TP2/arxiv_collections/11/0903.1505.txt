The mass eigen states $K_1(1270)$ and $K_1(1400)$ are mixture of the strange
members of two axial-vector SU(3) octet, $^3P_1(K_1^A)$ and $^1P_1(K_1^B)$.
Taking into account this mixture, the forward-backward asymmetry and branching
ratio of $B \rar K_1(1270,1400) \ell^+ \ell^-$ transitions are studied in the
framework of different supersymmetric models. It is found that the results have
considerable deviation from the standard model predictions. Any measurement of
these physical observables and their comparison with the results obtained in
this paper can give useful information about the nature of interactions beyond
the standard model.
