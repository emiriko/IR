Hot super-Earths are exoplanets with masses < 10 Earth masses and orbital
periods < 20 days. Around 8 hot super-Earths have been discovered in the
neighborhood of solar system. In this lecture, we review the mechanisms for the
formation of hot super-Earths, dynamical effects that play important roles in
sculpting the architecture of the multiple planetary systems. Two example
systems (HD 40307 and GJ 436) are presented to show the formation and evolution
of hot super-Earths or Neptunes.
