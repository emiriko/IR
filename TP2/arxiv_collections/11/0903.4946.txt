In order to better understand their potential formation in combustion
systems, a detailed kinetic mechanism for the formation of short-chain
monocarboxylic acids, formic (HCOOH), acetic (CH3COOH), propionic (C2H5COOH)
and propenic (C2H3COOH)) acids, has been developed. Simulations of lean
(equivalence ratios from 0.9 to 0.48) laminar premixed flames of propane
stabilized at atmospheric pressure with nitrogen as diluent have been
performed. It was found that amounts up to 25 ppm of acetic acid, 15 ppm of
formic acid and 1 ppm of C3 acid can be formed for some positions in the
flames. Simulations showed that the more abundant C3 acid formed is propenic
acid. A quite acceptable agreement has been obtained with the scarce results
from the literature concerning oxygenated compounds, including aldehydes (CH2O,
CH3CHO) and acids. A reaction pathways analysis demonstrated that each acid is
mainly derived from the aldehyde of similar structure.
