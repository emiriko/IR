The experimental critical temperatures and gap values of the superconducting
pnictides of both the 1111 and 122 families can be simultaneously reproduced
within the Eliashberg theory by using a three-band model where the dominant
role is played by interband interactions and the order parameter undergoes a
sigh reversal between hole and electron bands (s+- wave symmetry). High values
of the electron-boson coupling constants and small typical boson energies (in
agreement with experiments) are necessary to obtain the values of all the gaps
and to correctly reproduce their temperature dependence.
