The underdoped cuprates have a number of interesting and unusual properties
that often seem hard to reconcile with one another. In this paper we show how
many of these diverse phenomena can be synthesized into a single coherent
theoretical picture. Specifically we present a description where a pseudogap
and gapless Fermi arcs exist in the normal state above the superconducting
transition temperature ($T_c$), but give way to the observed quantum
oscillations and other phenomena at low temperature when the superconductivity
is suppressed by a magnetic field. We show the consistency between these
phenomena and observations of enhanced Nernst and diamagnetic signals above
$T_c$. We also develop a description of the vortex core inside the
superconducting state and discuss its relation with the high field phenomena.
