We introduce in this paper embedded Gaussian unitary ensemble of random
matrices, for $m$ fermions in $\Omega$ number of single particle orbits,
generated by random two-body interactions that are SU(4) scalar, called
EGUE(2)-SU(4). Here the SU(4) algebra corresponds to Wigner's supermultiplet
SU(4) symmetry in nuclei. Formulation based on Wigner-Racah algebra of the
embedding algebra $U(4\Omega) \supset U(\Omega) \otimes SU(4)$ allows for
analytical treatment of this ensemble and using this analytical formulas are
derived for the covariances in energy centroids and spectral variances. It is
found that these covariances increase in magnitude as we go from EGUE(2) to
EGUE(2)-$\cs$ to EGUE(2)-SU(4) implying that symmetries may be responsible for
chaos in finite interacting quantum systems.
