The goal of the presented application is to offer a full support for
universities in retrieving the feedback from their students with regard to
their teachers. This is the main reason we described it in this paper. To build
this application the following tools have been used: Microsoft Notepad 5.1 (to
make the source files), Adobe Photoshop CS3 (to make the background image) and
Adobe Flash Media Encoder 8 (to render the video clips).
