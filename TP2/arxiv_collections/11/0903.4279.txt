For critical bond-percolation on high-dimensional torus, this paper proves
sharp lower bounds on the size of the largest cluster, removing a logarithmic
correction in the lower bound in Heydenreich and van der Hofstad (2007). This
improvement finally settles a conjecture by Aizenman (1997) about the role of
boundary conditions in critical high-dimensional percolation, and it is a key
step in deriving further properties of critical percolation on the torus.
Indeed, a criterion of Nachmias and Peres (2008) implies appropriate bounds on
diameter and mixing time of the largest clusters. We further prove that the
volume bounds apply also to any finite number of the largest clusters. The main
conclusion of the paper is that the behavior of critical percolation on the
high-dimensional torus is the same as for critical Erdos-Renyi random graphs.
  In this updated version we incorporate an erratum to be published in a
forthcoming issue of Probab. Theory Relat. Fields. This results in a
modification of Theorem 1.2 as well as Proposition 3.1.
