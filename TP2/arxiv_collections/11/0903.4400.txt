We study the relationship between chaotic behavior and the Central Limit
Theorem (CLT) in the Kuramoto model. We calculate sums of angles at equidistant
times along deterministic trajectories of single oscillators and we show that,
when chaos is sufficiently strong, the Pdfs of the sums tend to a Gaussian,
consistently with the standard CLT. On the other hand, when the system is at
the "edge of chaos" (i.e. in a regime with vanishing Lyapunov exponents),
robust $q$-Gaussian-like attractors naturally emerge, consistently with
recently proved generalizations of the CLT.
