The photon mean free path in a relativistically moving medium becomes long in
the down-stream direction while short in the up-stream direction. As a result,
the observed optical depth $\tau$ becomes small in the downstream direction
while large in the upstream direction. Hence, if a relativistic spherical wind
blows off, the optical depth depends strongly on its speed and the angle
between the velocity and the line-of-sight. Abramowicz et al. (1991) examined
such a relativistic wind, and found that the shape of the photosphere at
$\tau=1$ appears convex in the non-relativistic case, but concave for
relativistic velocities. We further calculated the temperature distribution and
luminosity of the photosphere both in the comoving and inertial frames. We
found that the limb-darkening effect would strongly modified in the
relativistic regime. We also found that luminosities of the photosphere becomes
large as the wind speed increases due to the relativistic effects. In addition,
the luminosity in the inertial frame is higher than that in the comoving frame.
These results suggest that the observed temperature and brightness in luminous
objects may be overestimated when there are strong relativistic winds.
