An important issue in the study of the iron-arsenic based superconductors is
the symmetry of the superconducting gap, a problem complicated by multiple gaps
on different Fermi surface sheets. Electronic Raman scattering is a flexible
bulk probe which allows one in principle to determine gap magnitudes and test
for gap nodes in different regions of the Brillouin zone by employing different
photon polarization states. Here we calculate the clean Raman intensity for
$A_{1g}$, $B_{1g}$ and $B_{2g}$ polarizations, and discuss the peak structures
and low-energy power laws which might be expected for several popular models of
the superconducting gap in these systems.
