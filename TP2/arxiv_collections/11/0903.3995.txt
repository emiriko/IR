This paper presents a super-resolution method based on gradient-based
adaptive interpolation. In this method, in addition to considering the distance
between the interpolated pixel and the neighboring valid pixel, the
interpolation coefficients take the local gradient of the original image into
account. The smaller the local gradient of a pixel is, the more influence it
should have on the interpolated pixel. And the interpolated high resolution
image is finally deblurred by the application of wiener filter. Experimental
results show that our proposed method not only substantially improves the
subjective and objective quality of restored images, especially enhances edges,
but also is robust to the registration error and has low computational
complexity.
