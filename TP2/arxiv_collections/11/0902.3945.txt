We report the results of a survey of 442 planetary nebulae at 30 GHz. The
purpose of the survey is to develop a list of planetary nebulae as calibration
sources which could be used for high frequency calibration in future. For 41
PNe with sufficient data, we test the emission mechanisms in order to evaluate
whether or not spinning dust plays an important role in their spectra at 30
GHz.
  The 30-GHz data were obtained with a twin-beam differencing radiometer,
OCRA-p, which is in operation on the Torun 32-m telescope. Sources were scanned
both in right ascension and declination. We estimated flux densities at 30 GHz
using a free-free emission model and compared it with our data.
  The primary result is a catalogue containing the flux densities of 93
planetary nebulae at 30 GHz. Sources with sufficient data were compared with a
spectral model of free-free emission. The model shows that free-free emission
can generally explain the observed flux densities at 30 GHz thus no other
emission mechanism is needed to account for the high frequency spectra.
