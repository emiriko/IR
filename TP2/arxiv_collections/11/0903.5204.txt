We consider a left-right symmetric SU(4)_c \times SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R
(4-2-2) model with gravity mediated supersymmetry breaking. We find that with
4-2-2 compatible non-universal gaugino masses, t-b-\tau Yukawa coupling
unification is consistent with neutralino dark matter abundance and with
constraints from collider experiments (except (g-2)_{\mu}). The gluino mass
lies close to that of the lightest neutralino, so that the gluino
co-annihilation channel plays an important role in determining the neutralino
relic abundance. By relaxing the Yukawa unification constraint we find stau and
stop masses as low as 200-220 GeV. We highlight some benchmark points for these
cases with 40 < \tan\beta < 58.
