Chiral perturbation theory in the two-flavour sector allows one to analyse
Green functions in QCD in a limit where the strange quark mass is considered to
be large in comparison to the external momenta and to the light quark masses.
In this framework, the pertinent low-energy constants depend on the value of
the heavy quark masses. In a recent article, we have worked out, for the
coupling constants which occur at order p^4, the dependence on the strange
quark mass at two-loop accuracy. Here, we provide analogous relations for some
of the couplings which are relevant at order p^6. To keep the calculations
somewhat reasonable in size, we consider only those 28 couplings which enter
the Green functions built from vector- and axial-vector quark currents in the
chiral limit. This provides the matching for 27 linear combinations of the 28
couplings.
