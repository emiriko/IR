In the present paper we extend results of M.G. Krein associated to the
spectral problem for Krein systems to systems with matrix valued accelerants
with a possible jump discontinuity at the origin. Explicit formulas for the
accelerant are given in terms of the matrizant of the system in question.
Recent developments in the theory of continuous analogs of the resultant
operator play an essential role.
