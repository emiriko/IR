The manipulation of geometrically constrained magnetic domain walls (DWs) in
nanoscale magnetic strips has attracted much interest recently, with proposals
for prospective memory and logic devices. Here we propose to use the high
controllability of the motion of geometrically constrained DWs for the
manipulation of individual nanoparticles on a chip with an active control of
position at the nanometer scale. The proposed method exploits the fact that
magnetic nanoparticles in solution can be captured by a DW, whose position can
be manipulated with nanometric accuracy in a specifically designed magnetic
nanowire structure. We show that the high control over DW nucleation,
displacement, and annihilation processes in such structures can be used to
capture, transport and release magnetic nanoparticles. As magnetic particles
with functionalized surfaces are commonly used as molecule labels in several
applications - including single molecule manipulation, separation, cells
manipulation and biomagnetic sensing, the accurate control over the handling of
the single magnetic nanoparticles becomes crucial as it may reflect the
handling of the single molecules. The approach described here opens the path to
the implementation and design of nano-transport lines, with application to
single molecule study and lab-on-chip devices. In perspective, the easy
integration on chip with sensors of domain walls and particles will allow for
the realization of programmable circuits for molecular manipulation with
continuous control of the desired process.
