A framework is developed using techniques from rate distortion theory in
statistical testing. The idea is first to do optimal compression according to a
certain distortion function and then use information divergence from the
compressed empirical distribution to the compressed null hypothesis as
statistic. Only very special cases have been studied in more detail, but they
indicate that the approach can be used under very general conditions.
