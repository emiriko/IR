I show that in low dimensions the interactions in dilute Bose mixtures are
strongly renormalized, which leads to a considerable change of stability
conditions compared to the mean-field results valid in the high-density regime.
Estimates are given for the two-component Bose-Hubbard model and for the
Rb(87)-K(41) mixture.
