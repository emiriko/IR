We give a fully covariant energy momentum stress tensor for the gravitational
field which is easily physically motivated, and which leads to a very general
derivation of the Einstein equation for gravity. We do not need to assume any
property of the surce matter fields' energy momentum stress tensor other than
symmetry. We give a physical motivation for this choice using laser light
pressure. As a consequence of our derivation, the energy momentum stress tensor
for the total source matter and fields must be divergence free, when spacetime
is 4 dimensional. Moreoverr, if the total source matter fields are assumed to
be divergence free, then either spacetime is dimension 4 or the spacetime has
constant scalar curvature.
