We present the first observations of zero-n bandgaps in photonic crystal
superlattices consisting of alternating stacks of negative index photonic
crystals and positive index dielectric materials in the near-infrared. Guided
by ab initio three-dimensional numerical simulations, the fabricated
nanostructured superlattices demonstrate the presence of zero-order gaps in
remarkable agreement with theoretical predictions across a range of different
superlattice periods and unit cell variations. These volume-averaged zero-index
superlattice structures present a new type of photonic band gap, with potential
for complete wavefront control for arbitrary phase delay lines and open cavity
resonances.
