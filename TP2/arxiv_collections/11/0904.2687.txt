We discuss the potential of the photon-induced two lepton final states at the
LHC to explore the phenomenology of the Kaluza-Klein (KK) tower of gravitons in
the scenarios of the Arkani-Hamed, Dimopoulos and Dvali(ADD) model and
Randall-Sundrum (RS) model. The sensitivity to model parameters can be improved
compared to the present LEP or Tevatron sensitivity.
