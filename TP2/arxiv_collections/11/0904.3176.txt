The proof of principle of the Laser Ion Source Trap (LIST) coupled to a gas
cell catcher system has been demonstrated at the Leuven Isotope Separator
On-Line (LISOL). The experiments were carried out by using the modified gas
cell-based laser ion source and the SextuPole Ion Guide (SPIG). Element
selective resonance laser ionization of neutral atoms was taking place inside
the cold jet expanding out of the gas cell catcher. The laser path was oriented
in longitudinal as well as transverse geometries with respect to the atoms
flow. The enhancement of beam purity and the feasibility for in-source laser
spectroscopy were investigated in off-line and on-line conditions.
