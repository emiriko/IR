In this paper we will show that, the non-gaussian statistics framework based
on the Kaniadakis statistics is more appropriate to fit the observed
distributions of projected rotational velocity measurements of stars in the
Pleiades open cluster. To this end, we compare the results from the $\kappa$
and $q$-distributions with the Maxwellian.
