It is known that exp[i\lamda(Q_1P_1-i/2)] is a unitary single-mode squeezing
operator, where Q_1,P_1 are the coordinate and momentum operators,
respectively. In this paper we employ Dirac's coordinate representation to
prove that the exponential operator S_{n}=Exp[i\lamda
sum_{i=1}^{n}](Q_{i}P_{i+1}+Q_{i+1}P_{i}))], (Q_{n+1}=Q_1P_{n+1}=P_1), is a
n-mode squeezing operator which enhances the standard squeezing. By virtue of
the technique of integration within an ordered product of operators we derive
S_{n}'s normally ordered expansion and obtain new n-mode squeezed vacuum
states, its Wigner function is calculated by using the Weyl ordering invariance
under similar transformations.
