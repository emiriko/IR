We establish that the elliptic equation $\Delta u+f(x,u)+g(| x|)x\cdot \nabla
u=0$, where $x\in\mathbb{R}^{n}$, $n\geq3$, and $| x|>R>0$, has a positive
solution which decays to 0 as $| x|\to +\infty$ under mild restrictions on the
functions $f,g$. The main theorem extends and complements the conclusions of
the recent paper [M. Ehrnstr\"{o}m, O.G. Mustafa, On positive solutions of a
class of nonlinear elliptic equations, Nonlinear Anal. TMA 67 (2007),
1147--1154]. Its proof relies on a general result about the long-time behavior
of the logarithmic derivatives of solutions for a class of nonlinear ordinary
differential equations and on the comparison method.
