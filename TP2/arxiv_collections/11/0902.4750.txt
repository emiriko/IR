We provide conservative bounds on the dark matter cross-section and lifetime
from final state radiation produced by annihilation or decay into charged
leptons, either directly or via an intermediate particle $\phi$. Our analysis
utilizes the experimental gamma-ray flux upper limits from four Milky Way dwarf
satellites: HESS observations of Sagittarius and VERITAS observations of Draco,
Ursa Minor, and Willman 1. Using 90% confidence level lower limits on the
integrals over the dark matter distributions, we find that these constraints
are largely unable to rule out dark matter annihilations or decays as an
explanation of the PAMELA and ATIC/PPB-BETS excesses. However, if there is an
additional Sommerfeld enhancement in dwarfs, which have a velocity dispersion
~10 to 20 times lower than that of the local Galactic halo, then the
cross-sections for dark matter annihilating through $\phi$'s required to
explain the excesses are very close to the cross-section upper bounds from
Willman 1. Dark matter annihilation directly into $\tau$'s is also marginally
ruled out by Willman 1 as an explanation of the excesses, and the required
cross-section is only a factor of a few below the upper bound from Draco.
Finally, we make predictions for the gamma-ray flux expected from the dwarf
galaxy Segue 1 for the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. We find that for a
sizeable fraction of the parameter space in which dark matter annihilation into
charged leptons explains the PAMELA excess, Fermi has good prospects for
detecting a gamma-ray signal from Segue 1 after one year of observation.
