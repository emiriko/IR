A partial fraction decomposition of the Fermi function resulting in a finite
sum over simple poles is proposed. This allows for efficient calculations
involving the Fermi function in various contexts of electronic structure or
electron transport theories. The proposed decomposition converges in a
well-defined region faster than exponential and is thus superior to the
standard Matsubara expansion.
