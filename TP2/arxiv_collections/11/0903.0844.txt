We present new radio and X-ray observations of Abell 262. The X-ray residual
image provides the first evidence of an X-ray tunnel in this system while the
radio data reveal that the central radio source is more than three times larger
than previously known. We find that the well-known cluster-center S-shaped
radio source B2 0149+35 is surrounded by extended emission to the east and
south-west. The south-western extension is co-spatial with the X-ray tunnel
seen in our new Chandra images while the eastern extension shows three clumps
of emission with the innermost coincident with a faint X-ray cavity. The outer
two eastern radio extensions are coincident with a newly detected X-ray
depression. We use the projected separation of the emission regions to estimate
a lower limit of tau_rep=28 Myr to the outburst repetition timescale of the
central AGN. The total energy input into the cluster over multiple outburst
episodes is estimated to be 2.2x 10^{58} ergs, more than an order of magnitude
larger than previously thought. The total AGN energy output determined from our
new observations shows that the source should be capable of offsetting
radiative cooling over several outburst episodes.
