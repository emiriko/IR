We analyzed contribution of quark degrees of freedom in the deuteron to the
longitudinal, P_z', and transverse, P_x', polarizations of the proton in the
d(\vec e,e'\vec p)n break-up. It is demonstrated that such effects work in
correct direction to explain experimental data. We predict that the
polarizations should change qualitatively behavior at p_m >200 MeV/c, (i) the
polarizations become strongly dependent on the out-of-plain angle and (ii)
there appears a structure in the both polarizations at p_m ~200 MeV/c.
