This paper proposes new explicit formulas for the doubling and addition step
in Miller's algorithm to compute the Tate pairing. For Edwards curves the
formulas come from a new way of seeing the arithmetic. We state the first
geometric interpretation of the group law on Edwards curves by presenting the
functions which arise in the addition and doubling. Computing the coefficients
of the functions and the sum or double of the points is faster than with all
previously proposed formulas for pairings on Edwards curves. They are even
competitive with all published formulas for pairing computation on Weierstrass
curves. We also speed up pairing computation on Weierstrass curves in Jacobian
coordinates. Finally, we present several examples of pairing-friendly Edwards
curves.
