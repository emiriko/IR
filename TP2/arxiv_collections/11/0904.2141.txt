Generic smooth plane-to-plane map germs are topologically equivalent to cones
of mappings of the circle. We carry out a complete topological classification
of smooth stable mappings of the circle and show how this classification leads,
via the result mentioned above, to a topological classification of finitely
determined real analytic plane-to-plane map germs.
