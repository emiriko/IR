After the establishment of the Kobayashi-Maskawa mechanism of CP violation at
the two B factories, possibilities to increase the integrated luminosity by two
orders of magnitude have been investigated, since it seems to be the amount
needed to find physics beyond the Standard Model through CP violating and other
observables in rare B meson decays, D meson decays and tau lepton decays. This
report reviews the physics sensitivities and status of such super B factories,
which are planned at two locations.
