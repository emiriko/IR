In this paper we study a class of dynamical systems generated by iterations
of multivariate polynomials and estimate the degreegrowth of these iterations.
We use these estimates to bound exponential sums along the orbits of these
dynamical systems and show that they admit much stronger estimates than in the
general case and thus can be of use for pseudorandom number generation.
