Sequential effect algebra is an important model for studying quantum
measurement theory. In 2005, Professor Gudder presented 25 open problems to
motivate its study. The 20th problem asked: In a sequential effect algebra, if
the square root of some element exists, is it unique ? We can strengthen the
problem as following: For each given positive integer $n>1$, is there a
sequential effect algebra such that the n-th root of its some element $c$ is
not unique and the n-th root of $c$ is not the k-th root of $c$ ($k<n$) ?
Recently, we answered the strengthened problem affirmatively.
