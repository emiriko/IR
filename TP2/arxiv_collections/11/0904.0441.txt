In this paper we will give a unified proof of several results on the
sovability of systems of certain equations over finite fields, which were
recently obtained by Fourier analytic methods.
  Roughly speaking, we show that almost all systems of norm, bilinear or
quadratic equations over finite fields are solvable in any large subset of
vector spaces over finite fields.
