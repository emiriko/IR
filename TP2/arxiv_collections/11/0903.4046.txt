Error detectable and error correctable coding in Hamming space was researched
to discover possible fault tolerant coding constellations, which can implement
Boolean logic with fault tolerant property. Basic logic operators of the
Boolean algebra were developed to apply fault tolerant coding in the logic
circuits. It was shown that application of three-bit fault tolerant codes have
provided the digital system skill of auto-recovery without need for designing
additional-fault tolerance mechanisms.
