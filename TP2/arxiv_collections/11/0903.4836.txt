We consider compact minimal surfaces $f\colon M\to S^3$ of genus 2 which are
homotopic to an embedding. We assume that the associated holomorphic bundle is
stable. We prove that these surfaces can be constructed from a globally defined
family of meromorphic connections by the DPW method. The poles of the
meromorphic connections are at the Weierstrass points of the Riemann surface of
order at most 2. For the existence proof of the DPW potential we give a
characterization of stable extensions $0\to S^{-1}\to V\to S\to 0$ of spin
bundles $S$ by its dual $S^{-1}$ in terms of an associated element of $P
H^0(M;K^2).$ We also consider the family of holomorphic structures associated
to a minimal surface in $S^3.$ For surfaces of genus $g\geq2$ the holonomy of
the connections is generically non-abelian and therefore the holomorphic
structures are generically stable.
