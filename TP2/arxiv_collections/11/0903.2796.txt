We discuss the possibility of preparing highly entangled states by simply
cooling atoms into the ground state of an applied interaction Hamiltonian. As
in laser sideband cooling, we take advantage of a relatively large detuning of
the desired state, while all other qubit states experience resonant laser
driving. Once spontaneous emission from excited atomic states prepares the
system in its ground state, it remains there with a very high fidelity for a
wide range of experimental parameters and all possible initial states. After
presenting the general theory, we discuss concrete applications with one and
two qubits.
