The fundamental principle of quantum mechanics is that the probabilities of
physical outcomes are obtained from the intermediate states and processes of
the interacting particles, considered as happening concurrently. When the
interaction is described by a potential, the total energy of the particle is
equal to its total kinetic plus potential energies. We derive the Schrodinger
and Dirac equations as the conditions the wavefunction must satisfy at each
point in order to fulfill the corresponding energy equation. In our approach
quantum theory is tangible, experimentally justified and theoretically
consistent. PACS numbers: 03.65.-w Keywords: Quantum principles; Quantum
