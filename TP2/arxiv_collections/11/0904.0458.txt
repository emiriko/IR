We give a partonic interpretation for the deeply virtual Compton scattering
(DVCS) measurements of the H1 and ZEUS collaborations in the small-x_B region
in terms of generalized parton distributions. Thereby we have a closer look at
the skewness effect, parameterization of the t-dependence, revealing the
chromomagnetic pomeron, and at a model dependent access to the anomalous
gravitomagnetic moment of nucleon. We also quantify the reparameterization of
generalized parton distributions resulting from the inclusion of radiative
corrections up to next-to-next-to-leading order. Beyond the leading order
approximation, our findings are compatible with a `holographic' principle that
would arise from a (broken) SO(2,1) symmetry. Utilizing our leading-order
findings, we also perform a first model dependent dispersion relation fit of
HERMES and JLAB DVCS measurements. From that we extract the generalized parton
distribution H on its cross-over line and predict the beam charge-spin
asymmetry, measurable at COMPASS.
