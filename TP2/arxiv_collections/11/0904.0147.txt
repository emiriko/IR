We study the spatial distribution and colours of galaxies within the region
covered by the cold spot in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) recently
detected by the Very Small Array (VSA; Genova-Santos et al. 2005, 2008) towards
the Corona Borealis supercluster (CrB-SC). The spot is in the northern part of
a region with a radius ~1 degree (~5 Mpc at the redshift of CrB-SC) enclosing
the clusters Abell 2056, 2065, 2059 and 2073, and where the density of
galaxies, excluding the contribution from those clusters, is ~2 times higher
than the mean value in typical intercluster regions of the CrB-SC. Two of such
clusters (Abell 2056 and 2065) are members of the CrB-SC, while the other two
are in the background. This high density intercluster region is quite
inhomogeneous, being the most remarkable feature a large concentration of
galaxies in a narrow filament running from Abell 2065 with a length of ~35
arcmin (~3 Mpc at the redshift of CrB-SC) in the SW-NE direction. This
intercluster population of galaxies probably results from the interaction of
clusters Abell 2065 and 2056. The area subtended by the VSA cold spot shows an
excess of faint (21<r<22) and red (1.1<r-i<1.3) galaxies as compared with
typical values within the CrB-SC intercluster regions. This overdensity of
galaxies shows a radial dependence and extends out to ~15 arcmin. This could be
signature of a previously unnoticed cluster in the background.
