We study the conductance of mesoscopic graphene rings in the presence of a
perpendicular magnetic field by means of numerical calculations based on a
tight-binding model. First, we consider the magnetoconductance of such rings
and observe the Aharonov-Bohm effect. We investigate different regimes of the
magnetic flux up to the quantum Hall regime, where the Aharonov-Bohm
oscillations are suppressed. Results for both clean (ballistic) and disordered
(diffusive) rings are presented. Second, we study rings with smooth mass
boundary that are weakly coupled to leads. We show that the valley degeneracy
of the eigenstates in closed graphene rings can be lifted by a small magnetic
flux, and that this lifting can be observed in the transport properties of the
system.
