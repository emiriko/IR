We performed scanning tunneling spectroscopy of c-axis oriented YBCO films on
top of which ferromagnetic SRO islands were grown epitaxially in-situ. When
measured on the ferromagnetic islands, the density of states exhibits small
gap-like features consistent with the expected short range penetration of the
order parameter into the ferromagnet. However, anomalous split-gap structures
are measured on the superconductor in the vicinity of ferromagnetic islands.
This observation may provide evidence for the recently predicted induced
magnetization in the superconductor side of a superconductor/ ferromagnet
junction. The length scale of the effect inside the superconductor was found to
be an order of magnitude larger than the superconducting coherence length. This
is inconsistent with the theoretical prediction of a penetration depth of only
a few superconducting coherence lengths. We discuss a possible origin for this
discrepancy.
