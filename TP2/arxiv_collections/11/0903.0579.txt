The algebraic structure of the integrable mixed mKdV/sinh-Gordon model is
discussed and \textit{}extended to the AKNS/Lund-Regge model and to its
corresponding supersymmetric versions. The integrability of the models is
guaranteed from the zero curvature representation and some soliton solutions
are discussed.
