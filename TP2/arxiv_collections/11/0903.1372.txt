In order to discover generic effects of heterogeneous communication delays on
the dynamics of large systems of coupled oscillators, this paper studies a
modification of the Kuramoto model incorporating a distribution of interaction
delays. By focusing attention on the reduced dynamics on an invariant manifold
of the original system, we derive governing equations for the system which we
use to study stability of the incoherent states and the dynamical transitional
behavior from stable incoherent states to stable coherent states. We find that
spread in the distribution function of delays can greatly alter the system
dynamics.
