In our another recent article, we introduce a new dynamical property for
linear operators called norm-unimodality which implies distributional chaos. In
the present paper, we'll give a further discussion of norm-unimodality. It is
showed that norm-unimodality is similar invariant and the spectra of
norm-unimodal operator is referred to. As an application, in each nest algebra
there exist distributional chaotic operators. Moreover, normal operators and
compact operators with regard to norm-unimodality and Li-Yorke chaos are also
be considered. Specially, a small compact perturbation of the unit operator
could be distributionally chaotic.
