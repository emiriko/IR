We present a novel approach for computing the surface roughness-limited
thermal conductivity of silicon nanowires with diameter D < 100 nm. A
frequency-dependent phonon scattering rate is computed from perturbation theory
and related to a description of the surface through the root-mean-square
roughness height Delta and autocovariance length L. Using a full-phonon
dispersion relation, we find a quadratic dependence of thermal conductivity on
diameter and roughness as (D/\Delta)^2. Computed results show excellent
agreement with experimental data for a wide diameter and temperature range
(25-350 K), and successfully predict the extraordinarily low thermal
conductivity of 2 W.m^{-1}.K^{-1} at room temperature in rough-etched 50 nm
silicon nanowires.
