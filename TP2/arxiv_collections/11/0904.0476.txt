Having driven a large part of the decade's progress in physics,
nanoelectronics is now passing from today's realm of the extraordinary to
tomorrow's commonplace. This carries the problem of turning proofs of concept
into practical artefacts. Better and more sharply focussed predictive modelling
will be the ultimate guide to optimising mesoscopic technology as it matures.
Securing this level of understanding needs a reassessment of the assumptions at
the base of the present state of the field. We offer a brief overview of the
underlying assumptions of mesoscopic transport.
