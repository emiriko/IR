The unimodular metagravity, with the graviscalar as a dark matter, is
compared with General Relativity (GR) in the presence of a scalar field. The
effect of the graviscalar on the static spherically symmetric metric is
studied. An exact limit solution representing a new cosmic object, the
(harmonic) graviscalar black hole, is given. The relation with the black hole
in the environment of a scalar field in GR is discussed.
