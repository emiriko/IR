The Householder reduction of a member of the anti-symmetric Gaussian unitary
ensemble gives an anti-symmetric tridiagonal matrix with all independent
elements. The random variables permit the introduction of a positive parameter
$\beta$, and the eigenvalue probability density function of the corresponding
random matrices can be computed explicitly, as can the distribution of
$\{q_i\}$, the first components of the eigenvectors. Three proofs are given.
One involves an inductive construction based on bordering of a family of random
matrices which are shown to have the same distributions as the anti-symmetric
tridiagonal matrices. This proof uses the Dixon-Anderson integral from Selberg
integral theory. A second proof involves the explicit computation of the
Jacobian for the change of variables between real anti-symmetric tridiagonal
matrices, its eigenvalues and $\{q_i\}$. The third proof maps matrices from the
anti-symmetric Gaussian $\beta$-ensemble to those realizing particular examples
of the Laguerre $\beta$-ensemble. In addition to these proofs, we note some
simple properties of the shooting eigenvector and associated Pr\"ufer phases of
the random matrices.
