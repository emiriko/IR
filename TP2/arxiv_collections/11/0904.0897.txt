By using the quantum hydrodynamic and Maxwell equations, we derive nonlinear
electron-magnetohydrodynamic (MHD), Hall-MHD, and dust Hall-MHD equations for
dense quantum magnetoplasmas. The nonlinear equations include the
electromagnetic, the electron pressure gradient, as well as the quantum
electron tunneling and electron spin forces. They are useful for investigating
a number of wave phenomena including linear and nonlinear electromagnetic
waves, as well as three-dimensional electromagnetic wave turbulence spectra
arising from the mode coupling processes in dense magnetoplasmas.
