We investigate the discretization errors affecting correlators of the
energy-momentum tensor $T_{\mu\nu}$ at finite temperature in SU($N_c$) gauge
theory with the Wilson action and two different discretizations of
$T_{\mu\nu}$. We do so by using lattice perturbation theory and
non-perturbative Monte-Carlo simulations. These correlators, which are
functions of Euclidean time $x_0$ and spatial momentum ${\bf p}$, are the
starting point for a lattice study of the transport properties of the gluon
plasma. We find that the correlator of the energy $\int d^3x T_{00}$ has much
larger discretization errors than the correlator of momentum $\int d^3x
T_{0k}$. Secondly, the shear and diagonal stress correlators ($T_{12}$ and
$T_{kk}$) require $\Nt\geq 8$ for the $Tx_0={1/2}$ point to be in the scaling
region and the cutoff effect to be less than 10%. We then show that their
discretization errors on an anisotropic lattice with $\as/\at=2$ are comparable
to those on the isotropic lattice with the same temporal lattice spacing.
Finally, we also study finite ${\bf p}$ correlators.
