The suppression of single inclusive hadron spectra in heavy-ion collision as
compared to the scaled expectation from proton-proton collisions has long been
regarded as an interesting tool to study properties of the bulk matter in
heavy-ion collisions. However, the limitations of this class of observables has
become increasingly obvious, and both experimental and theoretical efforts are
now made to go beyond single hadrons to fully reconstructed jets. Monte-Carlo
simulations of in-medium parton showers are currently considered the most
promising tool to theoretically access jet physics in heavy-ion collisions. In
this paper, I review some of the first results obtained with the MC code YaJEM
(Yet another Jet Energy-loss Model) for both single hadron and jet observables.
