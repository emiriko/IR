First-principles calculations of the electronic structure of members of the
$R$NiC$_2$ series are presented, and their Fermi surfaces investigated for
nesting propensities which might be linked to the charge-density waves
exhibited by certain members of the series ($R$ = Sm, Gd and Nd). Calculations
of the generalized susceptibility, $\chi_{0}({\bf q},\omega)$, show strong
peaks at the same ${\bf q}$-vector in both the real and imaginary parts for
these compounds. Moreover, this peak occurs at a wavevector which is very close
to that experimentally observed in SmNiC$_2$. In contrast, for LaNiC$_2$ (which
is a superconductor below 2.7K) as well as for ferromagnetic SmNiC$_2$, there
is no such sharp peak. This could explain the absence of a charge-density wave
transition in the former, and the destruction of the charge-density wave that
has been observed to accompany the onset of ferromagnetic order in the latter.
