The miniaturization of thermoelectric nanojunctions raises a fundamental
question: do the thermoelectric quantities of the bridging materials in
nanojunctions remain to display material properties or show junction
properties? In order to answer this question, we investigate the Seebeck
coefficient $S$ and the thermoelectric figure of merit $ZT$ especially in
relation to the length characteristics of the junctions from the
first-principles approaches. For $S$, the metallic atomic chains reveal strong
length characteristics related to strong hybridization in the electronic
structures between the atoms and electrodes, while the insulating molecular
wires display strong material properties due to the cancelation of exponential
scalings in the DOSs. For $ZT$, the atomic wires remain to show strong junction
properties. However, the length chrematistics of the insulation molecular wires
depend on a characteristic temperature $T_{0}= \sqrt{\beta/\gamma(l)}$ around
10K. When $T \ll T_{0}$, where the electron transport dominates the thermal
current, the molecular junctions remain to show material properties. When $T
\gg T_{0}$, where the phonon transport dominates the thermal current, the
molecular junctions display junction properties.
