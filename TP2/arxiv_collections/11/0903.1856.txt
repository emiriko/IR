Previous papers have developed a statistical mechanics of neocortical
interactions (SMNI) fit to short-term memory and EEG data. Adaptive Simulated
Annealing (ASA) has been developed to perform fits to such nonlinear stochastic
systems. An N-dimensional path-integral algorithm for quantum systems,
qPATHINT, has been developed from classical PATHINT. Both fold short-time
propagators (distributions or wave functions) over long times. Previous papers
applied qPATHINT to two systems, in neocortical interactions and financial
options. \textbf{Objective}: In this paper the quantum path-integral for
Calcium ions is used to derive a closed-form analytic solution at arbitrary
time that is used to calculate interactions with classical-physics SMNI
interactions among scales. Using fits of this SMNI model to EEG data, including
these effects, will help determine if this is a reasonable approach.
\textbf{Method}: Methods of mathematical-physics for optimization and for path
integrals in classical and quantum spaces are used for this project. Studies
using supercomputer resources tested various dimensions for their scaling
limits. In this paper the quantum path-integral is used to derive a closed-form
analytic solution at arbitrary time that is used to calculate interactions with
classical-physics SMNI interactions among scales. \textbf{Results}: The
mathematical-physics and computer parts of the study are successful, in that
there is modest improvement of cost/objective functions used to fit EEG data
using these models. \textbf{Conclusion}: This project points to directions for
more detailed calculations using more EEG data and qPATHINT at each time slice
to propagate quantum calcium waves, synchronized with PATHINT propagation of
classical SMNI.
