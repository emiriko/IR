The next decade of survey astronomy has the potential to transform our
knowledge of variable stars. Stellar variability underpins our knowledge of the
cosmological distance ladder, and provides direct tests of stellar formation
and evolution theory. Variable stars can also be used to probe the fundamental
physics of gravity and degenerate material in ways that are otherwise
impossible in the laboratory. The computational and engineering advances of the
past decade have made large-scale, time-domain surveys an immediate reality.
Some surveys proposed for the next decade promise to gather more data than in
the prior cumulative history of astronomy. The actual implementation of these
surveys will have broad implications for the types of science that will be
enabled. We examine the design considerations for an optimal time-domain
photometric survey dedicated to variable star science, including: observing
cadence, wavelength coverage, photometric and astrometric accuracy,
single-epoch and cumulative depth, overall sky coverage, and data access by the
broader astronomical community. The best surveys must combine aspects from each
of these considerations to fully realize the potential for the next decade of
time-domain science.
