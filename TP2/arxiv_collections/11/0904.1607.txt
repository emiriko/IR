Electronic structure calculations are presented for KCo$_2$As$_2$ and alloys
with KFe$_2$As$_2$ and KRu$_2$As$_2$. These materials show electronic
structures characteristic of coherent alloys, with a similar Fermi surface
structure to that of the Fe-based superconductors, when the $d$ electron count
is near six per transition metal. However, they are less magnetic than the
corresponding Fe compounds. These results are discussed in relation to
superconductivity.
