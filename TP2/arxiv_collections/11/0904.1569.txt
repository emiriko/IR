We model the behavior of N classical impurity fields immersed in a larger
Bose-Einstein condensate by N+1 coupled nonlinear Schrodinger equations in 1,
2, and 3 space dimensions. We discuss the stability of the uniform miscible
system and show the importance of surface tension for self localization of the
impurity fields. We derive analytically the attractive tail of
impurity-impurity interaction due to mediation by the underlying condensate.
Assuming all impurity fields interact with the same strength, we explore the
resulting phase diagram, which contains four phases: {\it I}) all fields are
miscible; {\it II}) the impurity fields are miscible with each other but phase
separate from the condensate as a single bubble; {\it III}) the localized
impurity fields stay miscible with the condensate, but not with each other; and
{\it IV}) the impurity fields phase separate from the condensate and each
other, forming a crystalline structure within a bubble. Thus, we show that a
crystal can be constructed solely from superfluid components. Finally, we argue
that the crystalline phases maintain their superfluid behavior, i.e. they
possess a nonclassical rotational inertia, which, combined with lattice order,
is a characteristic of supersolidity.
