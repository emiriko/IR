The issues of single particle coherence and its interplay with singlet
pairing are studied within the slave boson gauge theory of a doped Mott
insulator. Prior work by one of us (T. Senthil, arXiv:0804.1555) showed that
the coherence scale below which Landau quasiparticles emerge is parametrically
lower than that identified in the slave boson mean field theory. Here we study
the resulting new non-fermi liquid intermediate temperature regime
characterized by a single particle scattering rate that is linear in
temperature ($T$). In the presence of a d-wave pair amplitude this leads to a
pseudogap state with $T$ dependent Fermi arcs near the nodal direction.
Implications for understanding the cuprates are discussed.
