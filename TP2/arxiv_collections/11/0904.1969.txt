Smoothing is an estimation technique that takes into account both past and
future observations, and can be more accurate than filtering alone. In this
Letter, a quantum theory of smoothing is constructed using a time-symmetric
formalism, thereby generalizing prior work on classical and quantum filtering,
retrodiction, and smoothing. The proposed theory solves the important problem
of optimally estimating classical Markov processes coupled to a quantum system
under continuous measurements, and is thus expected to find major applications
in future quantum sensing systems, such as gravitational wave detectors and
atomic magnetometers.
