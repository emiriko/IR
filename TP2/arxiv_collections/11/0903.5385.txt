We propose and analyze theoretically a double magnetic plasmon resonance
nanolaser, in which Ytterbium-erbium co-doped material is used as the gain
medium. Through design of the double magnetic resonance modes, pumping light
(980nm) can be resonantly absorbed and laser light (1550nm) can be resonantly
generated simultaneously. We introduce a set of rate equations combined to
describe the operation of the laser and predict the lasing condition. According
to our calculations, the disadvantage that pumping light is difficult to be
absorbed by a thin slab of gain materials can be overcome.
