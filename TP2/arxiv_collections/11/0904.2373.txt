We have carried out torsional oscillator (TO) and heat capacity (HC)
measurements on solid 4He samples grown within a geometry which restricts the
helium to thin (150 um) cylindrical discs. In contrast to previously reported
values from Rittner and Reppy of 20% non-classical rotational inertia (NCRI)
for similar confining dimensions, 0.9% NCRI (consistent with that found in bulk
samples and samples imbedded in porous media) was observed in our TO cell. In
this confined geometry the heat capacity peak is consistent with that found in
bulk solid samples of high crystalline quality.
