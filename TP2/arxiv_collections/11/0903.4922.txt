We reply to L. Ya. Glozman's Comment "Is a consistent holographic description
of excited hadrons with fixed $L$ possible?" In general, the solutions of the
bound state Hamiltonian equation of motion in QCD have Fock state components
with different $L$, and consequently hadronic relativistic wave equations
derived in the framework of light-front holography share this property. For
example, the proton eigenstate has components with L=0 and L=1. The results of
AdS/QCD are consistent with the requirements of chiral symmetry and do not
violate any fundamental physical principle. This is further illustrated with
various examples.
