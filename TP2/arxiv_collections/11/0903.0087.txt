Using gamma-ray data collected by the Astrorivelatore Gamma ad Immagini
LEggero (AGILE) satellite over a period of almost one year (from 2007 July to
2008 June), we searched for pulsed signals from 35 potentially interesting
radio pulsars, ordered according to $F_{\gamma}\propto \sqrt{\dot{E}} d^{-2}$
and for which contemporary or recent radio data were available. AGILE detected
three new top-ranking nearby and Vela-like pulsars with good confidence both
through timing and spatial analysis. Among the newcomers we find pulsars with
very high rotational energy losses, such as the remarkable PSR B1509-58 with a
magnetic field in excess of 10^13 Gauss, and PSR J2229+6114 providing a
reliable identification for the previously unidentified EGRET source 3EG
2227+6122. Moreover, the powerful millisecond pulsar B1821-24, in the globular
cluster M28, is detected during a fraction of the observations. Four other
promising gamma-ray pulsar candidates, among which is the notable J2043+2740
with an age in excess of 1 million years, show a possible detection in the
timing analysis only and deserve confirmation.
