We propose an optical scheme to generate genuine entangled states of four
atomic qubits in optical cavities using a single-photon source, beam splitters
and single photon detectors. We show how to generate deterministically sixteen
orthonormal and independent genuine entangled states of four atomic qubits. It
is found that the sixteen genuine entangled states form a new type of
representation of the four-atomic-qubit system, i.e., the genuine
entangled-state representation. This representation brings new interesting
insight onto better understanding multipartite entanglement.
