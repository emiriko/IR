We introduce a general model for a lossy bosonic memory channel and calculate
the classical and the quantum capacity, proving that coherent state encoding is
optimal. The use of a proper set of collective field variables allows to
unravel the memory, showing that the n-fold concatenation of the memory channel
is unitarily equivalent to the direct product of n single-mode lossy bosonic
channels.
