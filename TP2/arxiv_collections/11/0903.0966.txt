The A7 star Altair is one of the hottest magnetically active stars. Its
proximity to the Sun allows a detailed investigation of a corona in X-rays for
a star with a shallow convection zone. We used a deep XMM-Newton observation of
Altair and analyzed X-ray light curves, spectra, and emission lines,
investigated the temporal behavior and properties of the X-ray emitting plasma
and studied the global coronal structure. We find that Altair's corona with an
X-ray luminosity of L_X =1.4 x 10^27 erg/s and a very low activity level of log
L_X/L_bol = -7.4, is located predominantly at low latitude regions. The X-ray
emission is dominated by cool plasma (1-4 MK) at low density, and elemental
abundances exhibit a solar-like FIP effect and Ne/O ratio. The X-ray brightness
varies by 30 % over the observation, most likely due to rotational modulation
and minor activity; in contrast, no strong flares or significant amounts of hot
plasma were detected. The X-ray activity level of Altair is apparently close to
the saturation level, which is reduced by roughly four orders of magnitude when
compared to late-type stars. With its fast rotation, Altair provides an
inefficient, but very stable dynamo that mainly operates in convective layers
below its 'cooler' surface areas around the equator. This dynamo mechanism
results in magnetic activity and leads to X-ray properties that are overall
very similar to those of the quiescent Sun, despite very different underlying
stars.
