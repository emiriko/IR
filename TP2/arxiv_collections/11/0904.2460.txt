We report on new modeling results based on the mm- to X-ray emission of the
SgrA* counterpart associated with the massive black hole at the Galactic
Center. Our modeling is based on simultaneous observations carried out on 07
July, 2004, using the ESO NACO adaptive optics instrument and the ACIS-I
instrument aboard the Chandra X-ray Observatory as well as the SMA and the VLA.
The observations revealed several flare events in all wavelength domains. Here
we show that a combined synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) model followed by an
adiabatic expansion of the source components can fully account for the observed
flare flux densities and delay times covering the spectral range from the X-ray
to the mm-radio domain. The derived physical quantities that describe the flare
emission give a blob expansion speed of v{exp}=0.005c, magnetic field of < 60G
and spectral indices of 0.8 to 1.4. The derived model parameters suggest that
the adiabatic expansion takes place in source components that have a bulk
motion larger than v{exp} or the expanding material contributes to a corona or
disk, confined to the immediate surroundings of SgrA*.
