The propagation of SH waves in a solid containing a screen of line-like
scatterers is investigated. When the scatterers are uniformly distributed, the
amplitudes of the coherent waves inside and outside the screen are evaluated in
closed form. In the analysis, multiple scattering effects are taken into
account within the context of a first-order approximation. A Global Closure
Assumption is proposed, which yields an effective wavenumber identical to that
of Waterman and Truell. The scatterers can be fibers of circular or elliptical
cross-sections; they can also be two-dimensional cracks with slit-like or
elliptical cross-sections. Specific analytical and numerical results are
presented for flat cracks and empty cavities of circular cross-sections. In
those two cases, figures are presented to illustrate the variations of the
reflection and transmission coefficients as functions of frequency and of
scatterer concentration. The crack and cavity results, respectively, are
compared with those of earlier works.
