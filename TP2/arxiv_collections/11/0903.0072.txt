An experimental study of the yellow exciton series in Cu2O in strong magnetic
fields up to 32 T shows the optical activation of direct and phonon-assisted
paraexciton luminescence due to mixing with the quadruple allowed orthoexciton
state. The observed phonon-assisted luminescence yields information on the
statistical distribution of occupied states. Additional time-resolved
experiments provide a unique opportunity to directly determine the time
evolution of the thermodynamical properties of the paraexciton gas. Because the
lifetime of paraexciton is hardly affected by the optical activation in a
strong magnetic field, this opens new possibilities for studies aiming at
Bose-Einstein condensation of excitons in bulk semiconductors.
