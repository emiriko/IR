The Planck satellite has a nominal mission lifetime of 14 months allowing two
complete surveys of the sky. Here we investigate the potential of an extended
Planck mission of four sky surveys to constrain primordial B-mode anisotropies
in the presence of dominant Galactic polarized foreground emission. An extended
Planck mission is capable of powerful constraints on primordial B-modes at low
multipoles, which cannot be probed by ground based or sub-orbital experiments.
A tensor-scalar ratio of r=0.05 can be detected at a high significance level by
an extended Planck mission and it should be possible to set a 95% upper limit
on r of 0.03 if the tensor-scalar ratio is vanishingly small. Furthermore,
extending the Planck mission to four sky surveys offers better control of
polarized Galactic dust emission, since the 217 GHz frequency band can be used
as an effective dust template in addition to the 353 GHz channel.
