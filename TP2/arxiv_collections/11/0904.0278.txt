Modifications to the classic time-delay effect and Doppler shift in General
Relativity (GR) are studied in the context of the Lorentz-violating
Standard-Model Extension (SME). We derive the leading Lorentz-violating
corrections to the time-delay and Doppler shift signals, for a light ray
passing near a massive body. It is demonstrated that anisotropic coefficients
for Lorentz violation control a time-dependent behavior of these signals that
is qualitatively different from the conventional case in GR. Estimates of
sensitivities to gravity-sector coefficients in the SME are given for current
and future experiments, including the recent Cassini solar conjunction
experiment.
