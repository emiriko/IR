Metamaterials are artificial composite materials that, by virtue of their
microstructure, exhibit properties not exhibited by their component materials.
Much excitement has been generated by negatively refracting metamaterials,
typically consisting of coupled, metallic, subwavelength elements that simulate
electric and magnetic dipoles, because of their unusual ability to manipulate
visible light, infrared waves and microwaves. In such a metamaterial, an
electromagnetic wave propagates so that the direction of its energy flow is
opposed to its phase velocity, a condition captured by the real part of the
refractive index being negative. Here we show that a thin film comprising
parallel tilted nanorods deposited by directing silver vapor obliquely towards
a large-area substrate displays a negative real refractive index in the visible
regime. Since vapor deposition is a very well-established technique to deposit
thin films in the photonics industry, our result is promising for large-scale
production of negatively refracting metamaterials
