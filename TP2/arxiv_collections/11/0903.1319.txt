We investigate the effect of impurities in multiferroic materials using an
equation of motion approach for the spin dynamics of the host multiferroic
compound. We model the impurities as a two-level system and focus on the regime
where the impurity spins relax slowly. When the impurity strength is weak the
host spins oscillate with no decay and the electric polarization is not
affected. However as the impurity strength is increased the host spin
components get damped and the electrion polarization is suppressed. Since
polarization in multiferroic materials is driven by magnetic ordering we
conclude that the presence of impurities is detrimental to multiferroicity.
