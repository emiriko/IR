The aim of the present paper is to provide an intrinsic investigation of
projective changes in Finlser geometry, following the pullback formalism.
Various known local results are generalized and other new intrinsic results are
obtained. Nontrivial characterizations of projective changes are given. The
fundamental projectively invariant tensors, namely, the projective deviation
tensor, the Weyl torsion tensor, the Weyl curvature tensor and the Douglas
tensor are investigated. The properties of these tensors and their
interrelationships are obtained. Projective connections and projectively flat
manifolds are characterized. The present work is entirely intrinsic (free from
local coordinates).
