We study the dynamical response of a single semiflexible polymer chain based
on the theory developed by Hallatschek et al. for the wormlike-chain model. The
linear viscoelastic response under oscillatory forces acting at the two chain
ends is derived analytically as a function of the oscillation frequency . We
shall show that the real part of the complex compliance in the low frequency
limit is consistent with the static result of Marko and Siggia whereas the
imaginary part exhibits the power-law dependence +1/2. On the other hand, these
compliances decrease as the power law -7/8 for the high frequency limit. These
are different from those of the Rouse dynamics. A scaling argument is developed
to understand these novel results.
