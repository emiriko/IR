We present the first theoretical study on center-to-limb variation (CLV)
properties and relative radius interpretation for narrow and broad-band
filters, on the basis of a set of dynamic model atmospheres of C-rich AGB
stars. We computed visibility profiles and the equivalent uniform disc radii
(UD-radii) in order to investigate the dependence of these quantities upon the
wavelength and pulsation phase. After an accurate morphological analysis of the
visibility and intensity profiles determined in narrow and broad-band filter,
we fitted our visibility profiles with a UD function simulating the
observational approach. UD-radii have been computed using three different
fitting-methods to investigate the influence of the sampling of the visibility
profile: single point, two points and least square method. The intensity and
visibility profiles of models characterized by mass loss show a behaviour very
different from a UD. We found that UD-radii are wavelength dependent and this
dependence is stronger if mass loss is present. Strong opacity contributions
from C2H2 affect all radius measurements at 3 micron and in the N-band,
resulting in higher values for the UD-radii. The predicted behaviour of
UD-radii versus phase is complicated in the case of models with mass loss,
while the radial changes are almost sinusoidal for the models without mass
loss. Compared to the M-type stars, for the C-stars no windows for measuring
the pure continuum are available.
