In a recent Comment, Decca et al. [Phys. Rev. A 79, 026101 (2009);
arXiv:0809.3576] discussed the origin of the anomalies recently reported by us
in Phys. Rev. A 78, 036102(R) (2008); arXiv:0812.0028 . Here we restate our
view, corroborated by their considerations, that quantitative geometrical and
electrostatic characterizations of the conducting surfaces (a topic not
discussed explicitly in the literature until very recently) are critical for
the assessment of precision and accuracy of the demonstration of the Casimir
force and for deriving meaningful limits on the existence of Yukawian
components possibly superimposed to the Newtonian gravitational interaction.
