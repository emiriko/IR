We propose a general method to circumvent the singularity of arbitrary 2D
cloaks, which arises from infinitely large values of material parameters at
inner boundaries. The presented method is based on the deformation view of the
transformation design method. It is shown that by adjusting the principle
stretch out of the cloaking plane, 2D cloaks of arbitrary shapes without
singularity can be constructed. It is also demonstrated that the method based
on the equivalent dispersion relation and the design method for nonsingular 2D
cloak from mirror-symmetric cross section of 3D cloak can be derived from the
proposed theory. Examples of a cylindrical electromagnetic cloak and an
arbitrary shaped 2D electromagnetic cloak without singularity are provided to
illustrate the method.
