The effect of anisotropic order parameter to specific heat of anisotropic
two-band superconductors in BCS weak-coupling limit are investigated. An
analytical specific heat jump and the numerical specific heat are shown by
using anisotropic order parameters, and the electron-phonon interaction and
non-electron-phonon interaction. The two model of anisotropic order parameters
are used for numerical calculation that we find little effect to the numerical
results . The specific heat jump of, and superconductors can fit well with the
both of them. By comparing to experimental data overall range of temperature,
the best fit is ,, and superconductors, respectively.
