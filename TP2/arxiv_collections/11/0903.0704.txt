We study the dynamics of priority-queue networks, generalizations of the
binary interacting priority queue model introduced by Oliveira and Vazquez
[Physica A {\bf 388}, 187 (2009)]. We found that the original AND-type protocol
for interacting tasks is not scalable for the queue networks with loops because
the dynamics becomes frozen due to the priority conflicts. We then consider a
scalable interaction protocol, an OR-type one, and examine the effects of the
network topology and the number of queues on the waiting time distributions of
the priority-queue networks, finding that they exhibit power-law tails in all
cases considered, yet with model-dependent power-law exponents. We also show
that the synchronicity in task executions, giving rise to priority conflicts in
the priority-queue networks, is a relevant factor in the queue dynamics that
can change the power-law exponent of the waiting time distribution.
