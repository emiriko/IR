A non-Markovian model of quantum repeated interactions between a small
quantum system and an infinite chain of quantum systems is presented. By
adapting and applying usual pro jection operator techniques in this context,
discrete versions of the integro-differential and time-convolutioness Master
equations for the reduced system are derived. Next, an intuitive and rigorous
description of the indirect quantum measurement principle is developed and a
discrete non Markovian stochastic Master equation for the open system is
obtained. Finally, the question of unravelling in a particular model of
non-Markovian quantum interactions is discussed.
