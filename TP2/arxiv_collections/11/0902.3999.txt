I argue for two modes of gas giant planet formation and discuss the
conditions under which each mode operates. Gas giant planets at disk radii
$r>100$ AU are likely to form in situ by disk instability, while core accretion
plus gas capture remains the dominant formation mechanism for $r<100$ AU.
During the mass accretion phase, mass loading can push disks toward
fragmentation conditions at large $r$. Massive, extended disks can fragment
into clumps of a few to tens of Jupiter masses. This is confirmed by radiation
hydrodynamics simulations. The two modes of gas giant formation should lead to
a bimodal distribution of gas giant semi-major axes. Because core accretion is
expected to be less efficient in low-metallicity systems, the ratio of gas
giants at large $r$ to planets at small $r$ should increase with decreasing
metallicity.
