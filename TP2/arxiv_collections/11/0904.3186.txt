NA60 measured dimuon production in p-A and In-In collisions at the CERN SPS.
This paper presents a high statistics measurement of $\phi$ meson production in
In-In collisions at 158 AGeV. Both the transverse momentum, rapidity, decay
angular distributions and the absolute yield were measured as a function of
centrality. The results are compared to previous measurements in order to shed
light on the long standing $\phi$ puzzle. In addition, highlights on $\eta$
meson production and on the dimuon excess below the J/$\psi$ mass are
presented.
