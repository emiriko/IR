Entanglement dynamics for a couple of two-level atoms interacting with
independent structured reservoirs is studied using a non-perturbative approach.
It is shown that the revival of atom entanglement is not necessarily
accompanied by the sudden death of reservoir entanglement, and vice versa. In
fact, atom entanglement can revive before, simultaneously or even after the
disentanglement of reservoirs. Using a novel method based on the population
analysis for the excited atomic state, we present the quantitative criteria for
the revival and death phenomena. For giving a more physically intuitive
insight, the quasimode Hamiltonian method is applied. Our quantitative analysis
is helpful for the practical engineering of entanglement.
