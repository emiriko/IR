The origin of the unusual 90^o ferroelectric / ferroelastic domains,
consistently observed in recent studies on meso and nanoscale free-standing
single crystals of BaTiO3 [Schilling et al., Physical Review B, 74, 024115
(2006); Schilling et al., Nano Letters, 7, 3787 (2007)], has been considered. A
model has been developed which postulates that the domains form as a response
to elastic stress induced by a surface layer which does not undergo the
paraelectric-ferroelectric, cubic-tetragonal phase transition. This model was
found to accurately account for the changes in domain periodicity as a function
of size that had been observed experimentally. The physical origin of the
surface layer might readily be associated with patterning damage, seen in
experiment; however, when all evidence of physical damage is removed from the
BaTiO3 surfaces by thermal annealing, the domain configuration remains
practically unchanged. This suggests a more intrinsic origin, such as the
increased importance of surface tension at small dimensions. The effect of
surface tension is also shown to be proportional to the difference in hardness
between the surface and the interior of the ferroelectric. The present model
for surface tension induced twinning should also be relevant for finely grained
or core-shell structured ceramics.
