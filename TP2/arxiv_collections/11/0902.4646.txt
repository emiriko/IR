We present the result of a full direct component calculation for the
non-planar contribution to the four-loop anomalous dimension of the Konishi
operator in N =4 Supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. The result contains only
zeta(5) term and is proportional to zeta(5) contribution in the planar case,
which comes purely from wrapping corrections. We have extended also our
previous calculations for the leading transcendental contribution
arXiv:0811.0607 on non-planar case and have found the same results up to a
common factor. It allows us to suggest that the non-planar contribution to the
four-loop universal anomalous dimension for the twist-2 operators with
arbitrary Lorentz spin is proportional to $S_1^2(j) \zeta(5)$. This result
gives unusual double-logarithmic asymptotic $\ln^2 j$ for large j.
