The polarization properties of perfectly periodical and defective
one-dimensional photonic bandgap structures with nonreciprocal chiral
(bi-isotropic) layers are studied. The method of solution is based on the
2x2-block-representation transfer-matrix formulation. Numerical simulations are
carried out for different type of structures (symmetrical or asymmetrical) in
order to reveal the dependence of the reflection and transmission coefficients
on frequency, chirality, nonreciprocity parameters, and the angle of wave
incidence.
