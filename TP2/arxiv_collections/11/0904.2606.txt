To prevent the flocculation and phase separation of nanoparticles in
solution, nanoparticles are often functionalized with short chain surfactants.
Here we present fully-atomistic molecular dynamics simulations which
characterize how these functional coatings affect the interactions between
nanoparticles and with the surrounding solvent. For 5 nm diameter silica
nanoparticles coated with poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) oligomers in water, we
determined the hydrodynamic drag on two approaching nanoparticles moving
through solvent and on a single nanoparticle as it approaches a planar surface.
In most circumstances, acroscale fluid theory accurately predicts the drag on
these nano-scale particles. Good agreement is seen with Brenner's analytical
solutions for wall separations larger than the soft nanoparticle radius. For
two approaching coated nanoparticles, the solvent-mediated
(velocity-independent) and lubrication (velocity-dependent) forces are purely
repulsive and do not exhibit force oscillations that are typical of uncoated
rigid spheres.
