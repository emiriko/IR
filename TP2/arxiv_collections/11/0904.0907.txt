We present an investigation of different thin-film evaporated ferromagnetic
materials for their suitability as electrodes in individual single-wall and
multi-wall carbon nanotube-based spin devices. Various electrode shapes made
from permalloy (Ni_{81}Fe_{19}), the diluted ferromagnet PdFe, and PdFe/Fe
bilayers are studied for both their micromagnetic properties and their contact
formation to carbon nanotubes. Suitable devices are tested in low-temperature
electron transport measurements, displaying the typical tunneling
magnetoresistance of carbon nanotube pseudo spin valves.
