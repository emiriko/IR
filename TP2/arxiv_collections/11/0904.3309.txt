We calculate the radiative corrections to the annihilation of the Dark Matter
particles into leptons. Lepton masses are taken into account. As the Dark
Matter particles are considered both Dirac and Majorana fermions. We sum up all
the leading logarithms contributions where it is possible. We show that in the
Dirac fermion case the resulting cross-section is consistent with the
renormalization group prediction: the cross-section have the Drell-Yan form.
Whereas, in the Majorana fermions case we have two essentially different limits
of the resulting cross-section and quantitively the answer strongly depends on
a spectrum of the masses entering the problem.
