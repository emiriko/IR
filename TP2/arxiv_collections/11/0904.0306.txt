We show the additional spin dependent classical force due to the rotation of
an electron spin's rest frame is essential to derive a spin-Faraday law by
using an analogy with the usual Faraday law. The contribution of the additional
spin dependent force to the spin-Faraday law is the same as that of the spin
geometric phase. With this observations, Faraday law is generalized to include
both the usual Faraday and the spin-Faraday laws in a unified manner.
