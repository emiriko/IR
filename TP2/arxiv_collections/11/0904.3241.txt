In the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, physical phases of complex
parameters lead to CP violation. We show how triple products of particle
momenta or spins can be used to construct asymmetries, that allow us to probe
these CP phases. To give specific examples, we discuss the production of
neutralinos at the International Linear Collider. For the Large Hadron
Collider, we discuss CP asymmetries in squark decays, and in the tri-lepton
signal. We find that the CP asymmetries can be as large as 60%.
