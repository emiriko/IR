We present a microscopic calculation of the 6He beta-decay into the ground
state of 6Li. To this end, we use chiral perturbation theory at
next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order to describe the nuclear weak-currents.
The nuclear wave functions are derived from the J-matrix inverse scattering
nucleon-nucleon potential (JISP), and the Schroedinger equation is solved using
the hyperspherical-harmonics expansion. Our calculation brings the theoretical
decay-rate within 3% of the measured one. This success is attributed to the use
of chiral-perturbation-theory based mesonic currents, whose contribution is
qualitatively different compared to standard nuclear physics approach, where
the use of meson exchange currents worsens the comparison to experiment. The
inherent inconsistency in the use of the JISP potential together with
chiral-perturbation-theory based is argued not to affect this conclusion,
though a more detailed investigation is called for. We conclude that any
suppression of the axial constant in nuclear matter is included in this
description of the weak interaction in the nucleus.
