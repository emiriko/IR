We construct a supersymmetric model with the flavor symmetry D14 in which the
CKM matrix element |V_{ud}| can take the value |V_{ud}| =cos (pi/14) = 0.97493
implying that the Cabibbo angle theta_C is sin (theta_C) = |V_{us}| = sin
(pi/14) = 0.2225. These values are very close to those observed in experiments.
The value of |V_{ud}| (theta_C) is based on the fact that different Z2
subgroups of D14 are conserved in the up and down quark sector. In order to
achieve this, D14 is accompanied by a Z3 symmetry. The spontaneous breaking of
D14 is induced by flavons, which are scalar gauge singlets. The quark mass
hierarchy is partly due to the flavor group D14 and partly due to a
Froggatt-Nielsen symmetry U(1)_{FN} under which only the right-handed quarks
transform. The model is completely natural in the sense that the hierarchies
among the quark masses and mixing angles are generated with the help of
symmetries. The issue of the vacuum alignment of the flavons is solved up to a
small number of degeneracies, leaving four different possible values for
|V_{ud}|. Out of these, only one of them leads to a phenomenological viable
model. A study of the Z2 subgroup breaking terms shows that the results
achieved in the symmetry limit are only slightly perturbed. At the same time
they allow |V_{ud}| (theta_C) to be well inside the small experimental error
bars.
