We review a proposed multicomponent model to explain the features of the
pulsed emission and spectrum of the Crab Pulsar, on the light of the recent
detection of pulsed emission above 25 GeV from the MAGIC atmospheric Cherenkov
telescope. This model explains the evolution of the pulse shape and of the
phase-resolved spectra, ranging from the optical/UV to the GeV energy band, on
the assumption that the observed emission is due to several components, which
have spectra modelled as log-parabolic laws. We show that the new MAGIC data
are well consistent with the prevision of our model.
