We present the results of ab initio calculations describing the adsorption of
certain small organic molecules on clean and oxidized Al(111) surfaces as well
as on the alpha-Al2O3(0001) surface. Our results show that adsorption of
benzene on the clean and oxidized Al(111) surfaces is generally weak, the
adsorption energy being at most around -0.5 eV per benzene molecule, and the
molecule adsorbed at a considerable distance from the surfaces. The adsorption
energy varies weakly at the different adsorption sites and as a function of the
oxygen coverage. For the alumina surface, we find no benzene adsorption at all.
We have also calculated a phenol molecule on the aluminium and alumina
surfaces, since it is similar to the benzene molecule. The results show a weak
adsorption for phenol on the alumina surface and no adsorption on the aluminium
or oxidized aluminium surfaces at all. For the propane molecule there is no
adsorption on either the oxidized aluminium or the alumina surface, whereas the
carbonic acid molecule binds strongly to the alumina but not to the aluminium
surface.
