As the SALT High Resolution Spectrograph completion is nearing we plan to
extend the Pennsylvania-Torun Planets Search (PTPS) with HET to the southern
hemisphere. Due to overlap of the skies available for both HET and SALT in the
declination range (+10, -10) deg some cooperation and immediate follow up is
possible. Here we present, as an example, a $\sim$ 1000 star sample of evolved
stars for the future SALT Planet Search.
