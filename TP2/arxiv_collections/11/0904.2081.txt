We report on terahertz radiation detection with InGaAs/InAlAs Field Effect
Transistors in quantizing magnetic field. The photovoltaic detection signal is
investigated at 4.2 K as a function of the gate voltage and magnetic field.
Oscillations analogous to the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations, as well as their
strong enhancement at the cyclotron resonance, are observed. The results are
quantitatively described by a recent theory, showing that the detection is due
to rectification of the terahertz radiation by plasma waves related
nonlinearities in the gated part of the channel.
