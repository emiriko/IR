Models of binary star interactions have been successful in explaining the
origin of field hot subdwarf (sdB) stars in short period systems, but
longer-period systems that formed via Roche-lobe overflow (RLOF) mass transfer
from the present sdB to its companion have received less attention. We map sets
of initial binaries into present-day binaries that include sdBs and
main-sequence stars, distinguishing "observable" sdBs from "hidden" ones. We
aim to find out whether (1) the existing catalogues of sdBs are sufficiently
fair samples of all the kinds of sdB binaries that theory predicts; or instead
whether (2) large predicted hidden populations mandate the construction of new
catalogues, perhaps using wide-field imaging surveys such as 2MASS, SDSS, and
Galex. We also report on a pilot study to identify hidden subdwarfs, using
2MASS and GALEX data.
