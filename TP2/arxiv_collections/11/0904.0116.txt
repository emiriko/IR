Theory of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) in graphene is presented. The
canonical form of the electron-nucleus hyperfine interaction is strongly
modified by the linear electronic dispersion. The NMR shift and spin-lattice
relaxation time are calculated as function of temperature, chemical potential,
and magnetic field and three distinct regimes are identified: Fermi-,
Dirac-gas, and extreme quantum limit behaviors. A critical spectrometer
assessment shows that NMR is within reach for fully 13C enriched graphene of
reasonable size.
