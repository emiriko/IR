It is now well understood that $\ell_1$ minimization algorithm is able to
recover sparse signals from incomplete measurements [2], [1], [3] and sharp
recoverable sparsity thresholds have also been obtained for the $\ell_1$
minimization algorithm. However, even though iterative reweighted $\ell_1$
minimization algorithms or related algorithms have been empirically observed to
boost the recoverable sparsity thresholds for certain types of signals, no
rigorous theoretical results have been established to prove this fact. In this
paper, we try to provide a theoretical foundation for analyzing the iterative
reweighted $\ell_1$ algorithms. In particular, we show that for a nontrivial
class of signals, the iterative reweighted $\ell_1$ minimization can indeed
deliver recoverable sparsity thresholds larger than that given in [1], [3]. Our
results are based on a high-dimensional geometrical analysis (Grassmann angle
analysis) of the null-space characterization for $\ell_1$ minimization and
weighted $\ell_1$ minimization algorithms.
