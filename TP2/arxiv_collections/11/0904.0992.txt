We construct explicit Darboux transformations for a generalized,
two-dimensional Dirac equation. Our results contain former findings for the
one-dimensional, stationary Dirac equation, as well as for the fully
time-dependent case in (1+1) dimensions. We show that our Darboux
transformations are applicable to the two-dimensional Dirac equation in
cylindrical coordinates and give several examples.
