The photoionization of a two-shell endohedral A@CN1@CN2 is considered.
Formulas are presented for cross-sections and angular anisotropy parameters,
both dipole and non-dipole. The effect of the fullerenes shell upon
photoelectron from atom A is taken into account substituting the action of the
fullerene by two zero-thickness "bubble potential". The fullerenes shells
polarization is included assuming that the radius of the outer shell R2 is much
bigger than the inner R1 and both much exceeds the atomic radius r. This
permits to express the effect via CN1,N2 polarizabilities, which are connected
to their photoionization cross-sections. The interaction between shells CN1 and
CN2 is taken into account in the Random Phase Approximation (RPA). The effect
of photoelectron scattering by both "bubble potentials" is included in the
lowest order and in the RPA frame. As concrete examples, two endohedrals
Ar@C60@C240 and Xe@C60@C240 are considered. In the first case we consider 3p
and 3s, while in the second 5p, 5s and 4d subshells. A whole variety of new
peculiarities are found that deserve experimental verification.
