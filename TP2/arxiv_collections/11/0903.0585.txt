We study a twisted version of the Yang-Baxter Equation, called the
Hom-Yang-Baxter Equation (HYBE), which is motivated by Hom-Lie algebras. Three
classes of solutions of the HYBE are constructed, one from Hom-Lie algebras and
the others from Drinfeld's (dual) quasi-triangular bialgebras. Each solution of
the HYBE can be extended to operators that satisfy the braid relations.
Assuming an invertibility condition, these operators give a representation of
the braid group.
