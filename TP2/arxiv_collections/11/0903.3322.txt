We consider an Abelian Gauge Theory in R4 equipped with the Minkowski metric.
This theory leads to a system of equations, the Klein-Gordon- Maxwell
equations, which provide models for the interaction between the electromagnetic
field and matter. We assume that the nonlinear term is such that the energy
functional is positive; this fact makes the theory more suitable for physical
models. A three dimensional vortex is a finite energy, stationary solution of
these equations such that the matter field has nontrivial angular momen- tum
and the magnetic field looks like the field created by a finite solenoid. Under
suitable assumptions, we prove the existence of three dimensional
vortex-solutions.
