First-principles FLAPW-GGA calculations have been performed with the purpose
to determine the peculiarities of the structural, electronic, magnetic
properties and stability for a family of related ether carbides M3W3C and M6W6C
(where M= Fe and Co). The geometries of all phases were optimized and their
structural parameters, theoretical density, cohesive and formation energies,
total and partial densities of states, atomic magnetic moments have been
obtained and analyzed in comparison with available theoretical and experimental
data.
