The paper presents a detailed review of the smooth particle hydrodynamics
(SPH) method with particular focus on its astrophysical applications. We start
by introducing the basic ideas and concepts and thereby outline all ingredients
that are necessary for a practical implementation of the method in a working
SPH code. Much of SPH's success relies on its excellent conservation properties
and therefore the numerical conservation of physical invariants receives much
attention throughout this review. The self-consistent derivation of the SPH
equations from the Lagrangian of an ideal fluid is the common theme of the
remainder of the text. We derive a modern, Newtonian SPH formulation from the
Lagrangian of an ideal fluid. It accounts for changes of the local resolution
lengths which result in corrective, so-called "grad-h-terms". We extend this
strategy to special relativity for which we derive the corresponding grad-h
equation set. The variational approach is further applied to a
general-relativistic fluid evolving in a fixed, curved background space-time.
Particular care is taken to explicitely derive all relevant equations in a
coherent way.
