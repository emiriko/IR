The development and validation against experimental results of a new gasoline
surrogate complex kinetic mechanism is presented in this paper. The surrogate
fuel is a ternary mixture of n heptane, iso octane and toluene. The full three
components mechanism is based on existing n heptane/iso octane (gasoline PRF)
and toluene mechanisms which were modified and coupled for the purpose of this
work. Mechanism results are compared against available experimental data from
the literature. Simulations with the PRF plus toluene mechanism show that its
behavior is in agreement with experimental results for most of the tested
settings. These include a wide variety of thermodynamic conditions and fuel
proportions in experimental configurations such as HCCI engine experiments,
rapid compression machines, a shock tube and a jet stirred reactor.
