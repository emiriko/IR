We show that the recently introduced operator fidelity metric provides a
natural tool to investigate the cross-over to quantum chaotic behaviour. This
metric is an information-theoretic measure of the global stability of a unitary
evolution against perturbations. We use random matrix theory arguments to
conjecture that the operator fidelity metric can be used as an "order
parameter" to discriminates phases with regular behaviour from quantum chaotic
ones. A numerical study of the onset of chaotic in the Dicke model is given in
order to support the conjecture
