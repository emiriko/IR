Exclusive pi0 electroproduction from nucleons at large photon virtuality can
be described in terms of Generalized Parton Distributions, particularly the
chiral odd subset. Chiral odd GPDs are related to transversity and can be
accessed experimentally for various special choices of observables. This is
accomplished by choosing C-parity odd and chiral odd combinations of t-channel
exchange quantum numbers. These GPDs are calculated in a spectator model, and
are constrained by boundary functions. Alternatively, the production amplitudes
correspond to C-odd Regge exchanges with final state interactions. The helicity
structure of the virtual photoproduction amplitudes provides relations between
the partonic description via GPDs and the hadronic, Regge description of C-odd
processes, all via quark helicity flip. GPDs, in general, are analytic
functions of energy variables. Their integrals over unobservable parton momenta
thereby satisfy Dispersion Relations (DR). Using DR's could allow the real part
of the amplitudes, the integrated GPDs, to be extracted from the more easily
measured imaginary parts. However, at non-zero momentum transfer DRs require
integration over unphysical regions of the variables. We show that the relevant
unphysical region of the non-forward DRs is considerable. This will vitiate the
efforts to avoid the actual measurement of the real parts more directly.
