In this paper we present the results of the implementation of the decay t ->
b f1 f1 into the SANC system (f1 is a massless fermion). The new aspect of the
work is the combination of QCD and EW corrections. All calculations are done at
the one-loop level in the Standard Model. We give a detailed account of the new
procedure - the forming of a class of JAW,WA functions. These functions are
related to the procedure of extraction of infra-red and mass-shell singular
divergences. The emphasis of this paper is on the presentation of numerical
results for various approaches: complete one-loop calculations and different
versions of pole approximations.
