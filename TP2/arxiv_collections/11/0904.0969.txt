We show that Q-ball decay in Affleck-Dine baryogenesis models can account for
dark matter when the annihilation cross-section is sufficiently enhanced to
explain the positron and electron excesses observed by PAMELA, ATIC and
PPB-BETS. For Affleck-Dine baryogenesis along a d = 6 flat direction, the
reheating temperature is approximately 30 GeV and the Q-ball decay temperature
is in the range 10-100 MeV. The LSPs produced by Q-ball decay annihilate down
to the observed dark matter density if the cross-section is enhanced by a
factor ~ 10^3 relative to the thermal relic cross-section.
