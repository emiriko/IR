In order to better understand the chemistry involved during the combustion of
components of diesel fuel, the structure of a laminar lean premixed methane
flame doped with indane has been investigated. The gases of this flame contains
7.1% (molar) of methane, 36.8% of oxygen and 0.90% of indane corresponding to
an equivalence ratio of 0.74 and a ratio C9H10/CH4 of 12.75%. The flame has
been stabilized on a burner at a pressure of 6.7 kPa using argon as dilutant,
with a gas velocity at the burner of 49.2 cm/s at 333 K. Quantified species
included usual methane C0-C2 combustion products, but also 11 C3-C5
hydrocarbons and 3 C1-C3 oxygenated compounds, as well as 17 aromatic products,
namely benzene, toluene, phenylacetylene, styrene, ethylbenzene, xylenes,
trimethylbenzenes, ethyltoluenes, indene methylindane, methylindene,
naphthalene, phenol, benzaldehyde, benzofuran. The temperature was measured
thanks to a thermocouple in PtRh (6%)-PtRh (30%) settled inside the enclosure
and ranged from 800 K close to the burner up to 2000 K in the burned gases.
