Let G be a closed transitive subgroup of Homeo(S^1) which contains a
non-constant continuous path f: [0,1] --> G. We show that up to conjugation G
is one of the following groups: SO(2,R), PSL(2,R), PSL_k(2,R), Homeo_k(S^1),
Homeo(S^1). This verifies the classification suggested by Ghys [Enseign. Math.
47 (2001) 329-407]. As a corollary we show that the group PSL(2,R) is a maximal
closed subgroup of Homeo(S^1) (we understand this is a conjecture of de la
Harpe). We also show that if such a group G < Homeo(S^1) acts continuously
transitively on k-tuples of points, k>3, then the closure of G is Homeo(S^1)
(cf Bestvina's collection of `Questions in geometric group theory').
