The scanning tunnelling spectroscopy results from (Ca2-xNax)CuO2Cl2 in a
strong magnetic field are reinterpreted in a substantially different fashion.
Instead of looking, as Hanaguri et al do, to a B1g BCS-based interpretation and
relying heavily upon 'coherence effects', the very detailed changes wrought in
the tunnelling characteristics are re-addressed following the present author's
negative-U, boson-fermion, resonant crossover modelling of the High Temperature
Superconducting Cuprate (HTSC) phenomenon. As with a great many other now quite
sophisticated and discriminatory experimental assaults on the latter problem,
it would once again appear this form of modelling has much to offer a full
solution to this long-standing matter.
