We construct and study a family of double-periodic almost entire solutions of
the maximal surface equation. The solutions are parameterized by a submanifold
of $3\times 3$-matrices (the so-called generating matrices). We show that the
constructed solutions are either space-like or of mixed type with the
light-cone type isolated singularities.
