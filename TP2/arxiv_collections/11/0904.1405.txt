We develop an innovative numerical technique to describe few-body systems.
Correlated Gaussian basis functions are used to expand the channel functions in
the hyperspherical representation. The method is proven to be robust and
efficient compared to other numerical techniques. The method is applied to
few-body systems with short range interactions, including several examples for
three- and four-body systems. Specifically, for the two-component, four-fermion
system, we extract the coefficients that characterize its behavior at
unitarity.
