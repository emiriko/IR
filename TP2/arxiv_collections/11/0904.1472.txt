The charged-current quasi-elastic scattering of muon neutrino on a carbon
target is calculated for neutrino energy up to 2.8 GeV using the relativistic
distorted-wave impulse approximation with relativistic optical potential, which
was earlier successfully applied to describe electron-nucleus data. We studied
both neutrino and electron processes and have shown that the reduced exclusive
cross section for neutrino and electron scattering are similar. We have also
studied nuclear and axial vector mass effects on the shape of $Q^2$
distribution. The comparison of the (anti)neutrino total cross sections per
(proton)neutron, calculated for the carbon and oxygen targets shows the cross
sections for oxygen to be lower than those for carbon. We found significant
nuclear model dependence of inclusive and total cross sections for energy about
1 GeV.
