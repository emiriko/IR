All of the experimental data points presented in the original paper are
correct and unchanged (including statistical and systematic uncertainties).
However, herein we correct a comparison between the experimental data and a
theoretical picture, because we discovered a mistake in the code used. All of
the most probable sigma_breakup values differ by less than 0.4 mb from those
originally presented. However, the one standard deviation uncertainties (that
include contributions from both the statistical and systematic uncertainties on
the experimental data points) are approximately 30-60% larger than originally
reported. We give a table of the new comparison results and corrected versions
of Figs. 8-11 of the original paper and we note that no correction is needed
for results from the data-driven method in Fig. 13.
