The Mars Atmosphere-Ice Coupler MAIC-2 is a simple, latitudinal model, which
consists of a set of parameterisations for the surface temperature, the
atmospheric water transport and the surface mass balance (condensation minus
evaporation) of water ice. It is driven directly by the orbital parameters
obliquity, eccentricity and solar longitude (Ls) of perihelion. Surface
temperature is described by the Local Insolation Temperature (LIT) scheme,
which uses a daily and latitude-dependent radiation balance. The evaporation
rate of water is calculated by an expression for free convection, driven by
density differences between water vapor and ambient air, the condensation rate
follows from the assumption that any water vapour which exceeds the local
saturation pressure condenses instantly, and atmospheric transport of water
vapour is approximated by instantaneous mixing. Glacial flow of ice deposits is
neglected. Simulations with constant orbital parameters show that low
obliquities favour deposition of ice in high latitudes and vice versa. A
transient scenario driven by a computed history of orbital parameters over the
last 10 million years produces essentially monotonically growing polar ice
deposits during the most recent 4 million years, and a very good agreement with
the observed present-day polar layered deposits. The thick polar deposits
sometimes continue in thin ice deposits which extend far into the mid
latitudes, which confirms the idea of "ice ages" at high obliquity.
