We integrate the nonpropagating B_{\mu} gauge field for the non-linear BF
Lagrangian describing N M2-branes which includes terms with even number of the
totally antisymmetric tensor M^{IJK} in arXiv:0808.2473 and for the two-types
of non-linear BF Lagrangians which include terms with odd number of M^{IJK} as
well in arXiv:0809:0985. For the former Lagrangian we derive directly the
DBI-type Lagrangian expressed by the SU(N) dynamical A_{\mu} gauge field with a
spacetime dependent coupling constant, while for the low-energy expansions of
the latter Lagrangians the B_{\mu} integration is iteratively performed. The
derived Janus field theory Lagrangians are compared.
