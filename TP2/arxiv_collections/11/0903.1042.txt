Based on our comprehensive theoretical investigation and known experimental
results for small boron clusters, we predict the existence of a novel aromatic
inorganic molecule, B12H6. This molecule, which we refer to as borozene, has
remarkably similar properties to the well-known benzene. Borozene is planar,
possesses a large first excitation energy, D3h symmetry, and more importantly
is aromatic. Furthermore, the calculated anisotropy of the magnetic
susceptibility of borozene is three times larger in absolute value than for
benzene. Finally, we can show that borozene molecules may be fused together to
give larger aromatic compounds with even larger anisotropic susceptibilities.
