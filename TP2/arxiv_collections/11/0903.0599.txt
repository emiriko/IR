We present the basic ingredients of a technique to compute quantum Casimir
forces at micrometer scales using antenna measurements at tabletop, e.g.
centimeter, scales, forming a type of analog computer for the Casimir force.
This technique relies on a correspondence that we derive between the contour
integration of the Casimir force in the complex frequency plane and the
electromagnetic response of a physical dissipative medium in a finite, real
frequency bandwidth.
