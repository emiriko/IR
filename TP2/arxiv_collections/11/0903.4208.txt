We discuss quantum information processing machines. We start with single
purpose machines that either redistribute quantum information or identify
quantum states. We then move on to machines that can perform a number of
functions, with the function they perform being determined by a program, which
is itself a quantum state. Examples of both deterministic and probabilistic
programmable machines are given, and we conclude with a discussion of the
utility of quantum programs.
