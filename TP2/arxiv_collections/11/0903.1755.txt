Azimuthal asymmetries in signals of non vertical showers have been observed
in ground arrays of water Cherenkov detectors, like Haverah Park and the Pierre
Auger Observatory. The asymmetry in time distributions of arriving particles
offers a new possibility for the determination of the mass composition. The
dependence of this asymmetry on atmospheric depth shows a clear maximum at a
position that is correlated with the primary species. In this work a novel
method to determine mass composition based on these features of the ground
signals is presented and a Monte Carlo study of its sensitivity is carried out.
