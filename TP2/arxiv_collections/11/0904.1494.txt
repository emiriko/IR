We present the discovery of four remote star clusters in M33, one of which is
of an extended nature. Three of the clusters were discovered using survey data
from the Isaac Newton Telescope Wide-Field Camera while one was discovered
serendipitously in a deep image taken with the Hubble Space Telescope's
Advanced Camera for Surveys. With projected radii of 38-113 arcmin (9.6-28.5
kpc for an assumed M33 distance of 870 kpc), these clusters lie significantly
beyond all but one of the currently-confirmed clusters in M33. The clusters
have magnitudes and colors consistent with their being old to intermediate-age
globular clusters. Indeed, they bear a strong resemblance to the outer halo GC
population of the Milky Way and M31 in terms (V-I)o colors. The three outermost
clusters are projected on the far side of M33 with respect to M31, an asymmetry
that could suggest tidal interactions have affected M33's globular cluster
distribution at large radii.
