Bohmian mechanics is a theory about point particles moving along
trajectories. It has the property that in a world governed by Bohmian
mechanics, observers see the same statistics for experimental results as
predicted by quantum mechanics. Bohmian mechanics thus provides an explanation
of quantum mechanics. Moreover, the Bohmian trajectories are defined in a
non-conspiratorial way by a few simple laws.
