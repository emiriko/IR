This paper continues the study of metastable behaviour in disordered mean
field models initiated in [2], [3]. We consider the generalized Hopfield model
with finitely many independent patterns $\xi_1,...,\xi_p$ where the patterns
have i.i.d. components and follow discrete distributions on $[-1,1]$. We show
that metastable behaviour occurs and provide sharp asymptotics on metastable
exit times and the corresponding capacities. We apply the potential theoretic
approach developed by Bovier et al. in the space of appropriate order
parameters and use an analysis of the discrete Laplacian to obtain lower bounds
on capacities. Moreover, we include the possibility of multiple saddle points
with the same value of the rate function and the case that the energy surface
is degenerate around critical points.
