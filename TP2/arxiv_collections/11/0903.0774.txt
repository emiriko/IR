We analyze classical theory of a membrane propagating in a singular
background spacetime. The algebra of the first-class constraints of the system
defines the membrane dynamics. A membrane winding uniformly around compact
dimension of embedding spacetime is described by two constraints, which are
interpreted in terms of world-sheet diffeomorhisms. The system is equivalent to
a closed bosonic string propagating in a curved spacetime. Our results may be
used for finding a quantum theory of a membrane in the compactified Milne
space.
