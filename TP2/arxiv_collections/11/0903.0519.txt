One of the most important activities to increase the importance and the
responsibility of the higher education is the quality management, assessment
and evaluation. Starting from 2006, a national mechanism was created in Romania
and all the educational institutions have to apply a concrete algorithm to
ensure the internal evaluation, the external evaluation and, the most
important, to increase the quality of the educational process. This paper
presents the implementation of the quality assessment in "Tibiscus" University
of Timisoara, particularly at the Faculty of Computers and Applied Computer
Science.
