The spectrum of photons arising from WIMP annihilation carries a detailed
imprint of the structure of the dark sector. In particular, loop-level
annihilations into a photon and another boson can in principle lead to a series
of lines (a WIMP forest) at energies up to the WIMP mass. A specific model
which illustrates this feature nicely is a theory of two universal extra
dimensions compactified on a chiral square. Aside from the continuum emission,
which is a generic prediction of most dark matter candidates, we find a
"forest" of prominent annihilation lines that, after convolution with the
angular resolution of current experiments, leads to a distinctive (2-bump plus
continuum) spectrum, which may be visible in the near future with the Fermi
Gamma-Ray Space Telescope (formerly known as GLAST).
