We report on low temperature (2-30K) electron transport and magneto-transport
measurements of a chemically synthesized InAs nanowire. Both the temperature,
T, and transverse magnetic field dependences of the nanowire conductance are
consistent with the functional forms predicted in one-dimensional (1D) weak
localization theory. By fitting the magneto-conductance data to theory, the
phase coherence length of electrons is determined to be tens of nanometers with
a T-1/3 dependence. Moreover, as the electron density is increased by a gate
voltage, the magneto-conductance shows a possible signature of suppression of
weak localization in multiple 1D subbands.
