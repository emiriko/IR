The Penn State/Toru\'n Centre for Astronomy Search for Planets Around Evolved
Stars is a high-precision radial velocity (RV) survey aiming at planets
detection around giant stars. It is based on observations obtained with the 9.2
m Hobby-Eberly Telescope. As proper interpretation of high precision RV data
for red giants requires complete spectral analysis of targets we perform
spectral modeling of all stars included in the survey. Typically, rotation
velocities and metallicities are determined in addition to stellar luminosities
and temperatures what allows us to estimate stellar ages and masses. Here we
present preliminary results of metallicity studies in our sample. We search a
metallicity dependence similar to that for dwarfs by comparing our results for
a sample of 22 giants earlier than K5 showing significant RV variations with a
control sample of 58 relatively RV-stable stars.
