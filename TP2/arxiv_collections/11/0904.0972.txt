Superconductivity was achieved in Ti-doped iron-arsenide compound
Sr4Cr0.8Ti1.2O6Fe2As2 (abbreviated as Cr-FeAs-42622). The x-ray diffraction
measurement shows that this material has a layered structure with the space
group of \emph{P4/nmm}, and with the lattice constants a = b = 3.9003 A and c =
15.8376 A. Clear diamagnetic signals in ac susceptibility data and
zero-resistance in resistivity data were detected at about 6 K, confirming the
occurrence of bulk superconductivity. Meanwhile we observed a superconducting
transition in the resistive data with the onset transition temperature at 29.2
K, which may be induced by the nonuniform distribution of the Cr/Ti content in
the FeAs-42622 phase, or due to some other minority phase.
