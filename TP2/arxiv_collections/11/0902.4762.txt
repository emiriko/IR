We consider a particular class of n-dimensional homogeneous diffusions all of
which have an identity diffusion matrix and a drift function that is piecewise
constant and scale invariant. Abstract stochastic calculus immediately gives us
general results about existence and uniqueness in law and invariant probability
distributions when they exist. These invariant distributions are probability
measures on the $n$-dimensional space and can be extremely resistant to a more
detailed understanding. To have a better analysis, we construct a polyhedra
such that the inward normal at its surface is given by the drift function and
show that the finer structures of the invariant probability measure is
intertwined with the geometry of the polyhedra. We show that several natural
interacting Brownian particle models can thus be analyzed by studying the
combinatorial fan generated by the drift function, particularly when these are
simplicial. This is the case when the polyhedra is a polytope that is invariant
under a Coxeter group action, which leads to an explicit description of the
invariant measures in terms of iid Exponential random variables. Another class
of examples is furnished by interactions indexed by weighted graphs all of
which generate simplicial polytopes with $n !$ faces. We show that the
proportion of volume contained in each component simplex corresponds to a
probability distribution on the group of permutations, some of which have
surprising connections with the classical urn models.
