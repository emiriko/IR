We propose the use of mixing strategies to accelerate the convergence of the
common iterative algorithms utilized in Quantum Optimal Control Theory (QOCT).
We show how the non-linear equations of QOCT can be viewed as a "fixed-point"
non-linear problem. The iterative algorithms for this class of problems may
benefit from mixing strategies, as it happens, e.g. in the quest for th
ground-state density in Kohn-Sham density functional theory. We demonstrate,
with some numerical examples, how the same mixing schemes utilized in this
latter non-linear problem, may significantly accelerate the QOCT iterative
procedures.
