In this letter we consider a dark energy model in which the energy density is
a function of the Hubble parameter $H$ and its derivative with respect to time
$\rho_{de}=3\alpha \ddot{H}H^{-1}+3\beta\dot{H}+3\gamma H^2$. The behavior of
the dark energy and the expansion history of the Universe depend heavily on the
parameters of the model $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$. It is very interesting
that the age problem of the well-known three old objects can be alleviated in
this models.
