This paper outlines an application of iterated version of generalised
sequential crossover of two languages (which in some sense, an abstraction of
the crossover of chromosomes in living organisms) in studying some classes of
the newly proposed generalised splicing ($GS$) over two languages. It is proved
that, for $X,Y \in \{FIN, REG, LIN, CF, CS, RE \}, \sg \in FIN$, the subclass
of generalized splicing languages namely $GS(X,Y,\sg)$, (which is a subclass of
the class $GS(X,Y,FIN)$) is always regular.
