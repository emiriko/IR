Hawking-Unruh thermal state of warm surrounding field encountered in
non-inertial frames is shown to be a real phenomenon, a marker of nonstationary
dynamic evolutions. In accelerated motion of a charged particle it is shown
that the recoiled damping effect of Larmor radiation relaxation leads to
distinctive thermal power, which is akin to that of Hawking-Unruh radiation
from warm surrounding field of the accelerated charge. The damping effect from
recoil-momentum of transverse electromagnetic field is worked out by
considering torque imparted to the inherently existing angular evolution of
spherically polarized vacuum field around the point-like charged particle in
acceleration. Hawking-Unruh effects is generally noted to be a universal marker
of decoherence in evolution in all scales of microscopic, macroscopic and
megascopic systems. Besides detailing the case of electrodynamics, the various
efficacies of H-U relaxation are considered in the nonstationary evolutions.
