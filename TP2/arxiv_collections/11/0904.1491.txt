The joint probability distribution in the full counting statistics (FCS) for
noninteracting electrons is discussed for an arbitrary number of initially
separate subsystems which are connected at t=0 and separated at a later time. A
simple method to obtain the leading order long time contribution to the
logarithm of the characteristic function is presented which simplifies earlier
approaches. New explicit results for the determinant involving the scattering
matrices are found. The joint probability distribution for two leads is
discussed for Y-junctions and dots connected to four leads.
