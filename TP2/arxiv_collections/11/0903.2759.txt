We present a comprehensive study of two-boson exchange (TBE) corrections in
parity-violating electron-proton elastic scattering. Within a hadronic
framework, we compute contributions from box (and crossed box) diagrams in
which the intermediate states are described by nucleons and Delta baryons. The
Delta contribution is found to be much smaller than the nucleon one at backward
angles (small epsilon), but becomes dominant in the forward scattering limit
(epsilon -> 1), where the nucleon contribution vanishes. The dependence of the
corrections on the input hadronic form factors is small for Q^2 < 1 GeV^2, but
becomes significant at larger Q^2. We compute the nucleon and Delta TBE
corrections relevant for recent and planned parity-violating experiments, with
the total corrections ranging from -1% for forward angles to 1-2% at backward
kinematics.
