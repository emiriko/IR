To study fundamental questions of hadron and nuclear physics in interactions
of antiprotons with nucleons and nuclei, the universal PANDA detector will be
built. Gluonic excitations, the physics of strange and charm quarks and nucleon
structure studies will be performed with unprecedented accuracy thereby
allowing high-precision tests of the strong interaction. The proposed PANDA
detector is a state-of-the art internal target detector at the HESR at FAIR
allowing the detection and identification of neutral and charged particles
generated within the relevant angular and energy range. This report presents a
summary of the physics accessible at PANDA and what performance can be
expected.
