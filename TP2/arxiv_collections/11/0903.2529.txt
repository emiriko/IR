After discussing the various possible interpretations of the Y(4143) signal
observed by the CDF collaboration in the $J/\psi \phi$ mode, we tend to
conclude that Y(4143) is probably a $D_s^\ast {\bar D}_s^\ast$ molecular state
with $J^{PC}=0^{++}$ or $2^{++}$ while Y(3930) is its $D^\ast {\bar D}^\ast$
molecular partner as predicted in our previous work (arXiv:0808.0073). Both the
hidden-charm and open charm two-body decays occur through the rescattering of
the vector components within the molecular states while the three- and
four-body open charm decay modes are forbidden kinematically. Hence their
widths are narrow naturally. CDF, Babar and Belle collaborations may have
discovered heavy molecular states already. We urge experimentalists to measure
their quantum numbers and explore their radiative decay modes in the future.
