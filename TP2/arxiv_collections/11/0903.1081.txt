A particle produced in a hard collision can lose energy through
bremsstrahlung. It has long been of interest to calculate the effect on
bremsstrahlung if the particle is produced inside a finite-size QCD medium such
as a quark-gluon plasma. For the case of very high-energy particles traveling
through the background of a weakly-coupled quark-gluon plasma, it is known how
to reduce this problem to an equivalent problem in non-relativistic
two-dimensional quantum mechanics. Analytic solutions, however, have always
resorted to further approximations. One is a harmonic oscillator approximation
to the corresponding quantum mechanics problem, which is appropriate for
sufficiently thick media. Another is to formally treat the particle as having
only a single significant scattering from the plasma (known as the N=1 term of
the opacity expansion), which is appropriate for sufficiently thin media. In a
broad range of intermediate cases, these two very different approximations give
surprisingly similar but slightly differing results if one works to leading
logarithmic order in the particle energy, and there has been confusion about
the range of validity of each approximation. In this paper, I sort out in
detail the parametric range of validity of these two approximations at leading
logarithmic order. For simplicity, I study the problem for small alpha_s and
large logarithms but alpha_s log << 1.
