We develop a set of heuristic arguments to explain several results on planar
Poisson-Voronoi tessellations that were derived earlier at the cost of
considerable mathematical effort. The results concern Voronoi cells having a
large number n of sides. The arguments start from an entropy balance applied to
the arrangement of n neighbors around a central cell. It is followed by a
simplified evaluation of the phase space integral for the probability p_n that
an arbitrary cell be n-sided. The limitations of the arguments are indicated.
As a new application we calculate the expected number of Gabriel (or full)
neighbors of an n-sided cell in the large-n limit.
