We derive a consistent 2-loop scaling picture for a Kondo dot in both
equilibrium and non-equilibrium situations using the flow equation method. Our
analysis incorporates the important decoherence effects from both thermal and
non-equilibrium noise in a common setting. We calculate the spin-spin
correlation function, the T-matrix, and the magnetization as functions of
applied magnetic field, dc-voltage bias and temperature. In all these
quantities we observe characteristic non-equilibrium features for a
nonvanishing external voltage bias like Kondo splitting and strongly enhanced
logarithmic corrections.
