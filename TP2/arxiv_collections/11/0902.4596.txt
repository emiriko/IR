We study low energy quantum oscillations of electron gas in plasma. It is
shown that two electrons participating in these oscillations acquire additional
negative energy when they interact by means of a virtual plasmon. The
additional energy leads to the formation a Cooper pair and possible existence
of the superconducting phase in the system. We suggest that this mechanism
supports slowly damping oscillations of electrons without any energy supply.
Basing on our model we put forward the hypothesis the superconductivity can
occur in a low energy ball lightning.
