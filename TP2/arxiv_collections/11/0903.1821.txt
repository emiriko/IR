In this paper the interface between two transformation media or between a
transformation medium and vacuum is studied. Strictly from the transformation
optics point of view the consequences of the boundary conditions at such
interfaces are addressed in two different ways. First, we analyze a restricted
class of reflectionless interfaces, for which the tools of transformation
optics allow to describe the electromagnetic fields on both sides of the
interface by means of the same vacuum solution of the Maxwell equations. In a
second step, we examine interfaces between two arbitrary transformation media.
This analysis is extended to the recently suggested generalization of
transformation optics by the author. As a basic application it is shown how the
standard law of reflection and refraction at an interface between vacuum and a
homogeneous and isotropic medium with arbitrary and independent permittivity
and permeability can be understood in a completely geometric way by the use of
generalized transformation optics.
