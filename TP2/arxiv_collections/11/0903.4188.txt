We propose measurements of the deeply virtual Compton amplitude (DVCS),
gamma* to H H-bar gamma, in the timelike t = (p_{H} + p_{H-bar})^2 > 0
kinematic domain which is accessible at electron-positron colliders via the
radiative annihilation process e+ e- to H H-bar gamma. These processes allow
the measurement of timelike deeply virtual Compton scattering for a variety of
H H-bar hadron pairs such as pi+ pi-, K+ K-, and D D-bar as well as p p-bar. As
in the conventional spacelike DVCS, there are interfering coherent amplitudes
contributing to the timelike processes involving C= - form factors. The
interference between the amplitudes measures the phase of the C=+ timelike DVCS
amplitude relative to the phase of the timelike form factors and can be
isolated by considering the forward-backward e+ \leftrightarrow e- asymmetry.
The J=0 fixed pole contribution which arises from the local coupling of the two
photons to the quark current plays a special role. As an example we present a
simple model.
