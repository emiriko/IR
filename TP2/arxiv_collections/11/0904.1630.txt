We demonstrate existence of a tile assembly system that self-assembles the
statistically self-similar Sierpinski Triangle in the Winfree-Rothemund Tile
Assembly Model. This appears to be the first paper that considers self-assembly
of a random fractal, instead of a deterministic fractal or a finite, bounded
shape. Our technical contributions include a way to remember, and use,
unboundedly-long prefixes of an infinite coding sequence at each stage of
fractal construction; a tile assembly mechanism for nested recursion; and a
definition of "almost-everywhere local determinism," to describe a tileset
whose assembly is locally determined, conditional upon a zeta-dimension zero
set of (infinitely many) "input" tiles. This last is similar to the definition
of randomized computation for Turing machines, in which an algorithm is
deterministic relative to an oracle sequence of coin flips that provides advice
but does not itself compute. Keywords: tile self-assembly, statistically
self-similar Sierpinski Triangle.
