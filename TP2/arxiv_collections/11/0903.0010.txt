We study the behavior of U.S. markets both before and after U.S. Federal Open
Market Committee (FOMC) meetings, and show that the announcement of a U.S.
Federal Reserve rate change causes a financial shock, where the dynamics after
the announcement is described by an analogue of the Omori earthquake law. We
quantify the rate n(t) of aftershocks following an interest rate change at time
T, and find power-law decay which scales as n(t-T) (t-T)^-$\Omega$, with
$\Omega$ positive. Surprisingly, we find that the same law describes the rate
n'(|t-T|) of "pre-shocks" before the interest rate change at time T. This is
the first study to quantitatively relate the size of the market response to the
news which caused the shock and to uncover the presence of quantifiable
preshocks. We demonstrate that the news associated with interest rate change is
responsible for causing both the anticipation before the announcement and the
surprise after the announcement. We estimate the magnitude of financial news
using the relative difference between the U. S. Treasury Bill and the Federal
Funds Effective rate. Our results are consistent with the "sign effect," in
which "bad news" has a larger impact than "good news." Furthermore, we observe
significant volatility aftershocks, confirming a "market underreaction" that
lasts at least 1 trading day.
