The measurements of B -> pi K decays have been in disagreement with the
predictions of the Standard Model (SM) for some time. In this paper, we perform
an update of this puzzle using the latest (2008) data. We find that the
situation has become far less clear. A fit to the B -> pi K data alone suggests
the presence of new physics (NP). Indeed, if one adds a constraint on the weak
phase gamma coming from independent measurements -- the SM fit -- one finds
that the fit is poor. On the other hand, it is not terrible. If one is willing
to accept some deficiencies in the fit, it can be argued that the SM can
explain the B -> pi K data. If one assumes NP, it is found to be present only
in the electroweak penguin amplitude, as before. However, the fit is fair at
best, and the improvement over the SM is not particularly strong. All and all,
while the B -> pi K puzzle has not disappeared, it has become weaker.
