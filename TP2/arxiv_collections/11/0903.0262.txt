It was known for a long time that in d = 4 dimensions it is impossible to
construct the Lagrangian for antisymmetric second rank spin-tensor that will be
invariant under the gauge transformations with unconstrained spin-vector
parameter. But recently a paper arXiv:0902.1471 appeared where gauge invariant
Lagrangians for antisymmetric spin-tensors of arbitrary rank n in d > 2n were
constructed using powerful BRST approach. To clarify apparent contradiction, in
this note we carry a direct independent analysis of the most general first
order Lagrangian for the massless antisymmetric spin-tensor of second rank. Our
analysis shows that gauge invariant Lagrangian does exist but in d > 4
dimensions only, while in d = 4 this Lagrangian becomes identically zero. As a
byproduct, we obtain a very simple and convenient form of this massless
Lagrangian that makes deformation to AdS space and/or massive case a simple
task as we explicitly show here. Moreover, this simple form admits natural and
straightforward generalization on the case of massive antisymmetric
spin-tensors of rank n for d > 2n.
