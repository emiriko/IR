We report the final redshift release of the 6dF Galaxy Survey, a combined
redshift and peculiar velocity survey over the southern sky (|b|>10 deg). Its
136,304 spectra have yielded 110,256 new extragalactic redshifts and a new
catalogue of 125,071 galaxies making near-complete samples with (K, H, J, r_F,
b_J) <= (12.65, 12.95, 13.75, 15.60, 16.75). The median redshift of the survey
is 0.053. Survey data, including images, spectra, photometry and redshifts, are
available through an online database. We describe changes to the information in
the database since earlier interim data releases. Future releases will include
velocity dispersions, distances and peculiar velocities for the brightest
early-type galaxies, comprising about 10% of the sample. Here we provide
redshift maps of the southern local universe with z<=0.1, showing nearby
large-scale structures in hitherto unseen detail. A number of regions known
previously to have a paucity of galaxies are confirmed as significantly
underdense regions. The URL of the 6dFGS database is
