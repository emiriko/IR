The evaluation of the formative process in the University system has been
assuming an ever increasing importance in the European countries. Within this
context the analysis of student performance and capabilities plays a
fundamental role. In this work we propose a multivariate latent growth model
for studying the performances of a cohort of students of the University of
Bologna. The model proposed is innovative since it is composed by: (1)
multivariate growth models that allow to capture the different dynamics of
student performance indicators over time and (2) a factor model that allows to
measure the general latent student capability. The flexibility of the model
proposed allows its applications in several fields such as socio-economic
settings in which personal behaviours are studied by using panel data.
