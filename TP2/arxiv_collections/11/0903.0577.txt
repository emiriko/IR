We study the broadband optical conductivity and ultrafast carrier dynamics of
epitaxial graphene in the few-layer limit. Equilibrium spectra of nominally
buffer, monolayer, and multilayer graphene exhibit significant terahertz and
near-infrared absorption, consistent with a model of intra- and interband
transitions in a dense Dirac electron plasma. Non-equilibrium terahertz
transmission changes after photoexcitation are shown to be dominated by excess
hole carriers, with a 1.2-ps mono-exponential decay that reflects the
minority-carrier recombination time.
