This chapter defines a new concept and framework for constructing fusion
rules for evidences. This framework is based on a referee function, which does
a decisional arbitrament conditionally to basic decisions provided by the
several sources of information. A simple sampling method is derived from this
framework. The purpose of this sampling approach is to avoid the combinatorics
which are inherent to the definition of fusion rules of evidences. This
definition of the fusion rule by the means of a sampling process makes possible
the construction of several rules on the basis of an algorithmic implementation
of the referee function, instead of a mathematical formulation. Incidentally,
it is a versatile and intuitive way for defining rules. The framework is
implemented for various well known evidence rules. On the basis of this
framework, new rules for combining evidences are proposed, which takes into
account a consensual evaluation of the sources of information.
