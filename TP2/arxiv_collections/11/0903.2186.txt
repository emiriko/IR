We study the spin dynamics of a Heisenberg model at finite temperature in the
presence of an external field or a uniaxial anisotropy. For the case of the
uniaxial anisotropy our simulations show that the macro moment picture breaks
down. An effect which we refer to as a spin-wave instability (SWI) results in a
non-dissipative Bloch-Bloembergen type relaxation of the macro moment where the
size of the macro moment changes, and can even be made to disappear. This
relaxation mechanism is studied in detail by means of atomistic spin dynamics
simulations.
