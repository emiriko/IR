We studied the unusual Quantum Hall Effect (QHE) near the charge neutrality
point (CNP) in high-mobility graphene sample for magnetic fields up to 18 T. We
observe breakdown of the delocalized QHE transport and strong increase in
resistivities $\rho_{xx},|\rho_{xy}|$ with decreasing Landau level filling for
$\nu < 2$, where we identify two insulating regimes. For $1 \gtrsim |\nu|
\gtrsim 1/2$ we find an exponential increase of $\rho_{xx,xy} \sim
e^{a(H-H_c)}$ within the range up to several resistance quanta $R_K$, while the
Hall effect gradually disappears, consistent with the Hall insulator (HI) with
local transport. Then, at $\nu \approx 1/2$ a cusp in $\rho_{xx}(H)$ followed
by an onset of even faster growth indicates transition to a collective
insulator (CI) state. The likely candidate for this state is a pinned Wigner
crystal.
