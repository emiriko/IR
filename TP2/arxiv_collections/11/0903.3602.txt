Over the last few decades, astronomers and cosmologists have accumulated vast
amounts of data clearly demonstrating that our current theories of fundamental
particles and of gravity are inadequate to explain the observed discrepancy
between the dynamics and the distribution of the visible matter in the
Universe. The Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) proposal aims at solving the
problem by postulating that Newton's second law of motion is modified for
accelerations smaller than ~10^{-10}m/s^2. This simple amendment, has had
tremendous success in explaining galactic rotation curves. However, being
non-relativistic, it cannot make firm predictions for cosmology.
  A relativistic theory called Tensor-Vector-Scalar (TeVeS) has been proposed
by Bekenstein building on earlier work of Sanders which has a MOND limit for
non-relativistic systems.
  In this article I give a short introduction to TeVeS theory and focus on its
predictions for cosmology as well as some non-cosmological studies.
