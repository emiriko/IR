We show that the neutron scattering spectra observed in CaFe$_2$As$_2$ by
Zhao et al (arXiv:0903.2686v1) and the highly unusual spatially anisotropic
exchange constants in the iron pnictides derived by Han et al (Phys. Rev. Lett.
102, 107003 (2009)), using electronic structure calculations, can be explained
by assuming a role for orbital order in these materials. We write down a simple
model Hamiltonian with tertagonal symmetry, whose spin-wave spectra describes
the observed dispersion relations. We further argue that these materials have
orbital selective Mott transition, which is driven by superexchange between
neighboring iron atoms. We suggest that reduced spin and quasi-one
dimensionality and not frustration are responsible for the reduced moments in
these materials.
