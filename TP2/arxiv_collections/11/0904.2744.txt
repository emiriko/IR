We give an analytical derivation of the mass gap of the O(N) sigma models and
investigate a large-order behavior of the weak coupling asymptotic expansion
for the energy. For sufficiently large N the series is sign-oscillating, which
is expected from the large N solution of the sigma model. However, for N=3 and
N=4 the series are sign positive.
