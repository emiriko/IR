We present an exact relationship between the entropy production and the
distinguishability of a process from its time-reverse, quantified by the
relative entropy between forward and backward states. The relationship is shown
to remain valid for a wide family of initial conditions, such as canonical,
constrained canonical, multi-canonical and grand canonical distributions, as
well as both for classical and quantum systems.
