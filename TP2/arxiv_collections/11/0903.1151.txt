We studied magnetization dynamics of a geometrically confined domain wall
under dc current by solving simultaneously the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation
and diffusion equation for spin accumulation. We showed that the oscillation
motion of the domain wall is driven by the spin-transfer torque and the dc
current is converted to the ac voltage signal. The results means that the
geometrically confined domain wall is applicable as a source of microwave
oscillator.
