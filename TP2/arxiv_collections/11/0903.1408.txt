We reconsider the role that the possible detection of lepton flavour
violating (LFV) decays of supersymmetric particles at the Large Hadron Collider
(LHC) can play in helping reconstruct the underlying neutrino mass generation
mechanism within the simplest high-scale minimal supergravity (mSUGRA) seesaw
schemes. We study in detail the LFV scalar tau decays at the LHC, assuming that
the observed neutrino masses arise either through the pure type-I or the
simpler type-II seesaw mechanism. We perform a scan over the mSUGRA parameter
space in order to identify regions where lepton flavour violating decays of
$\chi^0_2$ can be maximized, while respecting current low-energy constraints,
such as those coming from the bounds on Br($\mu \to e \gamma$). We estimate the
cross section for $\chi^0_2 \to \chi^0_1 + \tau + \mu $. Though insufficient
for a full reconstruction of the seesaw, the search for LFV decays of
supersymmetric states at the LHC brings complementary information to that
coming from low energy neutrino oscillation experiments and LFV searches.
