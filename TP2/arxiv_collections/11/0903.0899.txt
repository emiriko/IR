We explain the relationship between Majorana neutrinos, which are their own
antiparticles, and Majorana neutrino masses. We point out that Majorana masses
would make the neutrinos very distinctive particles, and explain why many
theorists strongly suspect that neutrinos do have Majorana masses. The
promising approach to confirming this suspicion is to seek neutrinoless double
beta decay. We introduce a toy model that illustrates why this decay requires
nonzero neutrino masses, even when there are both right-handed and left-handed
weak currents.
