We continue the study of boundary operators in the dense O(n) model on the
random lattice. The conformal dimension of boundary operators inserted between
two JS boundaries of different weight is derived from the matrix model
description. Our results are in agreement with the regular lattice findings. A
connection is made between the loop equations in the continuum limit and the
shift relations of boundary Liouville 3-points functions obtained from Boundary
Ground Ring approach.
