Chemically peculiar (CP) stars are unique natural laboratories for
investigation of the microscopic diffusion processes of chemical elements. The
element segregation under the influence of gravity and radiation pressure leads
to the appearance of strong abundance gradients in the atmospheres of CP stars.
Consequently, the atmospheric temperature-pressure structure of these objects
could deviate significantly from the atmospheres of normal stars with
homogeneous abundances. In this study we performed a self-consistent, empirical
model atmosphere study of the brightest rapidly oscillating Ap star alpha Cir.
We account for chemical stratification in the model atmosphere calculations and
assess the importance of non-uniformed vertical element distribution on the
model structure, energy distribution and hydrogen line profiles. Based on an
iterative procedure of the chemical abundance analysis of 52 ions of 35
elements, stratification modeling of 4 elements (Si, Ca, Cr and Fe) and
subsequent re-calculations of the atmospheric structure, we derived a new model
atmosphere of alpha Cir, which is consistent with the inferred atmospheric
chemistry of the star. We find Teff=7500 K, logg=4.1, and demonstrate that
chemical stratification has a noticeable impact on the model structure and
modifies the formation of the hydrogen Balmer lines. Our spectroscopically
determined Teff of alpha Cir agrees with the fundamental effective temperature
of this star. This shows that temperatures inferred in detailed spectroscopic
analyses of cool magnetic CP stars are not affected by a large systematic bias.
