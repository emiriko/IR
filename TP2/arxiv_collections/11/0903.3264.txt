We present a formalism for spatial averaging in cosmology applicable to
general spacetimes and coordinates, and allowing the easy incorporation of a
wide variety of matter sources. We apply this formalism to a
Friedmann-LeMaitre-Robertson-Walker universe perturbed to second-order and
present the corrections to the background in an unfixed gauge. We then present
the corrections that arise in uniform curvature and conformal Newtonian gauges.
