This paper presents a preliminary analysis of the turbulence spectrum of the
solar wind in the near-Sun region R < 50 Rs, obtained from interplanetary
scintillation measurements with the Ooty Radio Telescope at 327 MHz. The
results clearly show that the scintillation is dominated by density
irregularities of size about 100 - 500 km. The scintillation at the small-scale
side of the spectrum, although significantly less in magnitude, has a flatter
spectrum than the larger-scale dominant part. Furthermore, the spectral power
contained in the flatter portion rapidly increases closer to the Sun. These
results on the turbulence spectrum for R < 50 Rs quantify the evidence for
radial evolution of the small-scale fluctuations (</= 50 km) generated by
Alfven waves.
