We investigate the QCD effects in the production of neutral Higgs bosons via
bottom quark fusion in both the standard model and the minimal supersymmetric
standard model at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. We include the
next-to-leading order (NLO) QCD corrections (including supersymmetric QCD) and
the threshold resummation effects. We use the soft-collinear effective theory
to resum the large logarithms near threshold from soft gluon emission. Our
results show that the resummation effects can enhance the total cross sections
by about 5% compared with the NLO results.
