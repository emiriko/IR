Topologically, a compact Riemann surface $X$ of genus $g$ is a $g$-holed
torus (a sphere with $g$ handles). This paper is an introduction to the theory
of compact Riemann surfaces and algebraic curves. It presents the basic ideas
and properties as an expository essay, explores some of their numerous
consequences and gives a concise account of the elementary aspects of different
viewpoints in curve theory. We discuss and prove most intuitively some
geometric-topological aspects of the algebraic functions and the associated
Riemann surfaces. Abelian and normalized differentials, Riemann's bilinear
relations and the period matrix for $X$ are defined and some consequences
drawn. The space of holomorphic 1-forms on $X$ has dimension $g$ as a complex
vector space. Fundamental results on divisors on compact Riemann surfaces are
stated and proved. The Riemann-Roch theorem is of utmost importance in the
algebraic geometric theory of compact Riemann surfaces. It tells us how many
linearly independent meromorphic functions there are having certain
restrictions on their poles. We present a simple direct proof of this theorem
and explore some of its numerous consequences. We also give an analytic proof
of the Riemann-Hurwitz formula. As an application, we compute the genus of some
interesting algebraic curves. Abel's theorem classifies divisors by their
images in the jacobian. The Jacobi inversion problem askes whether we can find
a divisor that is the preimage for an arbitrary point in the jacobian. In the
first appendix, we introduced intuitively and explicitly elliptic and
hyperelliptic Riemann surfaces. In the second appendix, we study some results
of resultant and discriminant as needed in the paper.
