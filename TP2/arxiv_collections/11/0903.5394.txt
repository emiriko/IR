Wormlike micelle solutions are submitted to small-amplitude oscillatory shear
superimposed to steady shear in the shear banding regime. By imposing a shear
oscillation, the interface between high- and low-shear regions oscillates in
time. A two-fluid semi-phenomenological model is proposed for superposition
rheology in the shear banding regime, which allows us to extract a
characteristic velocity for the interface dynamics from experiments involving
only a standard rheometer. Estimates of the stress diffusion coefficient ${\cal
D}$ can also be inferred from such superposition experiments. The validity of
our model is confirmed by directly recording the interface displacement using
ultrasonic velocimetry.
