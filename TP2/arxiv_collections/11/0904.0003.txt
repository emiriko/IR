We describe a fault-tolerant memory for an error-corrected logical qubit
based on silicon double quantum dot physical qubits. Our design accounts for
constraints imposed by supporting classical electronics. A significant
consequence of the constraints is to add error-prone idle steps for the
physical qubits. Even using a schedule with provably minimum idle time, for our
noise model and choice of error-correction code, we find that these additional
idles negate any benefits of error correction. Using additional qubit
operations, we can greatly suppress idle-induced errors, making error
correction beneficial, provided the qubit operations achieve an error rate less
than $2 \times 10^{-5}$. We discuss other consequences of these constraints
such as error-correction code choice and physical qubit operation speed. While
our analysis is specific to this memory architecture, the methods we develop
are general enough to apply to other architectures as well.
