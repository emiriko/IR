Certain quantum topological invariants of three manifolds can be written in
the form of the Gaussian sum. It is shown that such topological invariants can
be approximated efficiently by a quantum computer. The invariants discussed
here are obtained as a partition function of the gauge theory on three
manifolds with various gauge groups. Our algorithms are applicable to Abelian
and finite gauge groups and to some classes of non-Abelian gauge groups. These
invariants can be directly estimated by the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
technique used for evaluating the Gaussian sum.
