We introduce a generalized Wigner-Yanase skew information and then derive the
trace inequality related to the uncertainty relation. This inequality is a
non-trivial generalization of the uncertainty relation derived by S.Luo for the
quantum uncertainty quantity excluding the classical mixure. In addition,
several trace inequalities on our generalized Wigner-Yanase skew information
are argued.
