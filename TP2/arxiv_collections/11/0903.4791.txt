Most of the inspiralling compact binaries are expected to be circularized by
the time their gravitational-wave signals enter the frequency band of
ground-based detectors such as LIGO or VIRGO. However, it is not excluded that
some of these binaries might still possess a significant eccentricity at a few
tens of hertz. Despite this possibility, current search pipelines based on
matched filtering techniques consider only non-eccentric templates. The effect
of such an approximation on the loss of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) has been
investigated by Martel and Poisson (1999 Phys. Rev. D 60 124008) in the context
of initial LIGO detector. They ascertained that non-eccentric templates will be
successful at detecting eccentric signals. We revisit their work by
incorporating current and future ground-based detectors and precisely quantify
the exact loss of SNR. In order to be more faithful to an actual search, we
maximized the SNR over a template bank, whose minimal match is set to 95%.
