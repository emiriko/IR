Structure and bulk inversion asymmetry in doped (001)-grown GaAs quantum
wells is investigated by applying the magnetic field induced photogalvanic
effect. We demonstrate that the structure inversion asymmetry (SIA) can be
tailored by variation of the delta-doping layer position. Symmetrically-doped
structures exhibit a substantial SIA due to impurity segregation during the
growth process. Tuning the SIA by the delta-doping position we grow samples
with almost equal degrees of structure and bulk inversion asymmetry.
