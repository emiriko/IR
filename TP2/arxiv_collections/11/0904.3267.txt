Critical behaviors of sheared dense and frictionless granular materials in
the vicinity of the jamming transition are numerically investigated. From the
extensive molecular dynamics simulation, we verify the validity of the scaling
theory near the jamming transition proposed by Otsuki and Hayakawa (Prog.
Theor. Phys., 121, 647 (2009)). We also clarify the critical behaviors of the
shear viscosity and the pair correlation function based on both a phenomenology
and the simulation.
