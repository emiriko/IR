Multi-wavelength studies of solar analogs (G0-5 V stars) with ages from ~50
Myr to 9 Gyr have been carried out as part of the "Sun in Time" program for
nearly 20 yrs. From these studies it is inferred that the young (ZAMS) Sun was
rotating more than 10x faster than today. As a consequence, young solar-type
stars and the early Sun have vigorous magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) dynamos and
correspondingly strong coronal X-ray and transition region / chromospheric
FUV-UV emissions. To ensure continuity and homogeneity for this program, we use
a restricted sample of G0-5 V stars with masses, radii, T(eff), and internal
structure (i.e. outer convective zones) closely matching those of the Sun. From
these analogs we have determined reliable rotation-age-activity relations and
X-ray - UV (XUV) spectral irradiances for the Sun (or any solar-type star) over
time. These XUV irradiance measures serve as input data for investigating the
photo-ionization and photo-chemical effects of the young, active Sun on the
paleo-planetary atmospheres and environments of solar system planets. These
measures are also important to study the effects of these high energy emissions
on the numerous exoplanets hosted by solar-type stars of different ages.
Recently we have extended the study to include lower mass, main-sequence
(dwarf) dK and dM stars to determine relationships among their rotation
spin-down rates and coronal and chromospheric emissions as a function of mass
and age. From rotation-age-activity relations we can determine reliable ages
for main-sequence G, K, M field stars and, subsequently, their hosted planets.
Also inferred are the present and the past XUV irradiance and plasma flux
exposures that these planets have endured and the suitability of the hosted
planets to develop and sustain life.
