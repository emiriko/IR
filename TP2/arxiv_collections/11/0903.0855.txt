We have analyzed the double-lined eclipsing binary system
OGLE-051019.64-685812.3 in the LMC which consists of two G4 giant components
with very similar effective temperatures. A detailed analysis of the OGLE
I-band light curve of the system, radial velocity curves for both components
derived from high-resolution spectra, and near-infrared magnitudes of the
binary system measured outside the eclipses has allowed us to obtain an
accurate orbit solution for this eclipsing binary, and its fundamental physical
parameters. Using a surface brightness-(V-K) color relation for giant stars we
have calculated the distance to the system and obtain a true distance modulus
of 18.50 mag, with an estimated total uncertainty of ~ 3 %. More similar
eclipsing binary systems in the LMC which we have discovered and for which we
are currently obtaining the relevant data will allow us to better check on the
systematics of the method and eventually provide a distance determination to
the LMC accurate to 1 percent, so much needed for the calibration of the
distance scale.
