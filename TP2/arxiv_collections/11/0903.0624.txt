We perform a search for neutrinos coincident with GRB 080319B, the brightest
GRB observed to date, in a +/- 1,000 s window. No statistically significant
coincidences were observed and we thereby obtain an upper limit on the fluence
of neutrino-induced muons from this source. From this we apply reasonable
assumptions to derive a limit on neutrino fluence from the GRB.
