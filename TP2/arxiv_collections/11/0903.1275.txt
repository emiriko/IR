Although the existence of a cause and effect relationship between emotions
and Psychosomatic Illnesses (manifestation of organic diseases produced by
emotional problems) is an unquestionable fact, yet it remains to be explained
the mechanism by which an emotion affects the cure or worsening of an illness.
In this paper we will examine some articles written by doctors and
psychologists which confirm the Prevention Effect (or even cure) of such
illnesses, and hypothesize that this cause and effect relationship is mediated
by a substance, D (+) - adrenaline, which is one of the enantiomers [1] of the
adrenaline molecule.
