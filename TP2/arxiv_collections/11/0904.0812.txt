The PAMELA and ATIC collaborations have recently reported an excess in the
cosmic ray positron and electron fluxes. These lepton anomalies might be
related to cold dark matter (CDM) particles annihilating within a nearby dark
matter clump. We outline regions of the parameter space for both the dark
matter subhalo and particle model, where data from the different experiments
are reproduced. We then confront this interpretation of the data with the
results of the cosmological N-body simulation Via Lactea II. Having a sizable
clump (Vmax = 9km/s) at a distance of only 1.2 kpc could explain the PAMELA
excess, but such a configuration has a probability of only 0.37 percent.
Reproducing also the ATIC bump would require a very large, nearby subhalo,
which is extremely unlikely (p~3.10^-5). In either case, we predict Fermi will
detect the gamma-ray emission from the subhalo. We conclude that under
canonical assumptions, the cosmic ray lepton anomalies are unlikely to
originate from a nearby CDM subhalo.
