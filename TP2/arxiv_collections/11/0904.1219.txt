The one-loop renormalizability of the electroweak sector of the Standard
Model Extension with Lorentz violation is studied. Functional determinants are
used to calculate the one-loop contributions of the higgs, gauge bosons and
fermions to the one-loop effective action. The results are consistent with
multiplicative renormalization of the SME coupling constants. Conventional
Electroweak symmetry breaking is effectively unaltered relative to the standard
case as the renormalized SME parameters are sufficient to absorb all infinite
contributions.
