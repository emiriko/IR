Here we show, with simultaneous transport and photoemission measurements,
that the graphene terminated SiC(0001) surface undergoes a metal-insulator
transition (MIT) upon dosingwith small amounts of atomic hydrogen. We find the
room temperature resistance increases by about 4 orders of magnitude, a
transition accompanied by anomalies in the momentum-resolved spectral function
including a non-Fermi Liquid behaviour and a breakdown of the quasiparticle
picture. These effects are discussed in terms of a possible transition to a
strongly (Anderson) localized ground state.
