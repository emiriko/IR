A great deal of progress has been recently made in the study of holography
for non-conformal branes. Considering the near-horizon limit of backgrounds
generated by such branes, we discuss the holographic renormalization of probe
D-branes in these geometries. More specifically, we discuss in some detail
systems with a codimension-one defect. For this class of systems, the mode
which describes the probe branes wrapping a maximal 2-sphere in the transverse
space behaves like a free massive scalar propagating in a higher-dimensional
(asymptotically) AdS_{q+1}-space. The counterterms needed are then the ones of
a free massive scalar in asymptotically AdS_{q+1}. The original problem can be
recovered by compactifying the AdS-space on a torus and finally performing the
analytic continuation of q to the value of interest, which can be fractional.
We compute the one-point correlator for the operator dual to the embedding
function. We finally comment on holographic renormalization in the more general
cases of codimension-k defects (k=0, 1, 2). In all the cases the embedding
function exhibits the behaviour of a free massive scalar in an AdS-space and,
therefore, the procedure outlined before can be straightforwardly applied. Our
analysis completes the discussion of holographic renormalization of probe
D-branes started by Karch, O'Bannon and Skenderis.
