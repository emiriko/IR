Direct modeling of porous materials under shock is a complex issue. We
investigate such a system via the newly developed material-point method. The
effects of shock strength and porosity size are the main concerns. For the same
porosity, the effects of mean-void-size are checked. It is found that, local
turbulence mixing and volume dissipation are two important mechanisms for
transformation of kinetic energy to heat. When the porosity is very small, the
shocked portion may arrive at a dynamical steady state; the voids in the
downstream portion reflect back rarefactive waves and result in slight
oscillations of mean density and pressure; for the same value of porosity, a
larger mean-void-size makes a higher mean temperature. When the porosity
becomes large, hydrodynamic quantities vary with time during the whole
shock-loading procedure: after the initial stage, the mean density and pressure
decrease, but the temperature increases with a higher rate. The distributions
of local density, pressure, temperature and particle-velocity are generally
non-Gaussian and vary with time. The changing rates depend on the porosity
value, mean-void-size and shock strength. The stronger the loaded shock, the
stronger the porosity effects. This work provides a supplement to experiments
for the very quick procedures and reveals more fundamental mechanisms in energy
and momentum transportation.
