We demonstrate generation of 10-20 MeV/u ions with a compact 4 TW laser using
a gas target mixed with submicron clusters, corresponding to tenfold increase
in the ion energies compared to previous experiments with solid targets. It is
inferred that the high energy ions are generated due to formation of a strong
dipole vortex structure. The demonstrated method has a potential to construct
compact and high repetition rate ion sources for hadron therapy and other
applications.
