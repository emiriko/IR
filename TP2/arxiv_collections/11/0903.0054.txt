The paper presents a description of some point of view of different authors
related to the failures and exceptions that appear in workflows, as a direct
consequence of unavailability of resources involved in the workflow. Each of
these interpretations is typical for a certain situation, depending on the
authors' interpretation of failures and exceptions in workflows modeling real
dynamical systems.
