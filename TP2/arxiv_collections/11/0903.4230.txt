The mechanical first law (MFL) of black hole spacetimes is a geometrical
relation which relates variations of mass parameter and horizon area. While it
is well known that the MFL of asymptotic flat black hole is equivalent to its
thermodynamical first law, however we do not know the detail of MFL of black
hole spacetimes with cosmological constant which possess black hole and
cosmological event horizons. Then this paper aims to formulate an MFL of the
two-horizon spacetimes. For this purpose, we try to include the effects of two
horizons in the MFL. To do so, we make use of the Iyer-Wald formalism and
extend it to regard the mass parameter and the cosmological constant as two
independent variables which make it possible to treat the two horizons on the
same footing. Our extended Iyer-Wald formalism preserves the existence of
conserved Noether current and its associated Noether charge, and gives the
abstract form of MFL of black hole spacetimes with cosmological constant. Then,
as a representative application of that formalism, we derive the MFL of
Schwarzschild-de Sitter (SdS) spacetime. Our MFL of SdS spacetime relates the
variations of three quantities; the mass parameter, the total area of two
horizons and the volume enclosed by two horizons. If our MFL is regarded as a
thermodynamical first law of SdS spacetime, it offers a thermodynamically
consistent description of SdS black hole evaporation process: The mass
decreases while the volume and the entropy increase. In our suggestion, the
generalized second law is not needed to ensure the second law of SdS
thermodynamics for its evaporation process.
