Lagrangian properties obtained from a Particle Tracking Velocimetry
experiment in a turbulent flow at intermediate Reynolds number are presented.
Accurate sampling of particle trajectories is essential in order to obtain the
Lagrangian structure functions and to measure intermittency at small temporal
scales. The finiteness of the measurement volume can bias the results
significantly. We present a robust way to overcome this obstacle. Despite no
fully developed inertial range we observe strong intermittency at the scale of
dissipation. The multifractal model is only partially able to reproduce the
results.
