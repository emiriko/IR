We present 21-cm observations of four Galactic globular clusters, as part of
the on-going GALFA-HI Survey at Arecibo. We discovered a peculiar HI cloud in
the vicinity of the distant (109 kpc) cluster Pal 4, and discuss its properties
and likelihood of association with the cluster. We conclude that an association
of the HI cloud and Pal 4 is possible, but that a chance coincidence between
Pal 4 and a nearby compact high-velocity cloud cannot be ruled out altogether.
New, more stringent upper limits were derived for the other three clusters: M
3, NGC 5466, and Pal 13. We briefly discuss the fate of globular cluster gas
and the interaction of compact clouds with the Galactic Halo gas.
