We point out that the light radion phi in a recently proposed Warped
Top-Condensation Model, can provide distinct signatures in b -> s phi, where
the on-shell phi can decay with displaced vertices. We find that some of the
parameter space of these models is constrained by B-meson and astrophysical
data. Future B-decay measurements can lead to the discovery of the WTCM.
