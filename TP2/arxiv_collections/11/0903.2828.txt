In this paper we have analyzed IUE high resolution spectra of the central
star (BD+602522) of the Bubble nebula. We discuss velocities of the different
regions along the line of sight to the bubble. We find that the Bubble Nebula
is younger (by a factor of 100) than the exciting star suggesting that either
the bubble is expanding into an inhomogenuous interstellar medium or that the
mechanics of the stellar wind are not fully understood.
