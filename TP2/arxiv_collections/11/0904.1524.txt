We study the LHC phenomenology of a couple of mass-degenerate heavy new gauge
bosons with the quantum numbers of the Z and photon. We give a leading-order
estimate of the number of events expected in Drell-Yan processes in terms of
the parameters of the model (mass and coupling) and of the LHC machine
specifications (luminosity and energy). We consider the feasibility of
measuring a forward-backward asymmetry for various choices of the parameters
and estimate the potential reach. We comment on how the results may affect
future collider design and the results for a specific model of electro-weak
symmetry breaking by way of example.
