We investigate the combined effect of the repulsive vector interaction and
the positive electric chemical potential on the chiral phase transition by
considering neutral color superconductivity (CSC). The chiral condensate,
diquark condensate and quark number densities are solved in both two-flavor and
two-plus-one-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio(NJL) models with the so called
Kobayashi-Maskawa-'t Hooft term under the charge neutrality constraint. We
demonstrate that multiple chiral critical-point structures always exist in the
NJL model within the self-consistent mean-field approximation and the number of
chiral critical points can vary from zero to four, which is dependent on the
magnitudes of vector interaction and the diquark coupling. The difference
between the dynamical chemical potentials induced by vector interaction for u
and d quarks can effectively reduce the Fermi sphere disparity between the two
flavors of diquark paring. Thus the vector interaction works to significantly
suppress the unstable region associated with chromomagnetic instability in the
phase of neutral asymmetric homogenous CSC.
