In an accompanying paper [arXiv:0903.0011v1] we have studied the equilibrium
properties of vortices in a chiral quasi-twodimensional triplet
superfluid/superconductor. Here we extend our studies to include the dynamical
response of a vortex core in a chiral triplet superconductor to an external
a.c. electromagnetic field. We consider in particular the response of a doubly
quantized vortex with a homogeneous core in the time-reversed phase. The
external frequencies are assumed to be comparable in magnitude to the
superconducting gap frequency, such that the vortex motion is non-stationary
but can be treated by linear response theory. We include broadening of the
vortex core bound states due to impurity scattering and consider the
intermediate clean regime, with a broadening comparable to or larger than the
quantized energy level spacing. The response of the order parameter, impurity
self energy, induced fields and currents are obtained by a self-consistent
calculation of the distribution functions and the excitation spectrum. Using
these results we obtain the self-consistent dynamically induced charge
distribution in the vicinity of the core. This charge density is related to the
nonequilibrium response of the bound states and order parameter collective
mode, and dominates the electromagnetic response of the vortex core.
