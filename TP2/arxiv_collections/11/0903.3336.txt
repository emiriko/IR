Precise control over the position of a single quantum object is important for
many experiments in quantum science and nanotechnology. We report on a
technique for high-accuracy positioning of individual diamond nanocrystals. The
positioning is done with a home-built nanomanipulator under real-time scanning
electron imaging, yielding an accuracy of a few nanometers. This technique is
applied to pick up, move and position a single NV defect center contained in a
diamond nanocrystal. We verify that the unique optical and spin properties of
the NV center are conserved by the positioning process.
