We show that (n,2^n) additive codes over GF(4) can be represented as directed
graphs. This generalizes earlier results on self-dual additive codes over
GF(4), which correspond to undirected graphs. Graph representation reduces the
complexity of code classification, and enables us to classify additive (n,2^n)
codes over GF(4) of length up to 7. From this we also derive classifications of
isodual and formally self-dual codes. We introduce new constructions of
circulant and bordered circulant directed graph codes, and show that these
codes will always be isodual. A computer search of all such codes of length up
to 26 reveals that these constructions produce many codes of high minimum
distance. In particular, we find new near-extremal formally self-dual codes of
length 11 and 13, and isodual codes of length 24, 25, and 26 with better
minimum distance than the best known self-dual codes.
