We consider a quantum quench in a system of free bosons, starting from a
thermal initial state. As in the case where the system is initially in the
ground state, any finite subsystem eventually reaches a stationary thermal
state with a momentum-dependent effective temperature. We find that this can,
in some cases, even be lower than the initial temperature. We also study
lattice effects and discuss more general types of quenches.
