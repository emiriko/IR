In this work we study the Lepton Flavour Violating semileptonic tau --> mu
f0(980) decay within the context of SUSY-Seesaw Models, where the MSSM spectrum
is extended by three right handed neutrinos and their SUSY partners, and where
the seesaw mechanism is used to generate the neutrino masses.
  We estimate its decay rate when it proceeds via the Higgs mediated channel
tau --> mu H* --> mu f0(980), where H refers to the CP-even MSSM Higgs bosons
h^0 and H^0, and the Lepton Flavour Violating tau mu H vertex is radiatively
generated via SUSY loops. In order to describe the f0(980) meson we follow the
guidelines from chiral constraints. As an implication of our computation, we
explore the sensitivity to the Higgs sector in this decay and compare it with
other LFV tau decay channels. The confrontation of our predictions for BR(tau
--> mu f0(980)) with its very competitive present experimental bound leads us
to extract some interesting restrictions on the most relevant model parameters,
particularly, tanbeta and m_{H^0}.
