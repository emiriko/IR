We present a theoretical study of the magnetic properties of
dicyclopentadienyl metallocene and phthalocyanine molecules, that contain the
transition metal atoms M = Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ir, Pt and Au. Our most
important prediction is that gold and copper molecules are magnetic. We find
that the magnetism of these molecules is fairly unconventional: the gold atom
itself is weakly magnetic or even non-magnetic. Its role is rather to induce
magnetism in the surrounding carbon and nitrogen atoms, producing a sort of
spin density wave.
