An overview is given of various dark matter candidates. Among the many
suggestions given in the literature, axions, inert Higgs doublet, sterile
neutrinos, supersymmetric particles and Kaluza-Klein particles are discussed.
The situation has recently become very interesting with new results on
antimatter in the cosmic rays having dark matter as one of the leading possible
explanations. Problems of this explanation and possible solutions are
discussed, and the importance of new measurements is emphasized. If the
explanation is indeed dark matter, a whole new field of physics, with unusual
although not impossible mass and interaction properties may soon open itself to
discovery.
