Motivated by control-affine systems in optimal control theory, we introduce
the notion of a point-affine distribution on a manifold X - i.e., an affine
distribution F together with a distinguished vector field contained in F. We
compute local invariants for point-affine distributions of constant type when
dim(X)=n, rank(F)=n-1, and when dim(X)=3, rank(F)=1. Unlike linear
distributions, which are characterized by integer-valued invariants - namely,
the rank and growth vector - when dim(X)<=4, we find local invariants depending
on arbitrary functions even for rank 1 point-affine distributions on manifolds
of dimension 2.
