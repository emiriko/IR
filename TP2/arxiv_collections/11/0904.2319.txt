NN Ser is a non mass-transferring pre-cataclysmic variable containing a white
dwarf with a mass of $\sim 0.5 M_{\odot}$ and an M dwarf secondary star with a
mass of $\sim 0.2 M_{\odot}$. Based on the data detected by the high-speed CCD
camera ULTRACAM, it was observed that the orbital period of NN Ser is
decreasing, which may be caused by a genuine angular momentum loss or the
presence of a third body. However, neither gravitational radiation and magnetic
braking can ideally account for the period change of NN Ser. In this Letter, we
attempt to examine a feasible mechanism which can drain the angular momentum
from NN Ser. We propose that a fossil circumbinary disk (CB disk) around the
binary may have been established at the end of the common envelope phase, and
the tidal torques caused by the gravitational interaction between the disk and
the binary can efficiently extract the orbital angular momentum from the
system. We find that only if M dwarf has an ultra-high wind loss rates of $\sim
10^{-10} M_{\odot} \rm yr^{-1}$, and a large fraction ($\delta\sim 10 %$) of
wind loss is fed into the CB disk, the loss rates of angular momentum via the
CB disk can interpret the period change observed in NN Ser. Such a wind loss
rate and $\delta$-value seem to be incredible. Hence it seems that the presence
of a third body in a long orbit around the binary might account for the
changing period of NN Ser.
