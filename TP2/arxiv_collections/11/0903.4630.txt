We construct the generating functional for the light-cone superfield
amplitudes in a chiral momentum superspace. It generates the n-point particle
amplitudes which on shell are equivalent to the covariant ones. Based on the
action depending on unconstrained light-cone chiral scalar superfield, this
functional provides a regular d=4 QFT path integral derivation of the Nair-type
amplitude constructions.
  By performing a Fourier transform into the light-cone chiral coordinate
superspace we find that the quantum corrections to the superfield amplitudes
with n legs are non-local in transverse directions for the diagrams with the
number of loops smaller than n(n-1)/2 +1. This suggests the reason why UV
infinities, which are proportional to local vertices, cannot appear at least
before 7 loops in the light-cone supergraph computations. By combining the E7
symmetry with the supersymmetric recursion relations we argue that the
light-cone supergraphs predict all loop finiteness of d=4 N=8 supergravity.
