This paper is concerned with complex macroscopic behaviour arising in
many-body systems through the combinations of competitive interactions and
disorder, even with simple ingredients at the microscopic level. It attempts to
indicate and illustrate the richness that has arisen, in conceptual
understanding, in methodology and in application, across a large range of
scientific disciplines, together with a hint of some of the further
opportunities that remain to be tapped. In doing so it takes the perspective of
physics and tries to show, albeit rather briefly, how physics has contributed
and been stimulated.
