We present a detailed approach for making use of two new computer hardware
architectures -- CBEA and CUDA -- for accelerating a scientific data-analysis
application (Einstein@Home). Our results suggest that both the architectures
suit the application quite well and the achievable performance in the same
software developmental time-frame, is nearly identical.
