First principles FLAPW- GGA calculations have been performed to predict the
structural, electronic, cohesive and magnetic properties for hexagonal WC doped
with all 3d metals. The optimized lattice parameters, density of states,
cohesive and formation energies have been obtained and analyzed for ternary
solid solutions with nominal compositions W0.875M0.125C (where M = Sc, Ti, ...,
Ni, Cu). In addition, the magnetic properties of these solid solutions have
been examined, and magnetization has been established for W0.875Co0.125C.
