We present a geometric optics theory for the transport of quantum particles
(or classical waves) in a chiral and dissipative periodic crystal subject to
slowly varying perturbations in space and time. Taking account of some
properties of particles and media neglected in previous theory, we find
important additional terms in the equations of motion of particles. The
(energy) current density field, which traces the geometric optics rays, is not
only governed by the Bloch band energy dispersion but also involves there
additional fields. These are the angular momentum of the particle, the
dissipation dipole density, and various geometric gauge fields in the extended
phase space spanned by space-time and its reciprocal, momentum and frequency.
For simplicity, the theory is presented using light propagation in photonic
crystals.
