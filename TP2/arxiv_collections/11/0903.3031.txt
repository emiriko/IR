The recent Fermi detection of the globular cluster (GC) 47 Tucanae
highlighted the importance of modeling collective gamma-ray emission of
millisecond pulsars (MSPs) in GCs. Steady flux from such populations is also
expected in the very high energy (VHE) domain covered by ground-based Cherenkov
telescopes. We present pulsed curvature radiation (CR) as well as unpulsed
inverse Compton (IC) calculations for an ensemble of MSPs in the GCs 47 Tucanae
and Terzan 5. We demonstrate that the CR from these GCs should be easily
detectable for Fermi, while constraints on the total number of MSPs and the
nebular B-field may be derived using the IC flux components.
