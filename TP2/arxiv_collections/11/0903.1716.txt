A method for computing lower bounds on capacities of 2-dimensional
constraints having a symmetric presentation in either the horizontal or the
vertical direction is presented. The method is a generalization of the method
of Calkin and Wilf (SIAM J. Discrete Math., 1998). Previous best lower bounds
on capacities of certain constraints are improved using the method. It is also
shown how this method, as well as their method for computing upper bounds on
the capacity, can be applied to constraints which are not of finite-type.
Additionally, capacities of 2 families of multi-dimensional constraints are
given exactly.
