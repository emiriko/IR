We report the measurement of inelastic three-body and two-body collisional
decay rates for a two-component Fermi gas of $^6$Li, which are highly
suppressed by the Pauli exclusion principle. Our measurements are made in the
BEC-BCS crossover regime, near the two-body collisional (Feshbach) resonance.
At high temperature (energy) the data shows a dominant three-body decay
process, which is studied as a function of bias magnetic field. At low energy,
the data shows a coexistence of two-body and three-body decay processes near
and below the Feshbach resonance. Below resonance, the observed two-body
inelastic decay can arise from molecule-atom and molecule-molecule collisions.
We suggest that at and above resonance, an effective two-body decay rate arises
from collisions between atoms and correlated (Cooper) pairs that can exist at
sufficiently low temperature.
