An optical photometric and spectroscopic analysis of the slowly-evolving Type
IIn SN2007rt is presented, covering a duration of 481 days after discovery. Its
earliest spectrum, taken approximately 100 days after the explosion epoch,
indicates the presence of a dense circumstellar medium, with which the
supernova ejecta is interacting. This is supported by the slowly-evolving light
curve. A notable feature in the spectrum of SN 2007rt is the presence of a
broad He I 5875 line, not usually detected in Type IIn supernovae. This may
imply that the progenitor star has a high He/H ratio, having shed a significant
portion of its hydrogen shell via mass-loss. An intermediate resolution
spectrum reveals a narrow Halpha P-Cygni profile, the absorption component of
which has a width of 128 km/s. This slow velocity suggests that the progenitor
of SN 2007rt recently underwent mass-loss with wind speeds comparable to the
lower limits of those detected in luminous blue variables. Asymmetries in the
line profiles of H and He at early phases bears some resemblance to
double-peaked features observed in a number of Ib/c spectra. These asymmetries
may be indicative of an asymmetric or bipolar outflow or alternatively dust
formation in the fast expanding ejecta. In addition, the late time spectrum, at
over 240 days post-explosion, shows clear evidence for the presence of newly
formed dust.
