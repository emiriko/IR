A new classical solution for the Yang-Mills theory in which the Euclidean
energy plays a role of a parameter is discussed. The instanton and sphaleron
are shown to be particular examples of this more general solution. The energy
parameter for them takes on special values, which are zero and sphaleron mass
for the instanton and sphaleron, respectively. The solution is employed to
describe the tunneling process, which is accompanied by a variation of the
topological charge. A range of temperatures, where the new solution makes this
tunneling more effective than the known mechanisms based on the instanton,
caloron or sphaleron is found.
