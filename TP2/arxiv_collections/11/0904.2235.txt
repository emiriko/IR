B --> K^* \pi and B --> \rho K decays involve the same quark-level processes
as B --> \pi K. Analyzing the measurements of the former decays might be able
to shed additional light on the new-physics hints in the current B --> \pi K
data. We perform fits to B --> K^* \pi and B --> \rho K decays, and find that
the data can be accommodated within the standard model. However, this agreement
is due principally to the large errors in the data, particularly the
CP-violating asymmetries. If the errors on the B --> K^* \pi and B --> \rho K
observables can be reduced, one will have a clearer sense of whether new
physics is present in these decays.
