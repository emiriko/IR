We present a description of the public code XIM, a virtual X-ray observatory.
XIM can be used to convert hydrodynamic simulations of astrophysical objects,
such as large scale structure, galaxy clusters, groups, galaxies, supernova
remnants, and similar extended objects, into virtual X-ray observations for
direct comparison with observations and for post-processing with standard X-ray
analysis tools. By default, XIM simulates Chandra and the International X-ray
Observatory (IXO), but can accommodate any user-specified telescope parameters
and instrument responses. Examples of XIM applications include virtual Chandra
imaging of simulated X-ray cavities from AGN feedback in galaxy clusters,
kinematic mapping of cluster velocity fields (e.g., due to mergers or AGN
feedback), as well as detailed spectral modeling of multi-phase,
multi-temperature spectra from space plasmas.
