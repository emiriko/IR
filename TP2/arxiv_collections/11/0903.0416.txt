Perhaps more than other physical sciences, astronomy is frequently
statistical in nature. The objects under study are inaccessible to direct
manipulation in the laboratory, so the astronomer is restricted to observing a
few external characteristics and inferring underlying properties and physics.
Astronomy played a profound role in the historical development of statistics
from the ancient Greeks through the 19th century. But the fields drifted apart
in the 20th century as astronomy turned towards astrophysics and statistics
towards human affairs. Today we see a resurgence in astrostatistical activity
with the proliferation of survey mega-datasets and the need to link complicated
data to nonlinear astrophysical models. Several contemporary astrostatistical
challenges are outlined: heteroscedastic measurement errors, censoring and
truncation in multivariate databases; time series analysis of variable objects
including dynamical models of extrasolar planetary systems; treatments of faint
sources and other Poisson processes; the anisotropic spatial point process of
galaxy clustering; and model fitting and selection for the cosmic microwave
background.
