Models for the evolution of dust are used to show that the observed trend of
the abundance of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with metallicity is
the result of the delayed injection of carbon dust that formed in low mass
asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars into the interstellar medium. We also use
our dust evolution models to examine the origin of dust at redshifts > 6, when
only supernovae and their remnants could have been, respectively, their sources
of production and destruction. Unless an average supernova (or its progenitor)
produces between 0.1 and 1 Msun of dust, alternative sources will need to be
invoked to account for the massive amount of dust observed at these redshifts.
