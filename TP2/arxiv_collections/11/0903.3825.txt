We show the existence of a high interrelation between the different loops
that may appear in a DNA segment. Conformational changes in a chain segment
caused by the formation of a particular loop may either promote or prevent the
appearance of another. The underlying loop selection mechanism is analyzed by
means of a Hamiltonian model from which the looping free energy and the
corresponding repression level can be computed. We show significant differences
between the probability of single and multiple loop formation. The consequences
that these collective effects might have on gene regulation processes are
outlined.
