We use our recently developed algebraic methods for the calculation of the
heat kernel on homogeneous bundles over symmetric spaces to evaluate the
non-perturbative low-energy effective action in quantum general relativity and
Yang-Mills gauge theory in curved space. We obtain an exact integral
repesentation for the effective action that generates all terms in the standard
asymptotic epxansion of the effective action without derivatives of the
curvatures effectively summing up the whole infinite subseries of all quantum
corrections with low momenta.
