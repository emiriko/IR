We present an optomechanical displacement transducer, that relies on three
cavity modes parametrically coupled to a mechanical oscillator and whose
frequency spacing matches the mechanical resonance frequency. The additional
resonances allow to reach the standard quantum limit at substantially lower
input power (compared to the case of only one resonance), as both, sensitivity
and quantum backaction are enhanced. Furthermore, it is shown that in the case
of multiple cavity modes, coupling between the modes is induced via reservoir
interaction, e.g., enabling quantum backaction noise cancellation. Experimental
implementation of the schemes is discussed in both the optical and microwave
domain.
