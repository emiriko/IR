We present 0.3 arcsec resolution observations of the disk around GM Aurigae
with the Submillimeter Array (SMA) at a wavelength of 860 um and with the
Plateau de Bure Interferometer at a wavelength of 1.3 mm. These observations
probe the distribution of disk material on spatial scales commensurate with the
size of the inner hole predicted by models of the spectral energy distribution.
The data clearly indicate a sharp decrease in millimeter optical depth at the
disk center, consistent with a deficit of material at distances less than ~20
AU from the star. We refine the accretion disk model of Calvet et al. (2005)
based on the unresolved spectral energy distribution (SED) and demonstrate that
it reproduces well the spatially resolved millimeter continuum data at both
available wavelengths. We also present complementary SMA observations of CO
J=3-2 and J=2-1 emission from the disk at 2" resolution. The observed CO
morphology is consistent with the continuum model prediction, with two
significant deviations: (1) the emission displays a larger CO J=3-2/J=2-1 line
ratio than predicted, which may indicate additional heating of gas in the upper
disk layers; and (2) the position angle of the kinematic rotation pattern
differs by 11 +/- 2 degrees from that measured at smaller scales from the dust
continuum, which may indicate the presence of a warp. We note that
photoevaporation, grain growth, and binarity are unlikely mechanisms for
inducing the observed sharp decrease in opacity or surface density at the disk
center. The inner hole plausibly results from the dynamical influence of a
planet on the disk material. Warping induced by a planet could also potentially
explain the difference in position angle between the continuum and CO data
sets.
