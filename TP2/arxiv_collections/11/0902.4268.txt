In this paper we consider three-dimensional quantum q-oscillator field theory
without spectral parameters. We construct an essentially big set of eigenstates
of evolution with unity eigenvalue of discrete time evolution operator. All
these eigenstates belong to a subspace of total Hilbert space where an action
of evolution operator can be identified with quantized discrete BKP equations
(synonym Miwa equations). The key ingredients of our construction are specific
eigenstates of a single three-dimensional R-matrix. These eigenstates are
boundary states for hidden three-dimensional structures of U_q(B_n^1) and
U_q(D_n^1)$.
