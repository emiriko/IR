An intent expression system using eye robots is proposed for a mascot robot
system from a viewpoint of humatronics. The eye robot aims at providing a basic
interface method for an information terminal robot system. To achieve better
understanding of the displayed information, the importance and the degree of
certainty of the information should be communicated along with the main
content. The proposed intent expression system aims at conveying this
additional information using the eye robot system. Eye motions are represented
as the states in a pleasure-arousal space model. Changes in the model state are
calculated by fuzzy inference according to the importance and degree of
certainty of the displayed information. These changes influence the
arousal-sleep coordinates in the space that corresponds to levels of liveliness
during communication. The eye robot provides a basic interface for the mascot
robot system that is easy to be understood as an information terminal for home
environments in a humatronics society.
