Over the last few years increasing consideration has been given to the study
of Laser Guide Stars (LGS) for the measurement of the disturbance introduced by
the atmosphere in optical and near-infrared astronomical observations from the
ground. A possible method for the generation of a LGS is the excitation of the
Sodium layer in the upper atmosphere at approximately 90 km of altitude. Since
the Sodium layer is approximately 10 km thick, the artificial reference source
looks elongated, especially when observed from the edge of a large aperture.
The spot elongation strongly limits the performance of the most common
wavefront sensors. The centroiding accuracy in a Shack-Hartmann wavefront
sensor, for instance, decreases proportionally to the elongation (in a photon
noise dominated regime). To compensate for this effect a straightforward
solution is to increase the laser power, i.e. to increase the number of
detected photons per subaperture. The scope of the work presented in this paper
is twofold: an analysis of the performance of the Weighted Center of Gravity
algorithm for centroiding with elongated spots and the determination of the
required number of photons to achieve a certain average wavefront error over
the telescope aperture.
