We propose a general proximal algorithm for the inversion of ill-conditioned
matrices. This algorithm is based on a variational characterization of
pseudo-inverses. We show that a particular instance of it (with constant
regularization parameter) belongs to the class of {\sl fixed point} methods.
Convergence of the algorithm is also discussed.
