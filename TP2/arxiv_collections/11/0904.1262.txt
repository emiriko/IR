We analyze a single photon source consisting of an InAs quantum dot coupled
to a directional-emission photonic crystal (PC) cavity implemented in GaAs. On
resonance, the dot's lifetime is reduced by more than 10 times, to 45ps.
Compared to the standard three-hole defect cavity, the perturbed PC cavity
design improves the collection efficiency into an objective lens (NA=0.75) by
factor 6, and improves the coupling efficiency of the collected light into a
single mode fiber by factor 1.9. The emission frequency is determined by the
cavity mode, which is antibunched to g(2)=0.05. The cavity design also enables
efficient coupling to a higher-order cavity mode for local optical excitation
of cavity-coupled quantum dots.
