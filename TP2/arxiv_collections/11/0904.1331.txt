Using the structure of Singer cycles in general linear groups, we prove that
a conjecture of Zeng, Han and He (2007) holds in the affirmative in a special
case, and outline a plausible approach to prove it in the general case. This
conjecture is about the number of primitive $\sigma$-LFSRs of a given order
over a finite field, and it generalizes a known formula for the number of
primitive LFSRs, which, in turn, is the number of primitive polynomials of a
given degree over a finite field. Moreover, this conjecture is intimately
related to an open question of Niederreiter (1995) on the enumeration of
splitting subspaces of a given dimension.
