These are lecture notes on a recent remarkable preprint of Ein-Popa, which
simplifies the algebraic proof of the finite generation of the canonical ring
given by the team BCHM. The Ein-Popa extension result has been translated in
the analytic language by Berndson-Paun and Paun. In these notes we follow the
analytic language used in Berndson-Paun and Paun. The author of this manuscript
does not claim any originality of the main ideas and arguments which are due to
Ein-Popa, based in their turn in the ideas of Hacon-McKernan, Takayama and Siu.
