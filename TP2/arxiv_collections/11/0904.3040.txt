The GL electromagnetic (EM) modeling is used to simulate the 3D EM full wave
field propagation through cloaks. The 3D GL simulation of the EM wave field
excited by a point source outside of the cloaks has been done. The simulation
of the EM wave field from the point source excitation inside of the cloak
device is presented in this paper. By using the GL modeling simulation, we
found a phenomenon that there is no Maxwell EM wave field which is excited by
nonzero local sources inside of the single layer cloaked concealment. The
theoretical proof of the phenomenon by GL method is proposed in this paper. The
GL method is fully different from the conventional methods. The GL method has
double abilities of the theoretical analysis and numerical simulations to
research the physical process and cloak metamaterial properties that is
exhibited in this paper.
