We have performed a dynamical coupled-channels analysis of available
p(e,e'pi)N data in the region of W < 1.6 GeV and Q^2 < 1.45 (GeV/c)^2. The
channels included are gamma^* N, pi N, eta N, and pi pi N which has pi Delta,
rho N, and sigma N components. With the hadronic parameters of the model
determined in our previous investigations of pi N --> pi N, pi pi N reactions,
we have found that the available data in the considered W < 1.6 GeV region can
be fitted well by only adjusting the bare gamma^* N --> N^* helicity amplitudes
for the lowest N^* states in P33, P11, S11 and D13 partial waves. The
sensitivity of the resulting parameters to the amount of data included in the
analysis is investigated. The importance of coupled-channels effect on the
p(e,e' pi)N cross sections is demonstrated. The meson cloud effects, as
required by the unitarity conditions, on the gamma^* N --> N^* form factors are
also examined. Necessary future developments, both experimentally and
theoretically, are discussed.
