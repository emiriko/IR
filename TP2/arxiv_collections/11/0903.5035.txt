Nano-indentation of circular graphene flakes are studied by using Molecular
Dynamics simulation. We show that the theory of continuum elasticity based on
nonlinear F\"{o}pple-Hencky equations is applicable on a circular suspended
graphene flake. Our simulation results are plenty compatible to those results
calculated by the nonlinear elasticity theory. We find the force-displacement
curves in good agreement with the recent experimental measurements and conclude
they are temperature independent. In addition, we find the vibration frequency
for such a system and monitor that it behaves as a sinusoidal manner at small
circular graphene size.
