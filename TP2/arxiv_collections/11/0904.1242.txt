Sequences set is a mathematical model used in many applications. As the
number of the sequences becomes larger, single sequence set model is not
appropriate for the rapidly increasing problem sizes. For example, more and
more text processing applications separate a single big text file into multiple
files before processing. For these applications, the underline mathematical
model is multiple sequences sets (MSS). Though there is increasing use of MSS,
there is little research on how to process MSS efficiently. To process multiple
sequences sets, sequences are first distributed to different sets, and then
sequences for each set are processed. Deriving effective algorithm for MSS
processing is both interesting and challenging. In this paper, we have defined
the cost functions and performance ratio for analysis of the quality of
synthesis sequences. Based on these, the problem of Process of Multiple
Sequences Sets (PMSS) is formulated. We have first proposed two greedy
algorithms for the PMSS problem, which are based on generalization of
algorithms for single sequences set. Then based on the analysis of the
characteristics of multiple sequences sets, we have proposed the Distribution
and Deposition (DDA) algorithm and DDA* algorithm for PMSS problem. In DDA
algorithm, the sequences are first distributed to multiple sets according to
their alphabet contents; then sequences in each set are deposited by the
deposition algorithm. The DDA* algorithm differs from the DDA algorithm in that
the DDA* algorithm distributes sequences by clustering based on sequence
profiles. Experiments show that DDA and DDA* always output results with smaller
costs than other algorithms, and DDA* outperforms DDA in most instances. The
DDA and DDA* algorithms are also efficient both in time and space.
