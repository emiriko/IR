The present paper presents the carrier-acoustic phonon scattering in the
spherical and TMV viruses. We demonstrate theoretically that the absorption
rate changes in spherical and TMV viruses according to the phonon energy while
emission of phonon is limited by the hole energy. The obtained relaxation rate
is then used to calculate the conductivity and mobility of viruses. The
obtained conductivity for spherical and TMV viruses suggest that the TMV virus
is more conducting and therefore may be a good candidate for the connector or
wire to be used in the nanoelectronics. The value of resistance obtained for
TMV virus is lower than the earlier reported resistance of DNA.
