This paper presents an experimental and numerical study of the impact of
various additives on the oxidation of a typical automotive surrogate fuel
blend, i.e. n-heptane and toluene. It examines the impact of engine re-cycled
exhaust has compounds on the control of an Homogeneous Charge
Compression-Ignition (HCCI) engine. Series of experiments were performed in a
hihly diluted Jet-Stirred Reactor (JDR) at pressures of 1 and 10 atm (1 atm =
101,325 Pa). The chosen thermo-chemical conditions were close to those
characteristices of the pre-ignition period in an HCCI engine. The influence of
various additives, namely nitric oxide (NO), ethylene (C2H4) and methanol
(CH3OH), on the oxidation of a n-heptane/toluene blend was studied over a wide
range of temperatures (550-1100 K), including the zone of the Negative
Temperature Coefficient (NTC).
