In this paper we provide a thorough classification of
Friedman-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) cosmological models in terms of the
strong or weak character of their singularities according to the usual
definitions. The classification refers to a generalised Puiseux power expansion
of the scale factor of the model around a singular event.
