In a recent article, J.-Y. Chemin, I. Gallagher and M. Paicu obtained a class
of large initial data generating a global smooth solution to the three
dimensional, incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. This data varies slowly in
the vertical direction (is a function on $\epsilon x_3$) and has a norm which
blows up as the small parameter goes to zero. This type of initial data can be
seen as the "ill prepared" case (in opposite with the "well prepared" case
which was treated previously by J.-Y. Chemin and I. Gallagher). In that paper,
the fluid evolves in a special domain, namely $\Omega=T^2_h\times\R_v$. The
choice of a periodic domain in the horizontal variable plays an important role.
The aim of this article is to study the case where the fluid evolves in the
full spaces $\R^3$, case where we need to overcome the difficulties coming from
very low horizontal frequencies. We consider in this paper an intermediate
situation between the "well prepared" case and "ill prepared" situation (the
norms of the horizontal components of initial data are small but the norm of
the vertical component blows up as the small parameter goes to zero). The proof
uses the analytical-type estimates and the special structure of the nonlinear
term of the equation.
