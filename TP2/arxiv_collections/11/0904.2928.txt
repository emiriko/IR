Morris-Thorne wormholes with a cosmological constant \Lambda have been
studied extensively, even allowing \Lambda to be replaced by a space variable
scalar. These wormholes cannot exist, however, if \Lambda is both space and
time dependent. Such a \Lambda will therefore act as a topological censor.
While not likely to have a bearing on the present, possible cosmological
consequences of inflation cannot be discounted.
