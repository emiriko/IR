We calculate the oblique electroweak corrections and confront them with the
experiments in a composite Higgs version of the standard model. A vector-like
weak doublet and a singlet fermion are added to the standard model without
elementary Higgs. Due to quartic coupling there is a mixing between the
components of the new fields triggering electroweak symmetry breaking. The
Peskin-Takeuchi S and T electroweak parameters are presented. The new sector of
vector-like fermions is slightly constrained, T gives an upper bound on the
mixing angle of the new fermions, which is already constrained by
self-consistent gap-equations. S gives no constraints on the masses. This
extension can give a positive contribution to T, allowing for a heavy Higgs
boson in electroweak precision tests of the Standard Model.
