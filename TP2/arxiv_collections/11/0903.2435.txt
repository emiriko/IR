We study the renormalization of the effective mass and trigonal warping of
bilayer graphene by the electron-electron interaction. One consequence of such
a renormalization in the low-energy bands of a bilayer crystal consists of a
small reduction of the critical density of the Lifshitz transition (the
crossover between the single-pocket and four-pocket topology of the Fermi
surface).
