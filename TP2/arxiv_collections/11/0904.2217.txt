In this short review, we describe some of the results on diffraction from the
Tevatron and give some prospects for the LHC. In particular, we discuss the
search for exclusive events at the Tevatron and their importance for the LHC
program/ We finish by presenting the project of installing forward detectors in
the ATLAS collaboration at 220 and 420 m.
