We demonstrate quantum interference between photons generated by the
radiative decay processes of excitons that are bound to isolated fluorine donor
impurities in ZnSe/ZnMgSe quantum-well nanostructures. The ability to generate
single photons from these devices is confirmed by auto-correlation experiments,
and indistinguishability of single photons from two independent devices is
confirmed via a Hong-Ou-Mandel dip. These results indicate that donor
impurities in appropriately engineered semiconductor structures can portray
atom-like homogeneity and coherence properties, potentially enabling scalable
technologies for future large-scale optical quantum computers and quantum
communication networks.
