We present QBAL, an extension of Girard, Scedrov and Scott's bounded linear
logic. The main novelty of the system is the possibility of quantifying over
resource variables. This generalization makes bounded linear logic considerably
more flexible, while preserving soundness and completeness for polynomial time.
In particular, we provide compositional embeddings of Leivant's RRW and
Hofmann's LFPL into QBAL.
