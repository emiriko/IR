Bursts of high energy EAS intensity (the series of EAS), following each other
in short intervals of time were observed by means of Tien-Shan high mountain
installation. For the lower boundary of EAS, uniting in one series, the size
Ne= 10**6 (primary energies of the order of 4x10**15 eV) was taken. The
condition of amalgamation into one series was the presence of at least two EAS
of Ne >10**7. The number of EAS in a series is from 4 to 9 events, with the
mean time interval between them 1-5 minutes. Five such series were found in the
material treated (approximately 250 days of pure time of the installation run).
For each EAS of each series, all the basic parameters are given: observation
date and time, age parameter S, galactic coordinates, coordinates of EAS axes
relative to the installation center, energy release in the calorimeter and its
distance from EAS axes, fitting the Nishimura- Kamata- Greisen (NKG) function.
It is essential, that the frequency of the appearing of such series is much
higher, than the probability of the occasional fluctuations in the succession
of independent EAS. This probably is in favor of the commonality of their
origin.
