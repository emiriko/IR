We study the feasibility of extracting a pure entangled state of
non-complementary, and potentially well separated, regions of a quantum
many-body system. It is shown that this can indeed be accomplished in
non-equilibrium scenarios as well as the ground state of the considered spin
chain models when one locally measures observables such as magnetization in
separated blocks of spins. A general procedure is presented, which can search
for the optimal way to extract a pure entangled state through local
projections. Our results indicate a connection of the projective extraction of
entanglement to good quantum numbers of the underlying Hamiltonian.
