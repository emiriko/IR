Strong electrostatic turbulence in magnetically confined plasmas is
characterized by trapping or eddying of particle trajectories produced by the
$E\times B$ stochastic drift. Trapping is shown to produce strong effects on
test particles and on test modes. It determines non-standard statistics of
trajectories: non-Gaussian distribution, memory effects and coherence. Trapped
trajectories form quasi-coherent structure. Trajectory trapping has strong
nonlinear effects on the test modes on turbulent plasmas. We determine the
growth rate of drift modes as function of the statistical characteristics of
the background turbulence. We show that trapping provides the physical
mechanism for the inverse cascade observed in drift turbulence and for the
zonal flow generation.
