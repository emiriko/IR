The main properties of the leading-twist transverse momentum dependent parton
distributions in a light-cone constituent quark model of the nucleon are
reviewed, with focus on the role of the spin-spin and spin-orbit correlations
of quarks. Results for azimuthal single spin asymmetries in semi-inclusive deep
inelastic scattering are also discussed.
