Our aim is investigating surface inhomogeneities of the young late-type star
SAO51891, from photosphere to upper chromosphere, analyzing contemporaneous
high-resolution spectra and broad-band photometry. The FOCES@CAHA spectral
range is used to determine spectral classification and derive vsini and Vrad.
The Li abundance is measured to estimate the age. The BVRIJHKs bands are used
to construct the SED. The variations of our BV fluxes and Teff are used to
infer the presence of photospheric spots and observe their behavior over time.
The chromospheric activity is studied applying the spectral subtraction
technique to Halpha, CaII H&K, Heps, and CaII IRT lines. We find SAO51891 to be
a young K0-1V star with Li abundance close to the Pleiades upper envelope,
confirming its youth (~100 Myr), also inferred from its kinematical membership
to the Local Association. We detect no IR excess from SED analysis, and
rotational modulation of luminosity, Teff, CaII, and Heps total fluxes. A spot
model with two active regions, ~240 K cooler than the surrounding photosphere,
fits our light/Teff curves, and reproduces the small-amplitude Vrad variations.
The anti-correlation of light curves and chromospheric diagnostics indicates
plages spatially associated with spots. The large amplitude observed in the
Heps-flux curve suggests that this line is very sensitive to the plage
presence. Finally, SAO51891 is a young active star, lacking significant amounts
of circumstellar dust or any evidence for low mass companions. The spots turn
out to be larger and warmer than those in less active MS stars. The Vrad
variation produced by spots has an amplitude comparable with those induced by
Jupiter-mass planets orbiting close to the star. SAO51891 is a good example of
star where the detection of planets may be hampered by the high activity level.
