We discuss design considerations and simulation results for IceRay, a
proposed large-scale ultra-high energy (UHE) neutrino detector at the South
Pole. The array is designed to detect the coherent Askaryan radio emission from
UHE neutrino interactions in the ice, with the goal of detecting the cosmogenic
neutrino flux with reasonable event rates. Operating in coincidence with the
IceCube neutrino detector would allow complete calorimetry of a subset of the
events. We also report on the status of a testbed IceRay station which
incorporates both ANITA and IceCube technology and will provide year-round
monitoring of the radio environment at the South Pole.
