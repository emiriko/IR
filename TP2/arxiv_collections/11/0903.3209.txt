An approximation theorem for minimal surfaces by complete minimal surfaces of
finite total curvature in $\mathbb{R}^3$ is obtained. This Mergelyan type
result can be extended to the family of complete minimal surfaces of weak
finite total curvature, that is to say, having finite total curvature on proper
regions of finite conformal type. We deal only with the orientable case.
