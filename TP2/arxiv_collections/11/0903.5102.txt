We demonstrate that films of unconventional (d-wave) superconductor at
temperatures $T\lesssim 0.43 T_c$ can exhibit unusual superconducting phases.
The new ground states beside the broken gauge and the point group symmetries
can spontaneously break (i) continuous translational symmetry and form periodic
order parameter structures in the plane of the film, or (ii) time-reversal
symmetry and develop supercurrent flowing along the film. These states are
result of the strong transverse inhomogeniety present in films with thickness
of several coherence lengths. We show a natural similarity between formation of
these states and the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov state.
