It is known that in the two-dimensional disordered superconductors
electron-electron interactions in the Cooper channel lead to the negative
logarithmic in temperature correction to the tunneling conductance above the
critical temperature. Physically this result appears due to the density of
states suppression by superconductive fluctuations near the Fermi level. It is
interesting that the other correction, which accounts for the
Maki-Thompson-type interaction of fluctuations, is positive and exhibits strong
power law, which dominates the logarithmic term in the immediate vicinity of
the critical temperature. An interplay between these two contributions
determines the zero-bias anomaly in fluctuating superconductors. This paper is
devoted to the fate of such interaction corrections in the ballistic
superconductors. It turns out that ballistic dynamic fluctuations perturb
single-particle density of states near the Fermi level at the energy scale
which is different from that in the diffusive case. As the consequence,
fluctuation region becomes much broader. In this regime we confirm that
correction to the tunneling conductance remains negative and logarithmic not
too close to the critical temperature while in the immediate vicinity of the
transition we find novel power law for the Maki-Thompson contribution. It is
suggested that peculiar non-monotonous temperature dependence of the tunneling
conductance may be probed via magneto-tunnel experiments.
