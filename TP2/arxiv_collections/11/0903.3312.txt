The most general form of Hamiltonian that preserves fermionic coherent states
stable in time is found in the form of nonstationary fermion oscillator.
Invariant creation and annihilation operators and related Fock states and
coherent states are built up for the more general system of nonstationary
forced fermion oscillator.
