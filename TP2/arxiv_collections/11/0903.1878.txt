The binary relation framework has been shown to be applicable to many
real-life preference handling scenarios. Here we study preference contraction:
the problem of discarding selected preferences. We argue that the property of
minimality and the preservation of strict partial orders are crucial for
contractions. Contractions can be further constrained by specifying which
preferences should be protected. We consider two classes of preference
relations: finite and finitely representable. We present algorithms for
computing minimal and preference-protecting minimal contractions for finite as
well as finitely representable preference relations. We study relationships
between preference change in the binary relation framework and belief change in
the belief revision theory. We also introduce some preference query
optimization techniques which can be used in the presence of contraction. We
evaluate the proposed algorithms experimentally and present the results.
