We present the results of extensive observations by the gamma-ray AGILE
satellite of the Galactic region hosting the Carina nebula and the remarkable
colliding wind binary Eta Carinae (Eta Car) during the period 2007 July to 2009
January. We detect a gamma-ray source (1AGL J1043-5931) consistent with the
position of Eta Car. If 1AGL J1043-5931 is associated with the Eta Car system
our data provide the long sought first detection above 100 MeV of a colliding
wind binary. The average gamma-ray flux above 100 MeV and integrated over the
pre-periastron period 2007 July to 2008 October is F = (37 +/- 5) x 10-8 ph
cm-2 s-1 corresponding to an average gamma-ray luminosity of L = 3.4 x 10^34
erg s-1 for a distance of 2.3 kpc. We also report a 2-day gamma-ray flaring
episode of 1AGL J1043-5931 on 2008 Oct. 11-13 possibly related to a transient
acceleration and radiation episode of the strongly variable shock in the
system.
