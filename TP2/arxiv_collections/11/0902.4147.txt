We investigate the dynamical properties of the transcriptional regulation of
gene expression in the yeast Saccharomyces Cerevisiae within the framework of a
synchronously and deterministically updated Boolean network model. By means of
a dynamically determinant subnetwork, we explore the robustness of
transcriptional regulation as a function of the type of Boolean functions used
in the model that mimic the influence of regulating agents on the transcription
level of a gene. We compare the results obtained for the actual yeast network
with those from two different model networks, one with similar in-degree
distribution as the yeast and random otherwise, and another due to Balcan et
al., where the global topology of the yeast network is reproduced faithfully.
We, surprisingly, find that the first set of model networks better reproduce
the results found with the actual yeast network, even though the Balcan et al.
model networks are structurally more similar to that of yeast.
