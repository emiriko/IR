It is shown that use of a photonic crystal enables to construct several types
of hybrid systems with virtual cathode, which could radiate due to different
radiation mechanisms (bremsstrahlung and diffraction (transition) radiation)
with different frequencies.
  Also mentioned that photonic crystal makes possible to create phase-locked
array of generators.
