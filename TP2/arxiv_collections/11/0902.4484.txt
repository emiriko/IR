Three-dimensional numerical magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations are
performed to investigate how a magnetically confined mountain on an accreting
neutron star relaxes resistively. No evidence is found for non-ideal MHD
instabilities on a short time-scale, such as the resistive ballooning mode or
the tearing mode. Instead, the mountain relaxes gradually as matter is
transported across magnetic surfaces on the diffusion time-scale, which
evaluates to $\tau_\mathrm{I} \sim 10^5 - 10^8$ yr (depending on the
conductivity of the neutron star crust) for an accreted mass of $M_a = 1.2
\times 10^{-4} M_\odot$. The magnetic dipole moment simultaneously reemerges as
the screening currents dissipate over $\tau_\mathrm{I}$. For nonaxisymmetric
mountains, ohmic dissipation tends to restore axisymmetry by magnetic
reconnection at a filamentary neutral sheet in the equatorial plane. Ideal-MHD
oscillations on the Alfv\'{e}n time-scale, which can be excited by external
influences, such as variations in the accretion torque, compress the magnetic
field and hence decrease $\tau_\mathrm{I}$ by \change{one order of magnitude}
relative to its standard value (as computed for the static configuration). The
implications of long-lived mountains for gravitational wave emission from
low-mass X-ray binaries are briefly explored.
