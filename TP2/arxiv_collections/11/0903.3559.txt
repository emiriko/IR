We predict a new electron pair-tunneling (PT) resonance in non-linear
transport through quantum dots with positive charging energies exceeding the
broadening due to thermal and quantum fluctuations. The PT resonance shows up
in the single-electron transport (SET) regime as a peak in the derivative of
the non-linear conductance when the electrochemical potential of one electrode
matches the average of two subsequent charge addition energies. For a single
level quantum dot (Anderson model) we find the analytic peak shape and the
dependence on temperature, magnetic field and junction asymmetry and compare
with the inelastic cotunneling peak which is of the same order of magnitude. In
experimental transport data the PT resonance may be mistaken for a weak SET
resonance judging only by the voltage dependence of its position. Our results
provide essential clues to avoid such erroneous interpretation of transport
spectroscopy data.
