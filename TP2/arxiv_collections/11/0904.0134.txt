Locally affine Lie algebras are generalizations of affine Kac--Moody algebras
with Cartan subalgebras of infinite rank whose root system is locally affine.
In this note we study a class of representations of locally affine algebras
generalizing integrable highest weight modules. In particular, we construct
such an integrable representation for each integral weight not vanishing on the
center and show that, over the complex numbers, we thus obtain unitary
representations w.r.t. a unitary real form.
  We also use Yoshii's recent classification of locally affine root systems to
derive a classification of so-called minimal locally affine Lie algebras and
give realizations as twisted loop algebras.
