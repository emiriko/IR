After considering the reference case of the motion of spinning test bodies in
the equatorial plane of the Schwarzschild space-time, we generalize the results
to the case of the motion of a spinning particle in the equatorial plane of the
Schwarzschild-de Sitter space-time. Specifically, we obtain the loci of turning
points of the particle in this plane. We show that the cosmological constant
affect the particle motion when the particle distance from the black hole is of
the order of the inverse square root of the cosmological constant.
