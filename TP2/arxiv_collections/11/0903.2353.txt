Logic programming is sometimes described as relational programming: a
paradigm in which the programmer specifies and composes n-ary relations using
systems of constraints. An advanced logic programming environment will provide
tools that abstract these relations to transform, optimise, or even verify the
correctness of a logic program. This talk will show that these concepts, namely
relations, constraints and abstractions, turn out to also be important in the
reverse engineer process that underpins the discovery of bugs within the
security industry.
