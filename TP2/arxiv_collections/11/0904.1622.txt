In little higgs models a collective symmetry prevents the higgs from
acquiring a quadratically divergent mass at one loop. By considering first the
littlest higgs model we show that this requires a fine tuning: the couplings in
the model introduced to give the top quark a mass do not naturally respect the
collective symmetry. We show the problem is generic: it arises from the fact
that the would be collective symmetry of any one top quark mass term is broken
by gauge interactions.
