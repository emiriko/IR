In January 2004, the Stardust spacecraft flew through the dust of comet
81P/Wild 2 and captured specks of the cometary dust. On analysis of the comet
81P/Wild 2 samples, it was found that they contain materials found in the
coldest and hottest region of the early solar nebula, strongly suggesting
'mixing' on the grandest scale. Here it is suggested that if microorganisms
were present in the early solar nebula, as required by the hypothesis of
cometary panspermia, then in the light of the Stardust findings, life was
already present in the very material that formed the planetary bodies.
