The electronic structures of FeAs-compounds strongly depend on the
  Fe-As bonding, which can not be described successfully by the local density
approximation (LDA). Treating the multi-orbital fluctuations from $ab$-$initio$
by LDA+Gutzwiller method, we are now able to predict the correct Fe-As
bond-length, and find that Fe-As bonding-strength is 30% weaker, which will
explain the observed "soft phonon". The bands are narrowed by a factor of 2,
and the $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital is pushed up to cross the Fermi level, forming
3-dimensional Fermi surfaces, which suppress the anisotropy and the ($\pi,\pi$)
nesting. The inter-orbital Hund's coupling $J$ rather than $U$ plays crucial
roles to obtain these results.
