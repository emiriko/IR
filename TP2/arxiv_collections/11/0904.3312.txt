In this paper we present a novel hybrid (arraybased layout and vertical
bitmap layout) database representation approach for mining complete Maximal
Frequent Itemset (MFI) on sparse and large datasets. Our work is novel in terms
of scalability, item search order and two horizontal and vertical projection
techniques. We also present a maximal algorithm using this hybrid database
representation approach. Different experimental results on real and sparse
benchmark datasets show that our approach is better than previous state of art
maximal algorithms.
