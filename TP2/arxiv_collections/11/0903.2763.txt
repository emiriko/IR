High order actions proposed by Chin have been used for the first time in path
integral Monte Carlo simulations. Contrarily to the Takahashi-Imada action,
which is accurate to fourth order only for the trace, the Chin action is fully
fourth order, with the additional advantage that the leading fourth and sixth
order error coefficients are finely tunable. By optimizing two free parameters
entering in the new action we show that the time step error dependence achieved
is best fitted with a sixth order law. The computational effort per bead is
increased but the total number of beads is greatly reduced, and the efficiency
improvement with respect to the primitive approximation is approximately a
factor of ten. The Chin action is tested in a one-dimensional harmonic
oscillator, a H$_2$ drop, and bulk liquid $^4$He. In all cases a sixth-order
law is obtained with values of the number of beads that compare well with the
pair action approximation in the stringent test of superfluid $^4$He.
