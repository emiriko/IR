Two quantum Macro-states and their Macroscopic Quantum Superpositions (MQS)
localized in two far apart, space - like separated sites can be non-locally
correlated by any entangled couple of single-particles having interacted in the
past. This novel Macro - Macro paradigm is investigated on the basis of a
recent study on an entangled Micro-Macro system involving N=10^5 particles.
Crucial experimental issues as the violation of Bell's inequalities by the
Macro - Macro system are considered.
