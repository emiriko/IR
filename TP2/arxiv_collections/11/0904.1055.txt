A filament eruption, accompanied by a B9.5 flare, coronal dimming and an EUV
wave, was observed by the Solar TERrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) on
19 May 2007, beginning at about 13:00 UT. Here, we use observations from the
SECCHI/EUVI telescopes and other solar observations to analyze the behavior and
geometry of the filament before and during the eruption. At this time, STEREO A
and B were separated by about 8.5 degrees, sufficient to determine the
three-dimensional structure of the filament using stereoscopy. The filament
could be followed in SECCHI/EUVI 304 A stereoscopic data from about 12 hours
before to about 2 hours after the eruption, allowing us to determine the 3D
trajectory of the erupting filament. From the 3D reconstructions of the
filament and the chromospheric ribbons in the early stage of the eruption,
simultaneous heating of both the rising filamentary material and the
chromosphere directly below is observed, consistent with an eruption resulting
from magnetic reconnection below the filament. Comparisons of the filament
during eruption in 304 A and Halpha show that when it becomes emissive in He
II, it tends to disappear in Halpha, indicating that the disappearance probably
results from heating or motion, not loss, of filamentary material.
