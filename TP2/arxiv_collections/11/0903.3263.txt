We proposed a new observable based on two particle azimuth correlation to
study the away-side medium response in mid-central Au+Au collisions. We argue
that a left/right asymmetry may appear at the away-side by selecting triggers
separately in the left and right side of the reaction plane. A simple model
estimation suggests that the magnitude of such asymmetry could reach 30% with
details depends on the medium response mechanisms. This asymmetry, if observed,
can help to distinguish competing theoretical models.
