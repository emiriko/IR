Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) originate from closed magnetic field regions on
the Sun, which are active regions and quiescent filament regions. The energetic
populations such as halo CMEs, CMEs associated with magnetic clouds,
geoeffective CMEs, CMEs associated with solar energetic particles and
interplanetary type II radio bursts, and shock-driving CMEs have been found to
originate from sunspot regions. The CME and flare occurrence rates are found to
be correlated with the sunspot number, but the correlations are significantly
weaker during the maximum phase compared to the rise and declining phases. We
suggest that the weaker correlation results from high-latitude CMEs from the
polar crown filament regions that are not related to sunspots.
