We show that on superconducting spherical nanoshells, the co-existence of the
Meissner state with a variety of vortex patterns drives the phase transition to
higher magnetic fields. The spherical geometry leads to a Magnus-Lorentz force
pushing the nucleating vortices and antivortices towards the poles, overcoming
local pinning centers, preventing vortex-antivortex recombination and leading
to the appearance of a Meissner belt around the sphere's equator. In
sufficiently small and thin spherical shells paramagnetic vortex states can be
stable, enabling spatial separation of freely moving shells with different
radii and vorticity in an inhomogeneous external magnetic field.
