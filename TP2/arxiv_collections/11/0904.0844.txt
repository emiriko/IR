We propose and study an approach to realize quantum switch for single-photon
transport in a coupled superconducting transmission line resonator (TLR) array
with one controllable hopping interaction. We find that the single-photon with
arbitrary wavevector can transport in a controllable way in this system. We
also study how to realize controllable hopping interaction between two TLRs via
a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID). When the frequency of
the SQUID is largely detuned from those of the two TLRs, the variables of the
SQUID can be adiabatically eliminated and thus a controllable interaction
between two TLRs can be obtained.
