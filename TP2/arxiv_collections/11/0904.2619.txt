We study dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) induced by breakdown of the
fractional quantum Hall (FQH) effect. We find that voltage-current
characteristics depend on current sweep rates at the quantum Hall states of
Landau level filling factors $\nu$ = 1, 2/3, and 1/3. The sweep rate dependence
is attributed to DNP occurring in the breakdown regime of FQH states. Results
of a pump and probe experiment show that the polarities of the DNP induced in
the breakdown regimes of the FQH states is opposite to that of the DNP induced
in the breakdown regimes of odd-integer quantum Hall states.
