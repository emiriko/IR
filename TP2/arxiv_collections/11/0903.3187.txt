Aim of this paper is to show the possible significance, and usefulness, of
various non-selfadjoint operators for suitable Observables in non relativistic
and relativistic quantum mechanics, and in quantum electrodynamics. More
specifically, this work starts dealing with: (i) the maximal hermitian (but not
selfadjoint) Time operator in non-relativistic quantum mechanics and in quantum
electrodynamics; and with: (ii) the problem of the four-position and
four-momentum operators, each one with its hermitian and anti-hermitian parts,
for relativistic spin-zero particles. Afterwards, other physically important
applications of non-selfadjoint (and even non-hermitian) operators are
discussed: In particular, (iii) we reanalyze in detail the interesting
possibility of associating quasi-hermitian Hamiltonians with (decaying)
unstable states in nuclear physics. Finally, we briefly mention the cases of
quantum dissipation, as well as of the nuclear optical potential. [PACS
