We present an exact solution to the non-linear equation which describes a
global monopole in the flat space. We re-examine the metric and the geodesics
outside the global monopole. We will see that a global monopole produces a
repulsive gravitational field outside the core in addition to a solid angular
deficit. The lensing property of the global monopole and the global
monopole-antimonopole annihilation mechanism are studied.
