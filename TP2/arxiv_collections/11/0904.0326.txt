The eigenstate energies of an atom increase under spatial confinement and
this effect should also increase the electron density of the orbital electrons
at the nucleus thus increasing the decay rate of an electron-capturing
radioactive nucleus. We have observed that the orbital electron capture rates
of 109In and 110Sn increased by (1.00+-0.17)% and (0.48+-0.25)% respectively
when implanted in the small Au lattice versus large Pb lattice. These results
have been understood because of the higher compression experienced by the large
radioactive atoms due to the spatial confinement in the smaller Au lattice.
