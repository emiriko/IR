In this paper, we introduce a scientific format for text-based data files,
which facilitates storing and communicating tabular data sets. The so-called
Full-Metadata Format builds on the widely used INI-standard and is based on
four principles: readable self-documentation, flexible structure, fail-safe
compatibility, and searchability. As a consequence, all metadata required to
interpret the tabular data are stored in the same file, allowing for the
automated generation of publication-ready tables and graphs and the semantic
searchability of data file collections. The Full-Metadata Format is introduced
on the basis of three comprehensive examples. The complete format and syntax is
given in the appendix.
