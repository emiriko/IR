The general tendency for species number (S) to increase with sampled area (A)
constitutes one of the most robust empirical laws of ecology, quantified by
species-area relationships (SAR). In many ecosystems, SAR curves display a
power-law dependence, $S\propto A^z$. The exponent $z$ is always less than one
but shows significant variation in different ecosystems. We study the multitype
voter model as one of the simplest models able to reproduce SAR similar to
those observed in real ecosystems in terms of basic ecological processes such
as birth, dispersal and speciation. Within the model, the species-area exponent
$z$ depends on the dimensionless speciation rate $\nu$, even though the
detailed dependence is still matter of controversy. We present extensive
numerical simulations in a broad range of speciation rates from $\nu =10^{-3}$
down to $\nu = 10^{-11}$, where the model reproduces values of the exponent
observed in nature. In particular, we show that the inverse of the species-area
exponent linearly depends on the logarithm of $\nu$. Further, we compare the
model outcomes with field data collected from previous studies, for which we
separate the effect of the speciation rate from that of the different species
lifespans. We find a good linear relationship between inverse exponents and
logarithm of species lifespans. However, the slope sets bounds on the
speciation rates that can hardly be justified on evolutionary basis, suggesting
that additional effects should be taken into account to consistently interpret
the observed exponents.
