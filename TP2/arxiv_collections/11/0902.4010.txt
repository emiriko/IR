In arXiv:0805.0150 [hep-th] and arXiv:0812.2909 [hep-th] a general
prescription was presented for the computation of real-time correlation
functions using the gauge/gravity duality. I apply this prescription to the
specific case of retarded thermal correlation functions and derive the usual
ingoing boundary conditions at the horizon for bulk fields. The derivation
allows me to clarify various issues, in particular the generalization to
higher-point functions and the relevance of including the regions beyond the
horizon.
