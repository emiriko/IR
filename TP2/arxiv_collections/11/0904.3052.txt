We consider variations of the standard leptogenesis picture arising from the
presence of an additional scale related to the breaking of a $U(1)_X$ abelian
flavor symmetry. We show that quite generically the presence of an additional
energy scale might introduce new qualitative and quantitative changes on
leptogenesis. Especially interesting is the possibility of having succesful TeV
leptogenesis with a vanishing total CP violating asymmetry. By solving the
corresponding Boltzmann equations it is shown that these kind of scenarios
encounters no difficulties in generating the Cosmic baryon asymmetry.
