We present quantum networks for a n-qubit controlled gate C^{n-1}(U) which
use a higher dimensional (qudit) ancilla as a catalyser. In its simplest form
the network has only n two-particle gates (qubit-qudit) -- this is the minimum
number of two-body interactions needed to couple all n+1 subsystems (n qubits
plus one ancilla). This class of controlled gates includes the generalised
Toffoli gate C^{n-1}(X) on n qubits, which plays an important role in several
quantum algorithms and error correction. A particular example implementing this
model is given by the dispersive limit of a generalised Jaynes-Cummings
Hamiltonian of an effective spin-s interacting with a cavity mode.
