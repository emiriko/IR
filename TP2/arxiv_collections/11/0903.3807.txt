An unexplored diamond defect centre which is found to emit stable single
photons at a measured rate of 1.6 MHz at room temperature is reported. The
novel centre, identified in chemical vapour deposition grown diamond crystals,
exhibits a sharp zero phonon line at 734 nm with a full width at half maximum
of ~ 4 nm. The photon statistics confirm the center is a single emitter and
provides direct evidence of the first true two-level single quantum system in
diamond.
