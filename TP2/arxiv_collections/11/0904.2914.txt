The mesonic excitations and s-wave pi--pi scattering lengths at finite
temperature are studied in the two-flavor Polyakov--Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (PNJL)
model. The masses of pi-meson and sigma-meson, pion-decay constant, the
pion-quark coupling strength, and the scattering lengths $a_{0}$ and $a_{2}$ at
finite temperature are calculated in the PNJL model with two forms of
Polyakov-loop effective potential. The obtained results are almost independent
of the choice of the effective potentials. The calculated results in the PNJL
model are also compared with those in the conventional Nambu--Jona-Lasinio
model and indicate that the effect of color confinement screens the effect of
temperature below the critical one in the PNJL model. Furthermore, the
Goldberger-Treiman relation and the Gell-Mann--Oakes--Renner relation are
extended to the case at finite temperature in the PNJL model.
