The quantum teleportation protocol can be used to probabilistically simulate
a quantum circuit with backward-in-time connections. This allows us to analyze
some conceptual problems of time travel in the context of physically realizable
situations, to realize encrypted measurements of future states for which the
decryption key becomes available only after the state is created, and to
probabilistically realize a multistage quantum state processing within the time
needed to complete only one stage. The probabilistic nature of the process
resolves any paradox.
