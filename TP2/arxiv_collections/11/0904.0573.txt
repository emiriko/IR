We present the Hamiltonian formulation of General Relativity with the Holst
formulation in a generic local Lorentz frame. In particular, we outline that a
Gauss constraint is inferred by a proper generalization of
Ashtekar-Barbero-Immirzi connections. This feature allow to extend the Loop
Quantum Gravity quantization procedure to the case in which no gauge fixing at
all is performed of the Lorentz frame.
