The Sommerfeld factor for arbitrary partial wave processes is derived in the
non-relativistic limit. The s-wave and p-wave numerical results are presented
for the case of Yukawa interactions. An approximate analytic expression is also
found for the Sommerfeld factor of Yukawa interactions with arbitrary partial
waves, which is exact in the Coulomb limit. It is demonstrated that this result
is accurate to within 10% for some common scenarios. The non s-wave Sommerfeld
effect is determined to be significant, and can allow higher partial waves to
dominate cross sections.
