We study the dynamics of a charge qubit that is capacitively coupled to an
open double quantum dot. Depending on the qubit state, the transport through
the open quantum dot may be resonant or off-resonant, such that the qubit
affects the current through the open double dot. We relate the initial qubit
state to the magnitude of an emerging transient current peak. The relation
between these quantities enables the readout of not only the charge but also
the phase of the qubit.
