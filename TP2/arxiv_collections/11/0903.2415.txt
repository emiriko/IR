We present the electroweak and flavour structure of a model with a warped
extra dimension and the bulk gauge group SU(3) x SU(2)_L x SU(2)_R x P_LR x
U(1)_X. The presence of SU(2)_R implies an unbroken custodial symmetry in the
Higgs system allowing to eliminate large contributions to the T parameter,
whereas the P_LR symmetry and the enlarged fermion representations provide a
custodial symmetry for flavour diagonal and flavour changing couplings of the
SM Z boson to left-handed down-type quarks. We diagonalise analytically the
mass matrices of charged and neutral gauge bosons including the first KK modes.
We present the mass matrices for quarks including heavy KK modes and discuss
the neutral and charged currents involving light and heavy fields. We give the
corresponding complete set of Feynman rules in the unitary gauge.
