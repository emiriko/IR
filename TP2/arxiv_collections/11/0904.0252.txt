We study the renormalization of a non-magnetic impurity's scattering
potential due to the presence of a massless collective spin mode at a
ferromagnetic quantum critical point. To this end, we compute the lowest order
vertex corrections in two- and three-dimensional systems, for arbitrary
scattering angle and frequency of the scattered fermions, as well as band
curvature. We show that only for backward scattering in D=2 does the lowest
order vertex correction diverge logarithmically in the zero frequency limit. In
all other cases, the vertex corrections approach a finite (albeit possibly
large) value in the zero frequency limit. We demonstrate that vertex
corrections are strongly suppressed with increasing curvature of the fermionic
bands. Moreover, we show how the frequency dependence of vertex corrections
varies with the scattering angle. We also discuss the form of higher order
ladder vertex corrections and show that they can be classified according to the
zero-frequency limit of the lowest order vertex correction. We show that even
in those cases where the latter is finite, summing up an infinite series of
ladder vertex diagrams can lead to a strong enhancement (or divergence) of the
impurity's scattering potential. Finally, we suggest that the combined
frequency and angular dependence of vertex corrections might be experimentally
observable via a combination of frequency dependent and local measurements,
such as scanning tunneling spectroscopy on ordered impurity structures, or
measurements of the frequency dependent optical conductivity.
