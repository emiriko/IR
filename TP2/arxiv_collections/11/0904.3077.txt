In the context of quark (as for lepton) mixing, we introduce the concept of
the matrix of unitarity triangle angles $\Phi$, emphasising that it carries
equivalent information to the complex mixing matrix $V$ itself. The angle
matrix $\Phi$ has the added advantage, with respect to $V$, of being both
basis-and phase-convention independent and consequently observable (indeed
several $\Phi$-matrix entries, eg. $\Phi_{cs}=\alpha$, $\Phi_{us}=\beta$ etc.
are already long-studied as directly measurable/measured in $B$-physics
experiments). We give complete translation formulae between the mixing-matrix
and angle-matrix representations. We go on to consider briefly the present
state of the experimental data on the full angle matrix and some of the
prospects for the future, with reference to both the quark and lepton cases.
