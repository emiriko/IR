The polarimetric and photometric variability of Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars as
caused by clumps in the winds, is revisited. In the model which is improved
from Li et al. 2000, the radial expansion of the thickness is accounted for,
but we retain the dependence on the beta velocity law, stellar occultation
effects. We again search for parameters that can yield results consistent with
observations in regards to the mean polarization, the ratio of polarimetric to
photometric variability, and the volume filling factor. Clump generation and
spatial distribution are randomized by the Monte Carlo method so as to produce
clumps which are, in the mean, distributed uniformly in space and have time
intervals with a Gaussian distribution. The generated clumps move radially
outward with a velocity law determined by a beta index, and the angular size of
the clumps is assumed to keep fixed. By fitting the observational results and
the volume filling factor, the clump velocity law index beta and clump ejection
rate are inferred, and are found to be well constrained. In addition, the
subpeak features on broad emission lines seem to support the clump ejection
rate. Meanwhile, the fraction of the total mass loss rate that is contained in
the clumps is obtained by fitting the observed polarization. We conclude that
this picture for the clump properties produces a valuable diagnostic of WR wind
structure.
