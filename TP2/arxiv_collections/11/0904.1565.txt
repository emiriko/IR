We present a systematic study on the influence of epitaxial strain and hole
concentration on the magnetic anisotropy in (Ga,Mn)As at 4.2 K. The strain was
gradually varied over a wide range from tensile to compressive by growing a
series of (Ga,Mn)As layers with 5% Mn on relaxed graded (In,Ga)As/GaAs
templates with different In concentration. The hole density, the Curie
temperature, and the relaxed lattice constant of the as-grown and annealed
(Ga,Mn)As layers turned out to be essentially unaffected by the strain.
Angle-dependent magnetotransport measurements performed at different magnetic
field strengths were used to probe the magnetic anisotropy. The measurements
reveal a pronounced linear dependence of the uniaxial out-of-plane anisotropy
on both strain and hole density. Whereas the uniaxial and cubic in-plane
anisotropies are nearly constant, the cubic out-of-plane anisotropy changes
sign when the magnetic easy axis flips from in-plane to out-of-plane. The
experimental results for the magnetic anisotropy are quantitatively compared
with calculations of the free energy based on a mean-field Zener model. An
almost perfect agreement between experiment and theory is found for the
uniaxial out-of-plane and cubic in-plane anisotropy parameters of the as-grown
samples. In addition, magnetostriction constants are derived from the
anisotropy data.
