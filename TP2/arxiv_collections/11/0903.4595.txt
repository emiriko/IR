The spin lattice appropriate for Azurite Cu3(CO3)2(OH)2 was determined by
evaluating its spin exchange interactions on the basis of first principles
density functional calculations. It is found that Azurite is not described by
an isolated diamond chain with no spin frustration, but by a two-dimensional
spin lattice in which diamond chains with spin frustration interact through the
interchain spin exchange in the ab-plane. Our analysis indicates that the
magnetic properties of Azurite at low temperatures can be approximated by two
independent contributions, i.e., an isolated dimer and an effective uniform
chain contributions. This prediction was verified by analyzing the magnetic
susceptibility and specific heat data of Azurite.
