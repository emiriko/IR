We outline a generic ratchet mechanism for creating directed spin-polarized
currents in ac-driven double well or double dot structures by employing
resonant spin transfer through the system engineered by local external magnetic
fields. We show its applicability to semiconductor nanostructures by
considering coherent transport through two coupled lateral quantum dots, where
the energy levels of the two dots exhibit opposite Zeeman spin splitting. We
perform numerical quantum mechanical calculations for the I-V characteristics
of this system in the nonlinear regime, which requires a self-consistent
treatment of the charge redistribution due to the applied finite bias. We show
that this setting enables nonzero averaged net spin currents in the absence of
net charge transport.
