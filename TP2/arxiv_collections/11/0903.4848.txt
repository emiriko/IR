Based on functional analysis, we propose an algorithm for finite-norm
solutions of higher-order linear Fuchsian-type ordinary differential equations
(ODEs) P(x,d/dx)f(x)=0 with P(x,d/dx):=[\sum_m p_m (x) (d/dx)^m] by using only
the four arithmetical operations on integers. This algorithm is based on a
band-diagonal matrix representation of the differential operator P(x,d/dx),
though it is quite different from the usual Galerkin methods. This
representation is made for the respective CONSs of the input Hilbert space H
and the output Hilbert space H' of P(x,d/dx). This band-diagonal matrix enables
the construction of a recursive algorithm for solving the ODE. However, a
solution of the simultaneous linear equations represented by this matrix does
not necessarily correspond to the true solution of ODE. We show that when this
solution is an l^2 sequence, it corresponds to the true solution of ODE. We
invent a method based on an integer-type algorithm for extracting only l^2
components. Further, the concrete choice of Hilbert spaces H and H' is also
given for our algorithm when p_m is a polynomial or a rational function with
rational coefficients. We check how our algorithm works based on several
numerical demonstrations related to special functions, where the results show
that the accuracy of our method is extremely high.
