Recently doubts have been raised about the ability of pilot wave theories
with field ontology to recover the predictions of quantum field theory. In
particular, Struyve has questioned that the overlap between wave functionals of
macroscopically different states with fixed particle number is really
non-significant. With numerical computations and some further plausibility
arguments we show that the overlap between n-particle states in field theory
decreases almost exponentially with the number of particles and becomes
non-significant already for small particle numbers.
