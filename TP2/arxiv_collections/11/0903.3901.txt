This is a representation of the first Raman and IR / FIR spectra for
orthorhombic copper polysilicate, CuSiO3, measured at room temperature on
polycrystalline samples and a comparison of the optical phonons with those
observed for the spin-Peierls compound CuGeO3. CuSiO3 represents a further
example of a quasi-one-dimensional spin = 1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg
chain system. A mode assignment for the silicate is given. From the analysis of
the Davydov doublets a reduced intralayer- to-interlayer bond strength of the
silicate in comparison to the germanate is obtained allowing for different
magnetic response at low temperature.
