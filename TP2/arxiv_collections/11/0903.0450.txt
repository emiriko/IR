An overview is given on recent progress in the study of quarkonium
spectroscopy at the B-factories. In particular, an updated status report is
presented of the long list of "charmonium-like" resonances newly discovered,
whose assignment as true charmonium states is in most cases at least
controversial. Also, new measurements on the decay properties of bottomonium
states above open-B production thresholds are shown.
