We present high field magneto-transport data from a range of 30nm wide
InSb/InAlSb quantum wells. The low temperature carrier mobility of the samples
studied ranged from 18.4 to 39.5 m2V-1s-1 with carrier densities between
1.5x1015 and 3.28x1015 m-2. Room temperature mobilities are reported in excess
of 6 m2V-1s-1. It is found that the Landau level broadening decreases with
carrier density and beating patterns are observed in the magnetoresistance with
non-zero node amplitudes in samples with the narrowest broadening despite the
presence of a large g-factor. The beating is attributed to Rashba splitting
phenomenon and Rashba coupling parameters are extracted from the difference in
spin populations for a range of samples and gate biases. The influence of
Landau level broadening and spin-dependent scattering rates on the observation
of beating in the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations is investigated by simulations
of the magnetoconductance. Data with non-zero beat node amplitudes are
accompanied by asymmetric peaks in the Fourier transform, which are
successfully reproduced by introducing a spin-dependent broadening in the
simulations. It is found that the low-energy (majority) spin up state suffers
more scattering than the high-energy (minority) spin down state and that the
absence of beating patterns in the majority of (lower density) samples can be
attributed to the same effect when the magnitude of the level broadening is
large.
