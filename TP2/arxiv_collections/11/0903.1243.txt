The ability to manipulate quantum information encoded in microwave fields has
led to a renewed interest in Josephson parametric amplifiers (JPAs). For these
applications the ability of JPAs to amplify signals with the least amount of
added noise is critical. Unfortunately JPAs are typically narrow band
amplifiers with small dynamic range. It is therefore important to understand
the bandwidth and dynamic range of any particular JPA in order to determine if
it is appropriate for these applications. We recently introduced a new kind of
JPA. Although it is still narrow band, the amplified band can be tuned over a
full octave. We have shown that it has good noise performance and can squeeze
the vacuum noise by 10 dB. Here we characterize other important parameters of
this amplifier, specifically the signal-bandwidth, dynamic range and saturation
power.
