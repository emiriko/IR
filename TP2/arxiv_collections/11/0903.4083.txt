Gauge transformations leave only specific Maxwell fields unchanged. To reveal
more, I develop Lorenz field equations for superposed, sourced and unsourced,
wave function potentials. In this Maxwell form system, the Lorenz condition is
charge conservation. This allows me to define three transformation classes that
screen for Lorenz relevance. Nongauge, sans gauge function, Lorentz conditions
add polarization fields. These enable emergent, light-like radiation. That from
Lissajous potentials is Nadelstrahlung. It conveys energy localized like
particles at charge conserving, progressive phase points. Such rays escape
discovery in modern Maxwell fields where gauge transformations suppress the
polarizations.
