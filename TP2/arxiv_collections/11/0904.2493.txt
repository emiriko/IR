This paper is devoted to the analysis of a mathematical model of blood cells
production in the bone marrow (hematopoiesis). The model is a system of two
age-structured partial differential equations. Integrating these equations over
the age, we obtain a system of two nonlinear differential equations with
distributed time delay corresponding to the cell cycle duration. This system
describes the evolution of the total cell populations. By constructing a
Lyapunov functional, it is shown that the trivial equilibrium is globally
asymptotically stable if it is the only equilibrium. It is also shown that the
nontrivial equilibrium, the most biologically meaningful one, can become
unstable via a Hopf bifurcation. Numerical simulations are carried out to
illustrate the analytical results. The study maybe helpful in understanding the
connection between the relatively short cell cycle durations and the relatively
long periods of peripheral cell oscillations in some periodic hematological
diseases.
