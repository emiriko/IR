We study the asymptotic Virasoro symmetry which acts on the near-horizon
region of extremal four-dimensional black hole solutions of gravity theories
with higher-derivative corrections, following the recently proposed Kerr/CFT
correspondence. We demonstrate that its central charge correctly reproduces the
entropy formula of Iyer-Wald, once the boundary terms in the symplectic
structure are carefully chosen.
