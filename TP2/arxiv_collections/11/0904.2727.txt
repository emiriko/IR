The renormalization-group properties of transverse-momentum dependent parton
distribution functions in the light-cone gauge with the Mandelstam-Leibbrandt
prescription for the gluon propagator are addressed. An expression for the
transverse component of the gauge field at light-cone infinity, which plays a
crucial role in the description of the final-/initial-state interactions in the
light-cone axial gauge, is obtained. The leading-order anomalous dimension is
calculated in this gauge and the relation to the results obtained in other
gauges is worked out. It is shown that, using the Mandelstam-Leibbrandt
prescription, the ensuing anomalous dimension does not receive contributions
from extra rapidity divergences related to a cusped junction point of the
Wilson lines.
