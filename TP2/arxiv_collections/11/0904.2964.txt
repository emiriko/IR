We give a systematic construction of Hopf algebra structures on braided
cofree coalgebras. The relevant underlying structures are braided algebras and
braided coalgebras. We provide some interesting examples of these algebras and
coalgebras related to quantum groups. We introduce quantum multi-brace algebras
which are generalizations of both braided algebras and
$\textbf{B}_\infty$-algebras, as the natural framework. This new subject
enables one to quantize some important algebra structures in a uniform way.
Particular interesting examples are quantum quasi-shuffle algebras.
