A powerful and well-established tool for free-energy estimation is
  Bennett's acceptance ratio method. Central properties of this estimator,
which employs samples of work values of a forward and its time reversed
process, are known: for given sets of measured work values, it results in the
best estimate of the free-energy difference in the large sample limit. Here we
state and prove a further characteristic of the acceptance ratio method: the
convexity of its mean square error. As a two-sided estimator, it depends on the
ratio of the numbers of forward and reverse work values used. Convexity of its
mean square error immediately implies that there exists an unique optimal ratio
for which the error becomes minimal. Further, it yields insight into the
relation of the acceptance ratio method and estimators based on the Jarzynski
equation. As an application, we study the performance of a dynamic strategy of
sampling forward and reverse work values.
