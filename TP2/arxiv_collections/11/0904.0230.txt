We perform detailed study of the Higgs production and decay, when Higgs is
emitted from the black holes produced in proton-proton collisions at the Large
Hadron Collider. We show that black hole production can significantly enhance
the signal for the Higgs search at the LHC. We evaluate rapidity distribution
of diphotons and transverse momentum distribution of bottom quarks, photons,
tau leptons, top quarks and W bosons from Higgs decay, when Higgs is emitted
from the black hole and also in case when these particles are produced directly
from the black hole evaporation. We compare our results with the standard model
backgrounds. We find that Higgs production from black holes is dominant over
standard model production for $p_T^H > 100$ GeV, when $M_P=1$TeV. Diphotons
from Higgs, when Higgs is produced from evaporation of black holes, are
dominant over the standard model prediction, for diphoton rapidity $|y_{\gamma
\gamma}| \leq 1$, while bottom quarks are dominant over QCD background for
large bottom quark transverse momentum, $p_T^b > 300$ GeV, when $M_P=1$ TeV. We
show that measurements of the photon and bottom quark transverse momentum
distribution can provide valuable information about the value of the
fundamental Planck scale. We also propose a new signal for black hole
production at the LHC, an onset of increasing transverse momentum distribution
of bottom quarks with large transverse momentum.
