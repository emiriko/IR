We present a wide study on the comparison of different shadowing models and
their influence on \jpsi production. We have taken into account the possibility
of different partonic processes for the $c \bar c$-pair production. We notice
that the effect of shadowing corrections on \jpsi production clearly depends on
the partonic process considered. Our results are compared to the available data
on \dAu collisions at RHIC energies. We try different break up cross section
for each of the studied shadowing models.
