In this letter, we report that the superconductivity transition temperature
in beta-Fe1.01Se increases from 8.5 to 36.7 K under applied pressure of 8.9
GPa. It then decreases at higher pressure. A dramatic change in volume is
observed at the same time Tc rises, due to a collapse of the separation between
the Fe2Se2 layers. A clear transition to a linear resistivity normal state is
seen on cooling at all pressures. No static magnetic ordering is observed for
the whole p-T phase diagram. We also report that at higher pressure (starting
around 7 GPa and completed at 38 GPa), Fe1.01Se transforms to a hexagonal
NiAs-type structure and displays non-magnetic, insulating behavior. The
inclusion of electron correlation in band structure caculations is necessary to
describe this behavior, signifying that such correlations are important in this
chemical system. Our results strongly support unconventional superconductivity
in beta-Fe1.01Se.
