This paper presents a computational model for the cooperation of constraint
domains and an implementation for a particular case of practical importance.
The computational model supports declarative programming with lazy and possibly
higher-order functions, predicates, and the cooperation of different constraint
domains equipped with their respective solvers, relying on a so-called
Constraint Functional Logic Programming (CFLP) scheme. The implementation has
been developed on top of the CFLP system TOY, supporting the cooperation of the
three domains H, R and FD, which supply equality and disequality constraints
over symbolic terms, arithmetic constraints over the real numbers, and finite
domain constraints over the integers, respectively. The computational model has
been proved sound and complete w.r.t. the declarative semantics provided by the
$CFLP$ scheme, while the implemented system has been tested with a set of
benchmarks and shown to behave quite efficiently in comparison to the closest
related approach we are aware of.
