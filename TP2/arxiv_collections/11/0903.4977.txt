The nature of ball lightning (BL) is pure electric and can be described by
simple equations following to elementary considerations of equality of
translational acceleration and velocity of the ions and electrons, a
spherical-like dipole BL as a whole and balance of the energy influx of
atmospheric electricity and radiation losses. From these equations follows a
linear relationship between the size of BL and the tension of the atmospheric
field E. A typical size of the fireball (FB) r ~ 5 cm corresponds to the
calculated electron temperature T(e) ~ 8000K at a pressure p = 1 at with a
horizontal component of the electric field E a few kV/cm. I estimate the energy
of BL and characterize the conditions of its possible experimental generation.
The estimation is given of the surface tension of BL. The possibility of the
"hot" and the most realistic thermodynamic non-equilibrium "cold" BL is
discussed. Here we presented preliminary evaluations preceding the more
detailed work in Arxiv.org [11].
