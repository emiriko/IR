The study of rotation-alignment of quasiparticles probes sensitively the
properties of high-j intruder orbits. The distribution of very high-j orbits,
which are consequences of the fundamental spin-orbit interaction, links with
the important question of single-particle levels in superheavy nuclei. With the
deformed single-particle states generated by the standard Nilsson potential, we
perform Projected-Shell-Model calculations for transfermium nuclei where
detailed spectroscopy experiment is currently possible. Specifically, we study
the systematical behavior of rotation-alignment and associated band-crossing
phenomenon in Cf, Fm, and No isotopes. Neutrons and protons from the high-j
orbits are found to compete strongly in rotation-alignment, which gives rise to
testable effects. Observation of these effects will provide direct information
on the single-particle states in the heaviest nuclear mass region.
