We prove for finite reductive groups $G$ of classical type, that every
irreducible character of $L$ extends to its inertia group in $N$, where $L$ is
an abelian centraliser of a Sylow $d$-torus $\mathbf S$ of $G$ and
$N:=N_G(\mathbf S)$. This gives a precise description of the irreducible
characters of $N$. Furthermore it enables us to verify the McKay conjecture in
this situation for $G$ and some primes.
