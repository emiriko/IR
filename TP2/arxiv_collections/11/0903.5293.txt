Achieving coherent quantum control over massive mechanical resonators is a
current research goal. Nano- and micromechanical devices can be coupled to a
variety of systems, for example to single electrons by electrostatic or
magnetic coupling, and to photons by radiation pressure or optical dipole
forces. So far, all such experiments have operated in a regime of weak
coupling, in which reversible energy exchange between the mechanical device and
its coupled partner is suppressed by fast decoherence of the individual systems
to their local environments. Controlled quantum experiments are in principle
not possible in such a regime, but instead require strong coupling. So far,
this has been demonstrated only between microscopic quantum systems, such as
atoms and photons (in the context of cavity quantum electrodynamics) or solid
state qubits and photons. Strong coupling is an essential requirement for the
preparation of mechanical quantum states, such as squeezed or entangled states,
and also for using mechanical resonators in the context of quantum information
processing, for example, as quantum transducers. Here we report the observation
of optomechanical normal mode splitting, which provides unambiguous evidence
for strong coupling of cavity photons to a mechanical resonator. This paves the
way towards full quantum optical control of nano- and micromechanical devices.
