Everett's concept of relative state is used to introduce a geometric phase
that depends nontrivially on entanglement in a pure quantum state. We show that
this phase can be measured in multiparticle interferometry. A
correlation-dependent generalization of the relative state geometric phase to
mixed quantum states is outlined.
