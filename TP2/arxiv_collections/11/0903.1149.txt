In this paper, we study coherent exciton transport of continuous-time quantum
walks on star graph. Exact analytical results of the transition probabilities
are obtained by means of the Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization of the
eigenstates. Our results show that the coherent exciton transport displays
perfect revivals and strong localization on the initial node. When the initial
excitation starts at the central node, the transport on star graph is
equivalent to the transport on a complete graph of the same size.
