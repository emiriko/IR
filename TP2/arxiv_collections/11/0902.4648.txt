We investigate the effect of macromolecular crowding on protein folding,
using purely repulsive crowding particles and a self-organizing polymer model
of protein folding. We find that the thermodynamics of folding for typical
alpha-, beta- and alpha/beta-proteins are well described by an adaptation of
the scaled particle theory (SPT). In this approach, the native state,
transition state, and the unfolded protein are treated as effective hard
spheres with radii approximately independent of the size and concentration of
the crowders. The same model predicts the effect of crowding on the folding
barrier and therefore refolding rates with no adjustable parameters. A simple
extension of the SPT model, assuming additivity, can also describe the behavior
of mixtures of crowding particles.
