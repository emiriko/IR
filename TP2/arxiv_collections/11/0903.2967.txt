We apply results from Baryshnikov, Brady, Bressler and Pemantle (2008) to
compute limiting probability profiles for various quantum random walks in one
and two dimensions. Using analytic machinery we show some features of the limit
distribution that are not evident in an empirical intensity plot of the time
10,000 distribution. Some conjectures are stated and computational techniques
are discussed as well.
