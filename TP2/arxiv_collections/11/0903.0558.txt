The fluctuation dissipation theorem (FDT) is studied close to the glass
transition in colloidal suspensions under steady shear. Shear breaks detailed
balance in the many-particle Smoluchowski equation, and gives response
functions in the stationary state which are smaller at long times than
estimated from the equilibrium FDT. During the final shear-driven decay, an
asymptotically constant relation connects response and fluctuations, restoring
the form of the FDT with, however, a ratio different from the equilibrium one.
