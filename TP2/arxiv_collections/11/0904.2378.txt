In this letter we report the first room temperature gravimetric measurements
of hydrogen absorption in nanoscale titanium-benzene complexes formed by laser
ablation in a benzene atmosphere in a UHV chamber. We are able to obtain a 6%
by weight absorption as predicted by recent density functional theory based
calculations under the conditions of low benzene pressure (35 milli-torr) and
for sub-monolayer samples. For samples synthesized under higher benzene
pressures we find a systematic degradation of the hydrogen absorption.
