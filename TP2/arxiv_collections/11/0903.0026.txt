Computational experiments are used to show that grain boundary mobility is
independent of driving force in a two-dimensional, square-lattice Ising model
with Metropolis kinetics. This is established over the entire Monte Carlo
temperature range. A calibration methodology is then introduced which endows
the Monte Carlo algorithm with time and length scales and allows the Monte
Carlo parameters to be expressed directly in terms of experimentally measurable
parameters. A comparison of results obtained for a variety of driving forces
and temperature conditions indicates that such Calibrated Monte Carlo models
are able to capture the grain boundary kinetics predicted by sharp-interface
theory.
