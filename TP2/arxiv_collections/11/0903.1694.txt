Using both two orbital and five orbital models, we investigate the
quasiparticle interference (QPI) patterns in the superconducting (SC) state of
iron-based superconductors. We compare the results for nonmagnetic and magnetic
impurities in sign-changed s-wave $\cos(k_x)\cdot\cos(k_y)$ and sign-unchanged
$|\cos(k_x)\cdot\cos(k_y)|$ SC states. While the patterns strongly depend on
the chosen band structures, the sensitivity of peaks around $(\pm\pi,0)$ and
$(0,\pm\pi)$ wavevectors on magnetic or non-magnetic impurity, and sign change
or sign unchanged SC orders is common in two models. Our results strongly
suggest that QPI may provide direct information of band structures and evidence
of the pairing symmetry in the SC states.
