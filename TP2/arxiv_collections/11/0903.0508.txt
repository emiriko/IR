We find a system of two polynomial equations in two unknowns, whose solution
allows to give an explicit expression of the conformal representation of a
simply connected three sheeted compact Riemann surface onto the extended
complex plane. This function appears in the description of the ratio asymptotic
of multiple orthogonal polynomials with respect to so called Nikishin systems
of two measures.
