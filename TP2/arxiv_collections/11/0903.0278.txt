Graphane is a two-dimensional system consisting of a single planar layer of
fully saturated (sp$^3$ hybridization) carbon atoms with H atoms attached to
them in an alternating pattern (up and down with relation to the plane defined
by the carbon atoms). Stable graphane structures were theoretically predicted
to exist some years ago and just experimentally realized through hydrogenation
of graphene membranes. In this work we have investigated using \textit{ab
initio} and reactive molecular dynamics the role of H frustration (breaking the
H atoms up and down alternating pattern) in graphane-like structures. Our
results show that H frustration significantly contributes to lattice
contraction. The dynamical aspects of converting graphene to graphane is also
addressed.
