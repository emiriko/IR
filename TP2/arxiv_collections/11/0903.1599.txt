A nuclear model is extended to estimate binding energies and radii of
neutron-rich nuclei. These calculations have been made for some representative
examples of even-Z and odd-Z nuclei with nucleon numbers lower than sixty. A
comparison of results with experimental data supports the value and development
of the model in nuclear studies.
