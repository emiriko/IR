The growth and characterization of epitaxial Co3O4(111) films grown by oxygen
plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy on single crystalline a-Al2O3(0001) is
reported. The Co3O4(111) grows single crystalline with the epitaxial relation
Co3O4(111)[-12-1]||a-Al2O3(0001)[10-10], as determined from in situ electron
diffraction. Film stoichiometry is confirmed by x-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy, while ex situ x-ray diffraction measurements show that the Co3O4
films are fully relaxed. Post-growth annealing induces significant
modifications in the film morphology, including a sharper Co3O4/a-Al2O3
interface and improved surface crystallinity, as shown by x-ray reflectometry,
atomic force microscopy and electron diffraction measurements. Despite being
polar, the surface of both as-grown and annealed Co3O4(111) films are (1 * 1),
which can be explained in terms of inversion in the surface spinel structure.
