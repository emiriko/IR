The CALICE collaboration has constructed highly granular electromagnetic and
hadronic calorimeter prototypes to evaluate technologies for the use in
detector systems at the future International Linear Collider. These
calorimeters have been tested extensively in particle beams at CERN and at
Fermilab. We present preliminary results of an analysis of hadronic events in
the combined system under test at CERN in 2006 and 2007, comprising a SiW ECAL,
a scintillator tile HCAL and a scintillator strip tail catcher, the latter two
with SiPM readout. The properties of hadronic showers in the HCAL, compared to
simulations performed with GEANT4, are discussed. Particular emphasis is placed
on the study of the linearity of the detector response and on the single
particle energy resolution achievable with simple weighting algorithms based on
the local energy density in the hadronic showers.
