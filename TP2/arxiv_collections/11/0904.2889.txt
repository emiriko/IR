Motivated by investigations of the tridiagonal pairs of linear
transformations, we introduce the augmented tridiagonal algebra ${\mathcal
T}_q$. This is an infinite-dimensional associative ${\mathbb C}$-algebra with
1. We classify the finite-dimensional irreducible representations of ${\mathcal
T}_q$. All such representations are explicitly constructed via embeddings of
${\mathcal T}_q$ into the $U_q(sl_2)$-loop algebra. As an application,
tridiagonal pairs over ${\mathbb C}$ are classified in the case where $q$ is
not a root of unity.
