We have obtained the first constraints on extended Ly-alpha emission at z ~ 1
in a sample of five radio galaxies. We detect Ly-alpha emission from four of
the five galaxies. The Ly-alpha luminosities range from 0.1 - 4 times 10^43
erg/s and are much smaller than those observed for halos around higher redshift
radio galaxies. If the z ~ 1 radio galaxies are the descendents the z >~ 2
radio galaxies, then their Ly-alpha luminosities evolve strongly with redshift
as ~(1+z)^5. There do not appear to be strong correlations between other
parameters, such as radio power, suggesting that this observed evolution is
real and not an observational artifact or secondary correlation. We speculate
that this evolution of luminous halos may be due to gas depletion (as gas
cools, settles, and forms stars) accompanied by an overall rise in the mean gas
temperature and a decrease in specific star-formation rate in and around these
massive galaxies.
