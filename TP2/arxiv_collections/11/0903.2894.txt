The proton capture on the unstable nuclei plays a very important role for the
nucleonsynthesis. The 12N(p,g)13O reaction rates at the energies of
astrophysical interests are estimated with the spectroscopic factor and
asymptotic normalization coefficient methods. The present results show that the
12N(p,g)13O reaction may play an important role in x-ray bursts.
