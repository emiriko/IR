Integral expressions for positive-part moments E X_+^p (p>0) of random
variables X are presented, in terms of the Fourier-Laplace or Fourier
transforms of the distribution of X. A necessary and sufficient condition for
the validity of such an expression is given. This study was motivated by
extremal problems in probability and statistics, where one needs to evaluate
such positive-part moments.
