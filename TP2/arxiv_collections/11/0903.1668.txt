We investigate the dephasing suffered by a nonrelativistic quantum particle
within a conformally fluctuating spacetime geometry. Starting from a minimally
coupled massive Klein-Gordon field, the low velocity limit yields an effective
Schrodinger equation where the wave function couples to gravity through an
effective nonlinear potential induced by the conformal fluctuations. The
quantum evolution is studied through a Dyson expansion scheme up to second
order. We show that only the nonlinear part of the potential can induce
dephasing. This happens through an exponential decay of the off diagonal terms
of the particle density matrix. The bath of conformal radiation is modeled in
3-dimensions and its statistical properties are described in general in terms
of a power spectral density. The case of a Lorentz invariant spectral density,
allowing to model vacuum fluctuations at a low energy domain, is investigated
and a general formula describing the loss of coherence derived. This depends
quadratically on the particle mass and on the inverse cube of a typical
particle dependent cutoff scale. Finally, the possibilities for experimental
verification are discussed. It is shown that current interferometry experiments
cannot detect such an effect. However this conclusion may improve by using high
mass entangled quantum states.
