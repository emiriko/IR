We are studying the impact of HII regions on star formation in their
associated molecular clouds. In this paper we present JCMT RxA molecular line
observations of S175 and environs. This is the first within a sample of ten HII
regions and their surrounding molecular clouds selected for our study. We first
make 7'x 7' maps in $^{12}$CO(2-1), which are used to investigate the structure
of the cloud and to identify individual clumps. Single point observations were
made in $^{13}$CO(2-1) and CS(5-4) at the peak of the $^{12}$CO(2-1) emission
within each clump in order to measure the physical properties of the gas.
Densities, temperatures, clump masses, peak velocities, and line widths were
measured and calculated using these observations. We have identified two
condensations (S175A and S175B) in the molecular cloud associated with this HII
region. S175A is adjacent to the ionization front and is expected to be
affected by the HII region while S175B is too distant to be disturbed. We
compare the structure and gas properties of these two regions to investigate
how the molecular gas has been affected by the HII region.
  S175A has been heated by the HII region and partially compressed by the
ionized gas front, but contrary to our expectation it is a quiescent region
while S175B is very turbulent and dynamically active. Our investigation for the
source of turbulence in S175B resulted in the detection of an outflow within
this region.
