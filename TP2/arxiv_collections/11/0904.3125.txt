We find point-like and classical string solutions on the AdS_5 x X^5, where
X^5 are the 5-dimensional Sasaki-Einstein manifolds Ypq and Lpqr. The number of
acceptable solutions is limited drastically in order to satisfy the constraints
on the parameters and coordinates of the manifolds. The energy of the solutions
depends on the parameters of the Sasaki-Einstein manifolds and on the conserved
momenta transcendentally. A discussion on BPS solutions is presented as well.
