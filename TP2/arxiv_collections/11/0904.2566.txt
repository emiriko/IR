A sample of 18 long-lag (tau_{lag} > 1 s) Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) has been
drawn from our catalog of all Swift long GRBs. Four different tests are done on
this sample to test the prediction that a large fraction of long-lag GRBs are
from our Local Supercluster. The results of these four tests come out that: (1)
the distribution of these GRBs shows no tendency towards the Supergalactic
plane; (2) the distribution shows no tendency towards the Virgo or Coma
Cluster; (3) no associated bright host galaxies (m <=15) in the Local
Supercluster are found for any of the 18 GRBs; (4) 17 of these 18 GRBs have
redshifts of z>0.5, which are too far to be in the Local Supercluster. All
these results disproved the hypothesis that any significant fraction of
long-lag GRBs are from Local Supercluster. Hence these long-lag GRBs can not be
counted in the calculation of LIGO detection rates. An explanation of why we
can detect long-lag GRBs at high redshift is presented.
