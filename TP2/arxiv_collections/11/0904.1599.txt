In this article, existence results concerning temporal functions with
additional properties on a globally hyperbolic manifold are obtained. These
properties are certain bounds on geometric quantities as lapse and shift. The
results are linked to completeness properties and the existence of closed
isometric embeddings in Minkowski spaces.
