We examine various possibilities for realistic 5D higgsless models and
construct a full quark sector featuring next-to-minimal flavor violation (with
an exact bulk SU(2) protecting the first two generations) satisfying
electroweak and flavor constraints. The "new custodially protected
representation" is used for the third generation to protect the light quarks
from flavor violations induced due to the heavy top. A combination of flavor
symmetries, and RS-GIM for the right-handed quarks suppresses flavor-changing
neutral currents below experimental bounds, assuming CKM-type mixing on the UV
brane. In addition to the usual higgsless RS signals, this model predicts an
exotic charge-5/3 quark with mass of about 0.5 TeV which should show up at the
LHC very quickly, as well as nonzero flavor-changing neutral currents which
could be detected in the next generation of flavor experiments. In the course
of our analysis, we also find quantitative estimates for the errors of the
fermion zero mode approximation, which are significant for higgsless-type
models.
