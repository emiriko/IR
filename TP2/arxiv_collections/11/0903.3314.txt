A new layered oxypnictide (Fe2P2)(Sr4Sc2O6) have been synthesized by
solid-state reaction. This material has an alternating layer stacking structure
of anti-fluorite Fe2P2 and perovskite-based Sr4Sc2O6 oxide layers. Space group
of the material is P4/nmm and lattice constants a and c are 4.016 A and 15.543
A, respectively. The interlayer Fe-Fe distance corresponding to the c-axis
length is the longest ever reported in the iron-based oxypnictide systems. In
both magnetization and resistivity measurements, the present compound exhibited
superconductivity below 17 K, which is much higher than that of LaFePO and the
highest in arsenic-free iron-based oxypnictide systems under ambient pressure.
