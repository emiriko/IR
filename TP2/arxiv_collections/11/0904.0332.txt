We demonstrate a current-controlled, dynamic magnonic crystal. It consists of
a ferrite film whose internal magnetic field exhibits a periodic, cosine-like
variation. The field modulation is created by a direct current flowing through
an array of parallel wires placed on top of a spin-wave waveguide. A single,
pronounced rejection band in the spin-wave transmission characteristics is
formed due to spin-wave scattering from the inhomogeneous magnetic field. With
increasing current the rejection band depth and its width increase strongly.
The magnonic crystal allows a fast control of its operational characteristics
via the applied direct current. Simulations confirm the experimental results.
