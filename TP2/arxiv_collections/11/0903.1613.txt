In the preceding paper [T. Fabcic et al., preprint] "restricted Gaussian wave
packets" were introduced for the regularized Coulomb problem in the
four-dimensional Kustaanheimo-Stiefel coordinates, and their exact time
propagation was derived analytically in a fictitious time variable. We now
establish the Gaussian wave packet method for the hydrogen atom in static
external fields. A superposition of restricted Gaussian wave packets is used as
a trial function in the application of the time-dependent variational
principle. The external fields introduce couplings between the basis states.
The set of coupled wave packets is propagated numerically, and eigenvalues of
the Schrodinger equation are obtained by the frequency analysis of the time
autocorrelation function. The advantage of the wave packet propagation in the
fictitious time variable is that the computations are exact for the field-free
hydrogen atom and approximations from the time-dependent variational principle
only stem from the external fields. Examples are presented for the hydrogen
atom in a magnetic field and in crossed electric and magnetic fields.
