When revisiting the Faber-Krahn inequality for the principal $p$-Laplacian
eigenvalue of a bounded open set in $\mathbb R^n$ with smooth boundary, we
simply rename it as the $p$-Faber-Krahn inequality and interestingly find that
this inequality may be improved but also characterized through Maz'ya's
capacity method, the Euclidean volume, the Sobolev type inequality and
Moser-Trudinger's inequality.
