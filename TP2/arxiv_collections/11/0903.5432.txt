We report the formation of colloidal complexes resulting from the
electrostatic co-assembly between anionic surfactants and cationic
polyelectrolytes or block copolymers. Combining light and x-ray scattering
experiments with cryogenic transmission and optical microscopy, we emphasize a
feature rarely addressed in the formation of the electrostatic complexes,
namely the role of the mixing concentration on the microstructure. At low
mixing concentration, electrostatic complexes made from cationic-neutral
copolymers and alkyl sulfate surfactants exhibit spherical core-shell
microstructures. With increasing concentration, the complexes undergo a
sphere-to-cylinder transition, yielding elongated aggregates with diameter 50
nm and length up to several hundreds of nanometers. From the comparison between
homo- and diblock polymer phase behaviors, it is suggested that the
unidimensional growth is driven by the ability of the surfactant to
self-assemble into cylindrical micelles, and in particular when these
surfactants are complexed with oppositely charged polymers.
