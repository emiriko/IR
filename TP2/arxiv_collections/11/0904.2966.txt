We investigate theoretically the creation, persistence and detection of
quantized vortices in nonequilibrium polariton condensates within a stochastic
classical field model. The life time of the quantized vortices is shown to
increase with the spatial coherence and to depend on the geometry of the
condensate. The relation with superfluidity in conventional superfluids is
discussed. Three different ways to measure the vorticity of the polariton
condensate are proposed.
