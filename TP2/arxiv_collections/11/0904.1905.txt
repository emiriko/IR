We report a crossover in optical propagation in random layered media from
localization towards diffusion as the interaction of the wave with the sample
is transformed from one to three-dimensional due to nonuniformity in the layer
thickness. The crossover occurs at the point that the lateral spread of the
wave equals the transverse coherence length in the transmitted speckle pattern.
