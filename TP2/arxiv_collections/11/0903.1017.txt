Categories of partial functions have become increasingly important
principally because of their applications in theoretical computer science. In
this note we prove that the category of partial bijections between sets as an
inverse-Baer*-category with closed projections and in which the idempotent
split is an exact category. Finally the Noether isomorphism theorems are given
for this exact category.
