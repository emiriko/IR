Invariance properties of a physical system govern its behavior: energy
conservation in turbulence drives a wide distribution of energy among modes, as
observed in geophysics, astrophysics and engineering. In hydrodynamic
turbulence, the role of helicity (which measures departures from mirror
symmetry) remains unclear since it does not alter this distribution. However,
the interplay of rotation and helicity leads to significant differences. Using
numerical simulations we show the occurence of long-lived laminar cyclonic
vortices together with turbulent vortices, reminiscent of recent tornado
observations. Furthermore, the small scales are completely self-similar with no
deviations from Gaussianity. This result points to the discovery of a small
parameter in rotating helical turbulence.
