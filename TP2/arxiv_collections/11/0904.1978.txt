Plasma instabilities can be encountered in many branches of physics. This
work focuses on relativistic plasmas with applications in theoretical
astrophysics and particle accelerator physics. Even though these fields seem to
be unrelated the underlying plasma physics processes are often very similar.
Two plasma instabilities - the beam-beam instability and the coherent
synchrotron radiation instability - are analyzed. The former severely limits
the achievable luminosity in storage rings and is related to the two-stream
instability which has been proposed as a candidate for the radiation mechanism
of radio pulsars. The main emphasis is on coherent synchrotron radiation which
can lead to prohibitive energy losses in bunch compressors. Coherent
synchrotron radiation also makes up the intense emission of radio waves by
pulsars. Simple models based on the linearized Vlasov equation and relativistic
magnetohydrodynamics which allow to compute detailed spectra of the emitted
radiation are developed.
