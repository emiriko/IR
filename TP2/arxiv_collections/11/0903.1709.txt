We tune the thermodynamics of hydrogen absorption in Mg by means of elastic
clamping. The loading isotherms measured by hydrogenography show that Mg films
covered with Mg-alloy-forming elements, such as Pd and Ni, have hydrogen
plateau pressures more than two orders of magnitude higher than bulk Mg at the
same temperature. An elastic model allows us to interpret the Mg thickness
dependence of the hydrogen plateau pressure. Our results provide the basis for
the development of new hydrogen storage materials with excellent thermodynamic
properties.
