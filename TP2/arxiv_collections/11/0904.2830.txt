A new step-by-step diagonalization procedure for evaluating exact solutions
of the nuclear deformed mean-field plus pairing interaction model is proposed
via a simple Bethe ansatz in each step from which the eigenvalues and
corresponding eigenstates can be obtained progressively. This new approach
draws upon an observation that the original one- plus two-body problem in a
$k$-particle Hilbert subspace can be mapped unto a one-body grand hard-core
boson picture that can be solved step by step with a simple Bethe ansatz known
from earlier work. Based on this new procedure, it is further shown that the
extended pairing model for deformed nuclei [Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 112503 (2004)
] is similar to the standard pairing model with the first step approximation,
in which only the lowest energy eigenstate of the standard pure pairing
interaction part is taken into consideration. Our analysis show that the
standard pairing model with the first step approximation displays similar pair
structures of first few exact low-lying states of the model, which, therefore,
provides a link between the two models.
