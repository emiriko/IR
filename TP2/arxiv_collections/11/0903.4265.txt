We introduce a new method which enables us to calculate the coefficients of
the poles of local zeta functions very precisely and prove some explicit
formulas. Some vanishing theorems for the candidate poles of local zeta
functions will be also given. Moreover we apply our method to oscillating
integrals and obtain an explicit formula for the coefficients of their
asymptotic expansions.
