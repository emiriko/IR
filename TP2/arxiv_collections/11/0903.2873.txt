We synthesized tetragonal alpha-FeSe by melting a powder mixture of iron and
selenium at high pressure. Subsequent annealing at normal pressure results in
removing traces of hexagonal beta- FeSe, formation of a rather sharp transition
to superconducting state at Tc ~ 7 K, and the appearance of a magnetic
transition near Tm = 120 K. Resistivity and ac-susceptibility were measured on
the annealed sample at hydrostatic pressure up to 4.5 GPa. A magnetic
transition visible in ac-susceptibility shifts down under pressure and the
resistive anomaly typical for a spin density wave (SDW) antiferromagnetic
transition develops near the susceptibility anomaly. Tc determined by the
appearance of a diamagnetic response in susceptibility, increases linearly
under pressure at a rate dTc/dP = 3.5 K/GPa. Below 1.5 GPa, the resistive
superconducting transition is sharp; the width of transition does not change
with pressure; and, Tc determined by a peak in drho/dT increases at a rate ~
3.5 K/GPa. At higher pressure, a giant broadening of the resistive transition
develops. This effect cannot be explained by possible pressure gradients in the
sample and is inherent to alpha-FeSe. The dependences drho(T)/dT show a
signature for a second peak above 3 GPa which is indicative of the appearance
of another superconducting state in alpha-FeSe at high pressure. We argue that
this second superconducting phase coexists with SDW antiferromagnetism in a
partial volume fraction and originates from pairing of charge carriers from
other sheets of the Fermi surface.
