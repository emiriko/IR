The MiniBooNE Collaboration reports a search for \numu and \numubar
disappearance in the \dmsq region of a few \evsq. These measurements are
important for constraining models with extra types of neutrinos, extra
dimensions an d CPT violation. Fits to the shape of the \numu and \numubar
energy spectra reveal no evidence for disappearance at 90% confidence level
(CL) in either mode. This is the first test of \numubar disappearance between
\dmsq=0.1-10\evsq.
