We study a system of two coupled kicked rotors, both classically and quantum
mechanically, for a wide range of coupling parameters. This was motivated by
two published reports, one of which reported quantum localization, while the
other reported diffusion. The classical systems are chaotic, and exhibit normal
diffusive behavior. In the quantum systems, we found different regimes,
depending on the strength of the coupling. For weak coupling, we found quantum
localization similar to that exhibited by single kicked rotors. For strong
coupling, we found a quasi-diffusive growth of the width of the momentum
distribution, in which the apparent diffusion coefficient decreased as time
increased. The behavior in this regime can be described by the scaling theory
of weak localization for two-dimensional disordered lattices. The weak and
strong coupling regimes are separated by a regime of complex intermediate
behavior. Thus we explain the apparent contradiction in the literature as being
due to qualitatively different regimes of behavior, which we call strong and
weak quantum localization.
