We calculate the production rates of the second Kaluza-Klein (KK) photon
$\gamma^{(2)}$ and Z boson $Z^{(2)}$ at the LHC including all significant
processes in the minimal universal extra dimension (MUED) model. For
discrimination of the MUED model from other TeV scale models in hadron collider
experiments, $\gamma^{(2)}$ and $Z^{(2)}$ play a crucial role. In order to
discuss the discrimination and calculate their production rates, we derive
effective Lagrangian containing KK number violating operators. We show that KK
number violating processes are extremely important for the compactification
scale larger than 800 GeV. We find that, with an integrated luminosity of 100
fb$^{-1}$, $\gamma^{(2)}$ and $Z^{(2)}$ are produced 10$^6$ - 10$^2$ for the
compactification scale between 400 GeV and 2000 GeV.
