We investigate a slowly rotating black hole in four-dimensional extended
Chern-Simons modified gravity. We obtain an approximate solution that reduces
to the Kerr solution when a coupling constant vanishes. The Chern-Simons
correction effectively reduces the frame-dragging effect around a black hole in
comparison with that of the Kerr solution.
