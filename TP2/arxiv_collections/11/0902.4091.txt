Single scale quantities, as anomalous dimensions and hard scattering cross
sections, in renormalizable Quantum Field Theories are found to obey difference
equations of finite order in Mellin space. It is often easier to calculate
fixed moments for these quantities compared to a direct attempt to derive them
in terms of harmonic sums and their generalizations involving the Mellin
parameter $N$. Starting from a sufficiently large number of given moments, we
establish linear recurrence relations of lowest possible order with polynomial
coefficients of usually high degree. Then these recurrence equations are solved
in terms of d'Alembertian solutions where the involved nested sums are
represented in optimal nested depth. Given this representation, it is then an
easy task to express the result in terms of harmonic sums. In this process we
compactify the result such that no algebraic relations occur among the sums
involved. We demonstrate the method for the QCD unpolarized anomalous
dimensions and massless Wilson coefficients to 3--loop order treating the
contributions for individual color coefficients. For the most complicated
subproblem 5114 moments were needed in order to produce a recurrence of order
35 whose coefficients have degrees up to 938. About four months of CPU time
were needed to establish and solve the recurrences for the anomalous dimensions
and Wilson coefficients on a 2 GHz machine requiring less than 10 GB of memory.
No algorithm is known yet to provide such a high number of moments for 3--loop
quantities. Yet the method presented shows that it is possible to establish and
solve recurrences of rather large order and and degree, occurring in physics
problems, uniquely, fast and reliably with computer algebra.
