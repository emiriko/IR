The influence of randomly distributed point impurities and planar defects on
order and transport in type-II superconductors and related systems is studied.
It is shown that the Bragg glass phase is unstable with respect to planar
efects. Even a single weak defect plane oriented parallel to the magnetic field
as well as to one of the main axis of the Abrikosov flux line lattice is a
relevant perturbation in the Bragg glass. A defect that is aligned with the
magnetic field restores the flux density oscillations which decay algebraically
with the distance from the defect. The theory exhibits striking similarities to
the physics of a Luttinger liquid with a frozen impurity. The exponent for the
flux line creep in the direction perpendicular to a relevant defect is derived.
We find that the flux line lattice exhibits in the presence of many randomly
distributed parallel planar defects aligned to the magnetic field a new glassy
phase which we call planar glass. The planar glass is characterized by
diverging shear and tilt moduli, a transverse Meissner effect, resistance
against shear deformations. We also obtain sample to sample fluctuations of the
longitudinal magnetic susceptibility and an exponential decay of translational
long range order in the direction perpendicular to the defects. The flux creep
perpendicular to the defects leads to a nonlinear resistivity $\rho(J \to
0)\sim \exp[-(J_D/J)^{3/2}]$. Strong planar defects enforce arrays of
dislocations that are located at the defects with a Burgers vector parallel to
the defects in order to relax shear strain.
