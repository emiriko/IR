The advent of high transverse-field muon spin rotation (TF-muSR) has led to
recent muSR investigations of the magnetic-field response of cuprates above the
superconducting transition temperature T_c. Here the results of such
experiments on hole-doped cuprates are reviewed. Although these investigations
are currently ongoing, it is clear that the effects of high field on the
internal magnetic field distribution of these materials is dependent upon a
competition between superconductivity and magnetism. In La_{2-x}Sr_xCuO_4 the
response to the external field above Tc is dominated by heterogeneous spin
magnetism. However, the magnetism that dominates the observed inhomogeneous
line broadening below x ~ 0.19 is overwhelmed by the emergence of a completely
different kind of magnetism in the heavily overdoped regime. The origin of the
magnetism above x ~ 0.19 is currently unknown, but its presence hints at a
competition between superconductivity and magnetism that is reminiscent of the
underdoped regime. In contrast, the width of the internal field distribution of
underdoped YBa_2Cu_3O_y above Tc is observed to track Tc and the density of
superconducting carriers. This observation suggests that the magnetic response
above Tc is not dominated by electronic moments, but rather inhomogeneous
fluctuating superconductivity.
