This article reviews the basic computational techniques for carrying out
multi-scale simulations using statistical methods, with the focus on
simulations of epitaxial growth. First, the statistical-physics background
behind Monte Carlo simulations is briefly described. The kinetic Monte Carlo
(kMC) method is introduced as an extension of the more wide-spread
thermodynamic Monte Carlo methods, and algorithms for kMC simulations,
including parallel ones, are discussed in some detail. The step from the
atomistic picture to the more coarse-grained description of Monte Carlo
simulations is exemplified for the case of surface diffusion. Here, the aim is
the derivation of rate constants from knowledge about the underlying atomic
processes. Both the simple approach of Transition State Theory, as well as more
recent approaches using accelerated molecular dynamics are reviewed. Finally, I
address the point that simplifications often need to be introduced in practical
Monte Carlo simulations in order to reduce the complexity of 'real' atomic
processes. Different 'flavors' of kMC simulations and the potential pitfalls
related to the reduction of complexity are presented in the context of
simulations of epitaxial growth.
