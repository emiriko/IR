To meet the Basel II regulatory requirements for the Advanced Measurement
Approaches, the bank's internal model must include the use of internal data,
relevant external data, scenario analysis and factors reflecting the business
environment and internal control systems. Quantification of operational risk
cannot be based only on historical data but should involve scenario analysis.
Historical internal operational risk loss data have limited ability to predict
future behaviour moreover, banks do not have enough internal data to estimate
low frequency high impact events adequately. Historical external data are
difficult to use due to different volumes and other factors. In addition,
internal and external data have a survival bias, since typically one does not
have data of all collapsed companies. The idea of scenario analysis is to
estimate frequency and severity of risk events via expert opinions taking into
account bank environment factors with reference to events that have occurred
(or may have occurred) in other banks. Scenario analysis is forward looking and
can reflect changes in the banking environment. It is important to not only
quantify the operational risk capital but also provide incentives to business
units to improve their risk management policies, which can be accomplished
through scenario analysis. By itself, scenario analysis is very subjective but
combined with loss data it is a powerful tool to estimate operational risk
losses. Bayesian inference is a statistical technique well suited for combining
expert opinions and historical data. In this paper, we present examples of the
Bayesian inference methods for operational risk quantification.
