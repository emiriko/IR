The canonical Schmidt decomposition of quantum states is discussed and its
implementation to the Quantum Computation Simulator is outlined. In particular,
the semiorder relation in the space of quantum states induced by the
lexicographic semiorder of the space of the Schmidt coefficients is discussed.
The appropriate sorting algorithms on the corresponding POSETs consisting from
quantum states are formulated and theirs computer implementations are being
tested.
