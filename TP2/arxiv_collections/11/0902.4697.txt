In the minimal supersymmetric extension to the Standard Model, a non-zero
lepton number violating coupling lambda'_111 predicts both neutrinoless double
beta decay and resonant single slepton production at the LHC. We show that, in
this case, if neutrinoless double beta decay is discovered in the next
generation of experiments, there exist good prospects to observe single slepton
production at the LHC. Neutrinoless double beta decay could otherwise result
from a different source (such as a non-zero Majorana neutrino mass). Resonant
single slepton production at the LHC can therefore discriminate between the
lambda'_111 neutrinoless double beta decay mechanism and others.
