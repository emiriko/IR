We demonstrate that metamaterial devices requiring anisotropic dielectric
permittivity and magnetic permeability may be emulated by specially designed
tapered waveguides. This approach leads to low-loss, broadband performance.
Based on this technique, we demonstrate broadband electromagnetic cloaking in
the visible frequency range on a scale ~100 times larger than the wavelength.
