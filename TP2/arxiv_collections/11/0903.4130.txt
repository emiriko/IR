Improving the structure and analysis in \cite{elm0}, we give a variation of
the pairing heaps that has amortized zero cost per meld (compared to an $O(\log
\log{n})$ in \cite{elm0}) and the same amortized bounds for all other
operations. More precisely, the new pairing heap requires: no cost per meld,
O(1) per find-min and insert, $O(\log{n})$ per delete-min, and $O(\log\log{n})$
per decrease-key. These bounds are the best known for any self-adjusting heap,
and match the lower bound proved by Fredman for a family of such heaps.
Moreover, the changes we have done make our structure even simpler than that in
\cite{elm0}.
