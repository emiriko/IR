In a one dimensional superconductor where current driven phase transitions
occur between superconducting and normal phases, both the phases coexist in a
metastable regime over a wide range of current near the critical current $j_c$.
A lot of spatio-temporal localized forms of the the competing phases have been
identified in this so called resistive regime. In this paper we present the
relation that selects the closed conjugate form for the other order parameter
when that of the one of two competing states is known. Our main observation is
that, the free energy surface the system remains predominantly bound to in the
resistive regime is dominated by the quadratic term of the phenomenological
Ginzburg-Landau potential.
