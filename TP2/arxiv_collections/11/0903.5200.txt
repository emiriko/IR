In this article, we assume that there exists a scalar $D_s^\ast {\bar
D}_s^\ast$ molecular state in the $J/\psi \phi$ invariant mass distribution,
and study its mass using the QCD sum rules. The predictions depend heavily on
the two criteria (pole dominance and convergence of the operator product
expansion) of the QCD sum rules. The value of the mass is about $M_{D_s^\ast
{\bar D}_s^\ast}=(4.43\pm0.16) \rm{GeV}$, which is inconsistent with the
experimental data. The $D_s^\ast {\bar D}_s^\ast$ is probably a virtual state
and not related to the meson Y(4140). Other possibility, such as a hybrid
charmonium is not excluded.
