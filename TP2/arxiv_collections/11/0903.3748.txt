Susceptibility measurements of patterned thin films at sub-K temperatures
were carried out using a scanning SQUID microscope that can resolve signals
corresponding to a few hundred Bohr magnetons. Several metallic and insulating
thin films, even oxide-free Au films, show a paramagnetic response with a
temperature dependence that indicates unpaired spins as the origin. The
observed response exhibits a measurable out-of-phase component, which implies
that these spins will create 1/f-like magnetic noise. The measured spin density
is consistent with recent explanations of low frequency flux noise in SQUIDs
and superconducting qubits in terms of spin fluctuations, and suggests that
such unexpected spins may be even more ubiquitous than already indicated by
earlier measurements. Our measurements set several constraints on the nature of
these spins.
