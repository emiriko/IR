When a three-level quantum system is irradiated by an intense coupling field
resonant with one of the three possible transitions, the absorption peak of an
additional probe field involving the remaining level is split. This process is
known in quantum optics as the Autler-Townes effect. We observe these phenomena
in a superconducting Josephson phase qubit, which can be considered an
"artificial atom" with a multilevel quantum structure. The spectroscopy peaks
can be explained reasonably well by a simple three-level Hamiltonian model.
Simulation of a more complete model (including dissipation, higher levels, and
cross-coupling) provides excellent agreement with all the experimental data.
