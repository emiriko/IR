Developmental transcriptional networks in plants and animals operate in both
space and time. To understand these transcriptional networks it is essential to
obtain whole-genome expression data at high spatiotemporal resolution.
Substantial amounts of spatial and temporal microarray expression data
previously have been obtained for the Arabidopsis root; however, these two
dimensions of data have not been integrated thoroughly. Complicating this
integration is the fact that these data are heterogeneous and incomplete, with
observed expression levels representing complex spatial or temporal mixtures.
Given these partial observations, we present a novel method for reconstructing
integrated high resolution spatiotemporal data. Our method is based on a new
iterative algorithm for finding approximate roots to systems of bilinear
equations.
