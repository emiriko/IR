We study the correlations (and alignment as a particular case) existent
between the fragments originated in a decaying process when the daughter
particles interact. The interaction between the particles is modeled using the
potential of coupled oscillators, which can be treated analytically. This
approach can be considered as a first step towards the characterization of
realistic interacting decaying systems, an archetypal process in physics. The
results presented here also suggest the possibility of manipulating
correlations using external fields, a technique that could be useful to provide
sources of entangled massive particles.
