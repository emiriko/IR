In this work we do an "interpolation" of Scardigli theory of a quantum-like
description of the planetary system that reproduces remarkable
Titius-Bode-Richardson rule. More precisely, instead of simple, approximate,
Bohr-like theory, or, accurate, Schr$\ddot{o}$dinger-like theory, considered by
Scardigli, we suggest originally a semi-accurate, de Broglie-like description
of the planetary system. Especially, we shall propose a de Broglie-like waves
in the planetary systems. More precisely, in distinction from Scardigly (which
postulated absence of the interference phenomena at planet orbits) we shall
prove that, roughly speaking, planets orbits equal a sum of natural numbers of
two types, large and small, of the de-Broglie-like waves. It is similar to
well-known situation in atomic physics by interpretation of Bohr momentum
quantization postulate by de Broglie relation.
