In certain situations the state of a quantum system, after transmission
through a quantum channel, can be perfectly restored. This can be done by
'coding' the state space of the system before transmission into a 'protected'
part of a larger state space, and by applying a proper 'decoding' map
afterwards. We investigate two kinds of protected subspaces: the error
correction subspaces and the dark subspaces. In neither case information leaks
out of the system, but in the second it is more difficult to restore the state.
Recent results on higher rank numerical ranges of operators are used to
construct examples. In particular, dark spaces are constructed for any map of
rank 2, for a biased permutations channel and for certain separable maps acting
on multipartite systems. Furthermore, error correction subspaces are provided
for a class of three unitary noise models.
