We present the first results from a high sampling rate, multi-month
reverberation mapping campaign undertaken primarily at MDM Observatory with
supporting observations from telescopes around the world. The primary goal of
this campaign was to obtain either new or improved Hbeta reverberation lag
measurements for several relatively low luminosity AGNs. We feature results for
NGC 4051 here because, until now, this object has been a significant outlier
from AGN scaling relationships, e.g., it was previously a ~2-3sigma outlier on
the relationship between the broad-line region (BLR) radius and the optical
continuum luminosity - the R_BLR-L relationship. Our new measurements of the
lag time between variations in the continuum and Hbeta emission line made from
spectroscopic monitoring of NGC 4051 lead to a measured BLR radius of R_BLR =
1.87 (+0.54 -0.50) light days and black hole mass of M_BH = 1.73 (+0.55 -0.52)
x 10^6 M_sun. This radius is consistent with that expected from the R_BLR-L
relationship, based on the present luminosity of NGC 4051 and the most current
calibration of the relation by Bentz et al. (2009a). We also present a
preliminary look at velocity-resolved Hbeta light curves and time delay
measurements, although we are unable to reconstruct an unambiguous
velocity-resolved reverberation signal.
