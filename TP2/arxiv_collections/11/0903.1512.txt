We study the phenomenology of supersymmetric models that explain neutrino
masses through the spontaneous breaking of R-parity, finding strong
correlations between the decays of the lightest neutralino and the neutrino
mixing angles. In addition, the existence of a Goldstone boson, usually called
Majoron ($J$), completely modifies the phenomenology with respect to the
standard picture, inducing large invisible branching ratios and charged lepton
decays, like $\mu \to e J$, interesting signals that can be used to constrain
the model.
