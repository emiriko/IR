We consider a partially spin-polarized atomic Fermi gas in a
high-aspect-ratio trap, with a flux of predominantly spin-up atoms exiting the
center of the trap. We argue that such a scenario can be produced by
evaporative cooling, and we find that it can result in a substantially
non-equilibrium polarization pattern for typical experimental parameters. We
offer this as a possible explanation for the quantitative discrepancies in
recent experiments on spin-imbalanced unitary Fermi gases.
