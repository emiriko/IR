Understanding the nature of the matter comprising the Solar System is crucial
for understanding the mechanism that generates the Earth's geomagnetic field
and the magnetic fields of other planets and satellites. The commonality in the
Solar System of matter like that of the inside of the Earth, together with
common nuclear reactor operating conditions,forms the basis for generalizing
the author's concept of nuclear geomagnetic field generation to planetary
magnetic field generation by natural planetocentric nuclear fission reactors.
