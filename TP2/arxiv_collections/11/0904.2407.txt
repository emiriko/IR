In previous work we showed that two apparently unrelated formulas for the
Hall-Littlewood polynomials of type A are, in fact, closely related. The first
is the tableau formula obtained by specializing q=0 in the Haglund-Haiman-Loehr
formula for Macdonald polynomials. The second is the type $A$ instance of
Schwer's formula (rephrased and rederived by Ram) for Hall-Littlewood
polynomials of arbitrary finite type; Schwer's formula is in terms of so-called
alcove walks, which originate in the work of Gaussent-Littelmann and of the
author with Postnikov on discrete counterparts to the Littelmann path model. We
showed that the tableau formula follows by "compressing" Ram's version of
Schwer's formula. In this paper, we derive tableau formulas for the
Hall-Littlewood polynomials of type B and C by compressing the corresponding
instances of Schwer's formula.
