The orbital magnetism in spatially varying magnetic fields is studied in
monolayer graphene within the effective mass approximation. We find that,
unlike the conventional two-dimensional electron system, graphene with small
Fermi wave number k_F works as a magnetic shield where the field produced by a
magnetic object placed above graphene is always screened by a constant factor
on the other side of graphene. The object is repelled by a diamagnetic force
from the graphene, as if there exists its mirror image with a reduced amplitude
on the other side of graphene. The magnitude of the force is much greater than
that of conventional two-dimensional system. The effect disappears with the
increase of k_F.
