In this work, we examine a two-Higgs-doublet extension of the Standard Model
in which one Higgs doublet is responsible for giving mass to both up- and
down-type quarks, while a separate doublet is responsible for giving mass to
leptons. We examine both the theoretical and experimental constraints on the
model and show that large regions of parameter space are allowed by these
constraints in which the effective couplings between the lightest neutral Higgs
scalar and the Standard-Model leptons are substantially enhanced. We
investigate the collider phenomenology of such a "leptophilic"
two-Higgs-doublet model and show that in cases where the low-energy spectrum
contains only one light, CP-even scalar, a variety of collider processes
essentially irrelevant for the discovery of a Standard Model Higgs boson
(specifically those in which the Higgs boson decays directly into a
charged-lepton pair) can contribute significantly to the discovery potential of
a light-to-intermediate-mass (m_h < 140 GeV) Higgs boson at the LHC.
