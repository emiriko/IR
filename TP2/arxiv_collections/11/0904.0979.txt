We present results of CHARYBDIS2, a new Monte Carlo simulation of black hole
production and decay at hadron colliders in theories with large extra
dimensions and TeV-scale gravity. The main new feature of CHARYBDIS2 is a full
treatment of the spin-down phase of the decay process using the angular and
energy distributions of the associated Hawking radiation. Also included are
improved modelling of the loss of angular momentum and energy in the production
process as well as a wider range of options for the Planck-scale termination of
the decay. The new features allow us to study the effects of black hole spin
and the feasibility of its observation in such theories.
