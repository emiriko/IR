The momentum distribution of electrons from semi-leptonic decays of charm and
bottom for mid-rapidity |y|<0.35 in p+p collisions at sqrt(s)=200 GeV is
measured by the PHENIX experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC)
over the transverse momentum range 2 < p_T < 7 GeV/c. The ratio of the yield of
electrons from bottom to that from charm is presented. The ratio is determined
using partial D/D^bar --> e^{+/-} K^{-/+} X (K unidentified) reconstruction. It
is found that the yield of electrons from bottom becomes significant above 4
GeV/c in p_T. A fixed-order-plus-next-to-leading-log (FONLL) perturbative
quantum chromodynamics (pQCD) calculation agrees with the data within the
theoretical and experimental uncertainties. The extracted total bottom
production cross section at this energy is \sigma_{b\b^bar}= 3.2
