We investigate the effect of disorder at various lattice sites outside the
CuO$_2$ plane on the superconducting critical temperature $T_c$ of the cuprate
superconductor Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ (Bi2212). The most effective
disorder turns out to be that at the Sr site in the neighboring blocks, which
contain apical-oxygen atoms. The Sr-site disorder reduces $T_c$ and also
produces a residual component ($\rho_0$) in the in-plane resistivity, the
magnitude of which is found to be proportional to the magnitude of $T_c$
reduction. We demonstrate that both $T_c$-degradation rate and $\rho_0$
decrease as the number of the CuO$_2$ planes increases in the unit cell, that
is, as the number of the neighboring SrO blocks decreases. In real crystals of
Bi-based cuprates, main source of disorder is Bi atoms randomly occupying the
Sr sites. We have succeeded in reducing the Bi content at Sr-sites as much as
possible and achieved $T_c$=98K, a high-$T_c$ record in Bi2212.
