A spatial light modulator (SLM) and a pair of galvanometer-mounted mirrors
(GMM) were combined into an optical tweezers set-up. This provides great
flexibility as the SLM creates an array of traps which can be moved smoothly
and quickly with the GMM. To optimise performance, the effect of the incidence
angle on the SLM with respect to phase and intensity response was investigated.
Although it is common to use the SLM at an incidence angle of 45 degrees,
smaller angles give a full 2pi phase shift and an output intensity which is
less dependent on the magnitude of the phase shift. The traps were calibrated
using an active oscillatory technique and a passive probability distribution
method.
