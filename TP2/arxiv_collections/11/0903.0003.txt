We use the novel Higgs mechanism of arXiv:0803.3218 to determine the leading
higher-derivative corrections to the Euclidean N = 8 Bagger-Lambert-Gustavsson
field theory. The result matches that previously found for Lorentzian
3-algebras, pointing to a universal answer for all maximally supersymmetric
3-algebra theories. We also comment on the extension to the
lower-supersymmetric case of ABJM theory.
