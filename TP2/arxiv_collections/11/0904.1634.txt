The effect of atomic disorder induced by neutrons irradiation on
superconducting and normal state properties of polycrystalline LaFeAsO_0.9F_0.1
was investigated. The irradiation of the sample by a moderate neutron fluence F
= 1.6*1019 cm^-2 at Tirr = 50 +- 10 C leads to the suppression of
superconductivity which recovers almost completely after annealing at
temperatures Tann < 750 C. It is shown that the reduction of superconducting
transition temperature Tc under atomic disordering is not determined solely by
the value of Hall concentration nH, i.e. doping level, but is governed by the
reduction of electronic relaxation time. This behavior can be described
qualitatively by universal Abrikosov-Gorkov equation which presents evidence on
the anomalous type of electrons pairing in Fe-based superconductors.
