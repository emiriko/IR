Many scenarios have been proposed for the origin of the supermassive black
holes (SMBHs) that are found in the centres of most galaxies. Many of these
formation scenarios predict a high-redshift population of intermediate-mass
black holes (IMBHs), with masses in the range 100 to 100000 times that of the
Sun. A powerful way to observe these IMBHs is via gravitational waves the black
holes emit as they merge. The statistics of the observed black hole population
should, in principle, allow us to discriminate between competing astrophysical
scenarios for the origin and formation of SMBHs. However, gravitational wave
detectors such as LISA will not be able to detect all such mergers nor assign
precise black hole parameters to the merger, due to weak gravitational wave
signal strengths. In order to use LISA observations to infer the statistics of
the underlying population, these errors must be taken into account. We describe
here a method for folding the LISA gravitational wave parameter error estimates
into an `error kernel' designed for use at the population model level. The
effects of this error function are demonstrated by applying it to several
recent models of black hole mergers, and some tentative conclusions are made
about LISA's ability to test scenarios of the origin and formation of
supermassive black holes.
