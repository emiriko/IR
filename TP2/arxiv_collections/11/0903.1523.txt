Common beliefs about unitarity are not reliable, and we do not know how to
apply DGLAP evolution at small x. Together with the big discrepancy between the
measurements of the total cross section at the Tevatron, a consequence is that
the cross section at the LHC could be anywhere between 90 and 160 mb.
