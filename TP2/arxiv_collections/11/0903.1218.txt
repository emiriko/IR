We present an NNLO-compatible subtraction scheme for computing QCD jet cross
sections of hadron-initiated processes at NLO accuracy. The scheme is
constructed specifically with those complications in mind, that emerge when
extending the subtraction algorithm to next-to-next-to-leading order. It is
therefore possible to embed the present scheme in a full NNLO computation
without any modifications.
