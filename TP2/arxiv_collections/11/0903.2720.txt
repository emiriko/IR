We study the controllability of the Bloch equation, for an ensemble of non
interacting half-spins, in a static magnetic field, with dispersion in the
Larmor frequency. This system may be seen as a prototype for infinite
dimensional bilinear systems with continuous spectrum, whose controllability is
not well understood. We provide several mathematical answers, with
discrimination between approximate and exact controllability, and between
finite time or infinite time controllability: this system is not exactly
controllable in finite time $T$ with bounded controls in $L^2(0,T)$, but it is
approximately controllable in $L^\infty$ in finite time with unbounded controls
in $L^{\infty}_{loc}([0,+\infty))$. Moreover, we propose explicit controls
realizing the asymptotic exact controllability to a uniform state of spin +1/2
or -1/2.
