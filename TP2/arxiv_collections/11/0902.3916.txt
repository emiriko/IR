We show that the asymptotic symmetry algebra of geometries with Schrodinger
isometry in any dimension is an infinite dimensional algebra containing one
copy of Virasoro algebra. It is compatible with the fact that the corresponding
geometries are dual to non-relativistic CFTs whose symmetry algebra is the
Schrodinger algebra which admits an extension to an infinite dimensional
symmetry algebra containing a Virasoro subalgebra.
