Entanglement is one of the key feature of quantum world that has no classical
counterpart. This arises due to the linear superposition principle and the
tensor product structure of the Hilbert space when we deal with multiparticle
systems. In this paper, we will introduce the notion of entanglement for
quantum systems that are governed by non-Hermitian yet PT-symmetric
Hamiltonians. We will show that maximally entangled states in usual quantum
theory behave like non-maximally entangled states in PT-symmetric quantum
theory. Furthermore, we will show how to create entanglement between two
PTQubits using non-Hermitian Hamiltonians and discuss the entangling capability
of such interaction Hamiltonians that are non-Hermitian in nature.
