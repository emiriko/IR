Hard partons moving through a dense QCD medium lose energy by radiative
emissions and elastic scatterings. Deposition of the radiative contribution
into the medium requires rescattering of the radiated gluons. We compute the
total energy loss and its deposition into the medium self-consistently within
the same formalism, assuming perturbative interaction between probe and medium.
The same transport coefficients that control energy loss of the hard parton
determine how the energy is deposited into the medium; this allows a parameter
free calculation of the latter once the former have been computed or extracted
from experimental energy loss data. We compute them for a perturbative medium
in hard thermal loop (HTL) approximation. Assuming that the deposited
energy-momentum is equilibrated after a short relaxation time, we compute the
medium's hydrodynamical response and obtain a conical pattern that is strongly
enhanced by showering.
