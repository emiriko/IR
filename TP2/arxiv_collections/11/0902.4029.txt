We present new reddening measurements towards the young supernova remnant
Cassiopeia A, using two techniques not previously applied to this object. Our
observations of the near-infrared [Fe II] 1.257 micron and 1.644 micron lines
show the extinction to be highly variable across the remnant, increasing
towards the west and the south, consistent with previous radio and X-ray
observations. While the absolute value of AV as determined by the [Fe II] lines
is uncertain due to conflicting calculations and observations of their
intrinsic flux ratio, parts of the remnant without previous optical
measurements show comparatively higher reddening. We find AV = 6.2 +/- 0.6 from
the broadband shape of the infrared synchrotron emission of a knot within 13"
of the expansion center. Given this reddening, the apparent faintness of the
nascent supernova, and iron mass constraints from X-ray observations, we
estimate an ejected mass of 56Ni of 0.058 - 0.16 MSun. Taken with gamma-ray
observations of the 44Ti decay chain, this nickel mass is broadly consistent
with the solar 44Ca/56Fe ratio.
