The Randall-Sundrum model of warped geometry in a five-dimensional scenario,
aimed at explaining the hierarchy between the Planck and electroweak scales, is
intrinsically unstable in its minimal form due to negative tension of the
visible brane. A proposed solution to the problem yields a negative
cosmological constant in four dimensions. We show that this wrong-sign
cosmological constant is restricted to small values, therefore requiring less
cancellation from hitherto unknown physics, if bulk neutrinos are postulated to
explain the observed neutrino mass pattern. Thus neutrino masses, a stable
Tev-brane configuration and new physics in the context of the cosmological
constant get rather suggestively connected by the same thread.
