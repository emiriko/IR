A new measurement of the parity violating asymmetry in elastic electron
scattering on hydrogen at backward angles and at a four momentum transfer of
Q^2=0.22 (GeV/c)^2 is reported here. The measured asymmetry is A_LR=(-17.23 +-
0.82_stat +-0.89_syst) ppm. The Standard Model prediction assuming no
strangeness is A_0=(-15.87 +- 1.22) ppm. In combination with previous results
from measurements at forward angles, it it possible to disentangle for the
first time the strange electric and magnetic form factors at this momentum
transfer, G_E^s(0.22)=0.050 +- 0.038 +- 0.019 and G_M^s(0.22)=-0.14 +- 0.11 +-
0.11.
