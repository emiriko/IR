We study the Hartree equation with a slowly varying smooth potential, $V(x) =
W(hx)$, and with an initial condition which is $\epsilon \le \sqrt h$ away in
$H^1$ from a soliton. We show that up to time $|\log h|/h$ and errors of size
$\epsilon + h^2$ in $H^1$, the solution is a soliton evolving according to the
classical dynamics of a natural effective Hamiltonian. This result is based on
methods of Holmer-Zworski, who prove a similar theorem for the Gross-Pitaevskii
equation, and on spectral estimates for the linearized Hartree operator
recently obtained by Lenzmann. We also provide an extension of the result of
Holmer-Zworski to more general inital conditions.
