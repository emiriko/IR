Extending the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model with three right-handed
neutrino superfields is one of the best motivated scenarios for physics beyond
the Standard Model. However, very little is known from observations about the
high energy parameters of this model. In this paper we show, under the
plausible assumptions that the neutrino Yukawa eigenvalues are hierarchical and
the absence of cancellations, that there exists an upper bound on the smallest
Yukawa eigenvalue stemming from the non-observation of the rare lepton decay mu
--> e gamma. Furthermore, we show that this bound implies an upper bound on the
lightest right-handed neutrino mass of approximately 5x10^12 GeV for typical
supersymmetric parameters. We also discuss the implications of this upper bound
for the minimal leptogenesis scenario based on the decay of the lightest
right-handed neutrino and we argue that an improvement of sensitivity of six
orders of magnitude to the process mu --> e gamma could rule out this mechanism
as the origin of the observed baryon asymmetry, unless the neutrino parameters
take very specific values.
