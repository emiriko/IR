Technological advances allow for tunable lateral confinement of cold dipolar
excitons in coupled quantum wells. We consider theoretically the Josephson
effect between exciton condensates in two traps separated by a weak link. The
flow of the exciton supercurrent is driven by the dipole energy difference
between the traps. The Josephson oscillations may be observed after ensemble
average of the time correlation of photons separately emitted from the two
traps. The fringe visibility is controlled by the trap coupling and is robust
against quantum and thermal fluctuations.
