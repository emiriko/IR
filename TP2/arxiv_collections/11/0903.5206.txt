We report physical properties of the conductive magnet PdCrO2 consisting of a
layered structure with a triangular lattice of Cr3+ ions (S=3/2). We confirmed
an antiferromagnetic transition at TN=37.5K by means of specific heat,
electrical resistivity, magnetic susceptibility, and neutron scattering
measurements. The critical behavior in the specific heat persists in an
unusually wide temperature range above TN. This fact implies that spin
correlations develop even at much higher temperature than TN. The observed
sub-linear temperature dependence of the resistivity above TN is also
attributed to the short-range correlations among the frustrated spins. While
the critical exponent for the magnetization agrees reasonably with the
prediction of the relevant model, that for the specific heat evaluated in the
wide temperature range differs substantially from the prediction.
