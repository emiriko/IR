The standard cosmological model is assumed to respect parity symmetry. Under
this assumption the cross-correlations of the CMB's temperature anisotropy and
`gradient'-like polarization, with the `curl'-like polarization identically
vanish over the full sky. However, extensions of the standard model which allow
for light scalar field or axion coupling to the electromagnetic field, or
coupling to the Riemann gravitational field-strength, as well as other
modifications of field theories, may induce a rotation of the CMB polarization
plane on cosmological scales and manifest itself as nonvanishing TB and EB
cross-correlations. Recently, the degree of parity violation (reflected in
polarization rotation) was constrained using data from BOOMERANG, WMAP and
QUAD. Forecasts have been made for near-future experiments (e.g. PLANCK) to
further constrain parity- and Lorentz-violating terms in the fundamental
interactions of nature. Here we consider a real-world effect induced by a class
of telescope beam systematics which can mimic the rotation of polarization
plane or otherwise induce nonvanishing TB and EB correlations. In particular,
adopting the viewpoint that the primary target of future experiments will be
the inflationary B-mode signal, we assume the beam-systematics of the upcoming
PLANCK and POLARBEAR experiments are optimized towards this goal, and explore
the implications of the allowed levels of beam systematics on the resulting
precision of polarization-rotation measurements.
