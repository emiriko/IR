We consider the problem of asymptotic reconstruction of the state and
parameter values in systems of ordinary differential equations. A solution to
this problem is proposed for a class of systems of which the unknowns are
allowed to be nonlinearly parameterized functions of state and time.
Reconstruction of state and parameter values is based on the concepts of weakly
attracting sets and non-uniform convergence and is subjected to persistency of
excitation conditions. In absence of nonlinear parametrization the resulting
observers reduce to standard estimation schemes. In this respect, the proposed
method constitutes a generalization of the conventional canonical adaptive
observer design.
