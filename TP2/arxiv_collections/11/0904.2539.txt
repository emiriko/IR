We have studied the phi->a_0(980) gamma process with the KLOE detector at the
Frascati phi-factory DAPhNE by detecting the phi->eta pi^0 gamma decays in the
final states with eta->gamma gamma and eta->pi^+ pi^- pi^0. We have measured
the branching ratios for both final states: Br(phi->eta pi^0 gamma)=(7.01 +/-
0.10 +/- 0.20)x10^-5 and (7.12 +/- 0.13 +/- 0.22)x10^-5 respectively. We have
also extracted the a_0(980) mass and its couplings to eta pi^0, K^+ K^-, and to
the phi meson from the fit of the eta pi^0 invariant mass distributions using
different phenomenological models.
