We present here a classical optics device based on an imaging architecture as
analogy of a quantum system where the violation of the Bell inequality can be
evidenced. In our case, the two qbits entangled state needed to obtain non
classical correlations is encoded using an electromagnetic wave modulated in
amplitude and phase. Computational states are represented in a way where each
one of the two qbits is associated with two orthogonal directions in the input
plane. In addition, unitary operations involved in the measurement of the
observables are simulated with the use of a coherent optical processor. The
images obtained in the output of the process, contain all the information about
the joint, marginal and conditional probabilities. By measuring the intensity
distribution in the image plane we evaluate the mean values of the simulated
observables. The obtained experimental results show, in an illustrative manner,
how some correlations of Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt type exceed the upper bound
imposed by the local realism hypothesis as a consequence of the joint effect of
entanglement and two-particle interference.
