We reproduce apparently complex cellular automaton behaviour with simple
partial differential equations as developed in (Keane 09). Our PDE model easily
explains behaviour observed in selected scenarios of the cellular automaton
wargame ISAAC without resorting to anthropomorphisation of autonomous 'agents'.
The insinuation that agents have a reasoning and planning ability is replaced
with a deterministic numerical approximation which encapsulates basic
motivational factors and demonstrates a variety of spatial behaviours
approximating the mean behaviour of the ISAAC scenarios. All scenarios
presented here highlight the dangers associated with attributing intelligent
reasoning to behaviour shown, when this can be explained quite simply through
the effects of the terms in our equations. A continuum of forces is able to
behave in a manner similar to a collection of individual autonomous agents, and
shows decentralised self-organisation and adaptation of tactics to suit a
variety of combat situations.
