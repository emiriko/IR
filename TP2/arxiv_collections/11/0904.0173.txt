The numerical studies of the interplanetary coupling between multiple
magnetic clouds (MCs) are continued by a 2.5-dimensional ideal
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model in the heliospheric meridional plane. The
interplanetary direct collision (DC) / oblique collision (OC) between both MCs
results from their same/different initial propagation orientations. Here the OC
is explored in contrast to the results of the DC (Xiong et al., 2007). Both the
slow MC1 and fast MC2 are consequently injected from the different heliospheric
latitudes to form a compound stream during the interplanetary propagation. The
MC1 and MC2 undergo contrary deflections during the process of oblique
collision. Their deflection angles of $|\delta \theta_1|$ and $|\delta
\theta_2|$ continuously increase until both MC-driven shock fronts are merged
into a stronger compound one. The $|\delta \theta_1|$, $|\delta \theta_2|$, and
total deflection angle $\Delta \theta$ ($\Delta \theta = |\delta \theta_1| +
|\delta \theta_2|$) reach their corresponding maxima when the initial eruptions
of both MCs are at an appropriate angular difference. Moreover, with the
increase of MC2's initial speed, the OC becomes more intense, and the
enhancement of $\delta \theta_1$ is much more sensitive to $\delta \theta_2$.
The $|\delta\theta_1|$ is generally far less than the $|\delta\theta_2|$, and
the unusual case of $|\delta\theta_1|\simeq|\delta\theta_2|$ only occurs for an
extremely violent OC. But because of the elasticity of the MC body to buffer
the collision, this deflection would gradually approach an asymptotic degree.
Therefore, the deflection due to the OC should be considered for the evolution
and ensuing geoeffectiveness of interplanetary interaction among successive
coronal mass ejections (CMEs).
