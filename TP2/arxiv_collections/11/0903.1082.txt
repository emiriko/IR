The classical sampling theorem for bandlimited functions has recently been
generalized to apply to so-called bandlimited operators, that is, to operators
with band-limited Kohn-Nirenberg symbols. Here, we discuss operator sampling
versions of two of the most central extensions to the classical sampling
theorem. In irregular operator sampling, the sampling set is not periodic with
uniform distance. In multi-channel operator sampling, we obtain complete
information on an operator by multiple operator sampling outputs.
