We study squark flavour violation in the anomaly mediated supersymmetry
broken (AMSB) minimal supersymmetric standard model. Analytical expressions for
the three-generational squark mass matrices are derived. We show that the
anomaly-induced soft breaking terms have a decreasing amount of squark flavour
violation when running from the GUT to the weak scale. Taking into account
inter-generational squark mixing, we work out non-trivial constraints from B ->
Xs gamma and Bs -> mu mu, which complement each other, as well as B -> tau nu
decays. We further identify a region of parameter space where the anomalous
magnetic moment of the muon and the B -> Xs gamma branching ratio are
simultaneously accommodated. Since anomaly mediation is of the minimal
flavour-violating type, the generic flavour predictions for this class of
models apply, including a CKM-induced (and hence small) Bs-Bsbar-mixing phase.
