Eta meson production in the proton-proton scattering is dominated by the
low-mass meson exchange. We present a brief study on how the type of the
exchanged mesons within coupled-channel and multi-resonance model influences
the scattering observables. We show under which circumstances the eta exchange
may explain the shape of the observed cross sections, and present a few
selected results: total cross section in the full energy range, and the
proton-proton energy distribution at 15.5 MeV.
