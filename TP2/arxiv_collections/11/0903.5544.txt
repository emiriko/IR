We present spectroscopy of the host of GRB 051022 with GMOS nod and shuffle
on Gemini South and NIRSPEC on Keck II. We determine a metallicity for the host
of log(O/H)+12 = 8.77 using the R23 method (Kobulnicky & Kewley 2004 scale)
making this the highest metallicity long burst host yet observed. The galaxy
itself is unusually luminous for a LGRB host with a rest frame B band absolute
magnitude -21.5 and has the spectrum of a rapidly star-forming galaxy. Our work
raises the question of whether other dark burst hosts will show high
metallicities.
