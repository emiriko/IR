We study shot noise of the spin-polarized current in a diffusive
ferromagnetic nanowire which contains a ballistic domain wall. We find that the
existence of a short domain wall influences strongly the shot noise for
sufficiently high spin-polarization of the wire. Compared to the situation of
the absence of the domain wall, the shot noise can be reduced or enhanced
depending on the length of the domain wall and its relative conductance.
