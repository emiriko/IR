The magnetospheric emissions from extrasolar planets represent a science
frontier for the next decade. All of the solar system giant planets and the
Earth produce radio emissions as a result of interactions between their
magnetic fields and the solar wind. In the case of the Earth, its magnetic
field may contribute to its habitability by protecting its atmosphere from
solar wind erosion and by preventing energetic particles from reaching its
surface. Indirect evidence for at least some extrasolar giant planets also
having magnetic fields includes the modulation of emission lines of their host
stars phased with the planetary orbits, likely due to interactions between the
stellar and planetary magnetic fields. If magnetic fields are a generic
property of giant planets, then extrasolar giant planets should emit at radio
wavelengths allowing for their direct detection. Existing observations place
limits comparable to the flux densities expected from the strongest emissions.
Additional sensitivity at low radio frequencies coupled with algorithmic
improvements likely will enable a new means of detection and characterization
of extrasolar planets within the next decade.
