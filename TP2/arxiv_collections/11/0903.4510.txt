Consider the following problem: given a metric space, some of whose points
are "clients", open a set of at most $k$ facilities to minimize the average
distance from the clients to these facilities. This is just the well-studied
$k$-median problem, for which many approximation algorithms and hardness
results are known. Note that the objective function encourages opening
facilities in areas where there are many clients, and given a solution, it is
often possible to get a good idea of where the clients are located. However,
this poses the following quandary: what if the identity of the clients is
sensitive information that we would like to keep private? Is it even possible
to design good algorithms for this problem that preserve the privacy of the
clients?
  In this paper, we initiate a systematic study of algorithms for discrete
optimization problems in the framework of differential privacy (which
formalizes the idea of protecting the privacy of individual input elements). We
show that many such problems indeed have good approximation algorithms that
preserve differential privacy; this is even in cases where it is impossible to
preserve cryptographic definitions of privacy while computing any non-trivial
approximation to even the_value_ of an optimal solution, let alone the entire
solution.
  Apart from the $k$-median problem, we study the problems of vertex and set
cover, min-cut, facility location, Steiner tree, and the recently introduced
submodular maximization problem, "Combinatorial Public Projects" (CPP).
