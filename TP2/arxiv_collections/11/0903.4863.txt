Bose-Einstein correlations of charged kaons are measured for Au+Au collisions
at sqrt(s_NN) = 200 GeV and are compared to charged pion probes, which have a
larger hadronic scattering cross section. Three dimensional Gaussian source
radii are extracted, along with a one-dimensional kaon emission source
function. The centrality dependences of the three Gaussian radii are well
described by a single linear function if N_part^1/3 with zero intercept.
Imaging analysis shows a deviation from a Gaussian tail at r >~ 10 fm, although
the bulk emission at lower radius is well-described by a Gaussian. The presence
of a non-Gaussian tail in the kaon source reaffirms that the particle emission
region in a heavy ion collision is extended, and that similar measurements with
pions are not solely due to the decay of long-lived resonances.
