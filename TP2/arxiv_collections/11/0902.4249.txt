The Fractal Bubble model has been proposed as a viable cosmology that does
not require dark energy to account for cosmic acceleration, but rather
attributes its observational signature to the formation of structure. In this
paper it is demonstrated that, in contrast to previous findings, this model is
not a good fit to cosmological supernovae data; there is significant tension in
the best fit parameters obtained from different samples, whereas LCDM is able
to fit all datasets consistently. Furthermore, the concordance between galaxy
clustering scales and data from the cosmic microwave background is not achieved
with the most recent supernova compilations. The validity of the FB formalism
as a sound cosmological model is further challenged as it is shown that
previous studies of this model achieve concordance by requiring a value for the
present day Hubble constant that is derived from supernovae data containing an
arbitrary distance normalisation.
