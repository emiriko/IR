We show how the Equation-Free approach for multi-scale computations can be
exploited to systematically study the dynamics of neural interactions on a
random regular connected graph under a pairwise representation perspective.
Using an individual-based microscopic simulator as a black box coarse-grained
timestepper and with the aid of simulated annealing we compute the
coarse-grained equilibrium bifurcation diagram and analyze the stability of the
stationary states sidestepping the necessity of obtaining explicit closures at
the macroscopic level. We also exploit the scheme to perform a rare-events
analysis by estimating an effective Fokker-Planck describing the evolving
probability density function of the corresponding coarse-grained observables.
