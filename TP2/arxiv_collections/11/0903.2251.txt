The safety of our day-to-day life depends crucially on the correct
functioning of embedded software systems which control the functioning of more
and more technical devices. Many of these software systems are time-critical.
Hence, computations performed need not only to be correct, but must also be
issued in a timely fashion. Worst case execution time (WCET) analysis is
concerned with computing tight upper bounds for the execution time of a system
in order to provide formal guarantees for the proper timing behaviour of a
system. Central for this is to compute safe and tight bounds for loops and
recursion depths. In this paper, we highlight the TuBound approach to this
challenge at whose heart is a constraint logic based approach for loop
analysis.
