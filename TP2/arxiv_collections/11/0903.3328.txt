Method for detection and visualization of trends, periodicities, local
peculiarities in measurement series (dL-method) based on DFA technology
(Detrended fluctuation analysis) is proposed. The essence of the method lies in
reflecting the values of absolute deviation of measurement accumulation series
points from the respective values of linear approximation. It is shown that
dL-method in some cases allows better determination of local peculiarities than
wavelet-analysis. Easy-to-realize approach that is proposed can be used in the
analysis of time series in such fields as economics and sociology.
