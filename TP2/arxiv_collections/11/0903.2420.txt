The spectral energy distributions for pure-hydrogen (DA) hot white dwarfs can
be accurately predicted by model atmospheres. This makes it possible to define
spectrophotometric calibrators by scaling the theoretical spectral shapes with
broad-band photometric observations -- a strategy successfully exploited for
the spectrographs onboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) using three primary
DA standards. Absolute fluxes for non-DA secondary standards, introduced to
increase the density of calibrators in the sky, need to be referred to the
primary standards, but a far better solution would be to employ a network of DA
stars scattered throughout the sky. We search for blue objects in the sixth
data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and fit DA model fluxes to
identify suitable candidates. Reddening needs to be considered in the analysis
of the hottest and therefore more distant stars. We propose a list of nine
pure-hydrogen white dwarfs with absolute fluxes with estimated uncertainties
below 3%, including four objects with estimated errors <2%, as candidates for
spectrophotometric standards in the range 14<g<18, and provide model-based
fluxes scaled to match the SDSS broad-band fluxes for each. We apply the same
method to the three HST DA standards, linking the zero point of their absolute
fluxes to ugr magnitudes transformed from photometry obtained with the USNO 1-m
telescope. For these stars we estimate uncertainties of <1% in the optical,
finding good consistency with the fluxes adopted for HST calibration.
