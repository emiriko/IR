By attributing a circulating Josephson current induced diamagnetic moment to
a SQUID-type three-level qubit, a wireless connection between such qubits is
proposed based only on dipole-dipole interaction between their moments. The
estimates of the model parameters suggest quite an optimistic possibility to
experimentally realize the suggested coupling scheme.
