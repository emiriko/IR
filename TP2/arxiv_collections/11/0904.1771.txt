Many banks adopt the Loss Distribution Approach to quantify the operational
risk capital charge under Basel II requirements. It is common practice to
estimate the capital charge using the 0.999 quantile of the annual loss
distribution, calculated using point estimators of the frequency and severity
distribution parameters. The uncertainty of the parameter estimates is
typically ignored. One of the unpleasant consequences for the banks accounting
for parameter uncertainty is an increase in the capital requirement. This paper
demonstrates how the parameter uncertainty can be taken into account using a
Bayesian framework that also allows for incorporation of expert opinions and
external data into the estimation procedure.
