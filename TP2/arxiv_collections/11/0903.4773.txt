We made in this paper a brief analysis of the following statistics:
Intermediate Statistics, Parastatistics, Fractionary Statistics and Gentileonic
Statistics that predict the existence of particles which are different from
bosons, fermions and maxwellons. We shown the fundamental hypothesis assumed in
each one of the above mentioned statistics and their main predictions and
compared them with experimental results. Taking into account the works done
about these statistics we could say that there is a tendency to believe that
real particles, that is, those that can be observed freely, can be only bosons,
fermions and maxwellons and that all other particles, different from these
would be quasiparticles. Up to date in 3-dim systems only bosons, fermions and
maxwellons have been detected freely. Recently in 2-dim systems have been
detected the quasiparticles named anyons that have fractionary charges and
spins.
