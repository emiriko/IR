We show the existence of a Hawking vector field in a full neighborhood of a
local, regular, bifurcate, non-expanding horizon embedded in a smooth
Einstein-Maxwell space-time without assuming the underlying space-time is
analytic. It extends one result of Friedrich, R\'{a}cz and Wald, which was
limited to the interior of the black hole region. Moreover, we also show, in
the presence of an additional Killing vector field $T$ which tangent to the
horizon and not vanishing on the bifurcate sphere, then space-time must be
locally axially symmetric without the analyticity assumption. This axial
symmetry plays a fundamental role in the classification theory of stationary
black holes.
