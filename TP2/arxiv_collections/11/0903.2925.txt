We show an invariance result for the L2-torsion of groups under uniform
measure equivalence provided a measure-theoretic version of the determinant
conjecture holds. The measure-theoretic determinant conjecture is discussed
and, for instance, proved for Bernoulli actions of residually amenable groups.
