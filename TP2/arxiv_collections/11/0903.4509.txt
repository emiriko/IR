The NSF's Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship (AAPF) is
exceptional among the available postdoctoral awards in Astronomy and
Astrophysics. The fellowship is one of the few that allows postdoctoral
researchers to pursue an original research program, of their own design, at the
U.S. institution of their choice. However, what makes this fellowship truly
unique is the ability of Fellows to lead an equally challenging, original
educational program simultaneously. The legacy of this singular fellowship has
been to encourage and advance leaders in the field who are equally as
passionate about their own research as they are about sharing that research and
their passion for astronomy with students and the public.
  In this positional paper we address the importance of fellowships like the
AAPF to the astronomical profession by identifying the science and educational
contributions that Fellows have made to the community. Further, we recommend
that fellowships that encourage leading postdoctoral researchers to also become
leaders in Astronomy education be continued and expanded.
