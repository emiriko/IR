Extrasolar multiple-planet systems provide valuable opportunities for testing
theories of planet formation and evolution. The architectures of the known
multiple-planet systems demonstrate a fascinating level of diversity, which
motivates the search for additional examples of such systems in order to better
constrain their formation and dynamical histories. Here we describe a
comprehensive investigation of 22 planetary systems in an effort to answer
three questions: 1) Are there additional planets? 2) Where could additional
planets reside in stable orbits? and 3) What limits can these observations
place on such objects? We find no evidence for additional bodies in any of
these systems; indeed, these new data do not support three previously announced
planets (HD 20367b: Udry et al. 2003, HD 74156d: Bean et al. 2008, and 47 UMa
c: Fischer et al. 2002). The dynamical simulations show that nearly all of the
22 systems have large regions in which additional planets could exist in stable
orbits. The detection-limit computations indicate that this study is sensitive
to close-in Neptune-mass planets for most of the systems targeted. We conclude
with a discussion on the implications of these non-detections.
