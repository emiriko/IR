We have discovered new nickel-based pnictide oxide superconductors,
(Ni2Pn2)(Sr4Sc2O6) (Pn = P, As). These compounds have a tetragonal unit cell
with a space group of P4/nmm and they consist of alternate stacking of
anti-fluorite Ni2Pn2 layers and K2NiF4-type Sr4Sc2O6 blocking layers. Lattice
parameters were a = 4.044 A and c = 15.23 A for (Ni2P2)(Sr4Sc2O6) and a = 4.078
A and c = 15.41 A for (Ni2As2)(Sr4Sc2O6), indicating their thicker blocking
layers than that of LaNiPO (c ~ 8.1 A). Both (Ni2P2)(Sr4Sc2O6) and
(Ni2As2)(Sr4Sc2O6) exhibited superconductivity with zero resistivity at 3.3 K
and 2.7 K, respectively. The perfect diamagnetism observed in both compounds
guaranteed their bulk superconductivity.
