The importance of magnetic reconnection as an energy release mechanism in
many solar, stellar, magnetospheric and astrophysical phenomena has long been
recognised. Reconnection is the only mechanism by which magnetic fields can
globally restructure, enabling them to access a lower energy state. Over the
past decade, there have been some major advances in our understanding of
three-dimensional reconnection. In particular, the key characteristics of 3D
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) reconnection have been determined. For instance, 3D
reconnection (i) occurs with or without nulls, (ii) occurs continuously and
continually throughout a diffusion region and (iii) is driven by counter
rotating flows.
  Furthermore, analysis of resistive 3D MHD magnetic experiments have revealed
some intriguing effects relating to where and how reconnection occurs. To
illustrate these new features, a series of constant-resistivity experiments,
involving the interaction of two opposite-polarity magnetic sources in an
overlying field, are considered. Such a simple interaction represents a typical
building block of the Sun's magnetic atmosphere. By following the evolution of
the magnetic topology, we are able to explain where, how and at what rate the
reconnection occurs. Remarkably there can be up to five energy release sites at
anyone time (compared to one in the potential case) and the duration of the
interaction increases (more than doubles) as the resistivity decreases (by a
factor of 16). The decreased resistivity also leads to a higher peak ohmic
dissipation and more energy being released in total, as a result of a greater
injection of Poynting flux.
