Within the next-to-leading order (NLO) perturbative QCD (pQCD) parton model,
suppression of away-side hadron spectra associated with a high $p_{T}$ photon
due to parton energy loss is studied in high-energy heavy-ion collisions.
Dictated by the shape of the $\gamma$-associated jet spectrum in NLO pQCD,
hadron spectra at large $z_T=p_T^{h}/p_T^{\gamma} \stackrel{>}{\sim} 1$ are
more sensitive to parton energy loss and therefore are dominated by surface
emission of $\gamma$-associated jets, whereas small $z_{T}$ hadrons mainly come
from fragmentation of jets with reduced energy which is controlled by the
volume emission. These lead to different centrality dependence of the
$\gamma$-hadron suppression for different values of $z_{T}$. Therefore, a
complete measurement of the suppression of $\gamma$-triggered hadron spectra,
including its dependence on the orientation of the $\gamma$-hadron pair with
respect to the reaction plane, allows the extraction of the spatial
distribution of jet quenching parameters, achieving a true tomographic study of
the quark-gluon plasma in high-energy heavy-ion collisions.
