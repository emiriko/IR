We extend the well-known Denjoy-Ahlfors theorem on the number of different
asymptotic tracts of holomorphic functions to subharmonic functions on
arbitrary Riemannian manifolds. We obtain some new versions of the Liouville
theorem for $\p$-harmonic functions without requiring the geodesic completeness
requirement of a manifold. Moreover, an upper estimate of the topological index
of the height function on a minimal surface in $\R{n}$ has been established
and, as a consequence, a new proof of Bernstein's theorem on entire solutions
has been derived. Other applications to minimal surfaces are also discussed.
