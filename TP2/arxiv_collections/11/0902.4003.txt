We analyze the cross-correlation of 2,705 unambiguously intervening Mg II
(2796,2803A) quasar absorption line systems with 1,495,604 luminous red
galaxies (LRGs) from the Fifth Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
within the redshift range 0.36<=z<=0.8. We confirm with high precision a
previously reported weak anti-correlation of equivalent width and dark matter
halo mass, measuring the average masses to be log M_h(M_[solar]h^-1)=11.29
[+0.36,-0.62] and log M_h(M_[solar]h^-1)=12.70 [+0.53,-1.16] for systems with
W[2796A]>=1.4A and 0.8A<=W[2796A]<1.4A, respectively. Additionally, we
investigate the significance of a number of potential sources of bias inherent
in absorber-LRG cross-correlation measurements, including absorber velocity
distributions and the weak lensing of background quasars, which we determine is
capable of producing a 20-30% bias in angular cross-correlation measurements on
scales less than 2'. We measure the Mg II - LRG cross-correlation for 719
absorption systems with v<60,000 km s^-1 in the quasar rest frame and find that
these associated absorbers typically reside in dark matter haloes that are
~10-100 times more massive than those hosting unambiguously intervening Mg II
absorbers. Furthermore, we find evidence for evolution of the redshift number
density, dN/dz, with 2-sigma significance for the strongest (W>2.0A) absorbers
in the DR5 sample. This width-dependent dN/dz evolution does not significantly
affect the recovered equivalent width-halo mass anti-correlation and adds to
existing evidence that the strongest Mg II absorption systems are correlated
with an evolving population of field galaxies at z<0.8, while the non-evolving
dN/dz of the weakest absorbers more closely resembles that of the LRG
population.
