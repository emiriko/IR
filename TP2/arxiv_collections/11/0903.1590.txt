We prove that any rational linear combination of Pontryagin numbers that is
not a multiple of the signature is unbounded on connected closed oriented
manifolds of nonnegative sectional curvature. Combining our result with
Gromov's finiteness result for the signature yields a new characterization of
the L-genus.
