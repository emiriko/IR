To investigate Majorana fermionic excitations of a $p_x+ip_y$ superconductor,
the Bogoliubov-de-Gennes equation is solved on a sphere for two cases: (i) a
vortex-antivortex pair at opposite poles and (ii) an edge near the south pole
and an antivortex at the north pole. The vortex cores support a state of two
Majorana fermions, the energy of which decreases exponentially with the radius
of the sphere, independently of a moderate disorder potential. The tunneling
conductance of an electron into the superconductor near the position of a
vortex is computed for finite temperature, and is compared to the case of an
{\it s}-wave superconductor. The zero bias conductance peak of the antivortex
is half that of the vortex. This effect can be used as a probe of the order
parameter symmetry, and as a direct measurement of the Majorana fermion.
