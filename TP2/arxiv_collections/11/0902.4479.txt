Let $K$ denote a locally compact commutative hypergroup,
  $L^1(K)$ the hypergroup algebra, and $\alpha$ a real-valued hermitian
character of $K$. We show that $K$ is $\alpha$-amenable if and only if $L^1(K)$
is $\alpha$-left amenable. We also consider the $\alpha$-amenability of
hypergroup joins and polynomial hypergroups in several variables as well as a
single variable.
