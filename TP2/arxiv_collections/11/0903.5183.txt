Masses of the ground, orbitally and radially excited states of
quark-antiquark mesons composed from the light (u,d,s) quarks are calculated
within the framework of the relativistic quark model based on the
quasipotential approach. The relativistic treatment of the light quark dynamics
results in mass spectra which agree well with available experimental data for
the masses of the most well-established states. The Regge trajectories for
angular and radial excitations are constructed, and their linearity,
parallelism and equidistance are verified. The assignment of experimentally
observed light mesons to particular Regge trajectories is based on their masses
and quantum numbers.
