We study the average density of resonances (DOR) of a disordered
one-dimensional continuous open system. The disordered system is semi-infinite,
with white-noise random potential, and it is coupled to the external world by a
semi-infinite continuous perfect lead. Our main result is an integral
representation for the DOR which involves the probability density function of
the logarithmic derivative of the wave function at the contact point.
