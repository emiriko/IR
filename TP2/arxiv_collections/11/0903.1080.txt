We study electron-phonon interaction induced decoherence between two-electron
singlet and triplet states in a semiconductor double quantum dot using a
spin-boson model. We investigate the onset and time evolution of this
dephasing, and study its dependence on quantum dot parameters such as dot size
and double dot separations, as well as the host materials (GaAs and Si). We
find that electron-phonon interaction causes an initial Gaussian decay of the
off-diagonal density matrix element in the singlet-triplet Hilbert space, and a
long-time exponential decay originating from phonon relaxation.
