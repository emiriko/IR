We study the dynamics of the relative phase of a bilayer of two-dimensional
superfluids after the two superfluids have been decoupled, using truncated
Wigner approximation. On short time scales the relative phase shows "light
cone" like thermalization and creates a metastable superfluid state, which can
be supercritical. On longer time scales this state relaxes to a disordered
state due to dynamical vortex unbinding. This scenario of dynamically
suppressed vortex proliferation constitutes a {\it reverse-Kibble-Zurek
effect}. We observe dynamics of creation of vortex anti-vortex pairs and their
consequent motion. Our predictions can be directly measured in interference
experiments, see Ref 1.
