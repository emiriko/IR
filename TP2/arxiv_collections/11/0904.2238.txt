Using the simulation data coming from the cascade model, we have studied the
behavior of event number as a function of impact parameter-b and a number of
all charged particles- Nch for light and heavy nuclei at different energies. We
have seen that for light nuclei, a number of all charged particles-Nch could be
used to fix the centrality. But for heavy nuclei we have got strong initial
energy and mass dependences and the results for impact parameter factor
dependences and ones for a number of all charged particles differ. So for heavy
nuclei, a number of charged particles-Nch could not be use to fix the
centrality. Key words: cascade model; centrality, light nuclei, heavy nuclei
