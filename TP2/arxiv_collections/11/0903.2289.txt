The local zeta functions (also called Igusa's zeta functions) over p-adic
fields are connected with the number of solutions of congruences and
exponential sums mod p^{m}. These zeta functions are defined as integrals over
open and compact subsets with respect to the Haar measure. In this paper, we
introduce new integrals defined over submanifolds, or more generally, over
non-degenerate complete intersection varieties, and study their connections
with some arithmetical problems such as estimation of exponential sums mod
p^{m}. In particular we extend Igusa's method for estimating exponential sums
mod p^{m} to the case of exponential sums mod p^{m} along non-degenerate smooth
varieties.
