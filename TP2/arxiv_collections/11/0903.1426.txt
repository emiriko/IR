For SFTs, any equilibrium measure is Gibbs, as long a $f$ has $d$-summable
variation. This is a theorem of Lanford and Ruelle. Conversely, a theorem of
Dobru{\v{s}}in states that for strongly-irreducible subshifts, shift-invariant
Gibbs-measures are equilibrium measures. Here we prove a generalization of the
Lanford-Ruelle theorem: for all subshifts, any equilibrium measure for a
function with $d$-summable variation is "topologically Gibbs". This is a
relaxed notion which coincides with the usual notion of a Gibbs measure for
SFTs. In the second part of the paper, we study Gibbs and equilibrium measures
for some interesting families of subshifts: $\beta$-shifts, Dyck-shifts and
Kalikow-type shifts (defined below). In all of these cases, a Lanford-Ruelle
type theorem holds. For each of these families we provide a specific proof of
the result.
