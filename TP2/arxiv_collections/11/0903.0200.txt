Since the Turing test was first proposed by Alan Turing in 1950, the primary
goal of artificial intelligence has been predicated on the ability for
computers to imitate human behavior. However, the majority of uses for the
computer can be said to fall outside the domain of human abilities and it is
exactly outside of this domain where computers have demonstrated their greatest
contribution to intelligence. Another goal for artificial intelligence is one
that is not predicated on human mimicry, but instead, on human amplification.
This article surveys various systems that contribute to the advancement of
human and social intelligence.
