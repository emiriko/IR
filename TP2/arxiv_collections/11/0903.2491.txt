We demonstrate a silicon-based high frequency nanomechanical device capable
of switching controllably between two states at room temperature. The device
uses a nanomechanical resonator with two distinct states in the hysteretic
nonlinear regime. In contrast to prior work, we demonstrate room temperature
electrostatic actuation and sensing of the switching device with 100% fidelity
by phase modulating the drive signal. This phase-modulated device can be used
as a low-power high-speed mechanical switch integrated on-chip with silicon
circuitry.
