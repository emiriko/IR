We measure the evolution of the coupling constant using the Schroedinger
functional method in the lattice formulation of SU(2) gauge theory with two
massless Dirac fermions in the adjoint representation. We observe strong
evidence for an infrared fixed point, where the theory becomes conformal. We
measure the continuum beta-function and the coupling constant as a function of
the energy scale.
