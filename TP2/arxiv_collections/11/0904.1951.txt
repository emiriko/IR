The main objective of this article is to recast the hypermultiplets sector of
five dimensional ungauged N=2 supergravity into a manifestly
symplectic-covariant form. We propose that this facilitates the construction
and analysis of hypermultiplet fields coupled to p-brane sources and discuss
examples.
