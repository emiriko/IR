Electron is modeled as a spherically symmetric charged perfect fluid
distribution of matter. The existing model is extended assuming a matter source
that is characterized by quadratic EoS in the context of general theory of
relativity. For the suitable choices of the parameters, our charged fluid
models almost satisfy the physical properties of electron.
