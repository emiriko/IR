Several supersymmetric models with extended gauge structures, motivated by
either grand unification or by neutrino mass generation, predict light
doubly-charged Higgsinos. In this work we study the signals of doubly-charged
Higgsinos at the Tevatron in both pair-- and single--production modes, and show
that it is possible, especially from the events containing same-sign
same-flavor isolated leptons, to disentangle the effects of doubly-charged
Higgsinos in the Tevatron data.
