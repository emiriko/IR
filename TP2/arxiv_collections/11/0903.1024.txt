We make an estimate of the likelihood function for the Higgs vacuum
expectation value by imposing anthropic constraints on the existence of atoms
while allowing the other parameters of the Standard Model to also be variable.
We argue that the most important extra ingredients are the Yukawa couplings,
and for the intrinsic distribution of Yukawa couplings we use the scale
invariant distribution which is favored phenomenologically. The result is
successful phenomenologically, favoring values close to the observed vev. We
also discuss modifications that could change these conclusions. Our work
supports the hypothesis that the anthropic constraints could be the origin of
the small value of the Higgs vev.
