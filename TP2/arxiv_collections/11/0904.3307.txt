The Klein-Gordon equations were recently solved in general relativity for the
case of a plane-symmetric static massless scalar field with cosmological
constant. By analytic continuation, time-dependent solutions can be obtained
that correspond to cosmologies. These spacetimes are studied here, and include
among them a solution exhibiting both early inflation and later continued rapid
expansion that matches well with the Concordance Model.
