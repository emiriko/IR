Simulation of a Langevin-dynamics model demonstrates emergence of critical
fluctuations and anomalous grain transport which have been observed in
experiments on "soft" quasi-two-dimensional dusty plasma clusters. It has been
suggested that these anomalies derive from particular non-equilibrium physics,
but our model does not contain such physics: the grains are confined by an
external potential, interact via static Yukawa forces, and are subject to
stochastic heating and dissipation from neutrals. One remarkable feature is
emergence of leptokurtic probability distributions of grain displacements
$\xi(\tau)$ on time-scales $\tau<\tau_{\Delta}$, where $\tau_{\Delta}$ is the
time at which the standard deviation $\sigma(\tau)\equiv < \xi^2(\tau) >^{1/2}$
approaches the mean inter-grain distance $\Delta$. Others are development of
humps in the distributions on multiples of $\Delta$, anomalous Hurst exponents,
and transitions from leptokurtic towards Gaussian displacement distributions on
time scales $\tau>\tau_{\Delta}$. The latter is a signature of intermittency,
here interpreted as a transition from bursty transport associated with hopping
on intermediate time scales to vortical flows on longer time scales.
