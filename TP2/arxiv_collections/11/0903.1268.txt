The frst neutron powder diffraction based atomic pair distribution functions
(PDFs) are reported from the new wide angular-range chopper spectrometer ARCS
at the Spallation Neutron Source at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The
spectrometer was run in white-beam mode, with no Fermi chopper. The PDF
patterns of Si, Ni, and Al2O3 were refined using the PDFfit method and the
results compared to data collected at the NPDF diffractometer at Los Alamos
National Laboratory. The resulting fits are of high quality demonstrating that
quantitatively reliable powder diffraction data can be obtained from ARCS when
operated in this configuration.
