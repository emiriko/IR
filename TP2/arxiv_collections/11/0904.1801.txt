The Jensen theorem is used to derive inequalities for semi-classical
tunneling probabilities for systems involving several degrees of freedom. These
Jensen inequalities are used to discuss several aspects of sub-barrier
heavy-ion fusion reactions. The inequality hinges on general convexity
properties of the tunneling coefficient calculated with the classical action in
the classically forbidden region.
