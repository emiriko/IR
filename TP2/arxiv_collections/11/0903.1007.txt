Complex, non-Hermitian potentials V(x) can often generate standard quantum
bound states. H. F. Jones [Phys. Rev. D 78, 065032 (2008)] demonstrated that
the idea cannot directly be transferred to scattering. We reveal that a return
to the causal and unitary and asymptotically Hermitian scattering theory exists
for potentials which are allowed slightly non-local, V=V(x,p).
