We directly measure redshift evolution in the mean physical properties
(far-infrared luminosity, temperature, and mass) of the galaxies that produce
the cosmic infrared background (CIB), using measurements from the Balloon-borne
Large Aperture Sub-millimeter Telescope (BLAST), and Spitzer which constrain
the CIB emission peak. This sample is known to produce a surface brightness in
the BLAST bands consistent with the full CIB, and photometric redshifts are
identified for all of the objects. We find that most of the 70 micron
background is generated at z <~ 1 and the 500 micron background generated at z
>~ 1. A significant growth is observed in the mean luminosity from ~ 10^9 -
10^12 L_sun, and in the mean temperature by 10 K, from redshifts 0< z < 3.
However, there is only weak positive evolution in the comoving dust mass in
these galaxies across the same redshift range. We also measure the evolution of
the far-infrared luminosity density, and the star-formation rate history for
these objects, finding good agreement with other infrared studies up to z ~1,
exceeding the contribution attributed to optically-selected galaxies.
