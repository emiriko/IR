We treat the fluctuations of non-Abelian gauge fields around a classical
configuration by means of a transformation from the Yang--Mills gauge field to
a homogeneously transforming field variable. We use the formalism to compute
the effective action induced by these fluctuations in a static background
without Wu--Yang ambiguity.
