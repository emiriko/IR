Textual and archaeological sources are used to provide a synoptic vision of
the universe in India. This vision was based on an assumed equivalence of the
outer and the inner cosmoses and it is embodied in architecture, music, and
art. It provides an archaeoastronomical window on Indian monumental
architecture.
