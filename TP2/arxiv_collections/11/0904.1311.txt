Off-normal low energy ion beam sputtering of solid surfaces often leads to
morphological instabilities resulting in the spontaneous formation of ripple
structures in nanometer length scales. In the case of Si surfaces at ambient
temperature, ripple formation is found to take place normally at lower incident
angles with the wave vector parallel to the ion beam direction. The absence of
ripple pattern on Si surface at larger angles is due to the dominance of ion
beam polishing effect. We have shown that a gentle chemical roughening of the
starting surface morphology can initiate ripple pattern under grazing incidence
ion beam sputtering, where the ripple wave vector is perpendicular to the ion
beam direction. The characteristics of the perpendicular mode ripples are
studied as a function of pristine surface roughness and ion fluence. The
quality of the morphological structure is assessed from the analysis of ion
induced topological defects.
