We present MonteCUBES ("Monte Carlo Utility Based Experiment Simulator"), a
software package designed to sample the neutrino oscillation parameter space
through Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms. MonteCUBES makes use of the GLoBES
software so that the existing experiment definitions for GLoBES, describing
long baseline and reactor experiments, can be used with MonteCUBES. MonteCUBES
consists of two main parts: The first is a C library, written as a plug-in for
GLoBES, implementing the Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm to sample the
parameter space. The second part is a user-friendly graphical Matlab interface
to easily read, analyze, plot and export the results of the parameter space
sampling.
