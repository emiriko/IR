Time-to-science is an important figure of merit for digital instrumentation
serving the astronomical community. A digital signal processing (DSP) community
is forming that uses shared hardware development, signal processing libraries,
and instrument architectures to reduce development time of digital
instrumentation and to improve time-to-science for a wide variety of projects.
We suggest prioritizing technological development supporting the needs of this
nascent DSP community. After outlining several instrument classes that are
relying on digital instrumentation development to achieve new science
objectives, we identify key areas where technologies pertaining to
interoperability and processing flexibility will reduce the time, risk, and
cost of developing the digital instrumentation for radio astronomy. These areas
represent focus points where support of general-purpose, open-source
development for a DSP community should be prioritized in the next decade.
Contributors to such technological development may be centers of support for
this DSP community, science groups that contribute general-purpose DSP
solutions as part of their own instrumentation needs, or engineering groups
engaging in research that may be applied to next-generation DSP
instrumentation.
