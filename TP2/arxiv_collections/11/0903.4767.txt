Consider the space of double cosets of the product of $n$ copies of $\SU(2)$
with respect to the diagonal subgroup. We get a parametrization of this space,
the radial part of the Haar measure, and explicit formulas for the actions of
the group of outer automorphisms of the free group $F_{n-1}$ and of the braid
group of $n-1$ strings.
