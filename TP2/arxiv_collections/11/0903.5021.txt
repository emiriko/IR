We present a macroscopic theory of electroencephalogram (EEG) dynamics based
on the laws of motion that govern atomic and molecular motion. The theory is an
application of Zwanzig-Mori projection operators. The result is a simple
equation of motion that has the form of a generalized Langevin equation (GLE),
which requires knowledge only of macroscopic properties. The macroscopic
properties can be extracted from experimental data by one of two possible
variational principles. These variational principles are our principal
contribution to the formalism. Potential applications are discussed, including
applications to the theory of critical phenomena in the brain, Granger
causality and Kalman filters.
