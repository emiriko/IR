We investigate stationary, rotationally symmetric solutions of a recently
proposed three-dimensional theory of massive gravity. Along with BTZ black
holes, we also obtain warped AdS_3 black holes, and (for a critical value of
the cosmological constant) AdS_2 x S^1 as solutions. The entropy, mass and
angular momentum of these black holes are computed.
