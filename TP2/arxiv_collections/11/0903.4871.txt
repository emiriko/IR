We phrase deformations of n-Leibniz algebras in terms of the cohomology
theory of the associated Leibniz algebra. We do the same for n-Lie algebras and
for the metric versions of n-Leibniz and n-Lie algebras. We place particular
emphasis on the case of n=3 and explore the deformations of 3-algebras of
relevance to three-dimensional superconformal Chern--Simons theories with
matter.
