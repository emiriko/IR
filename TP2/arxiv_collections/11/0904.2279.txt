We calculate low-frequency Raman scattering from the confined acoustic phonon
modes of CdS1-xSex nanoparticles embedded in borosilicate glass. The
calculation of the Raman scattering by acoustic phonons in nanoparticles has
been performed by using third-order perturbation theory. The deformation
potential approximation is used to describe the electronphonon interaction. The
Raman-Brillouin electronic density and the electron-phonon interaction are
found to increases with decreasing size of nanoparticle. A good agreement
between the calculated and reported low-frequency Raman spectra is found.
