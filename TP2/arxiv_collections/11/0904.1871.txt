Let A be an asymptotic basis for N and X a finite subset of A such that A\X
is still an asymptotic basis. Farhi recently proved a new batch of upper bounds
for the order of A\X in terms of the order of A and a variety of parameters
related to the set X. He posed two questions concerning possible improvements
to his bounds. In this note, we answer both questions.
