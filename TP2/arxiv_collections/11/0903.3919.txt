We study a two-lane model of two-species of particles that perform biased
diffusion. Extensive numerical simulations show that when bias q is strong
enough oppositely drifting particles form some clusters that block each other.
Coarsening of such clusters is very slow and their size increases
logarithmically in time. For smaller q particles collapse essentially on a
single cluster whose size seems to diverge at a certain value of q=q_c.
Simulations show that despite slow coarsening, the model has rather large
power-law cooling-rate effects. It makes its dynamics different from glassy
systems, but similar to some three-dimensional Ising-type models (gonihedric
models).
