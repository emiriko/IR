Kolmogorov's statistic is used for the analysis of properties of
perturbations in the Cosmic Microwave Background signal. We obtain the maps of
the Kolmogorov stochasticity parameter for W and V band temperature data of
WMAP which are differently affected by the Galactic disk radiation and then we
model datasets with various statistic of perturbations. The analysis shows that
the Kolmogorov's parameter can be an efficient tool for the separation of
Cosmic Microwave Background from the contaminating radiations due to their
different statistical properties.
