We have used the GMOS instrument on the Gemini-South telescope to obtain
spatially-resolved two-colour imaging and IFU spectroscopy of a sample of ten
nearby E+A galaxies. Surface brightness profiles measured using our imaging
data show the isophotal profiles of our sample are generally r^{1/4}-like,
consistent with a sample dominated by early-type galaxies. This is further
underscored by all galaxies having early-type morphological classifications,
and showing a behaviour in the central velocity dispersion-absolute magnitude
plane that is consistent with the Faber-Jackson relation, once the transitory
brightening that occurs in the E+A phase is corrected for. In addition,
two-thirds of our sample shows clear evidence of either ongoing or recent tidal
interactions/mergers. While all the galaxies in our sample have total
integrated colours that are relatively blue, they show a diversity of colour
gradients, possessing central core regions that are either redder, bluer, or
indistinct in colour relative to their outer regions. Kinematically, the most
striking property is the significant and unambiguous rotation that is seen in
all our E+A galaxies, with it being generally aligned close to the photometric
major axis. This is contrary to the findings of Norton et al. 2001, who found
little or no evidence for rotation in a very similar sample of nearby E+A
galaxies. We also clearly demonstrate that our E+A galaxies are, in all but one
case, consistent with being "fast rotators" (Emsellem et al. 2007). We argue
that the combination of disturbed morphologies and significant rotation in
these galaxies supports their production via gas-rich galaxy mergers and
interactions. The large fraction of fast rotators argues against equal mass
mergers being the dominant progenitor to the E+A population.
