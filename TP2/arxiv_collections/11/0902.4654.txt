We provide a new exact solution of the Einstein equations which generalizes
the noncommutative geometry inspired Schwarzschild metric, we previously
obtained. We consider here more general relations between the energy density
and the radial pressure and find new a geometry describing a regular ``dirty
black hole''. We discuss strong and weak energy condition violations and
various aspects of the regular dirty black hole thermodynamics.
