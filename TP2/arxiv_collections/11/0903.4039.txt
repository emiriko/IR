On 2008 January 10, the twin Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO)
A and B spacecraft conducted a high time cadence study of the solar corona with
the Extreme UltraViolet Imager (EUVI) instruments with the aim of investigating
coronal dynamics. Observations of the three-dimensional propagation of waves
within active region coronal loops and a measurement of the true coronal slow
mode speed are obtained. Intensity oscillations with a period of approximately
12 minutes are observed to propagate outwards from the base of a loop system,
consistent with the slow magnetoacoustic mode. A novel analysis technique is
applied to measure the wave phase velocity in the observations of the A and B
spacecraft. These stereoscopic observations are used to infer the
three-dimensional velocity vector of the wave propagation, with an inclination
of 37 +- 6 deg to the local normal and a magnitude of 132 +- 9 and 132 +- 11 km
s-1, giving the first measurement of the true coronal longitudinal slow mode
speed, and an inferred temperature of 0.84 +- 12 MK and 0.84 +- 15 MK.
