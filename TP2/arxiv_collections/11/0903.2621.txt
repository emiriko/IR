Let f be a dominant meromorphic self-map on a projective manifold X which
preserves a meromorphic fibration pi: X --> Y of X over a projective manifold
Y. We establish formulas relating the dynamical degrees of f, the dynamical
degrees of f relative to the fibration and the dynamical degrees of the
self-map g on Y induced by f. Applications are given.
