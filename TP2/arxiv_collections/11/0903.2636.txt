By assuming an aspherical stellar wind with an equatorial disk from a red
giant, we investigate the production of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) via
symbiotic channel. We estimate that the Galactic birthrate of SNe Ia via
symbiotic channel is between $1.03\times 10^{-3}$ and $2.27\times 10^{-5}$
yr$^{-1}$, the delay time of SNe Ia has wide range from $\sim$ 0.07 to 5 Gyr.
The results are greatly affected by the outflow velocity and mass-loss rate of
the equatorial disk. Using our model, we discuss the progenitors of SN 2002ic
and SN 2006X.
