In this paper, we evaluate kinematic self-similar perfect fluid and dust
solutions for the most general cylindrically symmetric spacetime. We explore
kinematic self-similar solutions of the first, second, zeroth and infinite
kinds for parallel and orthogonal cases. It is found that the parallel case
gives solutions for both perfect fluid and dust cases in all kinds except the
zeroth kind of the dust case where there exists no solution. The orthogonal
perfect fluid case gives stiff fluid solution only in the first kind and vacuum
solution for the dust case. We obtain a total of thirteen solutions out of
which eleven are independent. The correspondence of these solutions with those
already available in the literature is also given.
