We consider spatially two dimensional Madelung fluid whose irrotational
motion reduces into the Schr\"odinger equation for a single free particle. In
this respect, we regard the former as a direct generalization of the latter,
allowing a rotational quantum flow. We then ask for the most likely wave
function possessing a given average energy by maximizing the Shannon
information entropy over the quantum probability density. We show that there
exists a class of solutions in which the wave function is self-trapped,
rotationally symmetric, spatially localized with finite support, and spinning
around its center, yet stationary. The stationarity comes from the balance
between the attractive quantum force field of a trapping quantum potential
generated by quantum probability density and the repulsive centrifugal force of
a rotating velocity vector field. We further show that there is a limiting case
where the wave function is non-spinning and yet still stationary. This special
state turns out to be the lowest stationary state of the ordinary Schr\"odinger
equation for a particle in a cylindrical tube classical potential.
