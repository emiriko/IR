We show that the classical equations of gravity follow from a thermodynamic
relation, dQ = T dS, where S is taken to be the Wald entropy, applied to a
local Rindler horizon at any point in spacetime. Our approach works for all
diffeomorphism-invariant theories of gravity. This suggests that classical
gravity may be thermodynamic in origin.
