In thin ($\Delta<$ few $\lambda_i$) collisionless current sheets in a space
plasma like the magnetospheric tail or magnetopause current layer, magnetic
fields can grow {from thermal fluctuation level by the action of the
non-magnetic Weibel instability \citep{weibel1959}.}The instability is driven
by the counter-streaming electron inflow from the `ion diffusion' (ion inertial
Hall) region into the inner current (electron inertial) region from where the
ambient magnetic fields are excluded when released by the inflowing electrons
which become non-magnetic on scales smaller than the electron gyroradius and
$<$ few $\lambda_e$. It is shown that under magnetospheric tail conditions it
takes $\sim$ 20-40 e-folding times ($\sim$ 10-20 s) for the Weibel field to
reach observable amplitudes $|{\bf b}_{\rm W}|\sim 1$ nT. In counter-streaming
inflows these fields are predominantly of guide field type. This is of interest
in magnetic guide field reconnection. Guide fields are known to possibly
providing the conditions required for the onset of bursty reconnection \citep
{drake2006,pritchett2005a,pritchett2006a,cassak2007}. In non-symmetric inflows
the Weibel field might itself evolve a component normal to the current sheet
which could also contribute to reconnection onset.
