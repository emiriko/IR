We numerically analyze the evolution of a long-duration gamma-ray burst jet
as it leaves the progenitor star and propagates to the photospheric radius,
where radiation can be released. We find that the interaction of the
relativistic material with the progenitor star has influences well beyond the
stellar surface. Tangential collimation shocks are observed throughout the jet
evolution, out to about 100 stellar radii, which is the whole range of our
simulation. We find that the jet is internally hot at the photospheric radius
and we compute the photospheric emission. The photosphere is a very efficient
radiator, capable of converting more than half of the total energy of the jet
into radiation. We show that bright photospheres are a common feature of jets
born inside massive progenitor stars and that this effect can explain the high
radiative efficiency observed in long-duration bursts.
