We present an experimental demonstration of strong coupling between a surface
plasmon propagating on a planar silver substrate, and the lowest excited state
of CdSe nanocrystals. Variable-angle spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements
demonstrated the formation of plasmon-exciton mixed states, characterized by a
Rabi splitting of $\sim$ 82 meV at room temperature. Such a coherent
interaction has the potential for the development of plasmonic non-linear
devices, and furthermore, this system is akin to those studied in cavity
quantum electrodynamics, thus offering the possibility to study the regime of
strong light-matter coupling in semiconductor nanocrystals at easily accessible
experimental conditions.
