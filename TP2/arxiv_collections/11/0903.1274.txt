We study the impact of dynamical correlations on the electronic structure and
coherent transport properties of Cu nanocontacts hosting a single magnetic
impurity (Ni,Co,Fe) in the contact region. The strong dynamical correlations of
the impurity 3d-electrons are fully taken into account by combining density
functional calculations with a dynamical treatment of the impurity 3d-shell in
the one-crossing approximation. We find that dynamical correlations give rise
to the Kondo effect and lead to Fano features in the coherent transport
characteristics similar to those observed in related experiments.
