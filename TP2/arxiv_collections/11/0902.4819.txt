Fermions in a space with some extra dimensional reflection symmetries are
considered. In this space only one Kaluza-Klein mode is observed at the scales
larger than the sizes of the extra dimensions while at the smaller scales all
modes become observable. The resulting picture suggests that this model has a
built-in Pauli-Villars-like regularization as its inherent characteristic.
