Using a segmented ion trap with mK laser-cooled ions we have realised a novel
single ion source which can deterministically deliver a wide range of ion
species, isotopes or ionic molecules [Schnitzler et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 102,
070501 (2009)]. Experimental data is discussed in detail and compared with
numerical simulations of ion trajectories. For the novel ion source we
investigate numerically the influence of various extraction parameters on
fluctuations in velocity and position of the beam. We present specialized ion
optics and show from numerical simulations that nm resolution is achievable.
The Paul trap, which is used as a single ion source, together with the
presented ion optics, constitutes a promising candidate for a deterministic ion
implantation method for applications in solid state quantum computing or
classical nano-electronic devices.
