This paper presents a Grid portal for protein secondary structure prediction
developed by using services of Aneka, a .NET-based enterprise Grid technology.
The portal is used by research scientists to discover new prediction structures
in a parallel manner. An SVM (Support Vector Machine)-based prediction
algorithm is used with 64 sample protein sequences as a case study to
demonstrate the potential of enterprise Grids.
