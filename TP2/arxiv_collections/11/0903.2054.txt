We study defects in non-relativistic conformal field theories. As in the
well-studied case of relativistic conformal defects, we find that a useful tool
to organize correlation functions is the defect operator expansion (dOPE). We
analyze how the dOPE is implemented in theories with a holographic dual,
highlighting some interesting aspects of the operator/state mapping in
non-relativistic holography.
