We obtained the spectral function of the graphite H point using high
resolution angle resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES). The extracted
width of the spectral function (inverse of the photo-hole lifetime) near the H
point is approximately proportional to the energy as expected from the linearly
increasing density of states (DOS) near the Fermi energy. This is well
accounted by our electron-phonon coupling theory considering the peculiar
electronic DOS near the Fermi level. And we also investigated the temperature
dependence of the peak widths both experimentally and theoretically. The upper
bound for the electron-phonon coupling parameter is ~0.23, nearly the same
value as previously reported at the K point. Our analysis of temperature
dependent ARPES data at K shows that the energy of phonon mode of graphite has
much higher energy scale than 125K which is dominant in electron-phonon
coupling.
