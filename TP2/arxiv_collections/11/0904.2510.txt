Applying functional renormalization group methods, we describe two
inequivalent ways of defining the renormalization group of matter-coupled four
dimensional gravity, in the approximation where only the conformal factor is
dynamical and taking the trace anomaly explicitly into account. We make contact
with earlier work and briefly discuss the presence or absence of fixed points,
depending on the truncation of the action and other approximations.
