Biased diffusive transport of Brownian particles through irregularly shaped,
narrow confining quasi-one-dimensional structures is investigated. The
complexity of the higher dimensional diffusive dynamics is reduced by means of
the so-called Fick-Jacobs approximation, yielding an effective one-dimensional
stochastic dynamics. Accordingly, the elimination of transverse, equilibrated
degrees of freedom stemming from geometrical confinements and/or bottlenecks
cause entropic potential barriers which the particles have to overcome when
moving forward noisily. The applicability and the validity of the reduced
kinetic description is tested by comparing the approximation with Brownian
dynamics simulations in full configuration space. This non-equilibrium
transport in such quasi-one-dimensional irregular structures implies for
moderate-to-strong bias a characteristic violation of the Sutherland-Einstein
fluctuation-dissipation relation.
