The Linked Data community is focused on integrating Resource Description
Framework (RDF) data sets into a single unified representation known as the Web
of Data. The Web of Data can be traversed by both man and machine and shows
promise as the \textit{de facto} standard for integrating data world wide much
like the World Wide Web is the \textit{de facto} standard for integrating
documents. On February 27$^\text{th}$ of 2009, an updated Linked Data cloud
visualization was made publicly available. This visualization represents the
various RDF data sets currently in the Linked Data cloud and their interlinking
relationships. For the purposes of this article, this visual representation was
manually transformed into a directed graph and analyzed.
