We present a search for the standard model Higgs boson using hadronically
decaying tau leptons, in 1 inverse femtobarn of data collected with the D0
detector at the Fermilab Tevatron ppbar collider. We select two final states:
tau plus missing transverse energy and b jets, and tau+ tau- plus jets. These
final states are sensitive to a combination of associated W/Z boson plus Higgs
boson, vector boson fusion and gluon-gluon fusion production processes. The
observed ratio of the combined limit on the Higgs production cross section at
the 95% C.L. to the standard model expectation is 29 for a Higgs boson mass of
115 GeV.
