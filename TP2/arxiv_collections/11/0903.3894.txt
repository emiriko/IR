A quantum shift register circuit acts on a set of input qubits and memory
qubits, outputs a set of output qubits and updated memory qubits, and feeds the
memory back into the device for the next cycle (similar to the operation of a
classical shift register). Such a device finds application as an encoding and
decoding circuit for a particular type of quantum error-correcting code, called
a quantum convolutional code. Building on the Ollivier-Tillich and
Grassl-Roetteler encoding algorithms for quantum convolutional codes, I present
a method to determine a quantum shift register encoding circuit for a quantum
convolutional code. I also determine a formula for the amount of memory that a
CSS quantum convolutional code requires. I then detail primitive quantum shift
register circuits that realize all of the finite- and infinite-depth
transformations in the shift-invariant Clifford group (the class of
transformations important for encoding and decoding quantum convolutional
codes). The memory formula for a CSS quantum convolutional code then
immediately leads to a formula for the memory required by a CSS
entanglement-assisted quantum convolutional code.
