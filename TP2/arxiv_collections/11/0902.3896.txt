It is proven that none of the bands in the quasi-energy spectrum of the
Quantum Kicked Rotor is flat at any primitive resonance of any order.
Perturbative estimates of bandwidths at small kick strength are established for
the case of primitive resonances of prime order. Different bands scale with
different powers of the kick strength, due to degeneracies in the spectrum of
the free rotor.
