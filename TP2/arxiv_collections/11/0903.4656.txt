The statistical physics of homogeneous DNA is investigated by the imaginary
time path integral formalism. The base pair stretchings are described by an
ensemble of paths selected through a macroscopic constraint, the fulfillement
of the second law of thermodynamics. The number of paths contributing to the
partition function strongly increases around and above a specific temperature
$T^*_c$ whereas the fraction of unbound base pairs grows continuosly around and
above $T^*_c$. The latter is identified with the denaturation temperature.
Thus, the separation of the two complementary strands appears as a highly
cooperative phenomenon displaying a smooth crossover versus $T$. The
thermodynamical properties have been computed in a large temperature range by
varying the size of the path ensemble at the lower bound of the range. No
significant physical dependence on the system size has been envisaged. The
entropy grows continuosly versus $T$ while the specific heat displays a
remarkable peak at $T^*_c$. The location of the peak versus $T$ varies with the
stiffness of the anharmonic stacking interaction along the strand. The
presented results suggest that denaturation in homogeneous DNA has the features
of a second order phase transition. The method accounts for the cooperative
behavior of a very large number of degrees of freedom while the computation
time is kept within a reasonable limit.
