We report zero-field muon spin rotation and relaxation measurements on the
superconducting ferromagnet UCoGe. Weak itinerant ferromagnetic order is
detected by a spontaneous muon spin precession frequency below the Curie
temperature $T_C = 3$ K. The $\mu^+$ precession frequency persists below the
bulk superconducting transition temperature $T_{sc} = 0.5$ K, where it measures
a local magnetic field $B_{loc} = 0.015$ T. The amplitude of the $\mu$SR signal
provides unambiguous proof for ferromagnetism present in the whole sample
volume. We conclude ferromagnetism coexists with superconductivity on the
microscopic scale.
