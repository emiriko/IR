We compare flavour singlet and non-singlet vector mesons from first
principles using lattice QCD. With N_f=2 flavours of light quark, this
addresses the omega-rho mass difference.
  Using maximally twisted-mass lattice QCD, we are able for the first time to
determine this mass difference precisely and we compare with experiment. We
also discuss omega-rho mixing effects arising within QCD through the u-d quark
mass difference.
