The top quark is the heaviest elementary particle observed to date. Its large
mass of about 173 GeV/c^2 makes the top quark act differently than other
elementary fermions, as it decays before it hadronises, passing its spin
information on to its decay products. In addition, the top quark plays an
important role in higher-order loop corrections to standard model processes,
which makes the top quark mass a crucial parameter for precision tests of the
electroweak theory. The top quark is also a powerful probe for new phenomena
beyond the standard model. During the time of discovery at the Tevatron in 1995
only a few properties of the top quark could be measured. In recent years,
since the start of Tevatron Run II, the field of top-quark physics has changed
and entered a precision era. This report summarises the latest measurements and
studies of top-quark properties and gives prospects for future measurements at
the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).
