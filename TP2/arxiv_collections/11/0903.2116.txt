The CLIC machine incorporates a 20 mrad crossing angle at the IP to aid the
extraction of spent beams. In order to recover the luminosity lost through the
crossing angle a crab cavity is proposed to rotate the bunches prior to
collision. The crab cavity is chosen to have the same frequency as the main
linac (11.9942 GHz) as a compromise between size, phase stability requirements
and beam loading. It is proposed to use a HE11 mode travelling wave structure
as the CLIC crab cavity in order to minimise beam loading and mode separation.
The position of the crab cavity close to the final focus enhances the effect of
transverse wake-fields so effective wake-field damping is required. A damped
detuned structure is proposed to suppress and de-cohere the wake-field hence
reducing their effect. Design considerations for the CLIC crab cavity will be
discussed as well as the proposed high power testing of these structures at
SLAC.
