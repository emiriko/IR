It is shown that effects of particle identity entail reduction in the number
of orbital degrees-of-freedom in non-relativistic 2-particle systems from 6 to
5. This effect of redundancy in description of orbital motion is found to be in
correspondence to multiplicative phase factor $(-1)^{2s}$ which accompany
interchange of the two particles, where $s$ is the spin of one particle.
