Based on a relativistic mean-field theory with an effective point coupling
between the nucleons, three-dimensional angular momentum projection is
implemented for the first time to project out states with designed angular
momentum from deformed intrinsic states generated by triaxial quadrupole
constraints. The same effective parameter set PC-F1 of the effective
interaction is used for deriving the mean field and the collective Hamiltonian.
Pairing correlations are taken into account by the BCS method using both
monopole forces and zero range d-forces with strength parameters adjusted to
experimental even-odd mass differences. The method is applied successfully to
the isotopes 24Mg, 30Mg, and 32Mg.
