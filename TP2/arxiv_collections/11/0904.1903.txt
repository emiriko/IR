In a financial market model, we consider variations of the problem of
minimizing the expected time to upcross a certain wealth level. For exponential
Levy markets, we show the asymptotic optimality of the growth-optimal portfolio
for the above problem and obtain tight bounds for the value function for any
wealth level. In an Ito market, we employ the concept of market time, which is
a clock that runs according to the underlying market growth. We show the
optimality of the growth-optimal portfolio for minimizing the expected market
time to reach any wealth level. This reveals a general definition of market
time which can be useful from an investor's point of view. We utilize this last
definition to extend the previous results in a general semimartingale setting.
