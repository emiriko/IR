Recent investigations have revealed a surprising lack of close binaries among
extreme horizontal branch (EHB) stars in the globular cluster NGC6752, at
variance with the analogous sdB field stars. Another puzzling result concerns
the derived spectroscopic masses for some EHB stars. The present paper extends
our study of NGC6752 to M80 and NGC5986. Twenty-one horizontal branch stars
(out of which 5 EHBs) in NGC5986 and 31 in M80 (11 EHBs) were observed during
four consecutive nights. We measured radial velocity variations, temperatures,
gravities, and helium abundances. By means of a statistical analysis, we
detected one EHB close binary candidate per cluster. In M80, the best estimate
of the close binary EHB fraction is f=12%, and even the lowest estimate of the
binary fraction among field sdB stars can be ruled out within a 90% confidence
level. Because of the small observed sample, no strong conclusions can be drawn
on the close EHB binary fraction for NGC5986, although our best estimate is
rather low (f=25%). For the discrepancy in spectroscopic derived masses with
theoretical models observed in NGC6752, our analysis of M80 EHB stars shows a
similar trend. For the first time, we report a clear trend in surface helium
abundance with temperature. Our results show that the deficiency of close
binaries among EHB stars is now confirmed in two, and possibly three, globular
clusters. This feature is therefore not a peculiarity of NGC6752. Our analysis
also proves that the strangely high spectroscopic masses among EHB stars are
now confirmed in at least a second cluster. Our results confirm that f could be
a function of the age of the sdB star population, but we find that recent
models have some problem reproducing all observations.
