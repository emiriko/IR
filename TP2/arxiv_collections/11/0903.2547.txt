Insights to the mechanism of CdSe nanoparticle attachment to carbon nanotubes
following the hot injection method are discussed. It was observed that the
presence of water improves the nanotube coverage while Cl containing media are
responsible for the shape transformation of the nanoparticles and further
attachment to the carbon lattice. The experiments also show that the mechanism
taking place involves the right balance of several factors, namely, low
passivated nanoparticle surface, particles with well-defined crystallographic
facets, and interaction with an organics-free sp2 carbon lattice. Furthermore,
this procedure can be extended to cover graphene by quantum dots.
