Currently, there are a number of light-shining-through-walls experiments
searching for hidden photons -- light, sub-eV-scale, abelian gauge bosons
beyond the standard model which mix kinetically with the standard photon. We
show that in the case that one of these experiments finds evidence for hidden
photons, laser communications through matter, using methods from free-space
optics, can be realized in the very near future, with a channel capacity of
more than 1 bit per second, for a distance up to the Earth's diamater.
