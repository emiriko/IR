In this publication we will implement the inverse Seesaw mechanism into the
noncommutative framework on the basis of the AC-extension of the Standard
Model. The main difference to the classical AC model is the chiral nature of
the AC fermions with respect to a U(1) extension of the Standard Model gauge
group. It is this extension which allows us to couple the right-handed
neutrinos via a gauge invariant mass term to left-handed A-particles. The
natural scale of these gauge invariant masses is of the order of 10^17 GeV
while the Dirac masses of the neutrino and the AC-particles are generated
dynamically and are therefore much smaller (ca. 1 GeV to 10^6 GeV). From this
configuration a working inverse Seesaw mechanism for the neutrinos is obtained.
