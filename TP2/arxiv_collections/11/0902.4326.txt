The problem of linear stability of confined V-flames with arbitrary gas
expansion is addressed. Using the on-shell description of flame dynamics, a
general equation governing propagation of disturbances of an anchored flame is
obtained. This equation is solved analytically for V-flames in high-velocity
channel streams. It is demonstrated that dynamics of flame disturbances in this
case is controlled by the memory effects associated with vorticity generated by
the curved front. The perturbation growth rate spectrum is determined, and
explicit analytic expressions for the eigenfunctions are given. It is found
that the piecewise linear V-structure is unstable for all values of the gas
expansion coefficient.
