We study suppression of the collapse and stabilization of matter-wave
solitons by means of time-periodic modulation of the effective nonlinearity,
using the nonpolynomial Schroedinger equation (NPSE) for BEC trapped in a tight
cigar-shaped potential. By means of systematic simulations, a stability region
is identified in the plane of the modulation amplitude and frequency. In the
low-frequency regime, solitons feature chaotic evolution, although they remain
robust objects.
