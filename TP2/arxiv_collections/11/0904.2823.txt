A purely numerical method, Direct ComputationMethod is applied to evaluate
Feynman integrals. This method is based on the combination of an efficient
numerical integration and an efficient extrapolation. In addition,
high-precision arithmetic and parallelization technique can be used in this
method if required. We present the recent progress in development of this
method and show results such as one-loop 5-point and two-loop 3-point
integrals.
