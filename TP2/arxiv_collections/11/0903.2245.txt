We study theoretically the magnetic screening properties of thin, diffusive
superconductor/ferromagnet bilayers subject to a perpendicular magnetic field.
We find that the effective penetration depth characterizing the magnetic
response oscillates with the thickness of the ferromagnetic layer on the scale
of the ferromagnetic coherence length.
