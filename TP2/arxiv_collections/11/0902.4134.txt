This paper represents the full version of a paper published earlier in
Physica A [246 (1997), 275]. The present paper includes argumentation, proofs
and details omitted in the shortened version. The papers are a further
development of the approach in quantum statistical mechanics proposed by the
author. The hierarchy of equations for reduced density matrices obtained
previously is extended to the case corresponding to the Bose-Einstein
condensation. The relevant state of the system with a condensate can be
superfluid as well as nonsuperfluid. Special attention is given to the
thermodynamics of superfluid systems. According to the results of the papers
superfluidity is the state of a fluid whose symmetry is spontaneously broken
because of a stationary flow. The state corresponds to thermodynamic
equilibrium while the magnitude of the flow depends upon the temperature and is
determined by thermodynamic considerations. The equations obtained are solved
in two simple cases. The physical origin of superfluidity, peculiarities of the
phenomenon in closed volumes and the critical velocity are discussed as well.
