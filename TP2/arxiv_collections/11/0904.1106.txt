The thermally assisted detachment of a self-avoiding polymer chain from an
adhesive surface by an external force applied to one of the chain ends is
investigated. We perform our study in the "fixed height" statistical ensemble
where one measures the fluctuating force, exerted by the chain on the last
monomer when a chain end is kept fixed at height $h$ over the solid plane at
different adsorption strength $\epsilon$. The phase diagram in the $h -
\epsilon$ plane is calculated both analytically and by Monte Carlo simulations.
We demonstrate that in the vicinity of the polymer desorption transition a
number of properties like fluctuations and probability distribution of various
quantities behave differently, if $h$ rather than $f$ is used as an independent
control parameter.
