We investigate a possible mechanism for the autoionization of ultracold
Rydberg gases, based on the resonant coupling of Rydberg pair states to the
ionization continuum. Unlike an atomic collision where the wave functions begin
to overlap, the mechanism considered here involves only the long-range dipole
interaction and is in principle possible in a static system. It is related to
the process of intermolecular Coulombic decay (ICD). In addition, we include
the interaction-induced motion of the atoms and the effect of multi-particle
systems in this work. We find that the probability for this ionization
mechanism can be increased in many-particle systems featuring attractive or
repulsive van der Waals interactions. However, the rates for ionization through
resonant dipole coupling are very low. It is thus unlikely that this process
contributes to the autoionization of Rydberg gases in the form presented here,
but it may still act as a trigger for secondary ionization processes. As our
picture involves only binary interactions, it remains to be investigated if
collective effects of an ensemble of atoms can significantly influence the
ionization probability. Nevertheless our calculations may serve as a starting
point for the investigation of more complex systems, such as the coupling of
many pair states proposed in [Tanner et al., PRL 100, 043002 (2008)].
