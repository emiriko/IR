The brain deformation that occurs during neurosurgery is a serious issue
impacting the patient "safety" as well as the invasiveness of the brain
surgery. Model-driven compensation is a realistic and efficient solution to
solve this problem. However, a vital issue is the lack of reliable and easily
obtainable patient-specific mechanical characteristics of the brain which,
according to clinicians' experience, can vary considerably. We designed an
aspiration device that is able to meet the very rigorous sterilization and
handling process imposed during surgery, and especially neurosurgery. The
device, which has no electronic component, is simple, light and can be
considered as an ancillary instrument. The deformation of the aspirated tissue
is imaged via a mirror using an external camera. This paper describes the
experimental setup as well as its use during a specific neurosurgery. The
experimental data was used to calibrate a continuous model. We show that we
were able to extract an in vivo constitutive law of the brain elasticity: thus
for the first time, measurements are carried out per-operatively on the
patient, just before the resection of the brain parenchyma. This paper
discloses the results of a difficult experiment and provide for the first time
in-vivo data on human brain elasticity. The results point out the softness as
well as the highly non-linear behavior of the brain tissue.
