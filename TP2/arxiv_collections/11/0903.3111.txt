Our study is based on the work of Stinchcombe [1974 \emph{J. Phys. C}
\textbf{7} 179] and is devoted to the calculations of average conductivity of
random resistor networks placed on an anisotropic Bethe lattice. The structure
of the Bethe lattice is assumed to represent the normal directions of the
regular lattice. We calculate the anisotropic conductivity as an expansion in
powers of inverse coordination number of the Bethe lattice. The expansion terms
retained deliver an accurate approximation of the conductivity at resistor
concentrations above the percolation threshold. We make a comparison of our
analytical results with those of Bernasconi [1974 \emph{Phys. Rev. B}
\textbf{9} 4575] for the regular lattice.
