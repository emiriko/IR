In this study a systematical analysis of various polarization asymmetries in
inclusive $b \rar s \ell^+ \ell^-$ decay in the standard model (SM) with four
generation of quarks is carried out. We found that the various asymmetries are
sensitive to the new mixing and quark masses for both of the $\mu$ and $\tau$
channels. Sizeable deviations from the SM values are obtained. Hence, $b \rar s
\ell^+ \ell^-$ decay is a valuable tool for searching physics beyond the SM,
especially in the indirect searches for the fourth-generation of quarks ($t',
b')$.
