We establish sharp $L^2$-Sobolev estimates for classes of pseudodifferential
operators with singular symbols whose non-pseudodifferential (Fourier integral
operator) parts exhibit two-sided fold singularities. The operators considered
include both singular integral operators along curves in $R^2$ with simple
inflection points and normal operators arising in linearized seismic imaging in
the presence of fold caustics.
