Vibrational density of states (VDOS) in a supercooled polydisperse liquid is
computed by diagonalizing the Hessian matrix evaluated at the potential energy
minima for systems with different values of polydispersity. An increase of
polydispersity leads to an increase in relative population of the localized
high-frequency modes. At low frequencies, the density of states show an excess
compared to the Debye squared-frequency law, which has been identified with the
boson peak. The height of the boson peak increases with polydispersity. The
values of the participation ratio as well as the level spacing statistics
demonstrate that the modes comprising the boson peak are largely delocalized.
Interestingly, the intensity of the boson peak shows a rather narrow
sensitivity to changes in temperature and is seen to persist even at high
temperatures. Study of the difference spectrum at two different polydispersity
reveals that the increase in the height of boson peak is due to a population
shift from modes with frequencies above the maximum in the VDOS to that below
the maximum, indicating an increase in the fraction of the unstable modes in
the system. The latter is further supported by the facilitation of the observed
dynamics by polydispersity. Since the strength of the liquid increases with
polydispersity, the present result provides an evidence that the intensity of
boson peak correlates positively with the strength of the liquid, as observed
earlier in many experimental systems.
