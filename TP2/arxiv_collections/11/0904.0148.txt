We report on numerical investigations concerning the propagation of solitons
in a real DNA chain (the Human Adenovirus 2) using a realistic model of DNA
torsional dynamics; this takes fully into account the inhomogeneities in the
real chain. We find that twist solitons propagate for considerable distances
(2-10 times their diameters) before stopping due to phonon emission. Our
results show that twist solitons may exist in real DNA chains; and on a more
general level that solitonic propagation can take place in highly inhomogeneous
media.
