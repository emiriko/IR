We consider the currently observed spin distributions of various types of
neutron stars, including isolated and binary radio millisecond pulsars in the
Galactic plane and globular cluster system as well as neutron stars in low-mass
X-ray binary systems where the spin rate is known either through coherent
pulsations or burst oscillations. We find that the spin distributions of
isolated and binary radio millisecond pulsars are statistically different, at
least for those residing in globular clusters, with the binary pulsars being on
average faster spinning. This result is likely to hold despite observational
biases still affecting the observed spin distribution. A possible explanation
for this is that the isolated radio millisecond pulsars are on average older
than those in binary systems.
