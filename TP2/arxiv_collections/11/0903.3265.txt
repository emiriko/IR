We present an analysis of data stemming from numerical simulations of
decaying magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence up to grid resolution of 1536^3
points and up to Taylor Reynolds number of 1200. The initial conditions are
such that the initial velocity and magnetic fields are helical and in
equipartition, while their correlation is negligible. Analyzing the data at the
peak of dissipation, we show that the dissipation in MHD seems to asymptote to
a constant as the Reynolds number increases, thereby strengthening the
possibility of fast reconnection events in the solar environment for very large
Reynolds numbers. Furthermore, intermittency of MHD flows, as determined by the
spectrum of anomalous exponents of structure functions of the velocity and the
magnetic field, is stronger than for fluids, confirming earlier results;
however, we also find that there is a measurable difference between the
exponents of the velocity and those of the magnetic field, as observed recently
in the solar wind. Finally, we discuss the spectral scaling laws that arise in
this flow.
