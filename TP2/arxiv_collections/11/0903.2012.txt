We discuss the use of Kaniadakis' $\kappa$-exponential in the construction of
a statistical manifold modelled on Lebesgue spaces of real random variables.
Some algebraic features of the deformed exponential models are considered. A
chart is defined for each strictly positive densities; every other strictly
positive density in a suitable neighborhood of the reference probability is
represented by the centered $\Kln$ likelihood
