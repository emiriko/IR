We analyze two flare events which occurred in active region NOAA 501 on
November 20, 2003. The H-alpha and magnetogram measurements show interaction
between two filaments which produced a slowly rising flare event, corresponding
to two stages of magnetic reconnection. The relative clockwise rotation between
the two sunspot systems caused filament destabilization. The cusp-shaped
magnetic field in the main phase of the second flare and its evolution in
correlation with ribbon separation provide evidence for the cause of the CME
eruption. The propagation and orientation of the CME with respect to the
ecliptic plane is illustrated by IPS images.
