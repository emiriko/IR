We study the localization properties of eigenvectors of the Google matrix,
generated both from the World Wide Web and from the Albert-Barabasi model of
networks. We establish the emergence of a delocalization phase for the PageRank
vector when network parameters are changed. In the phase of localized PageRank,
a delocalization takes place in the complex plane of eigenvalues of the matrix,
leading to delocalized relaxation modes. We argue that the efficiency of
information retrieval by Google-type search is strongly affected in the phase
of delocalized PageRank.
