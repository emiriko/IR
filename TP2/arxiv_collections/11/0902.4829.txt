We present recent results on a systematic method to calculate transport
coefficients for a meson gas (in particular, we analyze a pion gas) at low
temperatures in the context of Chiral Perturbation Theory (ChPT). Our method is
based on the study of Feynman diagrams taking into account collisions in the
plasma by means of the non-zero particle width. This implies a modification of
the standard ChPT power counting scheme. We discuss the importance of
unitarity, which allows for an accurate high energy description of scattering
amplitudes, generating dynamically the $\rho (770)$ and $f_0(600)$ mesons. Our
results are compatible with analyses of kinetic theory, both in the
non-relativistic very low-$T$ regime and near the transition. We show the
behavior with temperature of the electrical and thermal conductivities as well
as of the shear and bulk viscosities. We obtain that bulk viscosity is
negligible against shear viscosity, except near the chiral phase transition
where the conformal anomaly might induce larger bulk effects. Different
asymptotic limits for transport coefficients, large-$N_c$ scaling and some
applications to heavy-ion collisions are studied.
