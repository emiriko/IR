We report on near-infrared (IR) interferometric observations of the
double-lined pre-main sequence (PMS) binary system DQ Tau. We model these data
with a visual orbit for DQ Tau supported by the spectroscopic orbit & analysis
of \citet{Mathieu1997}. Further, DQ Tau exhibits significant near-IR excess;
modeling our data requires inclusion of near-IR light from an 'excess' source.
Remarkably the excess source is resolved in our data, similar in scale to the
binary itself ($\sim$ 0.2 AU at apastron), rather than the larger circumbinary
disk ($\sim$ 0.4 AU radius). Our observations support the \citet{Mathieu1997}
and \citet{Carr2001} inference of significant warm material near the DQ Tau
binary.
