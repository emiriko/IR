Ultra high energy cosmic ray events presently show a spectrum, which we
interpret here as galactic cosmic rays due to a starburst in the radio galaxy
Cen A pushed up in energy by the shock of a relativistic jet. The knee feature
and the particles with energy immediately higher in galactic cosmic rays then
turn into the bulk of ultra high energy cosmic rays. This entails that all
ultra high energy cosmic rays are heavy nuclei. This picture is viable if the
majority of the observed ultra high energy events come from the radio galaxy
Cen A, and are scattered by intergalactic magnetic fields across most of the
sky.
