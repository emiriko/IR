We study B->K(*)l+l- decays (l=e,mu) based on a data sample of 657 million BB
pairs collected with the Belle detector at the KEKB e+e- collider. We report
the differential branching fraction, isospin asymmetry, K* polarization, and
the forward-backward asymmetry (AFB) as functions of q^2 = M_{ll}^2*c^2. The
fitted AFB spectrum exceeds the Standard Model expectation by 2.7 standard
deviations. The measured branching fractions are
B(B->K*l+l-)=(10.7+1.1-1.0+-0.9)*10^-7 and
B(B->Kl+l-)=(4.8+0.5-0.4+-0.3)*10^-7, where the first errors are statistical
and the second are systematic, with the muon to electron ratios
R_K*=0.83+-0.17+-0.05 and R_K=1.03+-0.19+-0.06, respectively.
