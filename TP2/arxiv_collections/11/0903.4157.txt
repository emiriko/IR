We introduce a finiteness property for braided fusion categories, describe a
conjecture that would characterize categories possessing this, and verify the
conjecture in a number of important cases. In particular we say a category has
F if the associated braid group representations factor over a finite group, and
suggest that categories of integral Frobenius-Perron dimension are precisely
those with property F.
