In this work we investigate the effects of torsion in the framework of
Einstein-Cartan theory in early cosmology. We study solutions for a homogeneous
and isotropic relativistic Weyssenhoff spin fluid with dynamical timelike axial
current, also homogeneous and isotropic. The general solutions can mostly be
described by means of three particular solutions. The properties of these
solutions (such as singularity avoidance and primordial or late accelerated
expansion) are analysed and depend on the relations between the source
parameters.
