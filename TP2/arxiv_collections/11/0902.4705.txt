We show a system capable of projecting a video scene on a white-light
holographic screen to obtain a kind of image that results in a plane in front
of the screen. This holographic screen is mainly a diffractive lens and it is
constructed by holography. The image plane can be located at any azimuth angle
and seen with continuous parallax and without the use of goggles or any special
visualization equipment. The image is not volumetric but when the plane is
oblique to the observer its appearance looks very close to a real volumetric
image.
