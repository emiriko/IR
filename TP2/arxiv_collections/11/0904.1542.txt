A search for variable stars with ultra-low amplitudes (ULA), in the millimag
range, has been made in the combined MACHO and OGLE data bases in the broad
vicinity of the Cepheid instability strip in the HR diagram. A total of 25
singly periodic and 4 multiply periodic ULA objects has been uncovered. Our
analysis does not allow us to distinguish between pulsational and ellipsoidal
(binary) variability, nor between LMC and foreground objects. However, the
objects are strongly clustered and appear to be associated with the pulsational
instability strips of LMC Pop. I and II variables. When combined with the ULA
variables of Buchler et al (2005) a total of 20 objects fall close to the
classical Cepheid instability strip. However, they appear to fall on parallel
period-magnitude relations that are shifted to slightly higher magnitude which
would confer them a different evolutionary status. Low amplitude RV Tauri and
Pop. II Cepheids have been uncovered that do not appear in the MACHO or OGLE
catalogs. Interestingly, a set of binaries seem to lie on a PM relation that is
essentially parallel to that of the RV Tauri/Pop. II Cepheids.
