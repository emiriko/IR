Bose systems, subject to the action of external random potentials, are
considered. For describing the system properties, under the action of spatially
random potentials of arbitrary strength, the stochastic mean-field
approximation is employed. When the strength of disorder increases, the
extended Bose-Einstein condensate fragments into spatially disconnected
regions, forming a granular condensate. Increasing the strength of disorder
even more transforms the granular condensate into the normal glass. The
influence of time-dependent external potentials is also discussed. Fast varying
temporal potentials, to some extent, imitate the action of spatially random
potentials. In particular, strong time-alternating potential can induce the
appearance of a nonequilibrium granular condensate.
