We study non-adiabatic two-parameter charge and spin pumping through a
single-level quantum dot with Coulomb interaction. For the limit of weak tunnel
coupling and in the regime of pumping frequencies up to the tunneling rates,
$\Omega \lesssim \Gamma/\hbar$, we perform an exact resummation of
contributions of all orders in the pumping frequency. As striking non-adiabatic
signatures, we find frequency-dependent phase shifts in the charge and spin
currents, which allow for an effective single-parameter pumping as well as pure
spin without charge currents.
