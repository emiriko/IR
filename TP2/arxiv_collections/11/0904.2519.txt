The aim of this article is to show that systems of linear partial
differential equations on filtered manifolds, which are of weighted finite
type, can be canonically rewritten as first order systems of a certain type.
This leads immediately to obstructions to the existence of solutions. Moreover,
we will deduce that the solution space of such equations is always finite
dimensional.
