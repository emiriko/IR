I show how applying a symplectic Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization to the
normalizer of a quantum code gives a different way of determining the code's
logical operators. This approach may be more natural in the setting where we
produce a quantum code from classical codes because the generator matrices of
the classical codes form the normalizer of the resulting quantum code. This
technique is particularly useful in determining the logical operators of an
entanglement-assisted code produced from two classical binary codes or from one
classical quaternary code. Finally, this approach gives additional formulas for
computing the amount of entanglement that an entanglement-assisted code
requires.
