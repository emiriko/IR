As the Cosmology and Fundamental Physics (CFP) panel is fully aware, the next
decade will see major advances in our understanding of these areas of research.
To quote from their charge, these advances will occur in studies of the early
universe, the microwave background, the reionization and galaxy formation up to
virialization of protogalaxies, large scale structure, the intergalactic
medium, the determination of cosmological parameters, dark matter, dark energy,
tests of gravity, astronomically determined physical constants, and high energy
physics using astronomical messengers. Central to the progress in these areas
are the corresponding advances in laboratory astrophysics which are required
for fully realizing the CFP scientific opportunities within the decade
2010-2020. Laboratory astrophysics comprises both theoretical and experimental
studies of the underlying physics which produce the observed astrophysical
processes. The 5 areas of laboratory astrophysics which we have identified as
relevant to the CFP panel are atomic, molecular, plasma, nuclear, and particle
physics. Here, Section 2 describes some of the new scientific opportunities and
compelling scientific themes which will be enabled by advances in laboratory
astrophysics. In Section 3, we provide the scientific context for these
opportunities. Section 4 briefly discusses some of the experimental and
theoretical advances in laboratory astrophysics required to realize the CFP
scientific opportunities of the next decade. As requested in the Call for White
Papers, Section 5 presents four central questions and one area with unusual
discovery potential. Lastly, we give a short postlude in Section 6.
