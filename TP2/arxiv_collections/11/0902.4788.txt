In this paper we will discuss the previously proposed quantity nu_dyn[1], as
a measure of the number-ratio fluctuations in high-energy particle-production.
We will show that nu_dyn has pleasing mathematical properties making it ideal
for the purpose. We will demonstrate its relation to two-particle correlations
and how this measure can be generalized to higher order correlations.
