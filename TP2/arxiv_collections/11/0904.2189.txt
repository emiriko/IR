We propose a stochastic dynamical model of noisy neural networks with complex
architectures and discuss activation of neural networks by a stimulus,
pacemakers and spontaneous activity. This model has a complex phase diagram
with self-organized active neural states, hybrid phase transitions, and a rich
array of behavior. We show that if spontaneous activity (noise) reaches a
threshold level then global neural oscillations emerge. Stochastic resonance is
a precursor of this dynamical phase transition. These oscillations are an
intrinsic property of even small groups of 50 neurons.
