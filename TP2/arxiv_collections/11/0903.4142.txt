Given a closed connected Riemannian manifold M and a connected Riemannian
manifold N, we study fiberwise volume decreasing diffeomorphisms on the product
M x N. Our main theorem shows that in the presence of certain cohomological
condition on M and N such diffeomorphisms must map a fiber diffeomorphically
onto another fiber and are therefore fiber volume preserving. As a first
corollary, we show that the isometries of M x N split. We also study properly
discontinuous actions of a discrete group on M x N. In this case, we generalize
the first Bieberbach theorem and prove a special case of an extension of
Talelli's conjecture.
