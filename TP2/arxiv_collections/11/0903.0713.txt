Non-classical states that are characterized by their non-positive
quasi-probabilities in phase space are known to be the basis for various
quantum effects. In this work, we investigate the interrelation between the
non-classicality and entanglement, and then characterize the non-classicality
that precisely corresponds to entanglement. The results naturally follow from
two findings: one is the general structure among non-classical, entangled,
separable, and classical states over Hermitian operators, and the other a
general scheme to detect non-classical states.
