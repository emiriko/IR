Multilayer VO$_2$/TiO$_2$ nanostructures ($d^1$ - $d^0$ interfaces with no
polar discontinuity) are studied with first principles density functional
methods including structural relaxation. Quantum confinement of the {\it half
metallic} VO$_2$ slab within insulating TiO$_2$ produces an unexpected and
unprecendented two-dimensional new state, with a {\it semiDirac} point Fermi
surface: spinless charge carriers are effective-mass like along one principal
axis, but are massless along the other. Effects of interface imperfection are
addressed.
