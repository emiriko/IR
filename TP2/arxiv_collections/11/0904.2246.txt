The effects of SU(3) symmetry breaking and configuration mixing have been
investigated for the weak vector and axial-vector form factors in the chiral
constituent quark model (\chi CQM) for the strangeness changing as well as
strangeness conserving semi-leptonic octet baryon decays in the nonperturbative
regime. The results are in good agreement with existing experimental data and
also show improvement over other phenomenological models.
