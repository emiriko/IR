We review the theory of relaxational kinetics of superfluid turbulence--a
tangle of quantized vortex lines--in the limit of very low temperatures when
the motion of vortices is conservative. While certain important aspects of the
decay depend on whether the tangle is non-structured, like the one in the
Kibble-Zurek picture, or essentially polarized, like the one that emulates the
Richardson-Kolmogorov regime of classical turbulence, there are common
fundamental features. In both cases, there exists an asymptotic range in the
wavenumber space where the energy flux is supported by the cascade of Kelvin
waves (kelvons)--precessing distortions propagating along the vortex filaments.
At large enough wavenumbers, the Kelvin-wave cascade is supported by
three-kelvon elastic scattering. At T=0 the dissipative cutoff of the
Kelvin-wave cascade is due to the emission of phonons, in which an elementary
process converts two kelvons with almost opposite momenta into one bulk phonon.
Along with the standard set of conservation laws, a crucial role in the theory
is played by the fact of integrability of the local induction approximation
(LIA) controlled by the parameter \Lambda = \ln (\lambda/a_0), with \lambda the
characteristic kelvon wavelength and a_0 the vortex core radius. While
excluding a straightforward onset of the pure three-kelvon cascade, the
integrability of LIA does not plug the cascade because of the availability of
the kinetic channels associated with vortex line reconnections. We argue that
the crossover from Richardson-Kolmogorov to the Kelvin-wave cascade is due to
eventual dominance of local induction of a single line over the collective
induction of polarized eddies, which causes the breakdown of classical-fluid
regime and gives rise to a reconnection-driven inertial range.
