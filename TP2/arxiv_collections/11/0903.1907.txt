We show that a hybrid metamaterial slab comprising of an one-dimensional
array of two different types of cavities exhibits ferrimagnetic-like surface
resonances which can be used to realize interesting phenomena such as directive
emission as a consequence of strong angle-dependent reflection phase and the
selective coupling of a Gaussian incident beam into a higher order diffractive
channel, giving rise to the phenomenon of negative reflection and
retro-directive backtracking. The findings are verified by experiments in the
microwave regime.
