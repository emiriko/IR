We discuss the usefulness of the double charge-exchange reactions (DCX) for
the production of the neutron-rich Lambda-hypernuclei. We believe the (pi-,K+)
reaction is one of the most promising DCX reactions, and propose to produce the
neutron-rich Lambda-hypernuclei, 6(Lambda)H and 9(Lambda)He, at the J-PARC 50
GeV PS by the reaction (J-PARC E10 experiment). The design of the experiment is
presented.
