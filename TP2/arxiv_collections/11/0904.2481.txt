The Apodized Pupil Lyot Coronagraph (APLC) is a promising coronagraphic
device for direct exoplanets detection on the European-Extremely Large
Telescope. We present new near-IR laboratory results using binary apodizers --
the so-called microdots apodizer -- which represent a very attractive and
advantageous solution for the APLC.
  Microdots apodizers introduce high-frequency noise whose characteristics
depend on the pixel size. The aim of this work is to characterize the impact of
the pixel size on the coronagraphic image. Estimation of both the noise
intensity and its localization in the field of view is the objective of this
study.
  Stray-light diffraction introduced by the finite pixel size was measured
during experiment. Intensity decreases, and radial distance increases, when the
pixel size gets smaller.
  The physical properties of these microdots apodizers have been demonstrated
in laboratory. The microdots apodizer is a suitable solution for any
coronagraph using pupil amplitude apodization if properly designed.
