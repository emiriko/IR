The third part of the OGLE-III Catalog of Variable Stars comprises 24906 RR
Lyr stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). This sample consists of 17693
fundamental-mode (RRab), 4958 first-overtone (RRc), 986 double-mode (RRd) and
1269 suspected second-overtone (RRe) pulsators. 66 objects are foreground
Galactic RR Lyr stars. The catalog data include basic photometric and
astrometric properties of these RR Lyr stars, multi-epoch VI photometry and
finding charts.
  We detected one new RR Lyr star with additional eclipsing variations. The
spatial distribution of RR Lyr stars in the LMC is distinctly non-spherical and
it is elongated in the same direction as the LMC bar. The basic statistical
features of RR Lyr stars in the LMC are provided. The apparent V-band
magnitudes for RRab stars have the modal value at 19.36 mag, and for overtone
RR Lyr stars it is about 19.32 mag. The mean periods for RRab, RRc and RRe
stars are 0.576, 0.337 and 0.270 days, respectively.
