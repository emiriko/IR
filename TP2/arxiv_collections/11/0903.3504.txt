The measurement of electrons from semi-leptonic decay of heavy flavor in
$p+p$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}$=200 GeV has been carried out with the PHENIX
detector in the RHIC Year-2005 and Year-2006 run. This measurement provides a
good test of the perturbative QCD and the important base line to study the
medium created in Au+Au collisions at RHIC. The behavior of bottom in the
medium is expected to be largely different from that of charm. Therefore, the
determination of the fraction of bottom in the electrons from heavy flavor is
necessary to understand the behavior of heavy quarks in the matter.
  The first separate measurement of charm and bottom via partial reconstruction
of $D/\bar{D} \to e^{\pm} K^{\mp} X$ decay has been carried out in $p+p$
collisions. It is found that there is the considerable contribution from bottom
in the electrons from heavy flavor above 3 GeV/$c$. The total cross section of
bottom is also determined to $\sigma_{b\bar{b}}= 3.2 ^{+1.2}_{-1.1}(stat)
{}^{+1.4}_{-1.3}(sys) \mu b$. It is found that the perturbative QCD predictions
of charm and bottom production are consistent with the measurement of charm and
bottom at PHENIX. In addition, this result indicates the not only charm but
also bottom quarks lose a large fraction of their energy in the medium.
