We use early-time photometry and spectroscopy of 12 Type II plateau
supernovae (SNe IIP) to derive their distances using the expanding photosphere
method (EPM). We perform this study using two sets of Type II supernova (SN II)
atmosphere models, three filter subsets ($\{BV\}$, $\{BVI\}$, $\{VI\}$), and
two methods for the host-galaxy extinction, which leads to 12 Hubble diagrams.
We find that systematic differences in the atmosphere models lead to $\sim $50%
differences in the EPM distances and to a value of ${\rm H_0}$ between 52 and
101 ${\rm km s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}}$. Using the $\{VI\}$ filter subset we obtain the
lowest dispersion in the Hubble diagram, {${\rm \sigma_{\mu} = 0.32}$ mag}. We
also apply the EPM analysis to the well-observed SN IIP 1999em. With the
$\{VI\}$ filter subset we derive a distance ranging from 9.3 $\pm$ 0.5 Mpc to
13.9 $\pm$ 1.4 Mpc depending on the atmosphere model employed.
