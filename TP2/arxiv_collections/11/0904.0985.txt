Precision results on the leptonic, semileptonic, and hadronic decays of charm
mesons are reviewed. These results are important for timely progress in weak
flavor physics both in their own right and as checks of theoretical
calculations. Recent years have seen much progress on weak decays of charm, in
both theory and experiment, a trend we expect to continue.
