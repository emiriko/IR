In the context of the search for gasoline surrogates for kinetic modeling
purpose, this paper describes a new model for the low-temperature auto-ignition
of n-heptane/iso-octane/hexene/toluene blends for the different linear isomers
of hexene. The model simulates satisfactory experimental results obtained in a
rapid compression machine for temperatures ranging from 650 to 850 K in the
case of binary and ternary mixtures including iso octane, 1-hexene and toluene.
Predictive simulations have also been performed for the autoignition of n
heptane/iso octane/hexene/toluene quaternary mixtures: the predicted reactivity
is close to that of pure iso octane with a retarding effect when going from 1-
to 3-alkene.
