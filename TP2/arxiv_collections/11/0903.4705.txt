Exploiting the azimuthal angle dependence of the density matrices we
construct observables that directly measure the spin of a heavy unstable
particle. A novelty of the approach is that the analysis of the azimuthal angle
dependence in a frame other than the usual helicity frame offers an independent
cross-check on the extraction of the spin. Moreover, in some instances when the
transverse polarisation tensor of highest rank is vanishing, for an accidental
or dynamical reason, the standard azimuthal asymmetries vanish and would lead
to a measurement with a wrong spin assignment. In a frame such as the one we
construct, the correct spin assignment would however still be possible. The
method gives direct information about the spin of the particle under
consideration and the same event sample can be used to identify the spins of
each particle in a decay chain. A drawback of the method is that it is
instrumental only when the momenta of the test particle can be reconstructed.
However we hope that it might still be of use in situations with only partial
reconstruction. We also derive the conditions on the production and decay
mechanisms for the spins, and hence the polarisations, to be measured at a
collider experiment. As an example for the use of the method we consider the
simultaneous reconstruction, at the partonic level, of the spin of both the top
and the $W$ in top pair production in $e^+ e^-$ in the semi-leptonic channel.
