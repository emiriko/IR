Since gravitational wave spacetimes are time-varying vacuum solutions of
Einstein's field equations, there is no unambiguous means to define their
energy content. However, Weber and Wheeler had demonstrated that they do impart
energy to test particles. There have been various proposals to define the
energy content but they have not met with great success. Here we propose a
definition using "slightly broken" Noether symmetries. We check whether this
definition is physically acceptable. The procedure adopted is to appeal to
"approximate symmetries" as defined in Lie analysis and use them in the limit
of the exact symmetry holding. A problem is noted with the use of the proposal
for plane-fronted gravitational waves. To attain a better understanding of the
implications of this proposal we also use an artificially constructed
time-varying non-vacuum metric and evaluate its Weyl and stress-energy tensors
so as to obtain the gravitational and matter components separately and compare
them with the energy content obtained by our proposal. The procedure is also
used for cylindrical gravitational wave solutions. The usefulness of the
definition is demonstrated by the fact that it leads to a result on whether
gravitational waves suffer self-damping.
