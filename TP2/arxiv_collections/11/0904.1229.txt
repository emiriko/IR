Let c(G) be the smallest number of edges we have to test in order to
determine an unknown acyclic orientation of the given graph G in the worst
case. For example, if G is the complete graph on n vertices, then c(G) is the
smallest number of comparisons needed to sort n numbers.
  We prove that c(G)\le (1/4+o(1))n^2 for any graph G on n vertices, answering
in the affirmative a question of Aigner, Triesch, and Tuza [Discrete
Mathematics, 144 (1995) 3-10]. Also, we show that, for every e>0, it is NP-hard
to approximate the parameter c(G) within a multiplicative factor 74/73-e.
