The known Peres-Horodecki criterion and scaling criterion of separability are
considered on examples of three-mode and four-mode Gaussian states of
electromagnetic field. It is shown that the principal minors of the photon
quadrature dispersion matrix are sensitive to the change of scaling parameters.
An empirical observation has shown that the bigger the modulus of negative
principal minors, the more entangled the state.
