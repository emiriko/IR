We consider a synchronized, circular-orbit binary consisting of a polytrope
with index n and a point-mass object, and use a self-consistent field method to
construct the equilibrium structure of the polytrope under rotational and tidal
perturbations. Our self-consistent field method is distinct from others in that
the equilibrium orbital angular velocity is calculated automatically rather
than being prescribed, which is crucial for obtaining apsidal motion rates
accurately. We find that the centrifugal and tidal forces make perturbed stars
more centrally condensed and larger in size. For n=1.5 polytopes with fixed
entropy, the enhancement factor in stellar radii is about 23% and 4-8% for mu=1
and sim0.1-0.9, respectively, where mu is the fractional mass of the polytrope
relative to the total. The centrifugal force dominates the tidal force in
determining the equilibrium structure provided mu > 0.13-0.14 for n > 1.5. The
shape and size of rotationally- and tidally-perturbed polytropes are well
described by the corresponding Roche models as long as n > 2. The apsidal
motion rates calculated for circular-orbit binaries under the equilibrium tide
condition agree well with the predictions of the classical formula only when
the rotational and tidal perturbations are weak. When the perturbations are
strong as in critical configurations, the classical theory underestimates the
real apsidal motion rates by as much as 50% for n=1.5 polytropes, although the
discrepancy becomes smaller as n increases. For practical uses, we provide
fitting formulae for various quantities including the density concentration,
volume radius, and effective internal structure constant, as functions of mu
and the perturbation parameters.
