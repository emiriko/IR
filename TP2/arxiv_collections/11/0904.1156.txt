We investigate the interplay between the thermodynamic properties and
spin-dependent transport in a mesoscopic device based on a magnetic multilayer
(F/f/F), in which two strongly ferromagnetic layers (F) are exchange-coupled
through a weakly ferromagnetic spacer (f) with the Curie temperature in the
vicinity of room temperature. We show theoretically that the Joule heating
produced by the spin-dependent current allows a spin-thermo-electronic control
of the ferromagnetic-to-paramagnetic (f/N) transition in the spacer and,
thereby, of the relative orientation of the outer F-layers in the device
(spin-thermo-electric manipulation of nanomagnets). Supporting experimental
evidence of such thermally controlled switching from parallel to antiparallel
magnetization orientations in F/f(N)/F sandwiches is presented. Furthermore, we
show theoretically that local Joule heating due to a high concentration of
current in a magnetic point contact or a nanopillar can be used to reversibly
drive the weakly ferromagnetic spacer through its Curie point and thereby
exchange couple and decouple the two strongly ferromagnetic F-layers. For the
devices designed to have an antiparallel ground state above the Curie point of
the spacer, the associated spin-thermionic parallel-to-antiparallel switching
causes magneto-resistance oscillations whose frequency can be controlled by
proper biasing from essentially DC to GHz. We discuss in detail an experimental
realization of a device that can operate as a thermo-magneto-resistive switch
or oscillator.
