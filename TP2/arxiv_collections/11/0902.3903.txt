We present a new Group Field Theory for 4d quantum gravity. It incorporates
the constraints that give gravity from BF theory, and has quantum amplitudes
with the explicit form of simplicial path integrals for 1st order gravity. The
geometric interpretation of the variables and of the contributions to the
quantum amplitudes is manifest. This allows a direct link with other simplicial
gravity approaches, like quantum Regge calculus, in the form of the amplitudes
of the model, and dynamical triangulations, which we show to correspond to a
simple restriction of the same.
