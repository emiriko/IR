I report the results from a study of the transit times for CoRoT-1b, which
was one of the first planets discovered by CoRoT. Analysis of the pipeline
reduced CoRoT light curve yields a new determination of the physical and
orbital parameters of planet and star, along with 35 individual transit times
at a typical precision of 36 s. I estimate a planet-to-star radii ratio of
0.1433 +/- 0.0010, a ratio of the planet's orbital semimajor axis to the host
star radius of 4.751 +/- 0.045, and an orbital inclination for the planet of
83.88 +/- 0.29 deg. The observed transit times are consistent with CoRoT-1b
having a constant period and there is no evidence of an additional planet in
the system. I use the observed constancy of the transit times to set limits on
the mass of a hypothetical additional planet in a nearby, stable orbit. I
ascertain that the most stringent limits (4 M_earth at 3 sigma confidence) can
be placed on planets residing in a 1:2 mean motion resonance with the
transiting planet. In contrast, the data yield less stringent limits on planets
near a 1:3 mean motion resonance (5 M_jup at 3 sigma confidence) than in the
surrounding parameter space. In addition, I use a simulation to investigate
what sensitivity to additional planets could be obtained from the analysis of
data measured for a similar system during a CoRoT long run (100 sequential
transit times). I find that for such a scenario, planets with masses greater
than twice that of Mars (0.2 M_earth) in the 1:2 mean motion resonance would
cause high-significance transit time deviations. Therefore, such planets could
be detected or ruled out using CoRoT long run data. I conclude that CoRoT data
will indeed be very useful for searching for planets with the transit timing
method.
