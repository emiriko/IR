We present new VLBI observations of a complete sample of Brigthest Cluster
Galaxies (BCGs) in nearby Abell Clusters. These data show a possible difference
between BCGs in cool core clusters (two-sided parsec scale jets) and in non
cool core clusters (one-sided parsec scale jet). We suggest that this
difference could be due to the jet interaction with the surrounding medium.
More data are necessary to discuss whether parsec-scale properties of BCGs are
influenced by their peculiar morphology and position at the center of rich
galaxy clusters.
