We analyze antiferromagnetism and superconductivity in novel Fe-based
superconductors within the weak-coupling, itinerant model of electron and hole
pockets near (0,0) and (\pi,\pi) in the folded Brillouin zone. We discuss the
interaction Hamiltonian, the nesting, the RG flow of the couplings at energies
above and below the Fermi energy, and the interplay between SDW magnetism,
superconductivity and charge orbital order. We argue that SDW
antiferromagnetism wins at zero doping but looses to superconductivity upon
doping. We show that the most likely symmetry of the superconducting gap is
A_{1g} in the folded zone. This gap has no nodes on the Fermi surface but
changes sign between hole and electron pockets. We also argue that at weak
coupling, this pairing predominantly comes not from a spin fluctuation exchange
but from a direct pair hopping between hole and electron pockets.
