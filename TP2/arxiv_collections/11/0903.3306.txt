We derive the current response of noncentrosymmetric metal in normal and in
superconducting states to the electromagnetic field with finite frequency and
wave vector. The conductivity tensor is found contains the linear in wave
vector off diagonal part generating natural optical activity. The Kerr rotation
of polarization of light reflected from the metal surface is calculated. Its
value is expressed through the fine-structure constant and the ratio of light
frequency to the band splitting due to the spin-orbit interaction.
