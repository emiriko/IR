The initial growth of MnBi on MnAs terminated (GaMn)As is studied by means of
synchrotron based photoelectron spectroscopy. From analysis of surface core
level shifts we conclude that a continued epitaxial MnBi layer is formed, in
which the MnAs/MnBi interface occurs between As and Bi atomic planes. The well
defined 1x2 surface reconstruction of the MnAs surface in preserved for up to 2
ML of MnBi before clear surface degradation occurs.
