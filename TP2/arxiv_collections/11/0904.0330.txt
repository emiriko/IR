Until recently, it has been possible only for nearby galaxies to study the
scaling relations between central black hole and host galaxy in detail. Because
of the small number densities at low redshift, (luminous) AGN are
underrepresented in such detailed studies. The advent of adaptive optics (AO)
at large telescopes helps overcoming this hurdle, allowing to reach small
linear scales over a wide range in redshift. Finding AO-suitable targets, i.e.,
AGN having a nearby reference star, and carrying out an initial multiwavelength
classification is an excellent use case for the Virtual Observatory. We present
our Virtual-Observatory approach to select an AO-suitable catalog of
X-ray-emitting AGN at redshifts 0.1<z<1.
