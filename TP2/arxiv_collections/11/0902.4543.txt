Context. IC 1396N is a bright-rimmed cloud associated with an
intermediate-mass star-forming region, where a number of Herbig-Haro objects,
H2 jet-like features, CO molecular outflows, and millimeter compact sources
have been observed. Aims. To study in detail the complex structure of the IC
1396N core and the molecular outflows detected in the region and to reveal the
presence of additional YSOs inside this globule. Methods. We carried out a deep
survey of the IC 1396N region in the J, H, K' broadband filters and deep
high-angular resolution observations in the H2 narrowband filter with NICS at
the TNG telescope. The completeness limits in the 2MASS standard are Ks~17.5,
H~18.5 and J~19.5. Results. A total of 736 sources have been detected in all
three bands within the area where the JHK' images overlap. There are 128
sources detected only in HK', 67 detected only in K', and 79 detected only in
H. We found only few objects exhibiting a Near-Infrared excess and no clear
signs of clustering of sources towards the southern rim. In case of triggered
star formation in the southern rim of the globule, this could be very recent,
because it is not evidenced through Near-Infrared imaging alone. The H2
emission is complex and knotty and shows a large number of molecular hydrogen
features spread over the region, testifying a recent star-formation activity
throughout the whole globule. This emission is resolved into several chains or
groups of knots that sometimes show a jet-like morphology. The shocked cloudlet
model scenario previously proposed to explain the V-shaped morphology of the CO
molecular outflow powered by the intermediate-mass YSO BIMA 2 seems to be
confirmed by the presence of H2 emission at the position of the deflecting
western clump. New possible flows have been discovered in the globule,
