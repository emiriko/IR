We study the conductance of phase-coherent disordered quantum wires focusing
on the case in which the number of conducting channels is imbalanced between
two propagating directions. If the number of channels in one direction is by
one greater than that in the opposite direction, one perfectly conducting
channel without backscattering is stabilized regardless of wire length.
Consequently, the dimensionless conductance does not vanish but converges to
unity in the long-wire limit, indicating the absence of Anderson localization.
To observe the influence of a perfectly conducting channel, we numerically
obtain the distribution of conductance in both cases with and without a
perfectly conducting channel. We show that the characteristic form of the
distribution is notably modified in the presence of a perfectly conducting
channel.
