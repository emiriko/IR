It is proposed that convection driven dynamos operating in planetary cores
could be oscillatory even when the oscillations are not directly noticeable
from the outside. Examples of dynamo simulations are pointed out that exhibit
oscillations in the structure of the azimuthally averaged toroidal magnetic
flux while the mean poloidal field shows only variations in its amplitude. In
the case of the geomagnetic field, global excursions may be associated with
these oscillations. Long period dynamo simulations indicate that the
oscillations may cause reversals once in a while. No special attempt has been
made to use most realistic parameter values. Nevertheless some similarities
between the simulations and the paleomagnetic record can be pointed out.
