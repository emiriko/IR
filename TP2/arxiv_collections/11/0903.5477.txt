We present the results of a spectroscopic multisite campaign for the beta
Cephei star 12 (DD) Lacertae. Our study is based on more than thousand
high-resolution high S/N spectra gathered with 8 different telescopes in a time
span of 11 months. In addition we make use of numerous archival spectroscopic
measurements. We confirm 10 independent frequencies recently discovered from
photometry, as well as harmonics and combination frequencies. In particular,
the SPB-like g-mode with frequency 0.3428 1/d reported before is detected in
our spectroscopy. We identify the four main modes as (l1,m1) = (1, 1), (l2,m2)
= (0, 0), (l3,m3) = (1, 0) and (l4,m4) = (2, 1) for f1 = 5.178964 1/d, f2 =
5.334224 1/d, f3 = 5.066316 1/d and f4 = 5.490133 1/d, respectively. Our
seismic modelling shows that f2 is likely the radial first overtone and that
the core overshooting parameter alpha_ov is lower than 0.4 local pressure scale
heights.
