Investigations of the magnetic properties of graphenes prepared by different
methods reveal that dominant ferromagnetic interactions coexist along with
antiferromagnetic interactions in all the samples. Thus, all the graphene
samples exhibit room-temperature magnetic hysteresis. The magnetic properties
depend on the number of layers and the sample area, small values of both
favoring larger magnetization. Molecular charge-transfer affects the magnetic
properties of graphene, interaction with a donor molecule such as
tetrathiafulvalene having greater effect than an electron-withdrawing molecule
such as tetracyanoethylene
