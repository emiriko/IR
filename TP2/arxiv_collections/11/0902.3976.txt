The Schroedinger equation for position-dependent mass singular oscillators is
solved by means of the factorization method and point transformations. These
systems share their spectrum with the conventional singular oscillator. Ladder
operators are constructed to close the su(1,1) Lie algebra and the involved
point transformations are shown to preserve the structure of the
Barut-Girardello and Perelomov coherent states.
