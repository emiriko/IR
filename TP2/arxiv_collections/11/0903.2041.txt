We present the first measurement of photoproduction of J/psi and of
two-photon production of high-mass e+e- pairs in electromagnetic (or
ultra-peripheral) nucleus-nucleus interactions, using Au+Au data at sqrt(s_NN)
= 200 GeV. The events are tagged with forward neutrons emitted following
Coulomb excitation of one or both Au^{star} nuclei. The event sample consists
of 28 events with m_{e+e-} > 2 GeV/c^2 with zero like-sign background. The
measured cross sections at midrapidity of d\sigma / dy (J/psi + Xn, y=0) = 76
+/- 33 (stat) +/- 11 (syst) micro b and d^2\sigma/dm dy (e^+e^- + Xn, y=0) = 86
+/- 23 (stat) +/- 16 (syst) micro b/(GeV/c^2) for m_{e+e-} \in [2.0,2.8]
GeV/c^2 are consistent with various theoretical predictions.
