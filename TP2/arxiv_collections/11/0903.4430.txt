We report single crystal growth and a study of superconducting properties in
Fe_{1+y}Te_{1-x}S_{x}. We demonstrate the smallest upper critical field
anisotropy, gamma=H_{c2}^{//c}/H_{c2}^{//a}, among all iron based
superconductors, the value of gamma reaches 1.05 at T=0.65T_{C} for
Fe_{1.09}Te_{0.89}S_{0.11}, while still maintaining large values of upper
critical field.
