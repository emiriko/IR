We discuss the central role played by X-ray studies to reconstruct the past
history of formation and evolution of supermassive Black Holes (BHs), and the
role they played in shaping the properties of their host galaxies. We shortly
review the progress in this field contributed by the current X-ray and
multiwavelength surveys. Then, we focus on the outstanding scientific questions
that have been opened by observations carried out in the last years and that
represent the legacy of Chandra and XMM, as for X-ray observations, and the
legacy of the SDSS, as for wide area surveys: 1) When and how did the first
supermassive black holes form? 2) How does cosmic environment regulate nuclear
activity (and star formation) across cosmic time? 3) What is the history of
nuclear activity in a galaxy lifetime? We show that the most efficient
observational strategy to address these questions is to carry out a large-area
X-ray survey, reaching a sensitivity comparable to that of deep Chandra and XMM
pointings, but extending over several thousands of square degrees. Such a
survey can only be carried out with a Wide-Field X-ray Telescope (WFXT) with a
high survey speed, due to the combination of large field of view and large
effective area, i.e., grasp, and sharp PSF. We emphasize the important
synergies that WFXT will have with a number of future groundbased and space
telescopes, covering from the radio to the X-ray bands and discuss the immense
legacy value that such a mission will have for extragalactic astronomy at
large.
