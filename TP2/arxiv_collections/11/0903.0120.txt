We study dynamical behaviors of the dark energy models interacting with dark
matter and unparticle in the standard flat FRW cosmology. We considered four
different interacting models and examined the stability of the critical points.
We find that there exist late-time scaling attractors corresponding to an
accelerating Universe and the alleviation of the coincidence problem depends on
the choice of parameters in the models.
