The STAR collaboration at RHIC presents measurements of \Jpsi$\to{e^+e^-}$ at
mid-rapidity and high transverse momentum ($p_T>5$ GeV/$c$) in \pp and central
\cucu collisions at \sNN = 200 GeV. The inclusive \Jpsi production cross
section for \cucu collisions is found to be consistent at high $p_T$ with the
binary collision-scaled cross section for \pp collisions, in contrast to
previous measurements at lower $p_T$, where a suppression of \Jpsi production
is observed relative to the expectation from binary scaling. Azimuthal
correlations of $J/\psi$ with charged hadrons in \pp collisions provide an
estimate of the contribution of $B$-meson decays to \Jpsi production of $13%
\pm 5%$.
