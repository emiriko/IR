There has been considerable effort expended towards understanding high
temperature superconductors (HTSC), and more specifically the cuprate phase
diagram as a function of doping level. Yet, the only agreement seems to be that
HTSC is an example of a strongly correlated material where Coulomb repulsion
plays a major role. This manuscript proposes a model based on a Feshbach
resonance pairing mechanism and competing orders. An initial BCS-type
superconductivity at high doping is suppressed in the two particle channel by a
localized preformed pair (PP) [1] (circular density wave) creating a quantum
critical point (QCP). As doping continues to diminish, the PP then participates
in a Feshbach resonance complex that creates a new electron (hole) pair that
delocalizes and constitutes HTSC and the characteristic dome [2]. The resonant
nature of the new pair contributes to its short coherence length. The model we
propose also suggests an explanation (and necessity) for an experimentally
observed correlated lattice that could restrict energy dissipation to enable
the resonant Cooper pair to move over several correlation lengths, or
essentially free. The PP density wave is responsible for the pseudogap as it
appears as a localized superconductor since its density of states and
quasiparticle spectrum are similar to those of a superconductor
(Peierls-Frolich theory), but with no phase coherence between the PP.
