This study presents a new direct solar floor heating technique with double
heating network wich allows simultaneous use of solar and supply energy. Its
main purpose is to store and to diffuse the whole available solar energy while
regulating supply energy by physical means without using computer controlled
technology. This solar system has been tested in real user conditions inside a
bioclimatic house to study the interaction of non-inertial and passive walls on
the solar productivity. Daily, monthly and annual energy balances were drawn up
over three years and completed by real-time measurements of several physical
on-site parameters. As a result the expected properties of this technique were
improved. The use of per-hour solar productivity, saved primary energy and
corrected solar covering ratio is recommended to analyze the performances of
this plant and to allow more refined comparisons with other solar systems
