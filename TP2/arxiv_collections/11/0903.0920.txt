We study the tunability of the spin-orbit interaction in a two-dimensional
electron gas with a front and a back gate electrode by monitoring the spin
precession frequency of drifting electrons using time-resolved Kerr rotation.
The Rashba spin splitting can be tuned by the gate biases, while we find a
small Dresselhaus splitting that depends only weakly on the gating. We
determine the absolute values and signs of the two components and show that for
zero Rashba spin splitting the anisotropy of the spin-dephasing rate vanishes.
