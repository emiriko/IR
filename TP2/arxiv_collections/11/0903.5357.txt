We rederive the luminosity function for the sample of DA white dwarfs from
the Kiso Schmidt ultraviolet excess survey (KUV stars) using the spectroscopic
method where the atmospheric parameters (Teff and log g) and absolute visual
magnitudes for each star are obtained from detailed model atmosphere fits to
optical spectroscopic data. We compare the result of our determination with
that obtained by Darling (1994) based on empirical photometric calibrations.
Our luminosity function is also compared with that derived spectroscopically
from the PG survey. Misclassified objects are also briefly discussed.
