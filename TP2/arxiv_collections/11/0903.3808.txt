We solve a finite range two-channel model for three resonant identical
bosons. The model provides a minimal description of the various magnetic
Feshbach resonances in single species ultra-cold bosonic systems, including
off-resonant scattering. We obtain important insights into the interpretation
of seminal experiments: the three-body recombination rate measured in Sodium
and the Efimov resonances observed in Caesium. This approach quantifies non
universal effects appearing for a finite magnetic field detuning.
