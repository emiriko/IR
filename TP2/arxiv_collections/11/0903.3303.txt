We have measured the magnetic field and temperature dependence of the
resistivity of several micrometers long and heterogeneously thick graphite
sample. The magnetoresistance results for fields applied nearly parallel to the
graphene planes show both a granular superconducting behavior as well as the
existence of magnetic order in the sample.
