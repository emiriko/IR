We propose a kind of reaction-diffusion equations for cell differentiation,
which exhibits the Turing instability. If the diffusivity of some variables is
set to be infinity, we get coupled competitive reaction-diffusion equations
with a global feedback term. The size ratio of each cell type is controlled by
a system parameter in the model. Finally, we extend the model to a cascade
model of cell differentiation. A hierarchical spatial structure appears as a
result of the cell differentiation. The size ratio of each cell type is also
controlled by the system parameter.
