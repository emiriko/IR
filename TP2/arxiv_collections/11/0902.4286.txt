We investigate the connection between the Breit and infinite momentum frames
and show that when the nucleon matrix element of the time component of the
electromagnetic current, which yields G_E in the Breit frame, is boosted to the
infinite momentum (or light-front) frame, the quantity F_1 is obtained.
