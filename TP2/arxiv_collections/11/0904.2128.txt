We present results from modeling of quasi-simultaneous broad band (radio
through X-ray) observations of the galactic stellar black hole (BH) transient
X-ray binary (XRB) systems XTE J1118+480 and GX 339-4 using an irradiated disc
+ compact jet model. In addition to quantifying the physical properties of the
jet, we have developed a new irradiated disc model which also constrains the
geometry and temperature of the outer accretion disc by assuming a disc heated
by viscous energy release and X-ray irradiation from the inner regions. For the
source XTE J1118+480, which has better spectral coverage of the two in optical
and near-IR (OIR) wavelengths, we show that the entire broad band continuum can
be well described by an outflow-dominated model + an irradiated disc. The
best-fit radius of the outer edge of the disc is consistent with the Roche lobe
geometry of the system, and the temperature of the outer edge of the accretion
disc is similar to those found for other XRBs. Irradiation of the disc by the
jet is found to be negligible for this source. For GX 339-4, the entire
continuum is well described by the jet-dominated model only, with no disc
component required. For the two XRBs, which have very different physical and
orbital parameters and were in different accretion states during the
observations, the sizes of the jet base are similar and both seem to prefer a
high fraction of non-thermal electrons in the acceleration/shock region and a
magnetically dominated plasma in the jet. These results, along with recent
similar results from modeling other galactic XRBs and AGNs, may suggest an
inherent unity in diversity in the geometric and radiative properties of
compact jets from accreting black holes.
