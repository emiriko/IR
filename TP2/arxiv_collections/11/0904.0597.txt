In the minimal supersymmetric standard model the R-parity violating
interactions can trigger various exotic three-body decays for the top quark,
which may be accessible at the LHC. In this work we examine the R-violating
decays t-> c X_1 X_2, which include the tree-level processes t-> c l^-_i l^+_j
(l_i=e, mu, tau) and t->c d_i \bar{d}_j (d_i=d, s, b), as well as the loop
induced processes t->c g X (X=g, \gamma, Z, h). We find that the hereto weakly
constrained R-violating couplings can render the decay branching ratios quite
sizable, some of which already reach the sensitivity of the Tevatron collider
and can be expored at the LHC with better sensitivity.
