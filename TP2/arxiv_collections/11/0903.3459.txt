The multiconfiguration Dirac-Hartree-Fock theory (MCDHF) has been employed to
calculate the electric dipole moment of the 7s6d 3D2 state of radium induced by
the nuclear Schiff moment. The results are dominated by valence and
core-valence electron correlation effects. We show that the correlation effects
can be evaluated in a converged series of multiconfiguration expansions.
