Let X be a generalised symmetrised Dirichlet random vector in R^k, and let
u_n be thresholds such that P{X> u_n} tends to 0 as n goes infinity. In this
paper we derive an exact asymptotic expansion of P{X> u_n} assuming that the
associated random radius of X has distribution function in the Gumbel
max-domain of attraction
