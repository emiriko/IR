Electric and magnetic charges of a certain class of operators in N=2 large N
quiver Chern-Simons theories are investigated. We consider only non-chiral
theories, in which every bi-fundamental field appears with its conjugate
representation. By interpreting operators in a Chern-Simons theory as wrapped
M-branes in the dual geometry AdS_4 x X_7, we partly determine the homologies
of X_7.
