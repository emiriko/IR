The treatment of Internet traffic is increasingly affected by national
policies that require the ISPs in a country to adopt common protocols or
practices. Examples include government enforced censorship, wiretapping, and
protocol deployment mandates for IPv6 and DNSSEC. If an entire nation's worth
of ISPs apply common policies to Internet traffic, the global implications
could be significant. For instance, how many countries rely on China or Great
Britain (known traffic censors) to transit their traffic? These kinds of
questions are surprisingly difficult to answer, as they require combining
information collected at the prefix, Autonomous System, and country level, and
grappling with incomplete knowledge about the AS-level topology and routing
policies. In this paper we develop the first framework for country-level
routing analysis, which allows us to answer questions about the influence of
each country on the flow of international traffic. Our results show that some
countries known for their national policies, such as Iran and China, have
relatively little effect on interdomain routing, while three countries (the
United States, Great Britain, and Germany) are central to international
reachability, and their policies thus have huge potential impact.
