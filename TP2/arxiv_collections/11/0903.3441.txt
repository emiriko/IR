We consider the notion of canonical attacks, which are the cryptographic
analog of the canonical forms of a one-mode Gaussian channel. Using this
notion, we explore the connections between the degradability properties of the
channel and its security for quantum key distribution. Finally, we also show
some relations between canonical attacks and optimal Gaussian cloners.
