In this paper we investigate the evolution of the viscous dark energy (DE)
interacting with the dark matter (DM) in the Einstein cosmology model. Using
the linearizing theory of the dynamical system, we find, in our model, there
exists a stable late time scaling solution which corresponds to the
accelerating universe, and we also find the unstable solution under some
appropriate parameters. In order to alleviate the coincidence problem, some
authors considered the effect of quantum correction due to the conform anomaly
and the interacting dark energy model. But if we take into account the bulk
viscosity of the cosmic fluid, the coincidence problem will be softened just
like the interacting dark energy cosmology model. That's to say, both the
non-perfect fluid model and the interacting models of the dark energy can
alleviate or soften the singularity of the universe.
