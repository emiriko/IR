Generalized Bose-Einstein (BE) and Fermi-Dirac (FD) distributions in
nonextensive quantum statistics have been discussed by the maximum-entropy
method (MEM) with the optimum Lagrange multiplier based on the exact integral
representation [Rajagopal, Mendes, and Lenzi, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 80}, 3907
(1998)]. It has been shown that the $(q-1)$ expansion in the exact approach
agrees with the result obtained by the asymptotic approach valid for $O(q-1)$.
Model calculations have been made with a uniform density of states for
electrons and with the Debye model for phonons. Based on the result of the
exact approach, we have proposed the {\it interpolation approximation} to the
generalized distributions, which yields results in agreement with the exact
approach within $O(q-1)$ and in high- and low-temperature limits. By using the
four methods of the exact, interpolation, factorization and superstatistical
approaches, we have calculated coefficients in the generalized Sommerfeld
expansion, and electronic and phonon specific heats at low temperatures. A
comparison among the four methods has shown that the interpolation
approximation is potentially useful in the nonextensive quantum statistics.
Supplementary discussions have been made on the $(q-1)$ expansion of the
generalized distributions based on the exact approach with the use of the
un-normalized MEM, whose results also agree with those of the asymptotic
approach.
