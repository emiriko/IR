For evaluation of the undrained thermo-poro-elastic properties of saturated
porous materials in conventional triaxial cells, it is important to take into
account the effect of the dead volume of the drainage system. The
compressibility and the thermal expansion of the drainage system along with the
dead volume of the fluid filling this system, influence the measured pore
pressure and volumetric strain during an undrained thermal or mechanical
loading in a triaxial cell. The correction methods previously presented by
Wissa (1969), Bishop (1976) and Ghabezloo and Sulem (2009) only permit to
correct the measured pore pressures during an undrained isotropic compression
test or an undrained heating test. An extension of these methods is presented
in this paper to correct also the measured volumetric strain and consequently
the measured undrained bulk compressibility and undrained thermal expansion
coefficients during these tests. Two examples of application of the proposed
correction method are presented on the results of an undrained isotropic
compression test and an undrained heating test performed on a fluid-saturated
granular rock. A parametric study has demonstrated that the porosity and the
drained compressibility of the tested material, and the ratio of the volume of
the drainage system to the one of the tested sample are the key parameters
which influence the most the error induced on the measurements by the drainage
system.
