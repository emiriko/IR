Using an innovative first-principles band theory enabling the exploration of
Mott-insulating magnetic cuprates, we study the Fermi surface of underdoped
Y$_{1-x}$Ca$_x$Ba$_2$Cu$_3$O$_6$ in a selection of magnetically ordered and
polaronic states. All phases exhibit qualitatively similar, hole-like
nodal-point small pockets. Their properties (area, masses, mass sign) only
partially match those extracted from recent quantum-oscillation experiments. Ab
initio calculations, therefore, do not straightforwardly support a magnetic
origin of quantum oscillations.
