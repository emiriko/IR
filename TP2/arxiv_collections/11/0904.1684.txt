The onset of convection in the form of inertial waves in a rotating fluid
sphere is studied through a perturbation analysis in an extension of earlier
work by Zhang (1994). Explicit expressions for the dependence of the Rayleigh
number on the azimuthal wavenumber are derived and new results for the case of
a nearly thermally insulating boundary are obtained.
