Continuous-variable cluster states offer a potentially promising method of
implementing a quantum computer. This paper extends and further refines
theoretical foundations and protocols for experimental implementation. We give
a cluster-state implementation of the cubic phase gate through photon
detection, which, together with homodyne detection, facilitates universal
quantum computation. In addition, we characterize the offline squeezed
resources required to generate an arbitrary graph state through passive linear
optics. Most significantly, we prove that there are universal states for which
the offline squeezing per mode does not increase with the size of the cluster.
Simple representations of continuous-variable graph states are introduced to
analyze graph state transformations under measurement and the existence of
universal continuous-variable resource states.
