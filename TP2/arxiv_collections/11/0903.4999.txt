Small-field inflation typically requires rather special initial conditions to
commence. It is proposed that in models where the inflaton is an axionlike
field, with a periodic contribution to the potential, there is a possibility of
significantly enhancing the chances of inflation without any fine-tuning of
initial conditions and with no additional fine-tuning of the dynamics beyond
what is needed for the potential to support inflation in the first place.
