Evaluating the Wigner function of quantum states in the entangled state
representation is introduced, based on which we present a new approach for
deriving time evolution formula of Wigner function in laser process.
Application of this fomula to calculating time evolution of photon number is
also presented, as an example, the case when the initial state is photon-added
coherent state is discussed.
