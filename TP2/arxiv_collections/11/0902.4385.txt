We consider a one-dimensional mesoscopic quantum ring filled with spinless
electrons and threaded by a magnetic flux, which carries a persistent current
at zero temperature. The interplay of Coulomb interactions and a single on-site
impurity yields a non-trivial dependence of the persistent current on the size
of the ring. We determine numerically the asymptotic power law for systems up
to 32000 sites for various impurity strengths and compare with predictions from
Bethe Ansatz solutions combined with Bosonization. The numerical results are
obtained using an improved functional renormalization group (fRG) method. We
apply the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) and exact diagonalization
methods to benchmark the fRG calculations. We use DMRG to study the persistent
current at low electron concentrations in order to extend the validity of our
results to quasi-continuous systems. We briefly comment on the quality of
calculated fRG ground state energies by comparison with exact DMRG data.
