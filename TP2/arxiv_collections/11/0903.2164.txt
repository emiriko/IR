We investigate gauge-Higgs unification models in eight-dimensional spacetime
where extra-dimensional space has the structure of a four-dimensional compact
coset space. The combinations of the coset space and the gauge group in the
eight-dimensional spacetime of such models are listed. After the dimensional
reduction of the coset space, we identified $\mathrm{SO}(10)$, $\mathrm{SO}(10)
\times \mathrm{U}(1)$ and $\mathrm{SO}(10) \times \mathrm{U}(1) \times
\mathrm{U}(1)$ as the possible gauge groups in the four-dimensional theory that
can accomodate the Standard Model and thus is phenomenologically promising.
Representations for fermions and scalars for these gauge groups are tabulated.
