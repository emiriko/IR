In systems such as the early universe and supernova neutrinos comprise a
large fraction of the total particle number density thus one needs to consider
neutrino self-refraction. Coherent neutrino-neutrino scattering has been found
to play a role in the flavour evolution of the system. Traditionally this
problem has been analysed by assuming that the wavefunction of the system can
be factorised into one-body states. However in 1992 Pantaleone showed that a
neutrino ensemble is in general a many-body problem due to the off-diagonal
contribution to the neutrino refractive index. This topic was unexamined until
recently. It has been suggested by Bell, Rawlinson and Sawyer that quantum
entanglement could play an essential role in the flavour evolution of the dense
neutrino system.
  In this thesis we examine the validity of the one-body approximation by
constructing a many-body neutrino model. The neutrino system is modelled by a
system of interacting spins following earlier work of Friedland and Lunardini.
We extend this work by generalising the model to initial states with asymmetric
flavour composition. We find an exact analytical solution to the system. The
investigation has revealed an array of interesting physics including
semi-classical behaviour, quantum equilibration and a transition from
semi-classical to purely quantum regimes. Further, this study has found no
evidence for the violation of the one-body description of a dense neutrino
ensemble. We also note that our analysis is valid for any two state system with
equal strength interactions.
