Estimation of the signal amplitudes and counting rates for coherent
scattering of reactor antineutrino off atomic nuclei in two-phase xenon and
argon detectors has been done. A conceptual design of detector based on the
existing technologies and experience has been proposed. It is shown that a
condensed xenon/argon two-phase detector possesses the necessary sensitivity
for the use in experiment on detection of coherent scattering of the reactor
antineutrino off nuclei. It is shown that a two-phase detector with both
optical readout by PMTs and ionisation readout by GEM/THGEM possesses superior
capability for identification of the events of coherent antineutrino
scattering.
