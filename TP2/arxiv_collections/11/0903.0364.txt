We obtain expected number of arrivals, probability of arrival, absorption
probabilities and expected time before absorption for a modified discrete
random walk on the (sub)set of integers. In a [pqrs] random walk the particle
can move one step forward or backward, stay for a moment in the same state or
it can be absorbed immediately in the current state. M[pqrs] is a modified
version, where probabilities on both sides of a multiple function barrier M are
of different [pqrs] type.
