Given two probability measures $\mu$ and $\nu$ we consider a mass
transportation mapping $T$ satisfying 1) $T$ sends $\mu$ to $\nu$, 2) $T$ has
the form $T = \phi \frac{\nabla \phi}{|\nabla \phi|}$, where $\phi$ is a
function with convex sublevel sets.
  We prove a change of variables formula for $T$. We also establish Sobolev
estimates for $\phi$, and a new form of the parabolic maximum principle.
  In addition, we discuss relations to the Monge-Kantorovich problem, curvature
flows theory, and parabolic nonlinear PDE's.
