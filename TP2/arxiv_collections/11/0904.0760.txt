The problem concerning the form of the electrostatic field potential of the
infinite charged metallic plane contacting with the metallic sphere is solved.
The distributions of the surface charge densities both on the plane and the
sphere and also the force acting on the sphere that causing to tear away from
the plane are found. The expressions found for the charge of the sphere and the
force of tear from the plane permits estimate the frequency of the shuttle
motion of the nanoparticles and the charge transfer between metallic electrodes
and also use them for the measurement of their sizes and to make use of their
separation in progress.
