We have studied the effect of non-magnetic Zn impurities in the coupled
spin-ladder Bi(Cu1xZnx)2PO6 using 31P NMR, muSR and Quantum Monte Carlo
simulations. Our results show that the impurities induce in their vicinity
antiferromagnetic polarizations, extending over a few unit cells. At low
temperature, these extended moments freeze in a process which is found
universal among various other spin-gapped compounds: isolated ladders, Haldane
or Spin-Peierls chains. This allows us to propose a simple common framework to
explain the generic low-temperature impurity induced freezings observed in low
dimensional spin-gapped materials.
