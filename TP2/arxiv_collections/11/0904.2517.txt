We present developing of method of the numerical analysis of polarization in
the Gauss--Legendre Sky Pixelization (GLESP) scheme for the CMB maps. This
incorporation of the polarization transforms in the pixelization scheme GLESP
completes the creation of our new method for the numerical analysis of CMB
maps. The comparison of GLESP and HEALPix calculations is done.
