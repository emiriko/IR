The Lagrangian view of passive scalar turbulence has recently produced
interesting results and interpretations. Innovations in theory, experiments,
simulations and data analysis of Lagrangian turbulence are reviewed here in
brief. Part of the review is closely related to the so-called Kraichnan model
for the advection of the passive scalar in synthetic turbulence. Possible
implications for a better understanding of the passive scalar mixing in
Navier-Stokes turbulence are also discussed.
