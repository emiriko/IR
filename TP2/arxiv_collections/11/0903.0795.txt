We present a numerical study of the zero-temperature response of the Gaussian
random-field Ising model (RFIM) to a slowly varying external field, allowing
the system to be trapped in microscopic configurations that are not fully
metastable. This modification of the standard single-spin-flip dynamics results
in an increase of dissipation (hysteresis) somewhat similar to that observed
with a finite driving rate. We then study the distribution of avalanches along
the hysteresis loop and perform a finite-size scaling analysis that shows good
evidence that the critical exponents associated to the disorder-induced phase
transition are not modified.
