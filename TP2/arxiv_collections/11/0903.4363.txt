We introduce a discrete analogue of the scattering theory for the
Zakharov-Shabat (ZS) system, and use it to continue the work of C.L. Epstein by
deriving an efficient, recursive algorithm for generating RF-pulses for nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR). In the process, we present a straightforward
derivation of the standard Gel'fand-Levitan-Marchenko (Marchenko) equations,
and we derive similar equations which apply to the discrete framework. In
addition, we prove that the potentials obtained by solving the Marchenko
equations produce the correct scattering data. We explain how the generally
accepted Shinnar-Le Roux (SLR) technique fits into the more general framework
of discrete inverse scattering, and we show, using examples, how inverse
scattering theory can be used to produce pulses which are, in some ways,
superior to standard SLR pulses.
