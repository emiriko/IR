We present authorized quantum computation, where only a user with a
non-cloneable quantum authorization key can perform a unitary operation created
by an authenticated programmer. The security of our authorized quantum
computation is based on the quantum computational complexity problem of forging
the keys from an obfuscated quantum gate sequence. Under the assumption of the
existence of a \textit{sufficiently-random gate shuffling algorithm}, the
problem is shown to be in the NQP (Non-deterministic Quantum Polynomial)-hard
class by reducing it to a NQP-Complete problem, the exact non-identity check
problem. Therefore, our authorized quantum computation can be computationally
secure against attacks using quantum computers.
