We calculate the lowest order charm and beauty parton distribution functions
in and fragmentation functions into D and B mesons using the operator
definitions of factorized perturbative QCD. In the vacuum, we find the leading
corrections that arise from the structure of the final-state hadrons.
Quark-antiquark potentials extracted from the lattice are employed to
demonstrate the existence of open heavy flavor bound-state solutions in the QGP
in the vicinity of the critical temperature. We provide first results for the
in-medium modification of the heavy quark distribution and decay probabilities
in a co-moving plasma. In an improved perturbative QCD description of heavy
flavor dynamics in the thermal medium, we combine D and B meson formation and
dissociation with parton-level charm and beauty quark quenching to obtain
predictions for the heavy meson and non-photonic electron suppression in Cu+Cu
and Pb+Pb collisions at RHIC and the LHC, respectively.
