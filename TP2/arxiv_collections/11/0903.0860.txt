We present here HST NICMOS F110W and F160W observations of Haumea, and its
two satellites Hi'iaka and Namaka. From the measured (F110W-F160W) colours of
-1.209 +/-0.004, -1.48 +/- 0.06, and -1.4 +/- 0.2 mag for each object,
respectively, we infer that the 1.6 imcron water-ice absorption feature depths
on Hi'iaka and Namaka are at least as deep as that of Haumea. The light-curve
of Haumea is detected in both filters, and we find that the infrared colour is
bluer by approximately 2-3% at the phase of the red spot. These observations
suggest that the satellites of Haumea were formed from the collision that
produced the Haumea collisional family.
