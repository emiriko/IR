The discovery of distant sources of very high energy (VHE) gamma-rays with
hard energy spectra enabled to derive strong upper limits on the density of the
extragalactic background light (EBL). These limits are close to the lower
limits derived from deep source counts. A recent re-determination of the EBL
contribution from resolved sources at 3.6 micrometer finds a higher EBL
density, which is claimed to be in conflict with the assumptions utilized to
derive the EBL upper limits from VHE spectra. Here, it is shown that is
possible to recover the canonical Gamma~1.5 intrinsic spectra for such a higher
EBL density.
