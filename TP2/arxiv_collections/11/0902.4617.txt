Tunneling field-effect transistors (FETs) have been intensely explored
recently due to its potential to address power concerns in nanoelectronics. The
recently discovered graphene nanoribbon (GNR) is ideal for tunneling FETs due
to its symmetric bandstructure, light effective mass, and monolayer-thin body.
In this work, we examine the device physics of p-i-n GNR tunneling FETs using
atomistic quantum transport simulations. The important role of the edge bond
relaxation in the device characteristics is identified. The device, however,
has ambipolar I-V characteristics, which are not preferred for digital
electronics applications. We suggest that using either an asymmetric
source-drain doping or a properly designed gate underlap can effectively
suppress the ambipolar I-V. A subthreshold slope of 14mV/dec and a
significantly improved on-off ratio can be obtained by the p-i-n GNR tunneling
FETs.
