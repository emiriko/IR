We report an analysis of tau- decaying into omega.pi-.nu_tau with omega ->
pi+pi-pi0 using a data sample containing nearly 320 million tau pairs collected
with the BABAR detector at the PEP-II B-Factory. We find no evidence for
second-class currents and we set an upper limit of 0.69% at 90% confidence
level for the fraction of second-class currents in this decay mode.
