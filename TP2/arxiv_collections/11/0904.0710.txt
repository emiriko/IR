We investigate the propagation of the spatial soliton in cylindrical strongly
nonlocal media by a novel method of image beam of light. The effect of the
boundary on the soliton acting as the dynamic force for the soliton steering is
equivalent to the force between the soliton beam and the image beam. The
trajectory of the soliton is analytically studied which is in good agreement
with the experimental results.
