We discuss the locality problem in relativistic and nonrelativistic quantum
theory. We show that there exists a formulation of quantum theory that, on one
hand, preserves the mathematical apparatus of the standard quantum mechanics
and, on the other hand, ensures the satisfaction of the locality condition for
each individual event including the measurement procedure. As an example, we
consider the scattering from two slits.
