We present results of Niobium based SQUID magnetometers for which the
weak-links are engineered by the local oxidation of thin films using an Atomic
Force Microscope (AFM). Firstly, we show that this technique allows the
creation of variable thickness bridges with 10 nm lateral resolution. Precise
control of the weak-link milling is offered by the possibility to realtime
monitor weak-link conductance. Such a process is shown to enhance the magnetic
field modulation hence the sensitivity of the magnetometer. Secondly, AFM
lithography is used to provide a precise alignment of NanoSQUID weak-links with
respect to a ferromagnetic iron dot. The magnetization switching of the
near-field coupled particle is studied as a junction of the applied magnetic
field direction.
