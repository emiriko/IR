Gamma Doradus stars are excellent targets for asteroseismology since the
gravity modes present in these stars probe the deep stellar interiors. Mode
identification will improve the knowledge of these stars considerably. A
selected group of Gamma Doradus stars and some candidates were observed with
the Mercator telescope to find and/or confirm the periodicities in the light
variations and to derive reliable amplitude ratios in different pass bands. A
frequency analysis was performed on all new data obtained in the Geneva
photometric system. In order to have more reliable and accurate frequencies,
the new data were combined with similar data from the literature and with
Hipparcos observations. A set of frequencies that minimized the the residuals
in a harmonic fit was searched for while allowing means and amplitudes to vary
from one observation set to another. Frequencies and amplitudes in the
photometric passbands of the Geneva system are given for 21 Gamma Doradus
stars. We report the discovery of HD 74504 as a newly found Gamma Doradus star.
Our study provides the first extensive multicolour database for the
understanding of gravity modes in F-type stars.
