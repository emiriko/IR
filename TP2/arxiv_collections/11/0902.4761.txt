Quasars are powerful systems whose spectrum is rich of metal features that
allow us to investigate the chemical evolution of galaxies at very high
redshift, even close to the reionization epoch. I review the main observational
constraints on the metallicity of quasars host galaxies at high redshift and
discuss the implications and issues for models of galaxy evolution in the early
universe.
