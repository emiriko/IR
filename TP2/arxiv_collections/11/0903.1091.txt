Gyrokinetics is a rich and rewarding playground to study some of the
mysteries of modern physics. In this thesis I present work, motivated by the
quest for fusion energy, which seeks to uncover some of the inner workings of
turbulence in magnetized plasmas.
  I begin with the fundamental theory of gyrokinetics, and a novel formulation
of its extension to the equations for mean-scale transport -- the equations
which must be solved to determine the performance of magnetically confined
fusion devices. The second project presents gyrokinetic secondary instability
theory as a mechanism to bring about saturation of the basic instabilities that
drive gyrokinetic turbulence. Emphasis is put on the ability for this analytic
theory to predict basic properties of the nonlinear state, which can be applied
to a mixing length phenomenology of transport. The final project is an
application of the methods from inertial range understanding of fluid
turbulence, to describe the stationary state of fully developed two-dimensional
gyrokinetic turbulence. This work explores the relatively new idea of a
phase-space cascade, whereby fine scales are nonlinearly generated in both
position space and velocity space, and ultimately smoothed by collisional
entropy production. This process constitutes the thermodynamic balance which
occurs in the true steady state of a turbulent plasma, including those found in
fusion devices.
