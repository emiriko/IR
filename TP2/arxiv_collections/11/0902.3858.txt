The use of formal methods provides confidence in the correctness of
developments. Yet one may argue about the actual level of confidence obtained
when the method itself -- or its implementation -- is not formally checked. We
address this question for the B, a widely used formal method that allows for
the derivation of correct programs from specifications. Through a deep
embedding of the B logic in Coq, we check the B theory but also implement B
tools. Both aspects are illustrated by the description of a proved prover for
the B logic.
