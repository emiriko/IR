This review summarizes the state of the art in searches for supersymmetry at
colliders on the eve of the LHC era. Supersymmetry is unique among extensions
of the standard model in being motivated by naturalness, dark matter, and force
unification, both with and without gravity. At the same time, weak-scale
supersymmetry encompasses a wide range of experimental signals that are also
found in many other frameworks. We recall the motivations for supersymmetry and
review the various models and their distinctive features. We then
comprehensively summarize searches for neutral and charged Higgs bosons and
standard model superpartners at the high energy frontier, considering both
canonical and non-canonical supersymmetric models, and including results from
LEP, HERA, and the Tevatron.
