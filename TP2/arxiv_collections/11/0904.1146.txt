By various methods, we obtained L$_{disk}$ $\sim$ 70 L$_{\odot}$ and
$\dot{M}$ $\sim$1.1 $\times$ 10$^{-8}$ M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$. These values were
about twice as high in the pre-1966-outburst epoch. This allowed the first
direct estimate of the total mass accreted before outburst,
M$_{accr}$=$\dot{M}_{pre-OB}$ $\cdot \Delta$t, and its comparison with the
critical ignition mass M$_{ign}$. We found M$_{accr}$ and M$_{ign}$ to be in
perfect agreement (with a value close to 5 $\times$ 10$^{-7}$M$_{\odot}$) for
M$_1$ $\sim$ 1.37 M$_{\odot}$, which provides a confirmation of the
thermonuclear runaway theory. The comparison of the observed parameters of the
eruption phase, with the corresponding values in the grid of models by Yaron
and collaborators, provides satisfactory agreement for values of M$_1$ close to
1.35 M$_{\odot}$ and log$\dot{M}$ between -8.0 and -7.0, but the observed value
of the decay time t$_3$ is higher than expected. The long duration of the
optically thick phase during the recorded outbursts of T Pyx, a spectroscopic
behavior typical of classical novae, and the persistence of P Cyg profiles,
constrains the ejected mass M$_{ign}$ to within 10$^{-5}$ - 10$^{-4}$
M$_{\odot}$. Therefore, T Pyx ejects far more material than it has accreted,
and the mass of the white dwarf will not increase to the Chandrasekhar limit as
generally believed in recurrent novae. A detailed study based on the UV data
excludes the possibility that T Pyx belongs to the class of the supersoft X-ray
sources, as has been postulated. XMM-NEWTON observations have revealed a weak,
hard source and confirmed this interpretation.
