We exploit a recently constructed mapping between quantum circuits and graphs
in order to prove that circuits corresponding to certain planar graphs can be
efficiently simulated classically. The proof uses an expression for the Ising
model partition function in terms of quadratically signed weight enumerators
(QWGTs), which are polynomials that arise naturally in an expansion of quantum
circuits in terms of rotations involving Pauli matrices. We combine this
expression with a known efficient classical algorithm for the Ising partition
function of any planar graph in the absence of an external magnetic field, and
the Robertson-Seymour theorem from graph theory. We give as an example a set of
quantum circuits with a small number of non-nearest neighbor gates which admit
an efficient classical simulation.
