In this essay we describe a platonic metaphysics where time is a fundamental
idea such that the passage of time is independent of observers and the laws of
physics. Furthermore, time serves to distinguish between a real and an abstract
universe, where a real universe is an appropriatelly ordered set of ideas in
time, while an abstract universe is such a set outside of time. We allow for
non-computable and non-mathematical ideas to be part of our model of the
universe in order to include intelligent observers. The part of the universe
which can be described by mathematics corresponds to a mathematical structure
in Tegmark's sense, while the non-mathematical part can be described by a human
language. We describe the mind-brain connection in our framework, and show that
it resolves the problem of obtaining abstract knowledge in platonism. We
briefly discuss how different interpretations of Quantum Mechanics can be
implemented in our framework and point out some physics implications, most
notably that the time travel would be impossible.
