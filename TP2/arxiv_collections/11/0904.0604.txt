Ferromagnetic La3NiAlMnO9 (LNAMO) and La3CoAlMnO9 (LCAMO) triple-perovskite
thin films are stabilized in the 750-860 oC temperature range in 100 to 900
mTorr O2 pressure range using pulsed-laser deposition. The LCAMO and LNAMO
films exhibit ferromagnetism up to 190 K and 130 K respectively. The
structural, optical and magnetic properties of these films demonstrate that the
B-site 3d-cations, Al, Mn and Co or Ni ions, are structurally short-range
ordered. The strong spin-lattice-polarization coupling in LCAMO is evidenced by
the temperature dependence of the dielectric constant and the softening of the
phonon frequencies starting in the vicinity of the
ferromagnetic-to-paramagnetic phase transition mimicking the behaviours of
La2CoMnO6 double perovskite.
