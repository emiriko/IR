The trace anomaly of gluodynamics on the lattice shows clear fingerprints of
a dimension two condensate above the phase transition. The condensate manifests
itself through even powers of the inverse temperature while the total
perturbative contribution corresponds to a mild temperature dependence and
turns out to be compatible with zero within errors. We try several resummation
methods based on a renormalization group improvement. The trace anomaly data
are analyzed and compared with other determinations of the dimension two
condensate based on the Polyakov loop and the heavy qq free energy, yielding
roughly similar numerical values. The role of glueballs near the transition is
also discussed.
