Transmission spectroscopy of Earth-like exoplanets is a potential tool for
habitability screening. Transiting planets are present-day "Rosetta Stones" for
understanding extrasolar planets because they offer the possibility to
characterize giant planet atmospheres and should provide an access to
biomarkers in the atmospheres of Earth-like exoplanets, once they are detected.
Using the Earth itself as a proxy we show the potential and limits of the
transiting technique to detect biomarkers on an Earth-analog exoplanet in
transit. We quantify the Earths cross section as a function of wavelength, and
show the effect of each atmospheric species, aerosol, and Rayleigh scattering.
Clouds do not significantly affect this picture because the opacity of the
lower atmosphere from aerosol and Rayleigh losses dominates over cloud losses.
We calculate the optimum signal-to-noise ratio for spectral features in the
primary eclipse spectrum of an Earth-like exoplanet around a Sun-like star and
also M stars, for a 6.5-m telescope in space. We find that the signal to noise
values for all important spectral features are on the order of unity or less
per transit - except for the closest stars - making it difficult to detect such
features in one single transit, and implying that co-adding of many transits
will be essential.
