We comment on a recent paper by Deng et al. (Phys. Rev. D 79, 044014 (2009),
arXiv:0901.3730) in which the Eddington-Robertson parameters for our modified
gravity theory (MOG) are derived. We show by explicit calculation that the role
of the vector field $\phi_\mu$ cannot be ignored in this derivation.
