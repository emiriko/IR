Magnetic properties of the planar structure consisting of a ferromagnetic
metal and the diluted magnetic semiconductor are considered (by the example of
the structure Fe/Ga(Mn)As, experimentally studied in [F. Maccherozzi, e.a.,
Phys. Rev. Lett., 101, 267201 (2008)]). In the framework of the mean field
theory, we demonstrate the presence of the significant amplification of the
ferromagnetism, induced by the ferromagnetic metal in the near-interface
semiconductor area, due to the indirect interaction of magnetic impurities.
This results in the substantial expansion of the temperature range where the
magnetization in the boundary semiconductor region exists, that might be
important for possible practical applications.
