We present in this short note a polynomial graph extension procedure that can
be used to improve any graph isomorphism algorithm. This construction
propagates new constraints from the isomorphism constraints of the input graphs
(denoted by $G(V,E)$ and $G'(V',E')$). Thus, information from the edge
structures of $G$ and $G'$ is "hashed" into the weighted edges of the extended
graphs. A bijective mapping is an isomorphism of the initial graphs if and only
if it is an isomorphism of the extended graphs. As such, the construction
enables the identification of pair of vertices $i\in V$ and $i'\in V'$ that can
not be mapped by any isomorphism $h^*:V \to V'$ (e.g. if the extended edges of
$i$ and $i'$ are different). A forbidding matrix $F$, that encodes all pairs of
incompatible mappings $(i,i')$, is constructed in order to be used by a
different algorithm. Moreover, tests on numerous graph classes show that the
matrix $F$ might leave only one compatible element for each $i \in V$.
