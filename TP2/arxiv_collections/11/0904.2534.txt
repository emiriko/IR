We explore the possibility of indirectly observing the effects of $Z'$-like
particles with electroweak strength couplings in the Drell-Yan channel at the
LHC with masses above the resonance direct search reach. We find that, mostly
due to statistical limitations, this is very unlikely in almost all classes of
models independently of the spin of the resonance. Not unexpectedly, the one
possible exception to this general result is the case of degenerate
Kaluza-Klein (KK) excitations of the photon and $Z$ that occur in some
extra-dimensional models. In this special case, the strong destructive
interference with the Standard Model (SM) exchanges below the resonance mass
leads to a well-known significant suppression of the cross section and thus
increased sensitivity to this particular new physics scenario.
