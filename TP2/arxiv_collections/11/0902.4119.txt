We investigate a Bose gas with finite-range interaction using a scheme to
eliminate unphysical processes in the T-matrix approximation. In this way the
corrected T-matrix becomes suitable to calculate properties below the critical
temperature. For attractive interaction, an Evans-Rashid transition occurs
between a quasi-ideal Bose gas and a BCS-like phase with a gaped dispersion.
The gap decreases with increasing density and vanishes at a critical density
where the single-particle dispersion becomes linear for small momenta
indicating Bose-Einstein condensation. The investigation of the pressure shows
however, that the mentioned quantum phase transitions might be inaccessible due
to a preceding first order transition.
