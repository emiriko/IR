Using a set of heterogeneous competing systems with intra-system cooperation
and inter-system aggression, we show how the coevolution of the system
parameters (degree of organization and conditions for aggression) depends on
the rate of supply of resources. The model consists of a number of units
grouped into systems that compete for the resource; within each system several
units can be aggregated into cooperative arrangements whose size is a measure
of the degree of organization in the system. Aggression takes place when the
systems release inhibitors that impair the performance of other systems. Using
a mean field approximation we show that i) even in the case of identical
systems there are stable inhomogeneous solutions, ii) a system steadily
producing inhibitors needs large perturbations to leave this regime, and iii)
aggression may give comparative advantages. A discrete model is used in order
to examine how the particular configuration of the units within a system
determines its performance in the presence of aggression. We find that
full-scale, one sided aggression is only profitable for less-organized systems,
and that systems with a mixture of degrees of organization exhibit robustness
against aggression. By using a genetic algorithm we find that, in terms of the
full-occupation resource supply rate, the coevolution of the set of systems
displays a variety of regimes. This kind of model can be useful to analyse the
interplay of the cooperation/competition processes that can be found in some
social, economic, ecological and biochemical systems; as an illustration we
refer to the competition between drug-selling gangs.
