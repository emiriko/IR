The physics of Sunspots is a fascinating and demanding field of research in
solar astronomy. Interaction of magnetic fields and plasma flows takes place in
a tangled magnetic geometry and occurs on spatial scales that pose a continuous
challenge for existing instrumentation and for the unambiguous interpretation
of spectropolarimetric observations. Thus, the main properties of sunspots are
well established but its fine structure is not yet fully understood.
  In this contribution we summarize the current knowledge of the magnetic and
dynamic properties of sunspots at the photospheric level based on selected
observations featuring the highest possible spatial and spectral resolution. We
concentrate on light bridges, umbral dots, penumbral filaments and the
notorious dark cores in penumbral filaments. We report on the morphology of the
fine structure elements but mostly focus on observations of their line-of-sight
velocities and magnetic field parameters. We briefly comment on results from
recent radiative MHD simulations and more schematic model ideas that attempt to
rationalize observations of the penumbra.
