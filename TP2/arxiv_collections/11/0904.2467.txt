Based on general symmetry considerations we investigate how the dependence of
the tunneling anisotropic magnetoresistance (TAMR) on the magnetization
direction is determined by the specific form of the spin-orbit coupling field.
By extending a phenomenological model, previously proposed for explaining the
main trends of the TAMR in (001) ferromagnet/semiconductor/normal-metal
magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) [J. Moser {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. 99,
056601 (2007)], we provide a unified qualitative description of the TAMR in
MTJs with different growth directions. In particular, we predict the forms of
the angular dependence of the TAMR in (001),(110), and (111) MTJs with
structure inversion asymmetry and/or bulk inversion asymmetry. The effects of
in-plane uniaxial strain on the TAMR are also investigated.
