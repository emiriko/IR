Directed acyclic graphs are a fundamental class of networks that includes
citation networks, food webs, and family trees, among others. Here we define a
random graph model for directed acyclic graphs and give solutions for a number
of the model's properties, including connection probabilities and component
sizes, as well as a fast algorithm for simulating the model on a computer. We
compare the predictions of the model to a real-world network of citations
between physics papers and find surprisingly good agreement, suggesting that
the structure of the real network may be quite well described by the random
graph.
