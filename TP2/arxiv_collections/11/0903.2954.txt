In this paper we present the event-chain algorithms, which are fast
Markov-chain Monte Carlo methods for hard spheres and related systems. In a
single move of these rejection-free methods, an arbitrarily long chain of
particles is displaced, and long-range coherent motion can be induced.
Numerical simulations show that event-chain algorithms clearly outperform the
conventional Metropolis method. Irreversible versions of the algorithms, which
violate detailed balance, improve the speed of the method even further. We also
compare our method with a recent implementations of the molecular-dynamics
algorithm.
