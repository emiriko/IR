While quantum entanglement is known to be monogamous (i.e. shared
entanglement is restricted in multi-partite settings), here we show that
distributed entanglement (or the potential for entanglement) is by nature
polygamous. By establishing the concept of one-way unlocalizable entanglement
(UE) and investigating its properties, we provide a polygamy inequality of
distributed entanglement in tripartite quantum systems of arbitrary dimension.
We also provide a polygamy inequality in multi-qubit systems, and several trade
offs between UE and other correlation measures.
