We study the phase diagram of a microscopic model for the superconducting
iron arsenides by means of a functional renormalization group. Our treatment
establishes a connection between a strongly simplified two-patch model by
Chubukov et al. and a five-band- analysis by Wang et al.. For a wide parameter
range, the dominant pairing instability occurs in the extended s-wave channel.
The results clearly show the relevance of pair scattering between electron and
hole pockets. We also give arguments that the phase transition between the
antiferromagnetic phase for the undoped system and the superconducting phase
may be first order.
