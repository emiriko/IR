In a recent paper [Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 106601], I. V. Tokatly addresses a
non Abelian formulation of spin orbit interaction in condensed matter,
restricting to a gauge symmetric scenario. In this comment we draw attention on
the relevance of gauge symmetry breaking on such formulation and point out why
this is a necessary ingredient for properly describing the associated
diamagnetic color currents.
