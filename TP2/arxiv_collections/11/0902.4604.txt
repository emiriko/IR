We present a multi-epoch, accurate UBVRcIc photometric catalog of 83
symbiotic stars and related objects, measured while calibrating the Henden and
Munari (2000, 2001, 2006) photometric sequences around them. The vast majority
of the observations where collected in the time interval between October 19,
1998 to April 21, 2002 with the 1.0-m Ritchey-Chretien telescope of the U. S.
Naval Observatory, Flagstaff Station (Arizona). On average, UBVRcIc data are
given on 3.6 epochs for each program star. The overall budget error of the data
is usually better than 0.01 mag.
