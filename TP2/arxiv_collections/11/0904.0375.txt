The derivation of the Feynman rules for lattice perturbation theory from
actions and operators is complicated, especially for highly improved actions
such as HISQ. This task is, however, both important and particularly suitable
for automation. We describe a suite of software to generate and evaluate
Feynman rules for a wide range of lattice field theories with gluons and
(relativistic and/or heavy) quarks. Our programs are capable of dealing with
actions as complicated as (m)NRQCD and HISQ. Automated differentiation methods
are used to calculate also the derivatives of Feynman diagrams.
