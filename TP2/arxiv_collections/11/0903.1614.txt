This chapter reviews recent experiments on matter wave interferometry with
large molecules. Starting from an elementary introduction to matter wave
physics we discuss far-field diffraction and near-field interferometry with
thermally excited many-body systems. We describe the constraints imposed by
decoherence and dephasing effects, and present an outlook to the future
challenges in macromolecule and cluster interferometry.
