A theorem related to the Newman-Penrose constants is proven. The theorem
states that all the Newman-Penrose constants of asymptotically flat,
stationary, asymptotically algebraically special electrovacuum spacetimes are
zero. Straightforward application of this theorem shows that all the
Newman-Penrose constants of the Kerr-Newman spacetime must vanish.
