Near-bandgap Raman scattering was used to induce and study photostructural
changes in AsxS100-x bulk glasses revealing a new photoinduced polymerization
effect. Raman spectra were recorded also in off-resonant conditions allowing
for a detailed comparison between the equilibrium glass structure and the
metastable one induced by illumination. It is shown that in S-rich glasses
structural changes involve the athermal scission of S8 rings and their
polymerization to Sn chains. The fraction of bonds involved in this effect is
surprisingly high, being one order of magnitude higher than the corresponding
fractions reported up to now in photostructural studies in chalcogenide
glasses.
