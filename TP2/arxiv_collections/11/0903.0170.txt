The effect of physically realizable wall potentials (soft walls) on the
dynamics of two interacting particles in a one-dimensional (1D) billiard is
examined numerically. The 1D walls are modeled by the error function and the
transition from hard to soft walls can be analyzed continuously by varying the
softness parameter $\sigma$. For $\sigma\to 0$ the 1D hard wall limit is
obtained and the corresponding wall force on the particles is the
$\delta$-function. In this limit the interacting particle dynamics agrees with
previous results obtained for the 1D hard walls. We show that the two
interacting particles in the 1D soft walls model is equivalent to one particle
inside a soft right triangular billiard. Very small values of $\sigma$
substantiously change the dynamics inside the billiard and the mean finite-time
Lyapunov exponent decreases significantly as the consequence of regular islands
which appear due to the low-energy double collisions (simultaneous
particle-particle-1D wall collisions). The rise of regular islands and sticky
trajectories induced by the 1D wall softness is quantified by the number of
occurrences of the most probable finite-time Lyapunov exponent. On the other
hand, chaotic motion in the system appears due to the high-energy double
collisions. In general we observe that the mean finite-time Lyapunov exponent
decreases when $\sigma$ increases, but the number of occurrences of the most
probable finite-time Lyapunov exponent increases, meaning that the phase-space
dynamics tends to be more ergodiclike. Our results suggest that the transport
efficiency of interacting particles and heat conduction in periodic structures
modeled by billiards will strongly be affected by the smoothness of physically
realizable walls.
