The conditions for a generalized Burgers equation which a priori involves
nine arbitrary functions of one, or two variables to allow an infinite
dimensional symmetry algebra are determined. Though this algebra can involve up
to two arbitrary functions of time, it does not allow a Virasoro algebra. This
result confirms that variable coefficient generalizations of a non-integrable
equation should be expected to remain as such.
