We describe a method to control and detect in single-shot the electron spin
state of an individual donor in silicon with greatly enhanced sensitivity. A
silicon-based Single-Electron Transistor (SET) allows for spin-dependent
tunneling of the donor electron directly into the SET island during the
read-out phase. Simulations show that the charge transfer signals are typically
\Delta q > 0.2 e - over an order of magnitude larger than achievable with
metallic SETs on the SiO2 surface. A complete spin-based qubit structure is
obtained by adding a local Electron Spin Resonance line for coherent spin
control. This architecture is ideally suited to demonstrate and study the
coherent properties of donor electron spins, but can be expanded and integrated
with classical control electronics in the context of scale-up.
