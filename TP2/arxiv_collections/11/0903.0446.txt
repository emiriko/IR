We perform a study to describe motion of charged particles under the
influence of electromagnetic and gravitational fields of a slowly rotating
wormhole with nonvanishing magnetic moment. We present analytic expression for
potentials of electromagnetic field for an axially symmetric slowly rotating
magnetized wormholes. While addressing important issues regarding the subject,
we compare our results of motion around black holes and wormholes in terms of
the ratio of radii of event horizons of a black hole and of the throat of a
wormhole. It is shown that both radial and circular motions of test bodies in
the vicinity of a magnetized wormhole could give rise to a peculiar
observational astrophysical phenomenon.
