Arguments are presented based on particle phenomenology and the requirement
for Unitarity for a complex valued postulated four generation CKM Matrix (VCKM
) based on a Sequential Fourth Generation Model (sometimes named SM4). A
modified four generation QCD Standard Model Lagrangian is utilized per SM4. A
four generation neutrino mass mixing MNS Matrix, (VMNS) is estimated utilizing
a Unitary (to Order (Lambda**k), k = 1, 2, 3, 4, etc) 4 x 4 Bimaximal Matrix,
VBIMAX. The Unitary VBIMAX is based on a weighted 3 x 3 VBIMAX scheme and is
studied in conjunction with the postulated four generation VCKM complex Unitary
Matrix. A single parameter has been utilized in our analysis along with three
complex DELTA(i,j) phases. A four generation Wolfenstein Parameterization of
VCKM is deduced which is valid for order Lambda**3. Experimental implications
of the model are discussed. The issues of Baryogenesis in the context of
Leptogenesis associated with MNS Matrix neutrino mixing and Baryogenesis
associated with CKM Matrix quark mixing are discussed. These issues are studied
in the context of the postulated complex four generation CKM Matrix and
resulting complex MNS Matrix, predicted CP violating parameters, and a Fourth
Generation Neutrino mass bound of equal to or greater than 50 GeV. Our analysis
is valid to and includes order Lambda**3 terms. Our work is a mathematical
analysis of the consequences of such model. Classification Codes (PACS-1996):
