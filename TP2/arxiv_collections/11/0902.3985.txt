We show that the material dependencies of macroscopically quantized fields in
linear media are not consistent with the classical electromagnetic boundary
conditions. We then phenomenologically construct macroscopic quantized fields
that satisfy quantum--classical correspondence with the result indicating that
the canonical momentum in a linear medium is modified as a consequence of the
reduced speed of light. We re-derive D'Alembert's principle and Lagrange's
equations for an arbitrarily large region of space in which light signals
travel slower than in the vacuum and show that the resulting modifications to
Lagrangian dynamics, including the canonical momenta, repair the violation of
the correspondence principle for macroscopically quantized fields.
