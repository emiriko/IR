Effective temperatures of early-type supergiants are important to test
stellar atmosphere- and internal structure-models of massive and intermediate
mass objects at different evolutionary phases. However, these Teff values are
more or less discrepant depending on the method used to determine them. We aim
to obtain a new calibration of the Teff parameter for early-type supergiants as
a function of observational quantities that are highly sensitive to the
ionization balance in the photosphere and its gas pressure, independent of the
interstellar extinction, and as much as possible model-independent. The
observational quantities that best address our aims are the (lambda1, D)
parameters of the BCD spectrophotometric system. They describe the energy
distribution around the Balmer discontinuity, which is highly sensitive to Teff
and logg. We perform a calibration of the (lambda1, D) parameters into Teff
using effective temperatures derived with the bolometric-flux method for 217
program stars, whose individual absolute relative uncertainties are on average
0.05. The final comparison of calculated with obtained Teff values in the
(lambda1,D) calibration further show that the latter have total relative
uncertainties, which on average are of the order of 0.05 for all spectral types
and luminosity classes. The effective temperatures of OB supergiants derived in
this work agree on average within some 2000 K with other determinations found
in the literature, except those issued from wind-free non-LTE plane-parallel
models of stellar atmospheres, which produce effective temperatures that can be
overestimated by up to more than 5000 K near Teff = 25000 K.
