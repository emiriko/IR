We analyze the properties that manifest Hamiltonian nature of the
Schr\"odinger equation and show that it can be considered as originating from
singular Lagrangian action (with two second class constraints presented in the
Hamiltonian formulation). It is used to show that any solution to the
Schr\"odinger equation with time independent potential can be presented in the
form $\Psi=(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\triangle+V)\phi+i\hbar\partial_t\phi$, where
the real field $\phi(t, x^i)$ is some solution to nonsingular Lagrangian theory
being specified below. Preservation of probability turns out to be the energy
conservation law for the field $\phi$. After introducing the field into the
formalism, its mathematical structure becomes analogous to those of
electrodynamics: the real field $\phi$ turns out to be a kind of potential for
a wave function.
