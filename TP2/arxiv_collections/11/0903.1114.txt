We have performed a detailed abundance analysis of the content of s-process
elements of two dwarf stars with suspected overabundace of those elements. Such
stars belong to a special kinematic sample of the solar neighborhood, with
peculiar kinematics and different chemical abundances when compared to "normal"
disk stars. We aim to define if those stars can be identified as barium stars,
based on their s-process elements abundances, and their classification, i.e.,
if they share their chemical profile with strong or mild barium stars. We also
intend to shed light on the possible origins of the different kinds of barium
stars. Spectra have been taken by using the FEROS spectrograph at the 1.52m
telescope of ESO, La Silla. Abundances have been derived for 18 elements, by
matching the synthetic profile with the observed spectrum. We have found that
HD 11397 shows a mild enhancement for most of the s-process elements as well as
for some r-process elements. This star seems to share its abundance profile
with the mild Ba-stars. Although showing some slight chemical anomalies for Y,
Sr, Mo, and Pb, HD 14282 depicts a chemical pattern similar to the normal stars
with slight s-process enhancements.
