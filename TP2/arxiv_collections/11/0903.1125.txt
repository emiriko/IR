Collecting large labeled data sets is a laborious and expensive task, whose
scaling up requires division of the labeling workload between many teachers.
When the number of classes is large, miscorrespondences between the labels
given by the different teachers are likely to occur, which, in the extreme
case, may reach total inconsistency. In this paper we describe how globally
consistent labels can be obtained, despite the absence of teacher coordination,
and discuss the possible efficiency of this process in terms of human labor. We
define a notion of label efficiency, measuring the ratio between the number of
globally consistent labels obtained and the number of labels provided by
distributed teachers. We show that the efficiency depends critically on the
ratio alpha between the number of data instances seen by a single teacher, and
the number of classes. We suggest several algorithms for the distributed
labeling problem, and analyze their efficiency as a function of alpha. In
addition, we provide an upper bound on label efficiency for the case of
completely uncoordinated teachers, and show that efficiency approaches 0 as the
ratio between the number of labels each teacher provides and the number of
classes drops (i.e. alpha goes to 0).
