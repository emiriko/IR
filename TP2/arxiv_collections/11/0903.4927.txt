Myelin figures are interfacial structures formed when certain surfactants
swell in excess water. Here, I present data and model calculations suggesting
myelin formation and growth is due to the fluid flow of surfactant, driven by
the hydration gradient at the dry surfactant/water interface; a simple model
based on this idea qualitatively reproduces the various myelin growth behaviors
observed in different experiments. From a detailed experimental observation of
how myelins develop from a planar precursor structure, I identify a mechanical
instability that may underlie myelin formation. These results indicate the
mixed mechanical character of the surfactant lamellar structure, where fluid
and elastic properties coexist, is what enables the formation and growth of
myelins.
