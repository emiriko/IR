The paper presents a new stiffness modeling method for overconstrained
parallel manipulators with flexible links and compliant actuating joints. It is
based on a multidimensional lumped-parameter model that replaces the link
flexibility by localized 6-dof virtual springs that describe both
translational/rotational compliance and the coupling between them. In contrast
to other works, the method involves a FEA-based link stiffness evaluation and
employs a new solution strategy of the kinetostatic equations for the unloaded
manipulator configuration, which allows computing the stiffness matrix for the
overconstrained architectures, including singular manipulator postures. The
advantages of the developed technique are confirmed by application examples,
which deal with comparative stiffness analysis of two translational parallel
manipulators of 3-PUU and 3-PRPaR architectures. Accuracy of the proposed
approach was evaluated for a case study, which focuses on stiffness analysis of
Orthoglide parallel manipulator.
