We compute the continuous part of the ideal-magnetohydrodynamic (ideal-MHD)
frequency spectrum of a polar mountain produced by magnetic burial on an
accreting neutron star. Applying the formalism developed by Hellsten & Spies
(1979), extended to include gravity, we solve the singular eigenvalue problem
subject to line-tying boundary conditions. This spectrum divides into an
Alfv\'{e}n part and a cusp part. The eigenfunctions are chirped and anharmonic
with an exponential envelope, and the eigenfrequencies cover the whole spectrum
above a minimum $\omega_\mathrm{low}$. For equilibria with accreted mass $1.2
\times 10^{-6} \la M_a/M_\odot \la 1.7 \times 10^{-4}$ and surface magnetic
fields $10^{11} \la B_\ast/\mathrm{G} \la 10^{13}$, $\omega_\mathrm{low}$ is
approximately independent of $B_\ast$, and increases with $M_a$. The results
are consistent with the Alfv\'{e}n spectrum excited in numerical simulations
with the \textsc{zeus-mp} solver. The spectrum is modified substantially by the
Coriolis force in neutron stars spinning faster than $\sim 100$ Hz. The
implications for gravitational wave searches for low-mass X-ray binaries are
considered briefly.
