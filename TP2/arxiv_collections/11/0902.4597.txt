Photonic Crystal Fibers can be tailored to increase the effective Kerr
nonlinearity, while producing smaller amounts of excess noise compared to
standard silicon fibers. Using these features of Photonic Crystal Fibers we
create polarization squeezed states with increased purity compared to standard
fiber squeezing experiments. Explicit we produce squeezed states in counter
propagating pulses along the same fiber axis to achieve near identical
dispersion properties. This enables the production of polarization squeezing
through interference in a polarization type Sagnac interferometer. We observe
Stokes parameter squeezing of -3.9 +/- 0.3dB and anti-squeezing of 16.2 +/-
0.3dB.
