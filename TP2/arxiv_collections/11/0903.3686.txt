The operational characteristics of a magnonic crystal, which was fabricated
as an array of shallow grooves etched on a surface of a magnetic film, were
compared for magnetostatic surface spin waves and backward volume magnetostatic
spin waves. In both cases the formation of rejection frequency bands was
studied as a function of the grooves depth. It has been found that the
rejection of the volume wave is considerably larger than of the surface one.
The influences of the nonreciprocity of the surface spin waves as well as of
the scattering of the lowest volume spin-wave mode into higher thickness volume
modes on the rejection efficiency are discussed.
