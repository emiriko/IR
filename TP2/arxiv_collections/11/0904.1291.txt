To a finite, connected, unoriented graph of Betti-number g>=2 and valencies
>=3 we associate a finitely summable, commutative spectral triple (in the sense
of Connes), whose induced zeta functions encode the graph. This gives another
example where non-commutative geometry provides a rigid framework for
classification.
