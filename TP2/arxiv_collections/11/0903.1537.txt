We study the normal modes of a scalar field in the background of a warped
AdS_3 black hole which arises in topologically massive gravity. We discuss the
normal mode spectrum using the brick wall boundary condition. In addition, we
investigate the possibility of a more general boundary condition for the scalar
field.
