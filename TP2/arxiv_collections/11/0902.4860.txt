On the basis of of linearized Usadel equations we consider superconductivity
nucleation in multiply connected mesoscopic superconductor/ferromagnet hybrids
such as thin-walled superconducting cylinders placed in electrical contact with
a ferromagnetic metal. We study the interplay between the oscillations of $T_c$
due to the Little--Parks effect and the oscillations due to the exchange field.
We demonstrate that the exchange field provokes the switching between the
superconducting states with different vorticities and this may result in the
increase the critical temperature of the superconducting transition in the
magnetic field. Moreover we analyse the influence of the S/F transparency on
the realisation of the states with higher vorticities.
