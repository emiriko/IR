We report on a novel stochastic analysis of seismic time series for the
Earth's vertical velocity, by using methods originally developed for complex
hierarchical systems, and in particular for turbulent flows. Analysis of the
fluctuations of the detrended increments of the series reveals a pronounced
change of the shapes of the probability density functions (PDF) of the series'
increments. Before and close to an earthquake the shape of the PDF and the
long-range correlation in the increments both manifest significant changes. For
a moderate or large-size earthquake the typical time at which the PDF undergoes
the transition from a Gaussian to a non-Gaussian is about 5-10 hours. Thus, the
transition represents a new precursor for detecting such earthquakes.
