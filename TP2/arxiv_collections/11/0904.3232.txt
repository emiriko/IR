The properties of light in the presence of electromagnetic and gravitational
fields are compared. Once one takes account of the fact that clock rates vary
with distance from a massive object, it is argued that in an absolute sense
light frequencies remain constant in both interactions. It is also pointed out
that the criterion used by Einstein for the angle of curvature of light rays
passing close to the sun is not their actual trajectory but rather Huygens'
Principle. The latter only requires that the speed of light vary with distance
from a gravitational source in order to produce a measurable effect. As a
result, the observed displacement of star images during solar eclipses can be
explained on the basis of a rotation of the wave front of light without
assuming that individual photons are actually deflected by the sun. A
calculation reported by Schiff in 1960 based on the assumption that light
travels in a straight line for all local observers obtains the same closed
expression for the angle of displacement of star images as in Einstein's
original work, in support of this interpretation. Since light is believed to
follow a straight-line trajectory within any given homogeneous transparent
medium, it is argued that light refraction and gravitational bending have more
in common than is generally realized.
