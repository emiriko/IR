We present a systematic analysis of two-pion interferometry in Au+Au
collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}}$ = 62.4 GeV and Cu+Cu collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}}$ = 62.4 and 200 GeV using the STAR detector at RHIC. The
multiplicity and transverse momentum dependences of the extracted correlation
lengths (radii) are studied. The scaling with charged particle multiplicity of
the apparent system volume at final interaction is studied for the RHIC energy
domain. The multiplicity scaling of the measured correlation radii is found to
be independent of colliding system and collision energy.
