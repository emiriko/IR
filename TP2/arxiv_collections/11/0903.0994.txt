We studied the stripe phase of La1.8Sr0.2NiO4 using neutron diffraction,
resonant soft x-ray diffraction (RSXD) at the Ni L2,3 edges, and resonant x-ray
diffraction (RXD) at the Ni K threshold. Differences in the q-space resolution
of the different techniques have to be taken into account for a proper
evaluation of diffraction intensities associated with the spin and charge order
superstructures. We find that in the RSXD experiment the spin and charge order
peaks show the same temperature dependence. In the neutron experiment by
contrast, the spin and charge signals follow quite different temperature
behaviors. We infer that fluctuating magnetic order contributes considerably to
the magnetic RSXD signal and we suggest that this result may open an
interesting experimental approach to search for fluctuating order in other
systems by comparing RSXD and neutron diffraction data.
