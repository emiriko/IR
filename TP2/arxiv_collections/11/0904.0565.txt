We study the secant variety of the spinor variety, focusing on its equations
of degree three and four. We show that in type $D_n$, cubic equations exist if
and only if $n\ge 9$. In general the ideal has generators in degrees at least
three and four. Finally we observe that the other Freudenthal varieties exhibit
strikingly similar behaviors.
