A model of pattern formation in living systems is presented. The pattern is
achieved by the sequential interaction of two signaling pathways. The coupling
of the pattern to the (thick) epithelial sheet changes is given, when the Gauss
curvature'K'enters. The model suggests a novel point-like placement for organs
such as eyes, antennae, limbs, and wings. In the case of plant patterns, 'leaf'
outgrowths from a stem are predicted to be under the control of a yet to be
discovered "master regulatiory gene", analogous to the animal case, when
various outgrowths from the animal body are generally accompanied by activation
of the 'distal-less' (Dll) gene.
