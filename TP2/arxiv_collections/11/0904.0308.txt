We derive a new upper bound for Eve's information in secret key generation
from a common random number without communication. This bound improves on
Bennett et al(1995)'s bound based on the R\'enyi entropy of order 2 because the
bound obtained here uses the R\'enyi entropy of order $1+s$ for $s \in [0,1]$.
This bound is applied to a wire-tap channel. Then, we derive an exponential
upper bound for Eve's information. Our exponent is compared with
Hayashi(2006)'s exponent. For the additive case, the bound obtained here is
better. The result is applied to secret key agreement by public discussion.
