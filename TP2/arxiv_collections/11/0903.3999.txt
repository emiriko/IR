We study the implementation of a correlation measurement technique for the
characterization of squeezed light which is nearly free of electronic noise.
With two different sources of squeezed light, we show that the sign of the
covariance coefficient, revealed from the time resolved correlation data, is
witnessing the presence of squeezing in the system. Furthermore, we estimate
the degree of squeezing using the correlation method and compare it to the
standard homodyne measurement scheme. We show that the role of electronic
detector noise is minimized using the correlation approach as opposed to
homodyning where it often becomes a crucial issue.
