We report large scale determinant Quantum Monte Carlo calculations of the
effective bandwidth, momentum distribution, and magnetic correlations of the
square lattice fermion Hubbard Hamiltonian at half-filling. The sharp Fermi
surface of the non-interacting limit is significantly broadened by the
electronic correlations, but retains signatures of the approach to the edges of
the first Brillouin zone as the density increases. Finite size scaling of
simulations on large lattices allows us to extract the interaction dependence
of the antiferromagnetic order parameter, exhibiting its evolution from weak
coupling to the strong coupling Heisenberg limit. Our lattices provide improved
resolution of the Green's function in momentum space, allowing a more
quantitative comparison with time-of-flight optical lattice experiments.
