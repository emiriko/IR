In the last years the Space Science community was confronted to a continuous
increasing interest in Martian missions, extra-solar planet search and
multi-satellite missions. The presented T.I.P.O. mission is a proposal for a
research program dedicated to study, by space borne interferometric methods,
the radio emissions generated in the atmospheres and magnetospheres of planets,
both solar and extra-solar.
