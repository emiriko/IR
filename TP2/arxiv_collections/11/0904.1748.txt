We discuss properties of heavy quarkonium states at high temperatures based
on lattice QCD and potential models. We review recent progress made in lattice
calculations of spatial static quark anti-quark correlators as well as
quarkonium correlators in Euclidean time. Recent developments in effective
field theory approach and potential models are also discussed.
