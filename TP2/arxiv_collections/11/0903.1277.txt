The goal of this paper is to establish the existence of a foliation of the
asymptotic region of an asymptotically flat manifold with nonzero mass by
surfaces which are critical points of the Willmore functional subject to an
area constraint. Equivalently these surfaces are critical points of the
Geroch-Hawking mass. Thus our result has applications in the theory of General
Relativity.
