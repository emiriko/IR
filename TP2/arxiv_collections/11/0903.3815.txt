We report the serendipitous detection of a Wide-Angle-Tail (WAT) radio galaxy
at 240 and 610 MHz, using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT). This WAT
is hosted by a cD galaxy PGC 1519010 whose photometric redshift given in the
SDSS DR6 catalog is close to the spectroscopic redshifts (0.105, 0.106 and
0.107) of three galaxies found within 4' of the cD. Using the SDSS DR6 we have
identified a total of 37 galaxies within 15' of the cD, whose photometric
redshifts are between 0.08 and 0.14. This strongly suggests that the cD is
associated with a group of galaxies whose conspicuous feature is a north-south
chain of galaxies (filament) extending to at least 2.6 Mpc. The $ROSAT$ All-Sky
Survey shows a faint, diffuse X-ray source in this direction, which probably
marks the hot intra-cluster gas in the potential well of this group.
  We combine the radio structural information for this WAT with the galaxy
clustering in that region to check its overall consistency with the models of
WAT formation. The bending of the jet before and after its disruption forming
the radio plume, are found to be correlated in this WAT, as seen from the
contrasting morphological patterns on the two sides of the core. Probable
constraints imposed by this on the models of WAT formation are pointed out. We
also briefly report on the other interesting radio sources found in the
proximity of the WAT. These include a highly asymmetric double radio source and
an ultra-steep spectrum radio source for which no optical counterpart is
detected in the SDSS.
