We report the discovery by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) onboard the Fermi
Gamma-ray Space Telescope of high-energy gamma-ray (GeV) emission from the
flat-spectrum radio quasar PKS 1454-354 (z=1.424). On 4 September 2008 the
source rose to a peak flux of (3.5 +/- 0.7)x 10^-6 ph cm^-2 s^-1 (E > 100 MeV)
on a time scale of hours and then slowly dropped over the following two days.
No significant spectral changes occurred during the flare. Fermi/LAT
observations also showed that PKS 1454-354 is the most probable counterpart of
the unidentified EGRET source 3EG J1500-3509. Multiwavelength measurements
performed during the following days (7 September with Swift; 6-7 September with
the ground-based optical telescope ATOM; 13 September with the Australia
Telescope Compact Array) resulted in radio, optical, UV and X-ray fluxes
greater than archival data, confirming the activity of PKS 1454-354.
