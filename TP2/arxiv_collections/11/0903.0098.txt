The principal goal of this whitepaper is not so much to demonstrate that
gravitational wave detectors like LIGO and LISA will help answer many central
questions in astronomy and astrophysics, but to make the case that they can
help answer a far greater range of questions if we prepare to make the
(sometimes substantial) effort to identify electromagnetic counterparts to the
gravitational wave sources.
