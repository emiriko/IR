A new theoretical approach for the calculation of optical properties of
complex solutions is proposed. It is based on a dielectric matrix with included
small metallic inclusions (less than 3 nm) of spherical shape. We take into
account the mutual interactions between the inclusions and the quantum
finite-size effects. On the basis of the effective medium model, TDLDA and
Kohn-Sham theories, some analytical expressions for the effective dielectric
permittivity of the solution are obtained.
