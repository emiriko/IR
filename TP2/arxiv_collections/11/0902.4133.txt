The gravitational wave signal from a compact object spiralling toward a
massive black hole (MBH) is thought to be one of the most difficult sources to
detect in the LISA data stream. Due to the large parameter space of possible
signals and many orbital cycles spent in the sensitivity band of LISA, it has
been estimated previously that of the order of 10^{35} templates would be
required for a fully coherent search with a template grid, which is
computationally impossible. Here we describe an algorithm based on a
constrained Metropolis-Hastings stochastic search which allows us to find and
accurately estimate parameters of isolated EMRI signals buried in Gaussian
instrumental noise. We illustrate the effectiveness of the algorithm with
results from searches of the Mock LISA Data Challenge round 1B data sets.
