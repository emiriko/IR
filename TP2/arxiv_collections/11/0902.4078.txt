As a liquid is progressively supercooled an intriguing weakening of the
wavenumber ($q$) dependence of the structural relaxation time $\tau(q)$ in the
large q limit is observed both in experiments and simulation studies. Neither
the continuous Brownian diffusive dynamics nor the discontinuous activated
events can alone explain the anomalous wavenumber dependence. Here we use our
recently developed theory that unifies the mode coupling theory (MCT) for
continuous dynamics and the random first order transition theory (RFOT)
treatment of activated discontinuous motion as a nucleation (instanton)
process, to understand the wavenumber dependence of density relaxation. The
predicted smooth change in mechanism of relaxation from diffusive to activated,
in the crossover regime, is wavevector dependent and is eventually responsible
for sub-quadratic, almost linear, $q$ dependence of the relaxation time.
