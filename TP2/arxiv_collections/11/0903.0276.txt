Cognitive radio is a breakthrough technology which is expected to have a
profound impact on the way radio spectrum will be accessed, managed and shared
in the future. In this paper I examine some of the implications of cognitive
radio for future management of spectrum. Both a near-term view involving the
opportunistic spectrum access model and a longer-term view involving a
self-regulating dynamic spectrum access model within a society of cognitive
radios are discussed.
