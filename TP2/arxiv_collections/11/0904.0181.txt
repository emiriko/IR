Parameters of the nonorthogonal tight-binding model for hydrocarbons are
derived based on a criterion of the best agreement between the calculated and
experimental values of bond lengths and binding energies for different
molecules CnHm. The results obtained can be used, e. g., to study the kinetics
of hydrogen absorption by carbon nanostructures, to simulate the dynamics of
hydrocarbon clusters like cubane C8H8, etc.
