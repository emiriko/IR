Plasmon and polariton modes are derived for an ideal semi-infinite
(half-space) plasma and an ideal plasma slab by using a general, unifying
procedure, based on equations of motion, Maxwell's equations and suitable
boundary conditions. Known results are re-obtained in much a more direct manner
and new ones are derived. The approach consists of representing the charge
disturbances by a displacement field in the positions of the moving particles
(electrons). The dielectric response and the electron energy loss are computed.
The surface contribution to the energy loss exhibits an oscillatory behaviour
in the transient regime near the surfaces. The propagation of an
electromagnetic wave in these plasmas is treated by using the retarded
electromagnetic potentials. The resulting integral equations are solved and the
reflected and refracted waves are computed, as well as the reflection
coefficient. For the slab we compute also the transmitted wave and the
transmission coefficient. Generalized Fresnel's relations are thereby obtained
for any incidence angle and polarization. Bulk and surface plasmon-polariton
modes are identified. As it is well known, the field inside the plasma is
either damped (evanescent) or propagating (transparency regime), and the
reflection coefficient for a semi-infinite plasma exhibits an abrupt
enhancement on passing from the propagating regime to the damped one (total
reflection). Similarly, apart from characteristic oscillations, the reflection
and transmission coefficients for a plasma slab exhibit an appreciable
enhancement in the damped regime.
