We show that both confined atoms and electron-atom scattering can be
described by a unified basis set method. The central idea behind this method is
to place the atom inside a hard potential sphere, enforced by a standard Slater
type basis set multiplied by a cutoff factor. For confined atoms, where the
wall is placed close to the atomic nucleus, we show how the energy of the
highest occupied atomic orbital and the static polarizability of helium and
neon atoms evolve with the confinement radius. To our knowledge, these are the
first confined atom polarizability calculations that include correlation,
through the use of time-dependent density-functional theory. By placing the
atom in a large spherical box, with a wall outside the electron density, we
obtain scattering phase shifts using a recently developed method [M. van
Faassen, A. Wasserman, E. Engel, F. Zhang, and K. Burke, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf
99}, 043005 (2007)]. We show that the basis set method gives identical results
to previously obtained phase shifts for $e$-H and $e$-He${}^{+}$ scattering.
