Spectral properties of the Bose-Hubbard model and a recently proposed
coupled-cavity model are studied by means of quantum Monte Carlo simulations in
one dimension. Both models exhibit a quantum phase transition from a Mott
insulator to a superfluid phase. The dynamic structure factor $S(k,\omega)$ and
the single-particle spectrum $A(k,\omega)$ are calculated, focusing on the
parameter region around the phase transition from the Mott insulator with
density one to the superfluid phase, where correlations are important. The
strongly interacting nature of the superfluid phase manifests itself in terms
of additional gapped modes in the spectra. Comparison is made to recent
analytical work on the Bose-Hubbard model. Despite some subtle differences due
to the polaritonic particles in the cavity model, the gross features are found
to be very similar to the Bose-Hubbard case. For the polariton model, emergent
particle-hole symmetry near the Mott lobe tip is demonstrated, and temperature
and detuning effects are analyzed. A scaling analysis for the generic
transition suggests mean field exponents, in accordance with field theory
results.
