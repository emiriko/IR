Starting from a microscopic theory, we derive a master equation for a
harmonic oscillator coupled to a bath of non-interacting oscillators. We follow
a non-perturbative approach, proposed earlier by us for the free Brownian
particle. The diffusion constants are calculated analytically and the
positivity of the Master Equation is shown to hold above a critical
temperature. We compare the long time behaviour of the average kinetic and
potential energies with known thermodynamic results. In the limit of vainishing
oscillator frequency of the system, we recover the results of the free Brownian
particle.
