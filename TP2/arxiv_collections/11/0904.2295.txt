A summary of the most recent results on top quark physics obtained at
Fermilab's Tevatron proton-antiproton collider, operating at a centre of mass
energy of 1.96 TeV, is presented. Measurements of the top pair and single top
quark production cross sections, the investigation of top quark decay
properties, the precision measurement of the top quark mass as well as searches
for physics beyond the standard model are discussed.
