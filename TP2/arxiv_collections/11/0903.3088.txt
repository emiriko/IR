In this paper, the dynamical attractor and heteroclinic orbit have been
employed to make the late-time behaviors of the model insensitive to the
initial condition and thus alleviate the fine-tuning problem in the torsion
cosmology. The late-time de Sitter attractor indicates that torsion cosmology
is an elegant scheme and the scalar torsion mode is an interesting geometric
quantity for physics. The numerical solutions obtained by Nester et al. are not
periodic solutions, but are quasi-periodic solutions near the focus for the
coupled nonlinear equations.
