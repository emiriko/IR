We present the result of a search of the Milagro sky map for spatial
correlations with sources from a subset of the recent Fermi Bright Source List
(BSL). The BSL consists of the 205 most significant sources detected above 100
MeV by the Fermi Large Area Telescope. We select sources based on their
categorization in the BSL, taking all confirmed or possible Galactic sources in
the field of view of Milagro. Of the 34 Fermi sources selected, 14 are observed
by Milagro at a significance of 3 standard deviations or more. We conduct this
search with a new analysis which employs newly-optimized gamma-hadron
separation and utilizes the full 8-year Milagro dataset. Milagro is sensitive
to gamma rays with energy from 1 to 100 TeV with a peak sensitivity from 10-50
TeV depending on the source spectrum and declination. These results extend the
observation of these sources far above the Fermi energy band. With the new
analysis and additional data, multi-TeV emission is definitively observed
associated with the Fermi pulsar, J2229.0+6114, in the Boomerang Pulsar Wind
Nebula (PWN). Furthermore, an extended region of multi-TeV emission is
associated with the Fermi pulsar, J0634.0+1745, the Geminga pulsar.
