We analyze the connection between electric dipole moment of the electron and
the soft leptogenesis in supersymmetric $B-L$ extension of the standard model.
In this model, the $B-L$ symmetry is radiatively broken at TeV scale.
Therefore, it is a natural framework for low scale seesaw mechanism and also
for implementing the soft leptogenesis. We show that the phases of trilinear
soft SUSY breaking couplings $A$, which are relevant for the lepton asymmetry,
are not constrained by the present experimental bounds on electric dipole
moment. As in the MSSM extended with right-handed neutrinos, successful
leptogenesis requires small bilinear coupling $B$, which is now given by $A_N$
and $B-L$ breaking VEVs. SUSY $B-L$ model with non-universal $A$-terms such
that $A_N=0$ while $A_{\nu}\neq0$ is a promising scenario for soft
leptogenesis. The proposed EDM experiments will test this scenario in the
future.
