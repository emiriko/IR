The identification of an extrasolar planet as Earth-like will depend on the
detection of atmospheric signatures or surface non-uniformities. In this paper
we present spatially unresolved flux light curves of Earth for the purpose of
studying a prototype extrasolar terrestrial planet. Our monitoring of the
photometric variability of earthshine revealed changes of up to 23 % per hour
in the brightness of Earth's scattered light at around 600 nm, due to the
removal of specular reflection from the view of the Moon. This variability is
accompanied by reddening of the spectrum, and results from a change in surface
properties across the continental boundary between the Indian Ocean and
Africa's east coast. Our results based on earthshine monitoring indicate that
specular reflection should provide a useful tool in determining the presence of
liquid water on extrasolar planets via photometric observations.
