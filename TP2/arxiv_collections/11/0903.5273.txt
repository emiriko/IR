We report a systematic study on the effect of partial substitution of
Sc$^{3+}$ by Ti$^{4+}$ in Sr$_{2}$ScFeAsO$_{3}$, Ca$_{2}$ScFeAsO$_{3}$ and
Sr$_{3}$Sc$_{2}$Fe$_{2}$As$_{2}$O$_{5}$ on their electrical properties. High
level of doping results in an increased carrier concentration and leads to the
appearance of superconductivity with the onset of T$_{c}$ up to 45 K.
