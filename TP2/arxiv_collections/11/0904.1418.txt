The temperature dependence of the upper critical magnetic field (Hc2) in a
BaFe1.84Co0.16As2 single crystal was determined via resistivity, for the
inter-plane (H^ab) and in-plane (H//ab) directions in pulsed and static
magnetic fields of up to 60 T. Suppressing superconductivity in a pulsed
magnetic field at 3He temperatures permits us to construct an H-T phase diagram
from quantitative Hc2(0) values and determine its behavior in low temperatures.
Hc2(0) with H//ab (Hc2//(0)) and H^ab (Hc2^(0)) are ~ 55 T and 50 T
respectively. These values are ~ 1.2 - 1.4 times larger than the weak-coupling
Pauli paramagnetic limit (Hp = 1.84 Tc), indicating that enhanced paramagnetic
limiting is essential and this superconductor is unconventional. While Hc2//ab
is saturated at low temperature, Hc2 with H^ab (Hc2^) exhibits almost linear
temperature dependence towards T = 0 K which results in reduced anisotropy of
Hc2 in low temperature. The anisotropy of Hc2 was ~ 3.4 near Tc, and decreases
rapidly with lower temperatures reaching ~ 1.1 at T = 0.7 K.
