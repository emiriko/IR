Dynamical changes in the solar corona have proven to be very important in
inducing seismic waves into the photosphere. Different mechanisms for their
generation have been proposed. In this work, we explore the magnetic field
forces as plausible mechanisms to generate sunquakes as proposed by Hudson,
Fisher and Welsch. We present a spatial and temporal analysis of the
line-of-sight magnetic field variations induced by the seismically active 2003
October 29 and 2005 January 15 solar flares and compare these results with
other supporting observations.
