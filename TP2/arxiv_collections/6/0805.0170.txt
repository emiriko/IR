The calculation of the real part of a quasi-particle dispersion relation at
next-to-leading order in the hard thermal loop effective theory is a very
difficult problem. Even though the hard thermal loop effective theory is almost
20 years old, there is only one next-to-leading order calculation of the real
part of a quasi-particle dispersion relation in the literature. In this paper,
we calculate the fermion mass in QED and QCD at next-to-leading order. For QED
the result is M=eT/sqrt{8} * [1-(1.427 \pm 0.02)e/4pi] and for QCD with N_f=2
and N_c=3 we obtain M=gT/sqrt{6} * [1+(1.867 \pm 0.02)g/4pi].
