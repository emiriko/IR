Meissner effect and pinning effect are clearly observed with the naked eye. A
GdBaCuO high-temperature superconductor (HTS) disk fabricated by Nippon Steel
Corporation, a 100mm cubic NdFeB sintered magnet, and iron wires coated by
colored are used. When the HTS is put in the magnetic field of the magnet, it
can be observed by the wires that the magnetic field lines are excluded from
the superconductor (Meissner effect) as well as are pinned in the
superconductor (pinning effect).
