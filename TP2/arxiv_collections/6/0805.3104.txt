We study the growing time scales and length scales associated with dynamical
slow down for a realistic glass former, using computer simulations. We perform
finite size scaling to evaluate a length scale associated with dynamical
heterogeneity which grows as temperature decreases. However, relaxation times
which also grow with decreasing temperature, do not show the same kind of
scaling behavior with system size as the dynamical heterogeneity, indicating
that relaxation times are not solely determined by the length scale of
dynamical heterogeneity. We show that relaxation times are instead determined,
for all studied system sizes and temperatures, by configurational entropy, in
accordance with the Adam-Gibbs relation, but in disagreement with theoretical
expectations based on spin-glass models that configurational entropy is not
relevant at temperatures substantially above the critical temperature of mode
coupling theory. The temperature dependence of the heterogeneity length scale
shows significant deviations from theoretical expectations, and the length
scale one may extract from the system size dependence of the configurational
entropy has much weaker temperature dependence compared to the heterogeneity
length scale at all studied temperatures. Our results provide new insights into
the dynamics of glass-forming liquids and pose serious challenges to existing
theoretical descriptions.
