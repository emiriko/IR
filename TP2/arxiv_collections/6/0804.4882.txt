According to our previous results, the conjugacy class of the involution
induced by the complex conjugation in the homology of a real non-singular cubic
fourfold determines the fourfold up to projective equivalence and deformation.
Here, we show how to eliminate the projective equivalence and to obtain a pure
deformation classification, that is how to respond to the chirality question:
which cubics are not deformation equivalent to their image under a mirror
reflection. We provide an arithmetical criterion of chirality, in terms of the
eigen-sublattices of the complex conjugation involution in homology, and show
how this criterion can be effectively applied taking as examples $M$-cubics
(that is those for which the real locus has the richest topology) and
$(M-1)$-cubics (the next case with respect to complexity of the real locus). It
happens that there is one chiral class of $M$-cubics and three chiral classes
of $(M-1)$-cubics, contrary to two achiral classes of $M$-cubics and three
achiral classes of $(M-1)$-cubics.
