Contribution of simplest loops is studied in the Local Reggeon Field Theory
with a supercritical pomeron in the nuclear matter. It is shown that the latter
transforms the supercritical pomeron into the subcritical. Renormalization of
the intercept and difficulties related to the fact that the renormalized
intercept is complex are discussed. Numerical results with the conventional
parameters are reported.
