We present a scheme of surface-sensitive nuclear magnetic resonance in
optically pumped semiconductors, where an NMR signal from a part of the surface
of a bulk compound semiconductor is detected apart from the bulk signal. It
utilizes optically oriented nuclei with a long spin-lattice relaxation time as
a polarization reservoir for the second (target) nuclei to be detected. It
provides a basis for the nuclear spin polarizer [IEEE Trans. Appl. Supercond.
14, 1635 (2004)], which is a polarization reservoir at a surface of the
optically pumped semiconductor that polarizes nuclear spins in a target
material in contact through the nanostructured interfaces.
