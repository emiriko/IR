The collisional drift wave instability is reexamined taking into account the
ion response in the direction parallel to the magnetic field lines, which
appears due to friction with electrons and which can not be omitted in view of
the momentum conservation. A modified instability threshold is obtained. In
plasmas with dominant electron collisions with neutrals, the instability
threshold is shifted towards higher frequencies, compared to the case of
dominant electron collisions with ions. The difference between the two cases
vanishes when the ion sound response is negligible, i.e., when the instability
threshold disappears, and both ions and neutrals react to the electron friction
in the same manner.
