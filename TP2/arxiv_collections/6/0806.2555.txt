We prove that every distributional problem solvable in polynomial time on the
average with respect to the uniform distribution has a frequently
self-knowingly correct polynomial-time algorithm. We also study some features
of probability weight of correctness with respect to generalizations of
Procaccia and Rosenschein's junta distributions [PR07b].
