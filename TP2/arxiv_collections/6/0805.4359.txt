Computer experiments are often performed to allow modeling of a response
surface of a physical experiment that can be too costly or difficult to run
except using a simulator. Running the experiment over a dense grid can be
prohibitively expensive, yet running over a sparse design chosen in advance can
result in obtaining insufficient information in parts of the space,
particularly when the surface calls for a nonstationary model. We propose an
approach that automatically explores the space while simultaneously fitting the
response surface, using predictive uncertainty to guide subsequent experimental
runs. The newly developed Bayesian treed Gaussian process is used as the
surrogate model, and a fully Bayesian approach allows explicit measures of
uncertainty. We develop an adaptive sequential design framework to cope with an
asynchronous, random, agent--based supercomputing environment, by using a
hybrid approach that melds optimal strategies from the statistics literature
with flexible strategies from the active learning literature. The merits of
this approach are borne out in several examples, including the motivating
computational fluid dynamics simulation of a rocket booster.
