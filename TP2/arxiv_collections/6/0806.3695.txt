We show that quaternionic Gaussian random variables satisfy a generalization
of the Wick formula for computing the expected value of products in terms of a
family of graphical enumeration problems. When applied to the quaternionic
Wigner and Wishart families of random matrices the result gives the duality
between moments of these families and the corresponding real Wigner and Wishart
families.
