We present the realization of a ultra fast shutter for optical fields, which
allows to preserve a generic polarization state, based on a self-stabilized
interferometer. It exhibits high (or low) transmittivity when turned on (or
inactive), while the fidelity of the polarization state is high. The shutter is
realized through two beam displacing prisms and a longitudinal Pockels cell.
This can represent a useful tool for controlling light-atom interfaces in
quantum information processing.
