Even after the negative result by the MiniBooNE experiment, we can still have
a (3+1)-scheme with one sterile neutrino whose mixing lies within the allowed
region by MiniBooNE. In this note we discuss the possible effects of such a
scheme on the flavor ratio of high-energy cosmic neutrinos from cosmologically
distant astrophysical sources. It is shown that in principle there is still a
chance to observe deviation from the standard three flavor scenario in the
flavor ratio of the high-energy cosmic neutrinos. It is proposed to see the
energy spectrum to cope with the theoretical uncertainties which were recently
pointed out by Lipari, Lusignoli and Meloni. It is emphasized that the
$\nu_\mu-\nu_\tau$ ratio is relatively insensitive to the theoretical
uncertainties and therefore this ratio is the key ingredient to look for the
signatures of the sterile neutrino scheme. Although the statistics of data from
one source in the next generation of neutrino telescopes are estimated not to
be sufficient to distinguish the three and four family schemes, if we can gain
statistics by, e.g., summing over data from many sources, then it might be
possible to have a signature for the (3+1)-scheme.
