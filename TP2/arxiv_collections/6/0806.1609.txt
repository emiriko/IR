We compute the thermal conductance between two nanoparticles in contact based
on the Molecular Dynamics technique. The contact is generated by letting both
particles stick together under van der Waals attractions. The thermal
conductance is derived from the fluctuation-dissipation theorem and the time
fluctuations of the exchanged power. We show that the conductance is
proportional to the atoms involved in the thermal interaction. In the case of
silica, the atomic contribution to the thermal conductance is in the range of
0.5 to 3 nW.K-1. This result fits to theoretical predictions based on
characteristic times of the temperature fluctuation. The order of magnitude of
the contact conductance is 1 \mu W.K-1 when the cross section ranges from 1 to
10nm2.
