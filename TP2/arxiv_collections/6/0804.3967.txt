We employ the time-dependent non-crossing approximation to study the time
averaged conductance for a single electron transistor in the Kondo regime when
the dot level is sinusoidally driven from its equilibrium position by means of
a gate voltage in finite bias. We find that the average conductance exhibits
significant deviation from the monotonous reduction when the applied bias is
equal to the driving frequency of the dot level. We investigate the effect of
the temperature and the driving frequency on the observed enhancement. We
attribute this behaviour to the overlap of the satellite Kondo peaks with the
split Kondo resonances formed at each lead's Fermi level. We display the
spectral function to put our interpretation into more rigorous footing.
