The notion of polytopal map between two polytopal complexes is defined.
Surprisingly, this definition is quite simple and extends naturally those of
simplicial and cubical maps. It is then possible to define an induced chain map
between the associated chain complexes. Finally, we use this new tool to give
the first combinatorial proof of the splitting necklace theorem of Alon. The
paper ends with open questions, such as the existence of Sperner's lemma for a
polytopal complex or the existence of a cubical approximation theorem.
