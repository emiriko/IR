We have developed an efficient tabulation scheme to evaluate $6j$ symbol for
atomic calculations. The scheme is appropriate for coupled-cluster based
calculations. In particular, for perturbed coupled-clusters calculations, which
has another perturbation in addition to the residual Coulomb interaction. The
scheme relies on the symmetry of the $6j$ symbol and the triangular conditions.
