This experimental study investigates a new technique to keep a satellite in
orbit utilizing electrodynamics. The technique consists of establishing a
charge on a satellite such that the body's motion through a planetary magnetic
field induces acceleration via the Lorentz force. In order to find the
relationship between capacitance and power required to balance incident plasma
current, various objects were tested in high vacuum, plasma, and Xenon gas to
determine their ability to hold charge. Radioactive material (Am-241) and
pyroelectric crystals were tested as a candidate power source for charging the
objects. Microscopic arcing was observed at voltages as low as -300 V. This
arcing caused solder to explode off of the object. Insulating the object
allowed the charge to remain on the object longer, while in the plasma, and
also eliminated the arcing. However, this insulation does not allow a net
charge to reside on the surface of the spacecraft.
