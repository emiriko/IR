A large conformational change in the reaction co-ordinate and the role of the
solvent in the formation of base-pairing are combined to settle a long standing
issue {\it i.e.} prediction of re-entrance in the force induced transition of
DNA. A direct way to observe the re-entrance, i.e a strand goes to the closed
state from the open state and again to the open state with temperature, appears
difficult to be achieved in the laboratory. An experimental protocol (in direct
way) in the constant force ensemble is being proposed for the first time that
will enable the observation of the re-entrance behavior in the
force-temperature plane. Our exact results for small oligonucleotide that forms
a hairpin structure provide the evidence that re-entrance can be observed.
