We report specific heat, resistivity and susceptibility measurements at
different temperatures, magnetic fields, and pressures to provide solid
evidence of CoS2 being a marginal Fermi liquid. The presence of a tricritical
point in the phase diagram of the system provides an opportunity to test the
spin fluctuation theory with a high limit of accuracy. A magnetic field
suppresses the amplitude of the spin fluctuations and recovers conventional
Fermi liquid behavior, connecting both states continuously.
