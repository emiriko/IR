A brief account of the world view of classical physics is given first. We
then recapitulate as to why the Copenhagen interpretation of the quantum
mechanics had to renounce most of the attractive features of the clasical world
view such as a causal description, locality, scientific realism and introduce a
fundamental distinction between system and apparatus. The crucial role is
played in this by the Bohr's insistence on the wavefunction providing the most
complete description possible for an even individual system. The alternative of
introducing extra dynamical variables, called hidden variables, in addition to
the wavefunction of the system so as to be able to retain at least some of the
desirable features of classical physics, is then explored. The first such
successful attempt was that of Bohm in 1952 who showed that a realistic
interpretation of the quantum mechanics can be given which maintains a causal
description as well as does not treat systems and measuring appeartus
differently. We begin with the construction of the Bohm's theory. He introduces
particle positions as the hidden variables. The particle positions play a
special role in Bohm theory. The particle trajectories are guided by the
wavefunction. The Bohm theory is deterministic. The probability enters through
a special assumption, ``quantum equilibrium'' hypothesis, for the initial
conditions on the ensemble of particle trajectories. The ``wave or particle''
dilemma is resolved by a ``wave and particle'' resolution. The measurements in
Bohm theory can be described without mysticism. Bohm's theory is however
nonlocal.
