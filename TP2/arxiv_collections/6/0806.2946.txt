We present fully ab-initio calculations of van der Waals coefficients for two
different situations: i) the interaction between hydrogenated silicon clusters;
and ii) the interactions between these nanostructures and a non metallic
surface (a silicon or a silicon carbide surface). The methods used are very
efficient, and allow the calculation of systems containing hundreds of atoms.
The results obtained are further analyzed and understood with the help of
simple models. These models can be of interest for molecular dynamics
simulations of silicon nanostructures on surfaces, where they can give a very
fast yet sufficiently accurate determination of the van der Waals interaction
at large separations.
