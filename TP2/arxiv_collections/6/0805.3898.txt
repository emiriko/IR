Classical SU(2) Yang-Mills theory in 3+1 dimensional anti-de Sitter space is
known to provide a holographic dual to a 2+1 system that undergoes a
superconducting phase transition. We study the electrical conductivity and
spectral density of an isotropic superconducting phase. We show that the theory
exhibits a pseudogap at low temperatures and a nonzero Hall conductivity. The
Hall conductivity is possible because of spontaneous breaking of time reversal
symmetry.
