The calculation presented in "Rotation Velocities and Radial Electric Field
in the Plasma Edge" by W. M. Stacey [Contrib. Plasma Phys. 46, (2006)] contains
an inconsistent treatment of the electrostatic potential. Comparing the
expressions for the potential associated with the radial electrostatic field
with that associated with the poloidal electrostatic field reveals the
inconsistency. A field-theoretic perspective implies that the electrostatic
field must vanish in a model based upon the physics of a neutral, conducting
fluid.
