We construct a CW decomposition $C_n$ of the $n$-dimensional half cube in a
manner compatible with its structure as a polytope. For each $3 \leq k \leq n$,
the complex $C_n$ has a subcomplex $C_{n, k}$, which coincides with the clique
complex of the half cube graph if $k = 4$. The homology of $C_{n, k}$ is
concentrated in degree $k-1$ and furthermore, the $(k-1)$-st Betti number of
$C_{n, k}$ is equal to the $(k-2)$-nd Betti number of the complement of the
$k$-equal real hyperplane arrangement. These Betti numbers, which also appear
in theoretical computer science, numerical analysis and engineering, are the
coefficients of a certain Pascal-like triangle (Sloane's sequence A119258). The
Coxeter groups of type $D_n$ act naturally on the complexes $C_{n, k}$, and
thus on the associated homology groups.
