We prove global internal controllability in large time for the nonlinear
Schrodinger equation on a bounded interval with periodic, Dirichlet or Neumann
conditions. Our strategy combines stabilization and local controllability near
0. We use Bourgain spaces to prove this result on L2. We also get a regularity
result about the control if the data are assumed smoother.
