We study the effect of magnetic Mn ions on the two-band superconductor MgB_2,
and compute both the total and spin resolved scanning tunneling spectrum in the
vicinity of the magnetic impurity. We show that when the internal structure of
the Mn ion's d-shell is taken into account, multiple Shiba states appear in the
spectrum. The presence of these multiplets could alter significantly the
overall interpretation of local tunneling spectra for a wide range of
superconducting hosts and magnetic impurities.
