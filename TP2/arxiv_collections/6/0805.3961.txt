Possible influence of the weak interaction on the $\mu^+ + \mu^- \to \mu^+ +
\mu^- $ scattering and the $\mu^+ + \mu^- \to e^+ + e^- $ reaction, both
through the neutral lepton currents and the charged ones (in the second order
on weak constant), are considered.
  The calculations show that $P$ - odd effects in the mentioned processes would
prove the existence of the neutral currents which, in their turn, give the
principal basis for explanation of the mass difference of a muon and an
electron from the point of view of Ref. [1].
