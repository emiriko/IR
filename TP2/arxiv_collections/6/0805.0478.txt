Theory of trembling motion [Zitterbewegung (ZB)] of charge carriers in
various narrow-gap materials is reviewed. Nearly free electrons in a periodic
potential, InSb-type semiconductors, bilayer graphene, monolayer graphene and
carbon nanotubes are considered. General features of ZB are emphasized. It is
shown that, when the charge carriers are prepared in the form of Gaussian wave
packets, the ZB has a transient character with the decay time of femtoseconds
in graphene and picoseconds in nanotubes. Zitterbewegung of electrons in
graphene in the presence of an external magnetic field is mentioned. A
similarity of ZB in semiconductors to that of relativistic electrons in a
vacuum is stressed. Possible ways of observing the trembling motion in solids
are mentioned.
