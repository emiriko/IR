We describe a modular system for generating sentences from formal definitions
of underlying linguistic structures using domain-specific languages. The system
uses Java in general, Prolog for lexical entries and custom domain-specific
languages based on Functional Grammar and Functional Discourse Grammar
notation, implemented using the ANTLR parser generator. We show how linguistic
and technological parts can be brought together in a natural language
processing system and how domain-specific languages can be used as a tool for
consistent formal notation in linguistic description.
