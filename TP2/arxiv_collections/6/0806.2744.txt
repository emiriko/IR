We study a physical system consisting of non-interacting quasiparticles in
disordered superconductors that have neither time-reversal nor spin-rotation
invariance. This system belongs to class D within the recent classification
scheme of random matrix ensembles (RME) and its phase diagram contains three
different phases: metallic and two distinct localized phases with different
quantized thermal Hall conductances. We find that critical exponents describing
different transitions (insulator-to-insulator and insulator-to-metal) are
identical within the error of numerical calculations and also find that
critical disorder of the insulator-to-metal transition is energy independent.
