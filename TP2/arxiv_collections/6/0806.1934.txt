We present a new method in order to get variable slip coefficient in binary
lattice Boltzmann models to simulate gaseous flows. Boundary layer theory is
presented. We study both the single- and multi-fluid BGK-type models as well.
The boundary slip and the Knudsen layer are analyzed in detail. Benchmark
simulations are carried out in order to compare the analytical derivation with
the numerical results. Excellent agreement is found between the two situations.
