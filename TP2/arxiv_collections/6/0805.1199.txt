A relation is found between pulsed measurements of the excited state
probability of a two-level atom illuminated by a driving laser, and a
continuous measurement by a second laser coupling the excited state to a third
state which decays rapidly and irreversibly. We find the time between pulses to
achieve the same average detection time than a given continuous measurement in
strong, weak, or intermediate coupling regimes, generalizing the results in L.
