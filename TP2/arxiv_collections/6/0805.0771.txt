When cooled below room temperature, the pulse response of a photomultiplier
in the absence of light (dark rate) initially decreases, but then turns around
near 250 K and continues to rise all the way down to 4 K. When the
photomultiplier is cold, its dark response is burst-like. We have measured the
characteristics of the dark response of a photomultiplier.
