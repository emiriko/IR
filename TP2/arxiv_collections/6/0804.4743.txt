Nuclides in the vicinity of 94Ag have been studied with the Penning trap mass
spectrometer JYFLTRAP at the Ion-Guide Separator On-Line. The masses of the
two-proton-decay daughter 92Rh and the beta-decay daughter 94Pd of the
high-spin isomer in 94Ag have been measured, and the masses of 93Pd and 94Ag
have been deduced. When combined with the data from the one-proton or
two-proton-decay experiments, the results lead to contradictory mass excess
values for the high-spin isomer in 94Ag, -46370(170) or -44970(100) keV,
corresponding to excitation energies of 6960(400) or 8360(370) keV,
respectively.
