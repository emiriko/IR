Deep inelastic scattering off the strongly coupled N=4 supersymmetric
Yang-Mills plasma at finite temperature can be computed within the AdS/CFT
correspondence, with results which are suggestive of a parton picture for the
plasma. Via successive branchings, essentially all partons cascade down to very
small values of the longitudinal momentum fraction x and to transverse momenta
smaller than the saturation momentum Q_s\sim T/x. This scale Q_s controls the
plasma interactions with a hard probe, in particular, the jet energy loss and
its transverse momentum broadening.
