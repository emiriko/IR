The mean length and the variability of coding sequences for 48 genomes of
bacteria and archaea were analyzed. It was found that the plotted data can be
described by an angular area. This suggests the followings: a) The variability
of a genome increases as the mean length increases; b) There is an upper and a
lower limit for variability for a given mean length; c) Extrapolation of the
upper and lower limits to lower mean values converges to a single point which
might be assimilated to a primordial cell. The whole picture is reminding of a
process which starts from a single cell and evolves into more and more species
which, in turn, show more and more variability.
