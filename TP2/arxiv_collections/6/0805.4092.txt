We construct a universal code for stationary and memoryless classical-quantum
channel as a quantum version of the universal coding by Csisz\'{a}r and
K\"{o}rner. Our code is constructed by the combination of irreducible
representation, the decoder introduced through quantum information spectrum,
and the packing lemma.
