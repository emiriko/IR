In this paper we show that magnetic-dipolar-mode (MDM) oscillations of a
quasi-2D ferrite disk are characterized by unique symmetry features with
topological phases resulting in appearance of the magnetoelectric (ME)
properties. The entire ferrite disk can be characterized as a pair of two,
electric and magnetic, coupled eigen moments. However, there is no a "glued
pair" of two dipoles. An external electromagnetic field in the near-field
region "views" such a ME particle, as a system with a normally oriented eigen
electric moment and an in-plane rotating eigen magnetic dipole moment.
