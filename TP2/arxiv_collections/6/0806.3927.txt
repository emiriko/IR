Measurements of superfluid $^3$He in 98% aerogel demonstrate the existence of
a metastable \emph{A}-like phase and a stable \emph{B}-like phase. It has been
suggested that the relative stability of these two phases is controlled by
anisotropic quasiparticle scattering in the aerogel. Anisotropic scattering
produced by axial compression of the aerogel has been predicted to stabilize
the axial state of superfluid $^3$He. To explore this possiblity, we used
transverse acoustic impedance to map out the phase diagram of superfluid $^3$He
in a $\sim 98$% porous silica aerogel subjected to 17% axial compression. We
have previously shown that axial anisotropy in aerogel leads to optical
birefringence and that optical cross-polarization studies can be used to
characterize such anisotropy. Consequently, we have performed optical
cross-polarization experiments to verify the presence and uniformity of the
axial anisotropy in our aerogel sample. We find that uniform axial anisotropy
introduced by 17% compression does not stabilize the \emph{A}-like phase. We
also find an increase in the supercooling of the \emph{A}-like phase at lower
pressure, indicating a modification to \emph{B}-like phase nucleation in
\emph{globally} anisotropic aerogels.
