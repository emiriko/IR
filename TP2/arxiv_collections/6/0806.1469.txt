Using liquid 3He in aerogel as an example, it is shown that correlations in
positions of impurities affect the temperature $T_c$ of transition of Fermi
liquid in an unconventional superfluid or superconductive state. The effect is
significant if the correlation length for impurities is greater than the
coherence length in the superfluid or superconductive state $\xi_0$. For 3He in
aerogel the suppression of $T_c$ is expressed in terms of the structure factor
of aerogel. With the account of the fractal structure of aerogel a simple
expression is obtained for the decrease of $T_c$ from its clean value. This
expression is in a satisfactory agreement with experimental data.
