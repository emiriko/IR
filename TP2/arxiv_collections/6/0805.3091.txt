We present a simple randomized procedure for the prediction of a binary
sequence. The algorithm uses ideas from recent developments of the theory of
the prediction of individual sequences. We show that if the sequence is a
realization of a stationary and ergodic random process then the average number
of mistakes converges, almost surely, to that of the optimum, given by the
Bayes predictor. The desirable finite-sample properties of the predictor are
illustrated by its performance for Markov processes. In such cases the
predictor exhibits near optimal behavior even without knowing the order of the
Markov process. Prediction with side information is also considered.
