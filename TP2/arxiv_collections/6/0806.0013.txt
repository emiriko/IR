We show that nonperturbative lattice studies of four-dimensional N=4
Super-Yang-Mills are within reach. We use Ginsparg-Wilson fermions to avoid
gluino masses and an exact implementation of the (chiral) $R$-symmetry, which
greatly limits the number of counterterms that must be fine-tuned. Only bosonic
operators require fine tuning, so all tunings can be done ``offline'' by a
Ferrenberg-Swendsen type reweighting. We show what measurables can be used to
perform the tuning.
