Coherent electron transfer from a localized state trapped in a quantum dot
into a ballistic conductor, taking place in on-demand electron sources, in
general may result in excitation of particle-hole pairs. We consider a simple
model for these effects, involving a resonance level with time-dependent
energy, and derive Floquet scattering matrix describing inelastic transitions
of particles in the Fermi sea. We find that, as the resonance level is driven
through the Fermi level, particle transfer may take place completely without
particle-hole excitations for certain driving protocols. In particular, such
noiseless transfer occurs when the level moves with constant rapidity, its
energy changing linearly with time. A detection scheme for studying the
coherence of particle transfer is proposed.
