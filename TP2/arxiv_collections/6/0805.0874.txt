Autonomous microsystems are confronted today to a major challenge : the one
of energy supply. Energy scavenging, i.e. collecting energy from the ambient
environment has been developed to answer this problematic. Various sources have
already been successfully used (solar, vibration). This article presents
temporal variations of temperature as a new source of exploitable energy. A
brief review will take place at the beginning, exposing the different
approaches used in the past. Then we will focus our attention on hybridization
of magnetism and piezoelectricity. A new kind of thermal generator is proposed
and a preliminary model is exposed. Conclusions will be drawn on the
suitability of this prototype and the improvements that are needed to increase
its potential.
