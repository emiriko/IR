In this paper, second post-Newtonian approximation of Einstein-aether theory
is obtained by Chandrasekhar's approach. Five parameterized post-Newtonian
parameters in first post-Newtonian approximation are presented after a time
transformation and they are identical with previous works, in which $\gamma=1$,
$\beta=1$ and two preferred-frame parameters remain. Meanwhile, in second
post-Newtonian approximation, a parameter, which represents third order
nonlinearity for gravity, is zero the same as in general relativity. For an
application for future deep space laser ranging missions, we reduce the metric
coefficients for light propagation in a case of $N$ point masses as a
simplified model of the solar system. The resulting light deflection angle in
second post-Newtonian approximation poses another constraint on the
Einstein-aether theory.
