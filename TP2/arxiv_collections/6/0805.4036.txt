In this paper we considered a quantum particle moving through delute
Bose-Einstein condensate at zero temperature. In our formulation the impurity
particle interacts with the gas of uncoupled Bogoliubov's excitations. We
constructed the perturbation theory for the Green's function of the impurity
particle with respect to the impurity-condensate interaction employing the
coherent-state path integral approach. The perturbative expansion for the
Green's function is resumed into the expansion for its poles with the help of
the diagrammatic technique developed in this work. The dispersion relation for
the impurity clothed by condensate excitations is obtained and effective mass
is evaluated beyond the Golden rule approximation.
