It is shown that for superconductors with circumference $2\pi R$ approaching
BCS coherence length $\xi_0$ minimal period of the response of all
thermodynamic quantities to external magnetic field is set by $hc/e$ i.e. twice
the corresponding value for the bulk case. This is explained by the dependence
of internal energy of Cooper pairs on their center of mass motion which leads,
in particular, to a transition offset between different current-carrying
states. Explicit calculation of the transition offset is done for the case of
s-wave superconducting cylinder with $R \gg \xi_0$ and turns out to be
exponentially small. A possible enhancement of the effect for nodal
superconductors is suggested. Similar conclusions should also apply to the
response of charged or neutral superfluids to rotation.
