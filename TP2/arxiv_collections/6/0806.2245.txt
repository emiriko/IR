We analyze the dynamics of a paramagnetic, dipolar molecule in a generic
"magneto-electrostatic'' trap where both magnetic and electric fields may be
present. The potential energy that governs the dynamics of the molecules is
found using a reduced molecular model that incorporates the main features of
the system. We discuss the shape of the trapping potentials for different field
geometries, as well as the possibility of nonadiabatic transitions to untrapped
states, i.e., the analog of Majorana transitions in a quadrupole magnetic
atomic trap. Maximizing the lifetime of molecules in a trap is of great concern
in current experiments, and we assess the effect of nonadiabatic transitions on
obtainable trap lifetimes.
