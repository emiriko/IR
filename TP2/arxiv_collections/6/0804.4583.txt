We present a theoretical study of the electronic structure of magnetically
modulated graphene. We consider monolayer graphene in the presence of a
perpendicular magnetic field and a unidirectional weak magnetic modulation. The
density of states and the bandwidth of the Dirac electrons in this system are
determined. We have found magnetic Weiss oscillations in the bandwidth and the
density of states. These oscillations are out of phase and larger in amplitude
than the ones in the electrically modulated graphene. In addition, these
oscillations are in phase and smaller in amplitude to those of magnetically
modulated standard electron gas system.
