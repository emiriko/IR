We present a high-resolution photoluminescence study of Er-doped SiO2
sensitized with Si nanocrystals (Si NCs). Emission bands originating from
recombination of excitons confined in Si NCs and of internal transitions within
the 4f-electron core of Er3+ ions, and a band centered at lambda = 1200nm have
been identified. Their kinetics have been investigated in detail. Based on
these measurements, we present a comprehensive model for energy transfer
mechanisms responsible for light generation in this system. A unique picture of
energy flow between subsystems of Er3+ and Si NCs is developed, yielding truly
microscopic information on the sensitization effect and its limitations. In
particular, we show that most of the Er3+ ions available in the system are
participating in the energy exchange. The long standing problem of apparent
loss of optical activity of majority of Er dopants upon sensitization with Si
NCs is clarified and assigned to appearance of a very efficient energy exchange
mechanism between Si NCs and Er3+ ions. Application potential of SiO2:Er
sensitized by Si NCs is discussed in view of the newly acquired microscopic
insight.
