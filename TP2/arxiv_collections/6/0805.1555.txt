The interference between repeated Landau-Zener transitions in a qubit swept
through an avoided level crossing results in Stueckelberg oscillations in qubit
magnetization. The resulting oscillatory patterns are a hallmark of the
coherent strongly-driven regime in qubits, quantum dots and other two-level
systems. The two-dimensional Fourier transforms of these patterns are found to
exhibit a family of one-dimensional curves in Fourier space, in agreement with
recent observations in a superconducting qubit. We interpret these images in
terms of time evolution of the quantum phase of qubit state and show that they
can be used to probe dephasing mechanisms in the qubit.
