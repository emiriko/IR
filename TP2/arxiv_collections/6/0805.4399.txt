In this article we show for the first time the role played by the
hypergeneralized Heun equation (HHE) in the context of Quantum Field Theory in
curved space-times. More precisely, we find suitable transformations relating
the separated radial and angular parts of a massive Dirac equation in the
Kerr-Newman-deSitter metric to a HHE.
