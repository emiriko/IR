I discuss recent results obtained by our group within the Nambu-Jona Lasinio
model with the Polyakov loop. I focus on the two flavor version of the model,
discussing the phase diagram in the $\mu-T$ plane in the case in which
electrical neutrality is required. One of the results is that pion condensation
is not observed in our model when a physical mass for the light quarks is
considered.
