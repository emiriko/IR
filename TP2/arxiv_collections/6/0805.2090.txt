The color dipole analysis of small-$(x, Q^2)$ neutrino DIS induced by the
charmed-strange ($cs$) current reveals ordering of dipole sizes
$m_c^{-2}<r^2<m_s^{-2}$ typical of the Double Leading Log Approximation (DLLA).
The DLLA resummation leads to the $cs$ component of the longitudinal structure
function $F_L$ rising to small $x$ much faster than its light quark component.
Based on the color dipole BFKL approach we report quantitative predictions for
this effect in the kinematical range of the CCFR/NuTeV experiment.
