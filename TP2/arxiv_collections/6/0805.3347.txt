The absence of magnetic long range order in the triangular lattice spin-1
antiferromagnet $NiGa$_2$S$_4$ has prompted the search for a novel quantum
ground state. In particular, several experiments suggest the presence of a
linearly dispersing mode despite no long-range magnetic order. We show that the
anomalous low temperature properties of NiGa$_2$S$_4$ can naturally be
explained by the formulation developed by Halperin and Saslow where the
linearly dispersing Halperin-Saslow mode may exist in the background of frozen
spin moments and zero net magnetization. We provide highly non-trivial
consistency checks on the existing experimental data and suggest future
experiments that can further confirm the existence of the Halperin-Saslow mode.
Our results place strong constraints on any microscopic theory of this
material.
