We study the breathing mode frequencies of a rotating Fermi gas trapped in a
harmonic plus radial quartic potential. We find that as the radial
anharmonicity increases, the lowest order radial mode frequency increases while
the next lowest order radial mode frequency decreases. Then at a critical
anharmonicity, these two modes merge and beyond this merge the cloud is
unstable against the oscillations. The critical anharmonicity depends on both
rotational frequency and the chemical potential. As a result of the large
chemical potential in the BCS regime, even with a weak anharmonicity the lowest
order mode frequency increases with decreasing the attractive interaction. For
large enough anharmonicities in the weak coupling BCS limit, we find that the
excitation of the breathing mode frequencies make the atomic cloud unstable.
