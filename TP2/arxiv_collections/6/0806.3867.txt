The measurement of Lambda^0 hyperons polarization in nucleus-nucleus
collisions is considered as one of possible tools to study the phase
transition. Fixed target and collider experiments are discussed for the case of
Lambda^0's production from Au-Au central collisions at \sqrt{s_{NN}} of several
GeV.
