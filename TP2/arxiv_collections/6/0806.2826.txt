A novel method for controlling nanowire magnetic properties and growth from
filling time profile is presented.
  The wires are grown with an electrodeposition method ("Template synthesis")
with a wide selection of pore diameters. We show that stray-fields presence in
ferromagnetic nanowires are entirely dependent on the nanowire diameter.
Besides a crossover effect in the reversal mechanism is observed with change in
diameter. In this work, theory and experiment agree and confirm that according
to the variety of hysteresis loop measured, about four ranges of values of pore
diameter control the orientation of nanowire magnetization easy axis with
respect to the geometrical axis.
