The Goldberger-Treiman relation $M=2\pi/\sqrt{3}f^{\rm cl}_\pi$ where $M$ is
the constituent quark mass in the chiral limit (cl) and $f^{\rm cl}_\pi$ the
pion decay constant in the chiral limit predicts constituent quark masses of
$m_u=328.8\pm 1.1$ MeV and $m_d=332.3\pm 1.1$ MeV for the up and down quark,
respectively, when $f^{\rm cl}_\pi=89.8\pm 0.3$ MeV is adopted. Treating the
constituent quarks as bare Dirac particles the following zero order values
$\mu^{(0)}}_p=2.850\pm 0.009$ and $\mu^{(0)}}_n= -1.889\pm 0.006$ are obtained
for the proton and neutron magnetic moments, leading to deviations from the
experimental data of 2.0% and 1.3%, respectively. These unavoidable deviations
are discussed in terms of contributions to the magnetic moments proposed in
previous work.
