We specify the operational semantics and bisimulation relations for the
finite pi-calculus within a logic that contains the nabla quantifier for
encoding generic judgments and definitions for encoding fixed points. Since we
restrict to the finite case, the ability of the logic to unfold fixed points
allows this logic to be complete for both the inductive nature of operational
semantics and the coinductive nature of bisimulation. The nabla quantifier
helps with the delicate issues surrounding the scope of variables within
pi-calculus expressions and their executions (proofs). We illustrate several
merits of the logical specifications permitted by this logic: they are natural
and declarative; they contain no side-conditions concerning names of variables
while maintaining a completely formal treatment of such variables; differences
between late and open bisimulation relations arise from familar logic
distinctions; the interplay between the three quantifiers (for all, exists, and
nabla) and their scopes can explain the differences between early and late
bisimulation and between various modal operators based on bound input and
output actions; and proof search involving the application of inference rules,
unification, and backtracking can provide complete proof systems for one-step
transitions, bisimulation, and satisfaction in modal logic. We also illustrate
how one can encode the pi-calculus with replications, in an extended logic with
induction and co-induction.
