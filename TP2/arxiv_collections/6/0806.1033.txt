When X is a singular complex projective variety, we prove a Kodaira type
vanishing theorem generalizing results of Navarro Aznar and others. This is
proved by extending the Deligne-Illusie decomposition to the Du Bois complex.
We also give a new definition of Frobenius amplitude (introduced in
math.AG/0202129) using ultraproducts.
