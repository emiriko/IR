We study dynamic nonequilibrium electron charging phenomena in ballistic
molecular devices at room temperature that compromise their response to bias
and whose nature is evidently distinguishable from static Schottky-type
potential barriers. Using various metallic/semiconducting carbon nanotubes and
alkane dithiol molecules as active parts of a molecular bridge, we perform
self-consistent quantum transport calculations under the nonequilibrium Green's
function formalism coupled to a three-dimensional Poisson solver for a mutual
description of chemistry and electrostatics. Our results sketch a particular
tracking relationship between the device's local density of states and the
contact electrochemical potentials that can effectively condition the
conduction process by altering the electronic structure of the molecular
system. Such change is unassociated to electronic/phononic scattering effects
while its extent is highly correlated to the conducting character of the
system, giving rise to an increase of the intrinsic resistance of molecules
with a semiconducting character and a symmetric mass-center disposition.
