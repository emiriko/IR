The process of electron-positron pair creation by a high-energy electron in a
medium is analyzed. The spectral distribution over energies of created
particles is calculated for the direct and cascade mechanisms of the process.
The Coulomb corrections are included. The new formulation of the equivalent
photons method is developed which takes into account the influence of multiple
scattering. It is shown the effects of multiple scattering can be quite
effectively studied in the process under consideration.
