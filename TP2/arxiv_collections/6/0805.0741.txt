We report calorimetric, magnetic and electric transport properties of
single-crystal CaRuO3 and SrRuO3 as a function of temperature T and applied
magnetic field B. We find that CaRuO3 is a non-Fermi-liquid metal near a
magnetic instability, as characterized by the following properties: (1) the
heat capacity C(T,B) ~ -T log T is readily enhanced in low applied fields, and
exhibits a Schottky peak at 2.3 K that exhibits field dependence when T is
reduced; (2) the magnetic susceptibility diverges as T^-x at low temperatures
with 1/2 < x < 1, depending on the applied field; and (3) the electrical
resistivity exhibits a T3/2 dependence over the range 1.7 < T < 24 K. No
Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations are discerned at T = 0.65 K for applied fields
up to 45 T. These properties, which sharply contrast those of the itinerant
ferromagnet SrRuO3, indicate CaRuO3 is a rare example of a stoichiometric oxide
compound that exhibits non-Fermi-liquid behavior near a quantum critical point.
