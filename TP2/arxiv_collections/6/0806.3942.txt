Let P be a convex polytope containing the origin, whose dual is a lattice
polytope. Hibi's Palindromic Theorem tells us that if P is also a lattice
polytope then the Ehrhart $\delta$-vector of P is palindromic. Perhaps less
well-known is that a similar result holds when P is rational. We present an
elementary lattice-point proof of this fact.
