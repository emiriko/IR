It is shown on the basis of scaling arguments that a disordered interface
between two elastic solids will quite generally exhibit static and "dry
friction" (i.e., kinetic friction which does not vanish as the sliding velocity
approaches zero), because of Tomlinson model instabilities that occur for small
length scale asperities. This provides a possible explanation for why static
and "dry" friction are virtually always observed, and superlubricity almost
never occurs.
