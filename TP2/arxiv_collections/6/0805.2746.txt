If a stochastic system during some periods of its evolution can be divided
into non-interacting parts, the kinetics of each part can be simulated
independently. We show that this can be used in the development of efficient
Monte Carlo algorithms. As an illustrative example the simulation of
irreversible growth of extended one dimensional islands is considered. The new
approach allowed to simulate the systems characterized by parameters superior
to those used in previous simulations.
