A two-dimensional system of 10000 hard disks with square periodic boundary
conditions, at a density in the middle of the 2-phase region predicted from
equation-of-state data, when subjected to a weak external uniform force, is
seen to phase separate. Thermodynamic profiles of the inhomogeneous two-phase
system agree with the local density approximation (LDA) of density functional
theory. There is no indication of any mesophase.
