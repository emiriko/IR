Kauffman's bracket is an invariant of regular isotopy of knots and links
which since its discovery in 1985 it has been used in many different
directions: (a) it implies an easy proof of the invariance of (in fact, it is
equivalent to) the Jones polynomial; (b) it is the basic ingredient in a
completely combinatorial construction for quantum 3-manifold invariants; (c) by
its fundamental character it plays an important role in some theories in
Physics; it has been used in the context of virtual links; it has connections
with many objects other objects in Mathematics and Physics. I show in this note
that, surprisingly enough, the same idea that produces the bracket can be
slightly modified to produce algebraically stronger regular isotopy and ambient
isotopy invariants living in the quotient ring $R/I$, where the ring $R$ and
the ideal $I$ are: \begin{center} $R=\Z[\alpha,\beta,\delta]$, $I=< p_1, p_2
>$, with $p_1=\alpha^2 \delta + 2 \alpha \beta \delta ^2 -\delta ^2+\beta ^2
\delta, p_2=\alpha \beta \delta
  ^3+\alpha ^2 \delta ^2+\beta
  ^2 \delta ^2+\alpha \beta
  \delta -\delta.$ \end{center} It is easy to prove that any pair of links
distinguished by the usual bracket is also distinguishable by the new
invariant. The contrary is not necessarily true. However, a explicit example of
a pair of knots not distinguished by the bracket and distinguished by this new
invariant is an open problem.
