We attempt a unified treatment of heavy quarkonia and heavy-quark diffusion
in the Quark-Gluon Plasma. Our approach is based on finite-temperature
T-matrices with interaction potentials estimated from the heavy-quark internal
energy computed in thermal lattice QCD (lQCD). In the charmonium sector S-wave
bound states (J/\psi, \eta_c) survive up to temperatures of ~2 T_c, not
inconsistent with constraints from euclidean correlation functions in lQCD. In
the open-heavy flavor sector, the T-matrix interaction reduces heavy-quark
diffusion substantially, leading to fair agreement with single-electron spectra
at RHIC and suggestive for a small viscosity-to-entropy ratio close to T_c.
