In addition to introducing matter injection through a scalar field determined
by Pryce-Hoyle tensor, we also combine it with a BCDE
(Brans-Dicke-Einstein-Cartan) theory with lambdaterm developed earlier by
Berman(2008), for inflationary scenario. It involves a variable cosmological
constant, which decreases with time, jointly with energy density, cosmic
pressure, shear, vorticity, and Hubble's parameter, while the scale factor,
total spin and scalar field increase exponentially. The post-inflationary fluid
resembles a perfect one, though total spin grows, but not the angular speed
(Berman, 2007d). The Pryce-Hoyle tensor, which can measured by the number of
injected particles per unit proper volume and time, as well as shear and
vorticity, can be neglected in the aftermath of inflation ("no-hair").
