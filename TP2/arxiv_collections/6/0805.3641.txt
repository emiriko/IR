We discuss the dynamical generation of some low-lying $1/2^+$ $\Sigma$'s and
$\Lambda$'s in two-meson one-baryon systems. These systems have been
constructed by adding a pion in $S$-wave to the $\bar{K} N$ pair and its
coupled channels, where the $1/2^-$ $\Lambda$(1405)-resonance gets dynamically
generated. We solve Faddeev equations in the coupled-channel approach to
calculate the $T$-matrix for these systems as a function of the total energy
and the invariant mass of one of the meson-baryon pairs. This squared
$T$-matrix shows peaks at the energies very close to the masses of the
strangeness -1, $1/2^+$ resonances listed in the particle data book.
