Sequential techniques can enhance the efficiency of the approximate Bayesian
computation algorithm, as in Sisson et al.'s (2007) partial rejection control
version. While this method is based upon the theoretical works of Del Moral et
al. (2006), the application to approximate Bayesian computation results in a
bias in the approximation to the posterior. An alternative version based on
genuine importance sampling arguments bypasses this difficulty, in connection
with the population Monte Carlo method of Cappe et al. (2004), and it includes
an automatic scaling of the forward kernel. When applied to a population
genetics example, it compares favourably with two other versions of the
approximate algorithm.
