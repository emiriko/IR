We consider the relations $\ge$ and $\ge_p$ on the collection of all knots,
where $k \ge k'$ (respectively, $k \ge_p k'$) if there exists an epimorphism
$\pi k \to \pi k'$ of knot groups (respectively, preserving peripheral
systems). When $k$ is a torus knot, the relations coincide and $k'$ must also
be a torus knot; we determine the knots $k'$ that can occur. If $k$ is a
2-bridge knot and $k \ge_p k'$, then $k'$ is a 2-bridge knot with determinant a
proper divisor of the determinant of $k$; only finitely many knots $k'$ are
possible.
