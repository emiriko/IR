The zero-range process is a stochastic interacting particle system that is
known to exhibit a condensation transition. We present a detailed analysis of
this transition in the presence of quenched disorder in the particle
interactions. Using rigorous probabilistic arguments we show that disorder
changes the critical exponent in the interaction strength below which a
condensation transition may occur. The local critical densities may exhibit
large fluctuations and their distribution shows an interesting crossover from
exponential to algebraic behaviour.
