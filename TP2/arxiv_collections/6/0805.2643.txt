For more than a half century cosmologists have been guided by the assumption
that matter is distributed homogeneously on sufficiently large scales. On the
other hand, observations have consistently yielded evidence for inhomogeneity
in the distribution of matter right up to the limits of most surveys. The
apparent paradox can be understood in terms of the role that paradigms play in
the evolution of science.
