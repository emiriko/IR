The $e$-beam column which is intended on defects inspection is considered.
The defects which are to be examined or potentially might be examined at
inspection stage are briefly considered. Interrelations between the system
parameters is ascertaining and the ways of optimization and the technical
requirements to the system in whole are discussed. As a result, we find the
optimal combinations of the system parameters for the purpose.
