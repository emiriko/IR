We study the classical non-relativistic two-dimensional one-component plasma
at Coulomb coupling Gamma=2 on the Riemannian surface known as Flamm's
paraboloid which is obtained from the spatial part of the Schwarzschild metric.
At this special value of the coupling constant, the statistical mechanics of
the system are exactly solvable analytically. The Helmholtz free energy
asymptotic expansion for the large system has been found. The density of the
plasma, in the thermodynamic limit, has been carefully studied in various
situations.
