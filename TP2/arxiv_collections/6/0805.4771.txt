Transverse momentum spectra up to 4.5 GeV/c were measured around midrapidity
in Pb+Pb reactions at sqrt{s_{NN}}=17.3 GeV, for pi^{+/-}, p, pbar and K^{+/-},
by the NA49 experiment. The nuclear modification factors R_{AA}, R_{AA/pA} and
R_{CP} were extracted and are compared to RHIC results at sqrt{s_{NN}}=200 GeV.
The modification factor R_{AA} shows a rapid increase with transverse momentum
in the covered region. The modification factor R_{CP} shows saturation well
below unity in the pi^{+/-} channel. The extracted R_{CP} values follow the 200
GeV RHIC results closely in the available transverse momentum range for all
particle species. For pi^{+/-} above 2.5 GeV/c transverse momentum, the
measured suppression is smaller than that observed at RHIC. The nuclear
modification factor R_{AA/pA} for pi^{+/-} stays well below unity.
