We briefly report on some recent progress in the computation of B-brane
superpotentials for Type II strings compactified on Calabi-Yau manifolds,
obtained by using a parametrization of tubular neighborhoods of complex
submanifolds, also known as local spaces. In particular, we propose a closed
expression for the superpotential of a brane on a genus-g curve in a Calabi-Yau
threefold in the case in which there exists a holomorphic projection from the
local space around the curve to the curve itself.
