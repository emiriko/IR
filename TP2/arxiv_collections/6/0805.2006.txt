We consider two models with disorder dominated critical points and study the
distribution of clusters which are confined in strips and touch one or both
boundaries. For the classical random bond Potts model in the large-q limit we
study optimal Fortuin-Kasteleyn clusters by combinatorial optimization
algorithm. For the random transverse-field Ising chain clusters are defined and
calculated through the strong disorder renormalization group method. The
numerically calculated density profiles close to the boundaries are shown to
follow scaling predictions. For the random bond Potts model we have obtained
accurate numerical estimates for the critical exponents and demonstrated that
the density profiles are well described by conformal formulae.
