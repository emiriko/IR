We present a coupled Boltzmann and hydrodynamics approach to relativistic
heavy ion reactions. This hybrid approach is based on the Ultra-relativistic
Quantum Molecular Dynamics (UrQMD) transport approach with an intermediate
hydrodynamical evolution for the hot and dense stage of the collision.
Event-by-event fluctuations are directly taken into account via the
non-equilibrium initial conditions generated by the initial collisions and
string fragmentations in the microscopic UrQMD model. After a (3+1)-dimensional
ideal hydrodynamic evolution, the hydrodynamical fields are mapped to hadrons
via the Cooper-Frye equation and the subsequent hadronic cascade calculation
within UrQMD proceeds to incorporate the important final state effects for a
realistic freeze-out. This implementation allows to compare pure microscopic
transport calculations with hydrodynamic calculations using exactly the same
initial conditions and freeze-out procedure. The effects of the change in the
underlying dynamics - ideal fluid dynamics vs. non-equilibrium transport theory
- will be explored. The freeze-out and initial state parameter dependences are
investigated for different observables. Furthermore, the time evolution of the
baryon density and particle yields are discussed. We find that the final pion
and proton multiplicities are lower in the hybrid model calculation due to the
isentropic hydrodynamic expansion while the yields for strange particles are
enhanced due to the local equilibrium in the hydrodynamic evolution. The
results of the different calculations for the mean transverse mass excitation
function, rapidity and transverse mass spectra for different particle species
at three different beam energies are discussed in the context of the available
data.
