A novel way of filling high aspect ratio vertical interconnection (microvias)
with an aspect ratio of >2:1 is presented. High frequency acoustic streaming at
megasonic frequencies enables the decrease of the Nernst-diffusion layer down
to the sub-micron range, allowing thereby conformal electrodeposition in deep
grooves. Higher throughput and better control over the deposition properties
are possible for the manufacturing of interconnections and metal-based MEMS.
