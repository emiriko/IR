SOMIM is an open-source code that implements a Search for Optimal
Measurements by using an Iterative Method. For a given set of statistical
operators, SOMIM finds the POVMs that maximizes the accessed information, and
thus determines the accessible information and one or all of the POVMs that
retrieve it. The maximization procedure is a steepest-ascent method that
follows the gradient in the POVM space, and uses conjugate gradients for
speed-up.
