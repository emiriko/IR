Conformal totally symmetric arbitrary spin currents and shadow fields in flat
space-time of dimension greater than or equal to four are studied. Gauge
invariant formulation for such currents and shadow fields is developed. Gauge
symmetries are realized by involving the Stueckelberg fields. Realization of
global conformal boost symmetries is obtained. Gauge invariant differential
constraints for currents and shadow fields are obtained. AdS/CFT correspondence
for currents and shadow fields and the respective normalizable and
non-normalizable solutions of massless totally symmetric arbitrary spin AdS
fields is studied. The bulk fields are considered in modified de Donder gauge
that leads to decoupled equations of motion. We demonstrate that leftover
on-shell gauge symmetries of bulk fields correspond to gauge symmetries of
boundary currents and shadow fields, while the modified de Donder gauge
conditions for bulk fields correspond to differential constraints for boundary
conformal currents and shadow fields. Breaking conformal symmetries, we find
interrelations between the gauge invariant formulation of the currents and
shadow fields and the gauge invariant formulation of massive fields.
