We study finite two dimensional spin lattices with definite geometry (spin
billiards) demonstrating the display of collective integrable or chaotic
dynamics depending on their shape. We show that such systems can be quantum
simulated by ultra-cold atoms in optical lattices and discuss how to identify
their dynamical features in a realistic experimental setup. Possible
applications are the simulation of quantum information tasks in mesoscopic
devices.
