We study the backreaction on the mean field geometry due to a non-conformal
quantum field in a Robertson-Walker background. In the regime of small mass and
small deviation from conformal coupling, we compute perturbatively the
expectation value of the stress tensor of the field for a variety of vacuum
states, and use it to obtain explicitly the semiclassical gravity solutions for
isotropic perturbations around de Sitter spacetime, which is found to be
stable. Our results show clearly the crucial role of the non-local terms that
appear in the effective action: they cancel the contribution from local terms
proportional to the logarithm of the scale factor which would otherwise become
dominant at late times and prevent the existence of a stable self-consistent de
Sitter solution. Finally, the opposite regime of a strongly non-conformal field
with a large mass is also considered.
