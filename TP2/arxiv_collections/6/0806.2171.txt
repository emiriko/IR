This manual describes the basic objectives, functionalities and uses of the
toolbox for Maple (Maplesoft^TM) called Quantavo. It is intended to facilitate
calculations both symbolically and numerically related to Quantum Optics. In
particular the evolution, measurement and entanglement properties of quantum
states in the Fock basis can be simulated with it. It is provided to the
community as a free open source module.
