Digital video-microscopy measurements are reported of both elastic
bandstructures and overdamped phonon decay times in two-dimensional colloidal
crystals. Both quantities together allow to determine the friction coefficients
along various high symmetry directions in q-space. These coefficients contain
valuable information on the hydrodynamic forces acting between the colloidal
particles. We find Stokes-like friction for phonons near the edge of the first
Brillouin zone and vanishing friction coefficients for long wavelength phonons.
The effect of this wavelength dependence in real-space is further investigated
by simulating a crystal with constant friction (Langevin simulation) and
comparing experimentally measured and simulated particle auto-correlation
functions.
