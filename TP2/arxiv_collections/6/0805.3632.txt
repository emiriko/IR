We study the possibility of testing local realistic theory (LRT), envisioned
implicitly by Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen in 1935, based on the Bell
inequality for the correlations in the decay modes of entangled K or B-mesons.
It is shown that such a test is possible for a restricted class of LRT, despite
the passive nature of decay events and/or the non-unitary treatment of the
correlations which invalidate the test for general LRT. Unfortunately, the
present setup of the KEKB (Belle) experiment, where the coherence of entangled
B-mesons has been confirmed recently, does not admit such a test due to the
inability of determining the decay times of the entangled pairs separately. The
indeterminacy also poses a problem for ensuring the locality of the test,
indicating that improvement to resolve the indeterminacy is crucial for the
test of LRT.
