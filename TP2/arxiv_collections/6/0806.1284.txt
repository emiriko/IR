This paper presents Privilege Calculus (PC) as a new approach of knowledge
representation for Separation of Duty (SD) in the view of process and intents
to improve the reconfigurability and traceability of SD. PC presumes that the
structure of SD should be reduced to the structure of privilege and then the
regulation of system should be analyzed with the help of forms of privilege.
