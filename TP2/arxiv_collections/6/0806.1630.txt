We study thermal leptogenesis from decays of the electroweak triplets that
mediate neutrino masses in type-II and type-III see-saw. We find that
Sommerfeld corrections reduce the baryon asymmetry by ~30%, and that successful
leptogenesis needs triplets heavier than 1.6 TeV, beyond the discovery reach of
LHC.
