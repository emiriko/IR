Boron-doped multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) were synthesized using a
methanol solution of boric acid as a source material. Accurate measurements of
the electrical resistivity of an individual boron-doped MWNT was performed with
a four-point contact, which was fabricated using an electron beam lithography
technique. The doped boron provides conduction carriers, which reduces the
resistivity of the MWNT.
