We present single crystal inelastic neutron scattering measurements of the
S=1 dimerized quasi-two-dimensional antiferromagnet Ba$_3$Mn$_2$O$_8$. The
singlet-triplet dispersion reveals nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor
ferromagnetic interactions between adjacent bilayers that compete against each
other. Although the inter-bilayer exchange is comparable to the intra-bilayer
exchange, this additional frustration reduces the effective coupling along the
c-axis and leads to a quasi-two dimensional behavior. In addition, the obtained
exchange values are able to reproduce the four critical fields in the phase
diagram.
