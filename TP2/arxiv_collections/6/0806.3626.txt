In response to [6], we discover the looked for inversion formula for F-nomial
coefficients. Before supplying its proof, we generalize F-nomial coefficients
to multi F-nomial coefficients and we give their combinatorial interpretation
in cobweb posets language, as the number of maximal-disjoint blocks of the form
sP_{k_1,k_2,...,k_s} of layer <Phi_1-->Phi_n>. Then we present inversion
formula for F-nomial coefficients using multi F-nomial coefficients for all
cobweb-admissible sequences. To this end we infer also some identities as
conclusions of that inversion formula for the case of binomial, Gaussian and
Fibonomial coefficients.
