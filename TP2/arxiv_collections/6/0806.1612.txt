The relaxation of a single knotted ring polymer is studied by Brownian
dynamics simulations. The relaxation rate lambda_q for the wave number q is
estimated by the least square fit of the equilibrium time-displaced correlation
function to a double exponential decay at long times. The relaxation rate
distribution of a single ring polymer with the trefoil knot appears to behave
as lambda_q=A(1/N^)x for q=1 and lambda_q=A'(q/N)^x' for q=2 and 3, where
x=2.61, x'=2.02 and A>A'. The wave number q of the slowest relaxation rate for
each N is given by q=2 for small values of N, while it is given by q=1 for
large values of N. This crossover corresponds to the change of the structure of
the ring polymer caused by the localization of the knotted part to a part of
the ring polymer.
