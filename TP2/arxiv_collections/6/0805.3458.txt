Let $K$ be a one-variable function field over a field of constants of
characteristic 0. Let $R$ be a holomorphy subring of $K$, not equal to $K$. We
prove the following undecidability results for $R$: If $K$ is recursive, then
Hilbert's Tenth Problem is undecidable in $R$. In general, there exist
$x_1,...,x_n \in R$ such that there is no algorithm to tell whether a
polynomial equation with coefficients in $\Q(x_1,...,x_n)$ has solutions in
$R$.
