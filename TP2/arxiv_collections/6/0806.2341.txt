There are many instances when the structure of a weakly-scattering spinning
object in flight must be determined to high resolution. Examples range from
comets to nanoparticles and single molecules. The latter two instances are the
subject of intense current interest. Substantial progress has recently been
made in illuminating spinning single particles in flight with powerful X-ray
bursts to determine their structure with the ultimate goal of determining the
structure of single molecules. However, proposals to reconstruct the molecular
structure from diffraction "snapshots" of unknown orientation require ~1000x
more signal than available from next-generation sources. Using a new approach,
we demonstrate the recovery of the structure of a weakly scattering
macromolecule at the anticipated next-generation X-ray source intensities. Our
work closes a critical gap in determining the structure of single molecules and
nanoparticles by X-ray methods, and opens the way to reconstructing the
structure of spinning, or randomly-oriented objects at extremely low signal
levels. Other potential applications include low-dose electron microscopy,
ultra-low-signal tomography of non-stationary objects without orientational
information, and the study of heavenly bodies.
