The hypergeometric type operators are shape invariant, and a factorization
into a product of first order differential operators can be explicitly
described in the general case. Some additional shape invariant operators
depending on several parameters are defined in a natural way by starting from
this general factorization. The mathematical properties of the eigenfunctions
and eigenvalues of the operators thus obtained depend on the values of the
involved parameters. We study the parameter dependence of orthogonality, square
integrability and of the monotony of eigenvalue sequence. The obtained results
allow us to define certain systems of Gazeau-Klauder coherent states and to
describe some of their properties. Our systematic study recovers a number of
well-known results in a natural unified way and also leads to new findings.
