Efficient and faithful implementation of quantum information tasks, e.g.,
quantum computing, quantum communication and quantum metrology, requires robust
and state-independent decoherence-suppressing measures to protect quantum
information carriers. Here we present an experimental demonstration of a robust
distribution scheme in which one photon of an entangled photon pair is
successfully encoded into and decoded from a decoherence-free subspace (DFS) by
a state-independent scheme. We achieved a high-fidelity distribution of the
entangled state over fibre communication channel, and also demonstrated that
the scheme is robust against fragility of the reference frame. The scheme,
thanks to its state-independence, is also applicable to multipartite case where
the photon to be distributed is entangled with many other photons. Such a
universal scheme opens the possibility of robust distribution of quantum
information among quantum communication and computing networks.
