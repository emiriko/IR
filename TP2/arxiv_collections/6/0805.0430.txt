Carbides stand out because of their high hardness and wear-resistance. Thus
these materials are often discussed for coatings of machine tools etc. Within
this work Boron Carbide (B4C) and Carbide (C) thin films were deposited on Si
(100) substrates by pulsed-laser deposition technique. In order to improve the
wear-resistance of the deposited films, we introduced a new working technique
including the application of a second excimer laser in a special working mode.
Thereby one laser was used to ablate the carbide material from a target and to
deposit the material on the substrate. The light of the second laser was
directed directly onto the substrate in order to modify the ablated material.
We report on details for film deposition and film properties determined by
Scanning Electron Microscope, Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy, X-Ray
Diffraction, Rutherford Backscattering, Raman Spectroscopy and tribological
experiments.
