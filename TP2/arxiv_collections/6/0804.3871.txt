We study the flavour singlet pseudoscalar mesons from first principles using
lattice QCD. With N_f=2 flavours of light quark, this is the so-called eta_2
meson and we discuss the phenomenological status of this. Using maximally
twisted-mass lattice QCD, we extract the mass of the eta_2 meson at two values
of the lattice spacing for lighter quarks than previously discussed in the
literature. We are able to estimate the mass value in the limit of light quarks
with their physical masses.
