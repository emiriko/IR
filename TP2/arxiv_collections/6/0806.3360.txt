In this talk, recent results are presented of calculations of electromagnetic
form factors of hadrons in the framework of two quantum field theories (QFT),
(a) Dual-Large $N_c$ QCD (Dual-$QCD_\infty$) for the pion, proton, and
$\Delta(1236)$, and (b) the Kroll-Lee-Zumino (KLZ) fully renormalizable Abelian
QFT for the pion form factor. Both theories provide a QFT platform to improve
on naive (tree-level) Vector Meson Dominance (VMD). Dual-$QCD_\infty$ provides
a tree-level improvement by incorporating an infinite number of zero-width
resonances, which can be subsequently shifted from the real axis to account for
the time-like behaviour of the form factors. The renormalizable KLZ model
provides a QFT improvement of VMD in the framework of perturbation theory. Due
to the relative mildness of the $\rho\pi\pi$ coupling, and the size of loop
suppression factors, the perturbative expansion is well defined in spite of
this being a strong coupling theory. Both approaches lead to considerable
improvements of VMD predictions for electromagnetic form factors, in excellent
agreement with data.
