A cut ideal of a graph records the relations among the cuts of the graph.
These toric ideals have been introduced by Sturmfels and Sullivant who also
posed the problem of relating their properties to the combinatorial structure
of the graph.
  We study the cut ideals of the family of ring graphs, which includes trees
and cycles. We show that they have quadratic Gr\"obner bases and that their
coordinate rings are Koszul, Hilbertian, and Cohen-Macaulay, but not Gorenstein
in general.
