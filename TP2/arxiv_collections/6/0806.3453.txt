We use angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) to investigate the
electronic properties of the newly discovered iron-arsenic superconductor,
Ba(1-x)K(x)Fe2As2 and non-supercondcuting BaFe2As2. Our study indicates that
the Fermi surface of the undoped, parent compound BaFe$_2$As$_2$ consists of
hole pocket(s) at Gamma (0,0) and larger electron pocket(s) at X (1,0), in
general agreement with full-potential linearized plane wave (FLAPW)
calculations. Upon doping with potassium, the hole pocket expands and the
electron pocket becomes smaller with its bottom approaching the chemical
potential. Such an evolution of the Fermi surface is consistent with hole
doping within a rigid band shift model. Our results also indicate that FLAPW
calculation is a reasonable approach for modeling the electronic properties of
both undoped and K-doped iron arsenites.
