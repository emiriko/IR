The formation of the antihydrogen beam in the AEGIS experiment through the
use of inhomogeneous electric fields is discussed and simulation results
including the geometry of the apparatus and realistic hypothesis about the
antihydrogen initial conditions are shown. The resulting velocity distribution
matches the requirements of the gravity experiment. In particular it is shown
that the inhomogeneous electric fields provide radial cooling of the beam
during the acceleration.
