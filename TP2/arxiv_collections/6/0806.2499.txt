We investigate magnetic properties and statistical effects in 1D strongly
repulsive two-component fermions and in a 1D mixture of strongly repulsive
polarized fermions and bosons. Universality in the characteristics of phase
transitions, magnetization and susceptibility in the presence of an external
magnetic field $H$ are analyzed from the exact thermodynamic Bethe ansatz
solution. We show explicitly that polarized fermions with a repulsive
interaction have antiferromagnetic behavior at zero temperature. A universality
class of linear field-dependent magnetization persists for weak and finite
strong interaction. The system is fully polarized when the external field
exceeds the critical value $H^F_c\approx \frac{8}{\gamma}E_F$, where $E_F$ is
the Fermi energy and $\gamma$ is the dimensionless interaction strength. In
contrast, the mixture of polarized fermions and bosons in an external field
exhibits square-root field-dependent magnetization in the vicinities of H=0 and
the critical value $H=H^M_c\approx \frac{16}{\gamma}E_F$. We find that a pure
boson phase occurs in the absence of the external field, fully-polarized
fermions and bosons coexist for $0<H<H^M_c$, and a fully-polarized fermion
phase occurs for $H\ge H_c^M$. This phase diagram for the Bose-Fermi mixture is
reminiscent of weakly attractive fermions with population imbalance, where the
interacting fermions with opposite spins form singlet pairs.
