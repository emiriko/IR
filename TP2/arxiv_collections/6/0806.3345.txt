Local bond order parameters based on spherical harmonics, also known as
Steinhardt order parameters, are often used to determine crystal structures in
molecular simulations. Here we propose a modification of this method in which
the complex bond order vectors are averaged over the first neighbor shell of a
given particle and the particle itself. As demonstrated using soft particle
systems, this averaging procedure considerably improves the accuracy with which
different crystal structures can be distinguished.
