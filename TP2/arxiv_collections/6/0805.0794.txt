The magnetically ordered, low temperature phase of Ising ferro- magnets is
manifested within the associated Fortuin-Kasteleyn (FK) random cluster
representation by the occurrence of a single positive density percolating
cluster. In this paper, we review our recent work on the percolation signature
for Ising spin glass ordering -- both in the short-range Edwards-Anderson (EA)
and infinite-range Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) models -- within a two-replica
FK representation and also in the different Chayes-Machta-Redner two-replica
graphical representation. Numerical studies of the $\pm J$ EA model in
dimension three and rigorous results for the SK model are consistent in
supporting the conclusion that the signature of spin-glass order in these
models is the existence of a single percolating cluster of maximal density
normally coexisting with a second percolating cluster of lower density.
