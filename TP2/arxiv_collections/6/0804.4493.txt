Dileptons provide direct observables of the electromagnetic current-current
correlator in the hot and/or dense medium formed in heavy-ion collisions. In
this article an overview is given about the status of the theoretical
understanding of the dilepton phenomenology in heavy-ion collisions from
studies of the in-medium properties of hadrons and partons within many-body
theory and about connections to fundamental questions concerning the chiral
phase transition.
