De Haas-van Alphen oscillations were measured in lanthanum tritelluride
(LaTe_3) to probe the partially gapped Fermi surface resulting from charge
density wave (CDW) formation. Three distinct frequencies were observed, one of
which can be correlated with a FS sheet that is unaltered by CDW formation. The
other two frequencies arise from FS sheets that have been reconstructed in the
CDW state.
