We calculate absorptive corrections to single pion exchange in the production
of leading neutrons in pp collisions. Contrary to the usual procedure of
convolving the survival probability with the cross section, we apply
corrections to the spin amplitudes. The non-flip amplitude turns out to be much
more suppressed by absorption than the spin-flip one. We identify the
projectile proton Fock state responsible for the absorptive corrections as a
color octet-octet 5-quarks configuration. Calculations within two very
different models, color-dipole light-cone description, and in hadronic
representation, lead to rather similar absorptive corrections. We found a much
stronger damping of leading neutrons than in some of previous estimates.
Correspondingly, the cross section is considerably smaller than was measured at
ISR. However, comparison with recent measurements by the ZEUS collaboration of
neutron production in deep-inelastic scattering provides a strong motivation
for challenging the normalization of the ISR data. This conjecture is also
supported by preliminary data from the NA49 experiment for neutron production
in pp collisions at SPS.
