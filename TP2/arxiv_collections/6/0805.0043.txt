Employing a nonlinear left-handed transmission line as a model system, we
demonstrate experimentally the multi-stability phenomena predicted
theoretically for microstructured left-handed metamaterials with a nonlinear
response. We show that the bistability is associated with the period doubling
which at higher power may result in chaotic dynamics of the transmission line.
