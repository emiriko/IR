The core mission of universities and higher education institutions is to make
public the results of their work and to preserve the collective memory of the
institution. This includes the effective use of information and communication
technologies (ICT) to systematically compile academic and research achievements
as well as disseminate effectively this accumulated knowledge to society at
large. Current efforts in Latin America and Venezuela in particular, are
limited but provide some valuable insights to pave the road to this important
goal. The institutional repository of Universidad de Los Andes (ULA) in
Venezuela (www.saber.ula.ve) is such an example of ICT usage to store, manage
and disseminate digital material produced by our University. In this paper we
elaborate on the overall process of promoting a culture of content creation,
publishing and preservation within ULA.
