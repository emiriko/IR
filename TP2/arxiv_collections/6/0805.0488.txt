We study cold atomic gases in a disorder potential and analyze the
correlations between different systems subjected to the same disorder
landscape. Such independent copies with the same disorder landscape are known
as replicas. While in general these are not accessible experimentally in
condensed matter systems, they can be realized using standard tools for
controlling cold atomic gases in an optical lattice. Of special interest is the
overlap function which represents a natural order parameter for disordered
systems and is a correlation function between the atoms of two independent
replicas with the same disorder. We demonstrate an efficient measurement scheme
for the determination of this disorder-induced correlation function. As an
application, we focus on the disordered Bose-Hubbard model and determine the
overlap function within perturbation theory and a numerical analysis. We find
that the measurement of the overlap function allows for the identification of
the Bose-glass phase in certain parameter regimes.
