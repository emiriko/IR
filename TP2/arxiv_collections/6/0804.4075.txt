Synaptic weights for neurons in logic programming can be calculated either by
using Hebbian learning or by Wan Abdullah's method. In other words, Hebbian
learning for governing events corresponding to some respective program clauses
is equivalent with learning using Wan Abdullah's method for the same respective
program clauses. In this paper we will evaluate experimentally the equivalence
between these two types of learning through computer simulations.
