We study the dissipation physics of one dimensional mesoscopic
superconducting quantum interference device array by using the
field-theoretical renormalization group method. We observe length scale
dependent superconductor-insulator quantum phase transition at very low
temperature and also observe the dual behaviour of the system for the higher
and lower values of magnetic field. At a critical magnetic field, we also
observe a critical behaviour where the resistance is independent of length.
