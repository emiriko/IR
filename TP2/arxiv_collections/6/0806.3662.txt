We report on the current status of knowledge on inclusive quarkonium
production in high-energy photon-photon collisions. As a perspective for the
LHC, we compute various production cross sections via direct photon-photon
fusion in ultra-peripheral pp, pA and AA collisions at the LHC using the
tree-level quarkonium amplitude generator MadOnia.
