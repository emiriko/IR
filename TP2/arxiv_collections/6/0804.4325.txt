The Statistical Process Control (SPC) and the Automated Process Control (APC)
have a common goal: achieve optimal product quality by controlling variations
in the process. The work in this paper will present a developed integration
methodology of the APC in the SPC which is based on discretization of the
transfer functions relating to each component of the process. We proposed on
the one hand, a new control rule which is based on a system of first order. In
the other hand, we showed how to establish control charts to a process of the
type AR (1). Using simulation experiments, we showed that the proposed control
rule reduced variability by comparing it with that proposed in literature.
