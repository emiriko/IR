Impact processes of nanoclusters subject to thermal fluctuations are
investigated, theoretically. In the former half of the paper, we discuss the
basis of quasi-static theory. In the latter part, we carry out the molecular
dynamics simulation of collisions between two identical nanoclusters, and
report some statistical properties of impacts of nanoclusters.
