We report on the experimental observation of corner surface solitons
localized at the edges joining planar interfaces of hexagonal waveguide array
with uniform nonlinear medium. The face angle between these interfaces has a
strong impact on the threshold of soliton excitation as well as on the light
energy drift and diffraction spreading.
