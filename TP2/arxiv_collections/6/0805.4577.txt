Cachazo-Svrcek-Witten-type Feynman rules for massive matter scalar legs and
pure glue loops are presented, obtained by deriving them directly from the
space-time action. We comment on the derivation and some sample applications,
in particular to calculating one loop effects in pure Yang-Mills theory.
Furthermore, we derive CSW rules for effective Higgs-gluon couplings studied in
the literature. In addition, it is shown how twistor techniques for deriving
canonical field transformations explored for massless scalars extend to
massless fermions.
