It is reasonably well-known that birefringent crystal optics can to some
extent be described by the use of pseudo-Finslerian spacetimes (an extension of
pseudo-Riemannian spacetime). What is less commonly appreciated is that there
are two separate and quite disjoint pseudo-Finsler structures for the two
photon polarizations, and further, that there are separate tangent-space
pseudo-Finsler structures defined by the group velocity and co-tangent-space
pseudo-co-Finsler structures defined by the phase velocity. The
inter-connections between these four separate pseudo-Finsler structures are
rather subtle. One particular source of technical difficulty is the fact that
because physicists need to use pseudo-Finsler structures to describe
propagation of signals, there will be nonzero null vectors in both the tangent
and cotangent spaces -- this causes significant problems in that many of the
mathematical results normally obtained for "usual'' (Euclidean signature)
Finsler structures either do not apply, or require significant modifications to
their formulation. We shall first provide a few basic definitions, and then
present a tutorial outline of the relevant physics of birefringent optics,
explicitly demonstrating the interpretation in terms of pseudo-Finsler
spacetimes. We shall then discuss the tricky issues that arise when trying to
inter-relate the various pseudo-Finsler structures we encounter, and finish by
connecting these technical questions (which of course arise in what is a
physically a very well-understood situation) back to ongoing research into
possible extensions and modifications of general relativity.
