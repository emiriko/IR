This paper reports application of neuro- fuzzy inference system (NFIS) and
self organizing feature map neural networks (SOM) on detection of contact state
in a block system. In this manner, on a simple system, the evolution of contact
states, by parallelization of DDA, has been investigated. So, a comparison
between NFIS and SOM results has been presented. The results show applicability
of the proposed methods, by different accuracy, on detection of contact's
distribution.
