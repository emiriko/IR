Searches for supersymmetry (SUSY) are very important tasks at the Large
Hadron colleder(LHC). If SUSY exists at the TeV scale, clear excess above the
Standard Model (SM) background will be observed. SM background should be
estimated from real data self. In this paper, we descrive the strategy for the
early SUSY searches at the LHC and focus on the data-driven estimation of the
SM background in the early stage of collision.
