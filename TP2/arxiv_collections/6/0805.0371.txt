We study the impact of unparticle physics to the chromomagnetic dipole moment
(CMDM) of the top quark. We compute the effect induced by unparticle operators
of scalar and vector nature coupled to fermions on the CMDM. We find that this
dipole moment is sensitive to the scale dimensions $d_u$ of the unparticle and
the new couplings of the respective effective operators. Using the bounds
imposed on the CMDM by low-energy precision and Tevatron measurements we derive
indirect limits on the unparticle parameter space. In particular, we find that
the scalar-unparticle operator contribution fulfills both constraints for most
of the unparticle parameter space, while the low-energy precision bound on the
CMDM excludes a vector-unparticle contribution for low values of respective
scale dimension $d_u$.
