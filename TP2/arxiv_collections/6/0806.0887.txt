We obtain, analytically, the global negativity, partial $K-$way negativities
(K=2, 3), Wooter's tangle and three tangle for the generic three qubit
canonical state. It is found that the product of global negativity and partial
three way negativity is equal to three tangle, while the partial two way
negativity is related to tangle of qubit pairs. We also calculate similar
quantities for the state canonical to a single parameter (0<q<1) pure state
which is a linear combination of a GHZ state and a W state. In this case for
q=0.62685, the state has zero three tangle and zero three-way negativity,
having only W-like entanglement. The difference between the product of global
and partial three way negativity and three tangle for a given state is a
quantitative measure of two qubit coherences transformed by unitary
transformations on canonical state into three qubit coherences. The global
negativity and partial K-way negativities, obtained by selective partial
transpositions on multi-qubit state operator, satisfy inequalities which for
three qubits are equivalent to CKW (Coffman-Kundu-Wootter) inequality.
