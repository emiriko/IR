In this paper, we investigate the propagation of two-mode spatially
Gaussian-entangled quantum light fields passing through the turbulence
atmosphere. From the propagation formula of the two-mode wave function in the
position representation, we have derived the analytical expressions for the
fidelity, purity and logarithmic negativity (entanglement) of the resulting
quantum state after the long-distance atmospheric transportation. Based on the
derived formulae, the effects of the atmospheric turbulences on the evolutions
of quantum properties of the resulting two-mode quantum state are discussed in
detail under different input parameters of the initial two-mode quantum state.
The results show that the maximal distributing distance of quantum entanglement
is strongly dependent on the atmospheric conditions: when the atmospheric
turbulence becomes stronger and stronger, the maximal distance becomes shorter
and shorter, and both the fidelity and purity decrease quicker and quicker as
functions of propagating distances. Under a certain atmospheric condition, with
the increasing of the input entanglement of the initial two-mode spatially
Gaussian-entangled quantum state, the maximal distributing distance for
preserving the entanglement gradually increases and always has a saturated
(upper) limitation, and both the evolutions of the fidelity and purity are
affected by the input parameters of the initial two-mode quantum state, Finally
the optimal parameters of the input two-mode quantum state with the fixed input
entanglement are discussed in order to obtain the optimal transfer distribution
of the quantum entanglement over a long distance under a certain atmosphere.
Our theoretical results are very helpful for building the distribution of the
quantum entanglement via free-space atmosphere link.
