We performed inelastic neutron scattering experiment to study magnetic
excitation of O$_2$ molecules adsorbed in microporous compound. The
dispersionless excitation with characteristic intensity modulation is observed
at $\hbar \omega = 7.8$ meV at low temperature. The neutron cross section is
explained by spin dimer model with intradimer distance of 3.1 \AA . Anomalous
behaviour in the temperature dependence is discussed in the context of enhanced
magnetoelasticity in the soft framework of O$_2$ molecule.
