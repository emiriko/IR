We report muon spin relaxation measurements on the magnetic structures of
RBaCo_2O_5.5 with R=Y, Tb, Dy, and Ho. Three different phases, one
ferrimagnetic and two antiferromagnetic, are identified below 300 K. They
consist of different ordered spin state arrangements of high-, intermediate-,
and low-spin Co^3+ of CoO_6 octahedra. Phase separation into well separated
regions with different spin state order is observed in the antiferromagnetic
phases. The unusual strongly anisotropic magnetoresistance and its onset at the
FM-AFM phase boundary is explained.
