Over the past years PHOBOS has continued to analyze the large datasets
obtained from the first five runs of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC)
at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The two main analysis streams have been
pursued. The first one aims to obtain a broad and systematic survey of global
properties of particle production in heavy ion collisions. The second class
includes the study of fluctuations and correlations in particle production.
Both type of studies have been performed for a variety of the collision
systems, covering a wide range in collision energy and centrality. The uniquely
large angular coverage of the PHOBOS detector and its ability to measure
charged particles down to very low transverse momentum is exploited. The latest
physics results from PHOBOS, as presented at Quark Matter 2008 Conference, are
contained in this report.
