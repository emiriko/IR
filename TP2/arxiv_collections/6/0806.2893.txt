Coherent Synchrotron Radiation can severely limit the performance of
accelerators designed for high brightness and short bunch length. Examples
include light sources based on ERLs or FELs, and bunch compressors for linear
colliders. In order to better simulate Coherent Synchrotron Radiation, the
established 1-dimensional formalism is extended to work at lower energies, at
shorter bunch lengths, and for an arbitrary configuration of multiple bends.
Wide vacuum chambers are simulated by means of vertical image charges. This
formalism has been implemented in the general beam dynamics code "Bmad" and its
results are here compared to analytical approximations, to numerical solutions
of the Maxwell equations, and to the simulation code "elegant".
