We calculate the oblique electroweak corrections and confront with the
experiments in an extension of the Standard Model. The new fields added are a
vector-like weak doublet and a singlet fermion. After electroweak symmetry
breaking there is a mixing between the components of the new fields, but no
mixing allowed with the standard fermions. Four electroweak parameters,
$\hat{S}$, $\hat{T}$, W, Y are presented in the formalism of Barbieri et al.,
these are the generalization of the Peskin-Takeuchi S, T, U's. The vector-like
extension is slightly constrained, $\hat{T}$ requires the new neutral fermion
masses not to be very far from each other, allowing higher mass difference for
higher masses and smaller mixing. $\hat{S}, W, Y$ gives practically no
constraints on the masses. This extension can give a positive contribution to
$\hat{T} $, allowing a heavy Higgs boson in electroweak precision tests of the
Standard Model.
