We show that quantum interference can be classically interpreted in terms of
a phase invariant quantity, not unlike the Berry's phase. Under this
interpretation, closed loops in time become fundamental quantum entities, and
all quantum states become periodic. Decoherence is then seen to occur naturally
as a consequence. This formalism, although counterintuitive, provides a useful
way of assigning ``classical'' meaning to quantum probabilities.
