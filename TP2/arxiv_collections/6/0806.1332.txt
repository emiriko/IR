We explore the adiabatic particle excitations of an interacting field in a
cosmological background. By following the time-evolution of the quantum state
corresponding to the particle excitation, we show how the basic properties
characterizing the particle propagation can be recovered from the two-point
propagators. As an application, we study the background-induced dissipative
effects on the propagation of a two-level atom in an expanding universe.
