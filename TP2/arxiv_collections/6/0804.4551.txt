A simple and surprisingly accurate description of spectral diffusion in
deeply frozen globular proteins is constructed directly using the concept of
ultrametricity of protein dynamics. Earlier the similar concept has been used
for successful description of ligand-rebinding kinetics of myoglobin at
temperatures about of 200 K. Hence the ultrametricity offers a universal
background for the protein dynamics in a wide range of scales of protein
motions.
