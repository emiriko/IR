A renormalizable coupling between the Higgs and a scalar unparticle operator
O_U of non-integer dimension d_U < 2 gives rise, after electroweak symmetry
breaking, to a mass gap in the unparticle continuum and a shift in the original
Higgs mass, which can end up above or below the mass gap. We show that, besides
the displaced Higgs state, a new isolated state can generically appear in the
spectrum near or below the mass gap. Such state (which we call phantom Higgs)
is a mixture of Higgs and unparticles and therefore has universally reduced
couplings to fermions and gauge bosons. This phenomenon could cause the mass of
the lightest Higgs state accessible to colliders to be much smaller than the
mass expected from the SM Lagrangian.
