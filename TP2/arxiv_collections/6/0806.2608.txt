We address the possible scenario that the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)
discovers only a Higgs boson after 10 fb^{-1} of operation, and attempt to
identify this Higgs boson as that of the Standard Model (SM), the minimal
universal extra dimension model (MUED), the littlest Higgs model with T-parity
(LHT), or the minimal supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), using only the
measurement of the product of gluon-fusion production cross section and the
di-photon branching ratio. In MUED, by decoupling any new physics sufficiently
to evade the discovery reach at the LHC, the deviation of the signal from the
SM is not statistically significant. However, in LHT and MSSM, it is possible
to have a significant deviation in the signal that is consistent with this
"lone Higgs scenario", and, in the case of a very large suppression, we can
distinguish MSSM and LHT before the discovery of any new resonances. Starting
with the lone Higgs scenario and the deviation in this measurement from the
Standard Model prediction (whether or not statistically significant), we offer
tests that may discriminate the models and search strategies of discovering new
physics signatures with increasing integrated luminosity.
