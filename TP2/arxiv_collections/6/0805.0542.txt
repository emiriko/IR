Andreev levels deplete energy states above the superconductive gap, which
leads to the peculiar nonmonotonous crossover in the local density of states of
mesoscopic superconductor/normal-metal/superconductor junctions. This effect is
especially pronounced in the case when the normal metal bridge length is small
compared to the superconductive coherence length. Remarkable property of the
crossover function is that it vanishes not only at the proximity induced gap
but also at the superconductive gap. Analytical expressions for the density of
states at the both gap edges, as well as general structure of the crossover are
discussed.
