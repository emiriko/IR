We analyze the details of mass exchange in the vicinity of the Coulomb
barrier for heavy-ion collisions involving neutron-rich nuclei using the
time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) theory. We discuss the time-dependence of
transfer and show that the potential barriers seen by individual
single-particle states can be considerably different than the effective barrier
for the two interacting nuclei having a single center-of-mass. For this reason
we observe a substantial transfer probability even at energies below the
effective barrier.
