We extend the bimetric description of the Universe to a five-dimensional
framework. Starting from Souriau's work (1964) we use two Robertson-Walker
metrics with an extra term corresponding to the additional Kaluza fifth
dimension. This first order model is limited to zero electric charge and
electromagnetic energy densities. Assuming the massive particles, with positive
or negative mass and energies owing finite lifetimes, it restores the O(3)
symmetry and makes the generalized gauge process to restart. As a consequence
the speed of light tends to zero. We assume the Universe to be closed over all
its dimensions. Then, following an idea introduced in 1994 we describe the
Universe as the two folds cover of a projective space. The arrow of time, mass
and energy inversions arise as consequences of this geometrical hypothesis and
fits the bimetric model. We choose to eliminate the "initial singularity",
replaced by a boundary space, which is found to be euclidean.
