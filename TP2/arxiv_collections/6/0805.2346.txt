We consider a two-dimensional electron gas in the presence of Rashba
spin-orbit coupling, and study the effects of magnetic s-wave impurities and
long-range non-magnetic disorder on the spin-charge dynamics of the system. We
focus on voltage induced spin polarizations and their relation to spin Hall
currents. Our results are obtained using the quasiclassical Green function
technique, and hold in the full range of the disorder parameter $\alpha
p_F\tau$.
