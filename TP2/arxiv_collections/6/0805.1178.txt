The implications of a deformed Heisenberg algebra on the
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker cosmological models are investigated. We consider
the Snyder non-commutative space in which the translation group is undeformed
and the rotational invariance preserved. When this framework is implemented to
one-dimensional systems (which is this case) the modifications are uniquely
fixed up to a sign. A cosmological quantum bounce \`a la loop quantum cosmology
is then obtained. We also get the Randall-Sundrum braneworld scenario and this
way a Snyder-deformed quantum cosmology can be considered as a common
phenomenological description for both theories.
