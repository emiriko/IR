Superconductivity develops from an attractive interaction between itinerant
electrons that creates electron pairs which condense into a macroscopic quantum
state--the superconducting state. On the other hand, magnetic order in a metal
arises from electrons localized close to the ionic core and whose interaction
is mediated by itinerant electrons. The dichotomy between local moment magnetic
order and superconductivity raises the question of whether these two states can
coexist and involve the same electrons. Here we show that the single
4f-electron of cerium in CeRhIn5 simultaneously produces magnetism,
characteristic of localization, and superconductivity that requires itinerancy.
The dual nature of the 4f-electron allows microscopic coexistence of
antiferromagnetic order and superconductivity whose competition is tuned by
small changes in pressure and magnetic field. Electronic duality contrasts with
conventional interpretations of coexisting spin-density magnetism and
superconductivity and offers a new avenue for understanding complex states in
classes of materials.
