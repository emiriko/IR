Here we report the superconductivity in the LaFeAsO1-xFx system prepared by
high pressure synthesis. The highest onset superconducting transition
temperature (Tc) in this La-based system is 41.0 K with the nominal composition
of LaFeAsO1-xFx (x = 0.6), which is higher than that reported previously by
ambient pressure synthesis. The increase of Tc can be attributed to the further
shrinkage of crystal lattice that causes the stronger chemical pressure on the
Fe-As plane, which is induced by the increased F-doping level under high
pressure synthesis.
