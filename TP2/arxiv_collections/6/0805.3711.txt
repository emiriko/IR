We study two trapped ions coupled to the axial phonon modes of a
one-dimensional Coulomb crystal. This system is formally equivalent to the "two
spin-boson" model. We propose a scheme to dynamically generate a maximally
entangled state of two ions within a decoherence-free subspace. Here the
phononic environment of the trapped ions, whatever its temperature and number
of modes, serves as the entangling bus. The efficient production of the pure
singlet state can be exploited to perform short-ranged quantum communication
which is essential in building up a large-scale quantum computer.
