We have synthesized a new spinel oxide LiRh2O4 with a mixed-valent
configuration of Rh3+ and Rh4+. At room temperature it is a paramagnetic metal,
but on cooling, a metal-insulator transition occurs and a valence bond solid
state is formed below 170 K. We argue that the formation of valence bond solid
is promoted by a band Jahn-Teller transition at 230 K and the resultant
confinement of t2g holes within the xy band. The band Jahn-Teller instability
is also responsible for the observed enhanced thermoelectric power in the
orbital disordered phase above 230 K.
