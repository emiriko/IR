We study the production of $Z^\pm(4430)$ at a nucleon-antinucleon scattering
experiment. Considering the PANDA experiment to be an ideal platform to explore
the production of the charmonium and charmonim-like states, we suggest the
forthcoming PANDA experiment to pay attention to the production of
$Z^\pm(4430)$.
