In this paper, we construct a lattice formulation for two-dimensional N=(2,2)
supersymmetric gauge theory with matter fields in the fundamental
representation. We first construct it by the orbifolding procedure from
Yang-Mills matrix theory with eight supercharges. We show that we can obtain
the same lattice formulation by extending the geometrical discretization
scheme. This suggests that the equivalence between the two schemes holds even
for theories with matter fields.
