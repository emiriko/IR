The paper introduces a new technique for compressing Binary Decision Diagrams
in those cases where random access is not required. Using this technique,
compression and decompression can be done in linear time in the size of the BDD
and compression will in many cases reduce the size of the BDD to 1-2 bits per
node. Empirical results for our compression technique are presented, including
comparisons with previously introduced techniques, showing that the new
technique dominate on all tested instances.
