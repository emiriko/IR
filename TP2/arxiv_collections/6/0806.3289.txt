We model massive compact objects in galactic nuclei as stationary,
axially-symmetric naked singularities in the Einstein-massless scalar field
theory and study the resulting gravitational lensing. In the weak deflection
limit we study analytically the position of the two weak field images, the
corresponding signed and absolute magnifications as well as the centroid up to
post-Newtonian order. We show that there are a static post-Newtonian
corrections to the signed magnification and their sum as well as to the
critical curves, which are function of the scalar charge. The shift of the
critical curves as a function of the lens angular momentum is found, and it is
shown that they decrease slightingly for the weakly naked and vastly for the
strongly naked singularities with the increase of the scalar charge. The
point-like caustics drift away from the optical axis and do not depend on the
scalar charge. In the strong deflection limit approximation we compute
numerically the position of the relativistic images and their separability for
weakly naked singularities. All of the lensing quantities are compared to
particular cases as Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes as well as
Janis--Newman--Winicour naked singularities.
