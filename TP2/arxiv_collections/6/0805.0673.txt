Leakage current behavior of (BiFeO3)m(SrTiO3)m superlattice structures was
studied and analyzed at different temperatures (303-473K) in the light of
various models. While bulk limited Poole-Frenkel emission was observed to
dominate the leakage current in the temperature range of 303 - 383 K, the space
charge limited conduction was observed up to 473 K. With a Poole-Frenkel
emission type of conduction, the activation energy range of 0.06 - 0.2 eV was
calculated. The physical parameters, calculated from the analysis correlates
with the intrinsic properties. The analysis of leakage current facilitates,
interface engineering of heterostructures for device applications.
