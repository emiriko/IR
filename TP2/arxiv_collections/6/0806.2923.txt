This article extends the idea of solving parity games by strategy iteration
to non-deterministic strategies: In a non-deterministic strategy a player
restricts himself to some non-empty subset of possible actions at a given node,
instead of limiting himself to exactly one action. We show that a
strategy-improvement algorithm by by Bjoerklund, Sandberg, and Vorobyov can
easily be adapted to the more general setting of non-deterministic strategies.
Further, we show that applying the heuristic of "all profitable switches" leads
to choosing a "locally optimal" successor strategy in the setting of
non-deterministic strategies, thereby obtaining an easy proof of an algorithm
by Schewe. In contrast to the algorithm by Bjoerklund et al., we present our
algorithm directly for parity games which allows us to compare it to the
algorithm by Jurdzinski and Voege: We show that the valuations used in both
algorithm coincide on parity game arenas in which one player can "surrender".
Thus, our algorithm can also be seen as a generalization of the one by
Jurdzinski and Voege to non-deterministic strategies. Finally, using
non-deterministic strategies allows us to show that the number of improvement
steps is bound from above by O(1.724^n). For strategy-improvement algorithms,
this bound was previously only known to be attainable by using randomization.
