Characteristic signatures of statistical Coulomb fragmentation of highly
excited nuclear systems were analyzed. It was found that in some important
aspects, they coincide with perceived signatures of phase transitions in
confined hypothetical pseudo-microcanonical systems, thus potentially giving
rise to a false interpretation of experimental observations in terms of phase
transitions. It is demonstrated that the heat capacity as derived based on
experimental observations may show domains of faux negative heat capacity for
the same fundamental reason a faux negative heat capacity appears in
constrained numerical modeling of phase transitions in excited nuclear matter,
the reason being an effective truncation of the microcanonical phase space.
Similarly, selected experimental data may exhibit bimodality apparently in
accordance with the truncated pseudo-microcanonical (but not the true
microcanonical) calculations for confined systems.
