We study the energy distributions of dipion transitions $\Upsilon(5S)$ to
$\Upsilon(1S,2S,3S)\pi^+\pi^-$ in the final state rescattering model. Since the
$\Upsilon(5S)$ is well above the open bottom thresholds, the dipion transitions
are expected to mainly proceed through the real processes $\Upsilon(5S)\to
B^{(*)}\bar{B}^{(*)}$ and $B^{(*)}\bar{B}^{(*)}\to
\Upsilon(1S,2S,3S)\pi^+\pi^-$. We find that the energy distributions of
$\Upsilon(1S,2S,3S)\pi^+\pi^-$ markedly differ from that of $\Upsilon(5S)\to
B^{(*)}\bar{B}^{(*)}$. In particular, the resonance peak will be pushed up by
about 7-20 MeV for these dipion transitions relative to the main hadronic decay
modes. These predictions can be used to test the final state rescattering
mechanism in hadronic transitions for heavy quarkonia above the open flavor
thresholds.
