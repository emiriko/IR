This paper presents one approach in designing a Fire Fighting Robot which has
been contested annually in a robotic student competition in many countries
following the rules initiated at the Trinity College. The approach makes use of
computer simulation and animation in a virtual reality environment. In the
simulation, the amount of time, starting from home until the flame is
destroyed, can be confirmed. The efficacy of algorithms and parameter values
employed can be easily evaluated. Rather than spending time building the real
robot in a trial and error fashion, now students can explore more variation of
algorithm, parameter and sensor-actuator configuration in the early stage of
design. Besides providing additional excitement during learning process and
enhancing students understanding to the engineering aspects of the design, this
approach could become a useful tool to increase the chance of winning the
contest.
