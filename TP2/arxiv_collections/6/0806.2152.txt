We study theoretically the plasmon scattering at the intersection of two
metallic carbon nanotubes. We demonstrate that for a small angle of crossing,
$\theta \ll 1$, the transmission coefficient is an oscillatory function of
$\lambda/\theta$, where $\lambda$ is the interaction parameter of the Luttinger
liquid in an individual nanotube. We calculate the tunnel density of states,
$\nu(\omega,x)$, as a function of energy, $\omega$, and distance, $x$, from the
intersection. In contrast to a single nanotube, we find that, in the geometry
of crossed nanotubes, conventional "rapid" oscillations in $\nu(\omega,x)$ due
to the plasmon scattering acquire an aperiodic "slow-breathing" envelope which
has $\lambda/\theta$ nodes.
