We performed a massive study of the dynamics of group deliberation among
several websites containing millions of opinions on topics ranging from books
to media. Contrary to the common phenomenon of group polarization observed
offline, we measured a strong tendency towards moderate views in the course of
time. This phenomenon possibly operates through a self-selection bias whereby
previous comments and ratings elicit contrarian views that soften the previous
opinions.
