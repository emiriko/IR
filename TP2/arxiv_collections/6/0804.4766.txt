We propose a quantum description of the cooling of a micromechanical flexural
oscillator by a one-dimensional transmission line resonator via a force that
resembles cavity radiation pressure. The mechanical oscillator is capacitively
coupled to the central conductor of the transmission line resonator. At the
optimal point, the micromechanical oscillator can be cooled close to the ground
state, and the cooling can be measured by homodyne detection of the output
microwave signal.
