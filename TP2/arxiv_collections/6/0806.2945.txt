The tensor polarisation of omega mesons produced in the pd-->3He+omega
reaction has been studied at two energies near threshold. The 3He nuclei were
detected in coincidence with the pi0pi+pi- or pi0gamma decay products of the
omega. In contrast to the case of phi meson production, the omega mesons are
found to be unpolarised. This brings into question the applicability of the
Okubo-Zweig-Iizuka rule when comparing the production of vector mesons in low
energy hadronic reactions.
