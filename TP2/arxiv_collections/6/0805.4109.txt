Two wire mesh tomography devices and a liquid collector were used to study
the influence of the gas flow rate on liquid distribution when fluids
distribution on top of the reactor is ensured by a perforated plate. In
opposition to most of the studies realized by other authors, conditions in
which the gas has a negative impact in liquid distribution were evidenced.
Indeed, the obtained results show that the influence of gas flow rate depends
on the quality of the initial distribution, as the gas forces the liquid to
"respect" the distribution imposed at the top of the reactor. Finally, a
comparison between the two measuring techniques shows the limitations of the
liquid collector and the improper conclusions to which its use could lead.
