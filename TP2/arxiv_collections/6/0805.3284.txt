The dynamics of a "peeling front" or an elastic line is studied under creep
(constant load) conditions. Our experiments show an exponential dependence of
the creep velocity on the inverse force (mass) applied. In particular, the
dynamical correlations of the avalanche activity are discussed here. We compare
various avalanche statistics to those of a line depinning model with non-local
elasticity, and study various measures of the experimental avalanche-avalanche
and temporal correlations such as the autocorrelation function of the released
energy and aftershock activity. From all these we conclude, that internal
avalanche dynamics seems to follow "line depinning" -like behavior, in rough
agreement with the depinning model. Meanwhile, the correlations reveal subtle
complications not implied by depinning theory. Moreover, we also show how these
results can be understood from a geophysical point of view.
