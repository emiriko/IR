Muon spin relaxation (MuSR) measurements in iron oxy-pnictide systems have
revealed: (1) commensurate long-range order in undoped LaOFeAs; (2) Bessel
function line shape in La(O0.97F0.03)FeAs which indicates possible
incommensurate or stripe magnetism; (3) anomalous weak magnetism existing in
superconducting LaOFeP, Ce(O0.84F0.16)FeAs, and Nd(O0.88F0.12)FeAs but absent
in superconducting La(O0.92F0.08)FeAs; and (4) scaling of superfluid density
and Tc in the Ce, La, and Nd-FeAs superconductors following a nearly linear
relationship found in cuprates.
