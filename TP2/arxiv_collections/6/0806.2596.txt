Here we show how to generate a dark two-mode squeezed state of a trapped ion,
employing a three-level ion in a V configuration with a strong decay of the
excited states. The degree of squeezing can be manipulated by choosing the
intensity of the driving fields. Our scheme is robust against the usual
dissipation mechanism and could be implemented with present-day technology. The
validity of the approximations employed in this work was tested by numerical
calculations, which agreed completely with the analytical solutions.
