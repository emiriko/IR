We study randomized variants of two classical algorithms: coordinate descent
for systems of linear equations and iterated projections for systems of linear
inequalities. Expanding on a recent randomized iterated projection algorithm of
Strohmer and Vershynin for systems of linear equations, we show that, under
appropriate probability distributions, the linear rates of convergence (in
expectation) can be bounded in terms of natural linear-algebraic condition
numbers for the problems. We relate these condition measures to distances to
ill-posedness, and discuss generalizations to convex systems under metric
regularity assumptions.
