We explain the rotational Doppler effect associated with light beams carrying
with orbital angular momentum in left-handed materials (LHMs). We demonstrate
that the rotational Doppler effect in LHMs is unreversed, which is
significantly different from the linear Doppler effect. The physics underlying
this intriguing effect is the combined contributions of negative phase velocity
and inverse screw of wave-front. In the normal dispersion region, the
rotational Doppler effect induces a upstream energy flow but a downstream
momentum flow. In the anomalous dispersion region, however, the rotational
Doppler effect produces a downstream energy flow but a upstream momentum flow.
We theoretically predict that the rotational Doppler effect can induce a
transfer of angular momentum of the LHM to orbital angular momentum of the
beam.
