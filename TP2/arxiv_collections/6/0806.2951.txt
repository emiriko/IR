An analysis of electron transport in graphene is presented in the presence of
various arrangement of delta-function like magnetic barriers. The motion
through one such barrier gives an unusual non specular refraction leading to
asymmetric transmission. The symmetry is restored by putting two such barriers
in opposite direction side by side. Periodic arrangements of such barriers can
be used as Bragg reflectors whose reflectivity has been calculated using a
transfer matrix formalism. Such Bragg reflectors can be used to make resonant
cavities. We also analyze the associated band structure for the case of
infinite periodic structures.
