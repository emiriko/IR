The difference between surface and deep structures of a spreadsheet is a
major cause of difficulty in checking spreadsheets. After a brief survey of
current methods of checking (or debugging) spreadsheets, new visual methods of
showing the deep structures are presented. Illustrations are given on how these
visual methods can be employed in various interactive local and global
debugging strategies.
