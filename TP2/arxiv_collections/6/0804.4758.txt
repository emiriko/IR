We propose an efficient numerical scheme, based on the method of lines, for
solving the Landau-de Gennes equations describing the relaxational dynamics of
nematic liquid crystals. Our method is computationally easy to implement,
balancing requirements of efficiency and accuracy. We benchmark our method
through the study of the following problems: the isotropic-nematic interface,
growth of nematic droplets in the isotropic phase and the kinetics of
coarsening following a quench into the nematic phase. Our results, obtained
through solutions of the full coarse-grained equations of motion with no
approximations, provide a stringent test of the de Gennes ansatz for the
isotropic - nematic interface, illustrate the anisotropic character of droplets
in the nucleation regime and validate dynamical scaling in the coarsening
regime.
