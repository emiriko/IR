The principal sigma model and Abelian gauge fields coupling is studied. By
expressing the first-order formulation of the gauge field equations an implicit
on-shell scalar-gauge field decoupling structure is revealed. It is also shown
that due to this decoupling structure the scalars of the theory belong to the
pure sigma model and the gauge fields sector consists of a number of coupled
Maxwell theories with currents partially induced by the scalars.
