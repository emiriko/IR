The nature of the interplay between superconductivity and magnetism in the
cuprates remains one of the fundamental unsolved problems in high temperature
superconductivity. Whether and how these two phenomena are interdependent is
perhaps most sharply seen in the stripe phases of various copper-oxide
materials. These phases, involving a mixture of spin and charge density waves,
do not yet admit a complete, overarching theoretical treatment. However aspects
of this problem can be analyzed. In this work, we focus on the magnetic side of
stripe physics. To this end, we study a simple model of a stripe-ordered phase
consisting of an array of alternating coupled doped and undoped two-leg
Hubbard-like ladders. To obtain the magnetic response, we employ already
available dynamical susceptibilities of the individual two-leg ladders and
treat the interladder coupling in a random phase approximation. Strikingly, we
find two possible scenarios for the ordered state induced by the coupling
between ladders: the spin modulation can occur either along or perpendicular to
the direction of the stripes. These two scenarios are differentiated according
to different microscopic realizations of the component doped ladders. However
inelastic neutron scattering experiments on the two stripe ordered cuprates,
La_{1.875}Ba_{0.125}CuO_4 and La_{2-x}Sr_xCuO_4, do not readily distinguish
between these two scenarios due to manner in which stripes form in these
materials.
