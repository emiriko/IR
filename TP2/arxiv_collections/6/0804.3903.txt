Solutions for the fields in a coated cylinder where the core radius is bigger
than the shell radius are seemingly unphysical, but can be given a physical
meaning if one transforms to an equivalent problem by unfolding the geometry.
In particular the unfolded material can act as an impedance matched hyperlens,
and as the loss in the lens goes to zero finite collections of polarizable line
dipoles lying within a critical region surrounding the hyperlens are shown to
be cloaked having vanishingly small dipole moments. This cloaking, which occurs
both in the folded geometry and the equivalent unfolded one, is due to
anomalous resonance, where the collection of dipoles generates an anomalously
resonant field, which acts back on the dipoles to essentially cancel the
external fields acting on them.
