We investigate the leading one-loop Yukawa corrections to the process pp-> b
anti-b H in the Standard Model. We find that the next-to-leading order
correction to the cross section is small about -4% if the Higgs mass is 120GeV.
However, the appearance of leading Landau singularity when $M_H > 2M_W$ can
lead to a large correction at the next-to-next-to-leading order level for a
Higgs mass around 160GeV.
