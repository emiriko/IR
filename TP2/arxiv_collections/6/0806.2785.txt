Resonant scattering of electrons with low energies (as compared to the
bandwidth) on a single neutral short-range impurity in graphene is analyzed
theoretically, taking into account the valley degeneracy. Resonances
dramatically increase the scattering cross-section and introduce a strong
energy dependence. Analysis of the tight-binding model shows that resonant
scattering is typical for generic impurities as long as they are sufficiently
strong (the potential is of the order of the electron bandwidth or higher).
