Quantum critical systems out of equilibrium are of extensive interest, but
are difficult to study theoretically. We consider here the steady state limit
of a single electron transistor, which is attached to ferromagnetic leads and
subjected to a finite bias voltage (V). In equilibrium (i.e., V=0), this system
undergoes a continuous quantum phase transition with a critical destruction of
the Kondo effect. We construct an exact quantum Boltzmann treatment in a
dynamical large-N limit, and determine the universal scaling functions for the
I-V characteristics covering both the linear and non-linear regimes. We also
elucidate the scaling properties of both the fluctuation-dissipation ratios and
the decoherence properties as encoded in the local spin response.
