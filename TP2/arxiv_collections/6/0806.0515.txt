Systematic study of electrical resistivity of Hf_{100-x}Fe_x (x=20,25),
Hf_{100-x}Cu_x (x=30,40,50), and Ti_{65}Cu_{35} metallic glasses has been done
in the temperature range 0.3 K - 290 K, and in magnetic fields B <= 5 T. All
Hf-base alloys are superconducting with T_c >= 0.44 K, which is well above T_c
of pure crystalline Hf (0.13 K). From the initial slopes of the upper critical
fields, (dH_{c2}/dT)_{T_c}, and resistivities we determined the dressed
electronic densities of states, N_{\gamma}(E_F), for all alloys. Both T_c and
N_{\gamma}(E_F) decrease with increasing x (Fe and Cu content). The results are
compared with those for corresponding Zr-base metallic glasses and
ion-implanted Hf films.
