Recent advances in photon detectors have resulted in high-density imaging
arrays that offer many performance and cost advantages. In particular, the
excellent transit time spread of certain devices show promise to provide
tangible benefits in applications such as Positron Emission Tomography (PET).
Meanwhile, high-density, high-performance readout techniques have not kept on
pace for exploiting these developments. Photodetector readout for next
generation high event rate particle identification and time-resolved PET
requires a highly-integrated, low-power, and cost-effective readout technique.
We propose fast waveform sampling as a method that meets these criteria and
demonstrate that sub-10ps resolution can be obtained for an existing device.
