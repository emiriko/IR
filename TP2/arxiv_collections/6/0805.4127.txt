In this paper, based on a weighted projection of bipartite user-object
network, we introduce a personalized recommendation algorithm, called the
\emph{network-based inference} (NBI), which has higher accuracy than the
classical algorithm, namely \emph{collaborative filtering}. In the NBI, the
correlation resulting from a specific attribute may be repeatedly counted in
the cumulative recommendations from different objects. By considering the
higher order correlations, we design an improved algorithm that can, to some
extent, eliminate the redundant correlations. We test our algorithm on two
benchmark data sets, \emph{MovieLens} and \emph{Netflix}. Compared with the
NBI, the algorithmic accuracy, measured by the ranking score, can be further
improved by 23% for \emph{MovieLens} and 22% for \emph{Netflix}, respectively.
The present algorithm can even outperform the \emph{Latent Dirichlet
Allocation} algorithm, which requires much longer computational time.
Furthermore, most of the previous studies considered the algorithmic accuracy
only, in this paper, we argue that the diversity and popularity, as two
significant criteria of algorithmic performance, should also be taken into
account. With more or less the same accuracy, an algorithm giving higher
diversity and lower popularity is more favorable. Numerical results show that
the present algorithm can outperform the standard one simultaneously in all
five adopted metrics: lower ranking score and higher precision for accuracy,
larger Hamming distance and lower intra-similarity for diversity, as well as
smaller average degree for popularity.
