The use of computational intelligence techniques for classification has been
used in numerous applications. This paper compares the use of a Multi Layer
Perceptron Neural Network and a new Relational Network on classifying the HIV
status of women at ante-natal clinics. The paper discusses the architecture of
the relational network and its merits compared to a neural network and most
other computational intelligence classifiers. Results gathered from the study
indicate comparable classification accuracies as well as revealed relationships
between data features in the classification data. Much higher classification
accuracies are recommended for future research in the area of HIV
classification as well as missing data estimation.
