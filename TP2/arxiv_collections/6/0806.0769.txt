There is a major need to better constrain nuclear parton densities in order
to provide reliable perturbative QCD predictions at the LHC as well as to probe
possible non-linear evolution at small values of x. In these proceedings, we
discuss how the production of prompt photons at large rapidity in p-p and d-Au
collisions at RHIC (sqrt(s_NN)=200 GeV) is sensitive to the nuclear
modifications of gluon distributions at x~0.001 and at rather low scales,
Q^2~10 GeV^2. The nuclear production ratio, R_dAu=sigma(d+A->gamma+X)/(2A
sigma(p+p->gamma X), is computed for isolated prompt photons at NLO using the
nDSg nuclear parton densities, in order to assess the visibility of the signal.
We also emphasise that the expected counting rates in a year of running at RHIC
are large, indicating that R_dAu could be measured with a high statistical
accuracy.
