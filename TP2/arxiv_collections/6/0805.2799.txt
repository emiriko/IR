In this paper we develop an approach to soft scattering processes at high
energies,which is based on two mechanisms: Good-Walker mechanism for low mass
diffractionand multi-Pomeron interactions for high mass diffraction. The
pricipal idea, that allows us to specify the theory for Pomeron interactions,
is that the so called soft processes occur at rather short distances
  ($r^2 \propto 1 /<p_t>^2 \propto \alpha'_\pom \approx 0.01 GeV^{-2}$), where
perturbative QCD is valid. The value of the Pomeron slope $\alpha'_\pom $ was
obtained from the fit to experimental data. Using this theoretical approach we
suggest a model that fits all soft data in the ISR-Tevatron energy range, the
total, elastic, single and double diffractive cross sections, including $t$
dependence of the differential elastic cross section, and the mass dependence
of single diffraction. In this model we calculate the survival probability of
diffractive Higgs production, and obtained a value for this observable, which
is smaller than 1% at the LHC energy range.
