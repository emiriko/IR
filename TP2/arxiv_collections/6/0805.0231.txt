We combine a refined version of two-point step-size adaptation with the
covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES). Additionally, we
suggest polished formulae for the learning rate of the covariance matrix and
the recombination weights. In contrast to cumulative step-size adaptation or to
the 1/5-th success rule, the refined two-point adaptation (TPA) does not rely
on any internal model of optimality. In contrast to conventional
self-adaptation, the TPA will achieve a better target step-size in particular
with large populations. The disadvantage of TPA is that it relies on two
additional objective function
