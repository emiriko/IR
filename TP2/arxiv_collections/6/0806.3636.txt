A white noise quantum stochastic calculus is developped using classical
measure theory as mathematical tool. Wick's and Ito's theorems have been
established. The simplest quantum stochastic differential equation has been
solved, unicity and the conditions for unitarity have been proven. The
Hamiltonian of the associated one parameter strongly continuous group has been
calculated explicitely.
