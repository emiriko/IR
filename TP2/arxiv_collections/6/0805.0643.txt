The complete list of electroweak chiral Lagrangian for W', Z' and a neutral
light higgs with symmetry $SU(2)_1\otimes SU(2)_2\otimes U(1)$ is provided. The
bosonic part is accurate up to order of $p^4$, the matter part involving
various fermions representation arrangements includes dimension three Yukawa
type and dimension four gauge type operators. The universal mixings and masses
of gauge boson and fermion are given. Constraints from mass differences for
$K^0-\bar{K}^0$, $B_d^0-\bar{B}_{d}^0$, $B_s^0-\bar{B}_{s}^0$ systems and
indirect CP violation parameter $|\epsilon_K|$ for $K$ mesons are evaluated.
