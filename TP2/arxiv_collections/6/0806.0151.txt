This paper gives an overview of recent results concerning the long time
dynamics of repeated interaction quantum systems in a deterministic and random
framework. We describe the non equilibrium steady states (NESS) such systems
display and we present, as a macroscopic consequence, a second law of
thermodynamics these NESS give rise to. We also explain in some details the
analysis of products of certain random matrices underlying this dynamical
problem.
