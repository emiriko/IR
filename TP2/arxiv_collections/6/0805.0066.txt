The damage growth and surface modifications in Si(100), induced by 25 keV
Si$_5^-$ cluster ions, as a function of fluence, $\phi$, has been studied using
atomic force microscopy (AFM) and channeling Rutherford backscattering
spectrometry (CRBS). CRBS results indicate a nonlinear growth in damage from
which it has been possible to get a threshold fluence, $\phi_0$, for
amorphization as $2.5\times 10^{13}$ ions-cm$^{-2}$. For $\phi$ below $\phi_0$,
a growth in damage as well as surface roughness has been observed. At a $\phi$
of $1\times 10^{14}$ ions-cm$^{-2}$, damage saturation coupled with a much
reduced surface roughness has been found. In this case a power spectrum
analysis of AFM data showed a significant drop, in spectral density, as
compared to the same obtained for a fluence, $\phi < \phi_0$. This drop,
together with damage saturation, can be correlated with a transition to a
stress relaxed amorphous phase. Irradiation with similar mass Cs$^-$ ions, at
the same energy and fluence, has been found to result in a reduced accumulation
of defects in the near surface region leading to reduced surface features.
