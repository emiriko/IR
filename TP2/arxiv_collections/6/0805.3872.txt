We calculate the vector spin chirality for $S=1/2$ zigzag spin chains having
U(1) symmetry, using the density matrix renormalization group combined with
unitary transformation. We then demonstrate the occurrence of the chiral order
for the zigzag XY chain and discuss the associated phase transition. The
results are consistent with the analysis based on the bosonization and the long
distance behaviour of the chirality correlation function. For the $S=1/2$
zigzag Heisenberg chain in a magnetic field, we also verify the chiral order
that is predicted by the effective field theory and the chirality correlation
function, and then determine its magnetic phase diagram.
