Electric transport measurements of the charge frustrated LuFe2O4, in which
the charge ordering (CO) and electronic ferroelectricity are found, reveal
strong nonlinear electric conduction upon application of electrical field in
both single crystalline and polycrystalline samples. The threshold electric
fields (Et) in single crystalline LuFe2O4 are estimated respectively to be
about 60V/cm and 10V/cm with E parallel and perpendicular to the c-axis
direction. Experimental measurements also demonstrate that the I-V nonlinearity
increases quickly with lowering temperature. Furthermore, our in-situ TEM
investigations evidently reveal that the nonlinear I-V behavior is
intrinsically in correlation with a current driven charge ordering
insulator-metal transition, and the applied electrical field triggers a visible
CO collapse recognizable as the fading of satellite spots of the CO
modulations.
