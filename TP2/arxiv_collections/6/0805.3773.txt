We report a high-statistics measurement of the branching fraction for tau^-
--> pi^- pi^0 nu_tau and the invariant mass spectrum of the produced pi^- pi^0
system using 72.2 fb^-1 of data recorded with the Belle detector at the KEKB
asymmetric-energy e^+ e^- collider. The branching fraction obtained is (25.24
+/- 0.01 +/- 0.39)%, where the first error is statistical and the second is
systematic. The unfolded pi^- pi^0 mass spectrum is used to determine resonance
parameters for the rho(770), rho'(1450), and rho"(1700) mesons. We also use
this spectrum to estimate the hadronic (2pi) contribution to the anomalous
magnetic moment of the muon (a_{mu}^{pipi}). Our result for a_{mu}^{pipi}
integrated over the mass range sqrt{s} = 2m_{pi} - 1.8 GeV/c^2 is a_{mu}^{pipi}
= (523.5 +/- 1.5 (exp) +/- 2.6 (Br) +/- 2.5 (isospin))x 10^{-10}, where the
first error is due to the experimental uncertainties, the second is due to the
uncertainties in the branching fractions and the third is due to the
uncertainties in the isospin-violating corrections.
