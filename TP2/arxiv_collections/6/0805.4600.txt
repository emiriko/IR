It is assumed that the digital-like spatio-time brain activity might be
caused by non-topological transformations of patterns in the cortex which is a
linear, analog and active system. Such an effect can be modeled by
topologically modulated spatio-time electromagnetic signals which theory is
proposed in this paper. The logical operations are performed by passive
components, and a theory of them is considered. Two gates of this sort are
simulated. A short review on semiconductor hardware for this type of spatial
digital processing and computing is given.
