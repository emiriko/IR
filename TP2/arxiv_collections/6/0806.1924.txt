For an embedded singly periodic minimal surface M with genus bigger than or
equal to 4 and annular ends, some weak symmetry hypotheses imply its congruence
with one of the Hoffman-Wohlgemuth examples. We give a very geometrical proof
of this fact, along which they come out many valuable clues for the
understanding of these surfaces.
