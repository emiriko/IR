The elastic scattering amplitudes of indistinguishable, bosonic,
strongly-polar molecules possess universal properties at the coldest
temperatures due to wave propagation in the long-range dipole-dipole field.
Universal scattering cross sections and anisotropic threshold angular
distributions, independent of molecular species, result from careful tuning of
the dipole moment with an applied electric field. Three distinct families of
threshold resonances also occur for specific field strengths, and can be both
qualitatively and quantitatively predicted using elementary adiabatic and
semi-classical techniques. The temperatures and densities of heteronuclear
molecular gases required to observe these univeral characteristics are
predicted. PACS numbers: 34.50.Cx, 31.15.ap, 33.15.-e, 34.20.-b
