A robust system for use of Quantum Computation using neutral atoms is
presented in this communication. This scheme exploits a multilevel atomic
system interacting with two lasers in such a way that it leads to formation of
two Coherent Population Trap (CPT) states. The atomic population can be pumped
alternatively between these two CPT states or any desired superposition of the
two can also be formed. These two CPT states can then be mapped to two Qubits
for Quantum Computation. Preparation of any desired state and formation of CNOT
gates are explained below. A scheme for preparing 1-D lattice of mutually
interacting spin systems, which mimic behaviour of magnetic spin systems is
also shown. Atoms in CPT states do not interact with the lasers that prepare it
and hence are free of perturbation. The states involved here are also made up
of only ground states of bare atoms and hence are free of decoherence due to
spontaneous emission. Thus, the configuration studied here is a good example of
a very robust system.
