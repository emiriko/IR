We study the production of electroweak gauge bosons at high energies in the
framework of kt-factorization QCD approach. Contributions from the valence
quarks are calculated using the quark-gluon interaction and quark-antiquark
annihilation QCD subprocesses. The total and differential cross sections (as a
function of the transverse momentum and rapidity) are presented and the ratio
of cross sections for W and Z boson production is investigated. The
conservative error analysis is performed. In the numerical calculations two
different sets of unintegrated gluon distributions in the proton are used: the
one obtained from Ciafaloni-Catani-Fiorani-Marchesini evolution equation and
the other from Kimber-Martin-Ryskin prescription. Theoretical results are
compared with experimental data taken by the D0 and CDF collaborations at the
Tevatron. We demonstrate the importance of the quark component in parton
evolution in description of the experimental data. This component is very
significant also at the LHC energies.
