We investigate the global scheduling of sporadic, implicit deadline,
real-time task systems on multiprocessor platforms. We provide a task model
which integrates job parallelism. We prove that the time-complexity of the
feasibility problem of these systems is linear relatively to the number of
(sporadic) tasks for a fixed number of processors. We propose a scheduling
algorithm theoretically optimal (i.e., preemptions and migrations neglected).
Moreover, we provide an exact feasibility utilization bound. Lastly, we propose
a technique to limit the number of migrations and preemptions.
