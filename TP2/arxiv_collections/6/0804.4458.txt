In zero magnetic field the superconductor Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ is believed to have a
chiral spin triplet pairing state in which the gap function d-vector is aligned
along the crystal c-axis. Using a phenomenological but orbital specific
description of the spin dependent electron-electron attraction and a realistic
quantitative account of the electronic structure in the normal state we analyze
the orientation of the spin triplet Cooper pair d-vector in response to an
external c-axis magnetic field. We show that for suitable values of the model
parameters a c-axis field of only 20 mT is able to cause a reorientation phase
transition of the d-vector from along $c$ to the $a-b$ plane, in agreement with
recent experiments.
