There are well-known examples of dynamical systems for which the Birkhoff
averages with respect to a given observable along some or all of the orbits do
not converge. It has been suggested that such orbits could be classified using
higher order averages. In the case of a bounded observable, we show that a
classical result of G.H. Hardy implies that if the Birkhoff averages do not
converge, then neither do the higher order averages.
  If the Birkhoff averages do not converge then we may denote by
$[\alpha_k,\beta_k]$ the limit set of the $k$-th order averages. The sequence
of intervals thus generated is nested: $[\alpha_{k+1},\beta_{k+1}] \subset
[\alpha_k,\beta_k]$. We can thus make a distinction among nonconvergent
Birkhoff averages; either:
  B1. $\cap_{k=1}^\infty [\alpha_k,\beta_k]$ is a point $B_\infty$, or,
  B2. $\cap_{k=1}^\infty [\alpha_k,\beta_k]$ is a non-trivial interval
  $[\alpha_\infty,\beta_\infty]$.
  We give characterizations of the types B1 and B2 in terms of how slowly they
oscillate and we give examples that exhibit both behaviours B1 and B2 in the
context of full shifts on finite symbols and "Bowen's example". For finite full
shifts, we show that the set of orbits with type B2 behaviour has full
topological entropy.
