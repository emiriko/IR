We introduce a new genuinely 2N qubit state, known as the "mirror state" with
interesting entanglement properties. The well known Bell and the cluster states
form a special case of these "mirror states", for N=1 and N=2 respectively. It
can be experimentally realized using $SWAP$ and multiply controlled phase shift
operations. After establishing the general conditions for a state to be useful
for various communicational protocols involving quantum and classical
information, it is shown that the present state can optimally implement
algorithms for the quantum teleportation of an arbitrary N qubit state and
achieve quantum information splitting in all possible ways. With regard to
superdense coding, one can send 2N classical bits by sending only N qubits and
consuming N ebits of entanglement. Explicit comparison of the mirror state with
the rearranged N Bell pairs and the linear cluster states is considered for
these quantum protocols. We also show that mirror states are more robust than
the rearranged Bell pairs with respect to a certain class of collisional
decoherence.
