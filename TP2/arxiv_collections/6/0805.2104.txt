This paper investigates the relations between the particular eigensolutions
of a limiting functional differential equation of any order, which is the
nominal (unperturbed) linear autonomous differential equations, and the
associate ones of the corresponding perturbed functional differential equation.
Both differential equations involve point and distributed delayed dynamics. The
proofs are based on a Perron type theorem for functional equations so that the
comparison is governed by the real part of a dominant zero of the
characteristic equation of the nominal differential equation. The obtained
results are also applied to investigate the global stability of the perturbed
equation based on that of its corresponding limiting equation.
