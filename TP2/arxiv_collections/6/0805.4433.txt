The insulator-to-metal transition in solid helium at high pressure is studied
with first-principles simulations. Diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (DMC)
calculations predict that the band gap closes at a density of 21.3 g/cc and a
pressure of 25.7 terapascals, which is 20% higher in density and 40% higher in
pressure than predicted by density functional calculations based on the
generalized gradient approximation (GGA). The metallization density derived
from GW calculations is found to be in very close agreement with DMC
predictions. The zero point motion of the nuclei had no effect on the
metallization density within the accuracy of the calculation. Finally, fit
functions for the equation of state are presented and the magnitude of the
electronic correlation effects left out of the GGA approximation are discussed.
