We show the existence of smooth stationary solutions for the inelastic
Boltzmann equation under the thermalization induced by a host-medium with a
fixed distribution. This is achieved by controlling the Lp-norms, the moments
and the regularity of the solutions for the Cauchy problem together with
arguments related to a dynamical proof for the existence of stationary states.
