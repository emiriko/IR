Interaction of single-walled carbon nanotubes with electron donor and
acceptor molecules causes significant changes in the electronic and Raman
spectra, the relative proportion of the metallic species increasing on electron
donation through molecular charge transfer, as also verified by electrical
resistivity measurements.
