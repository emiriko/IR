While multiple testing procedures have been the focus of much statistical
research, an important facet of the problem is how to deal with possible
confounding. Procedures have been developed by authors in genetics and
statistics. In this chapter, we relate these proposals. We propose two new
multiple testing approaches within this framework. The first combines
sensitivity analysis methods with false discovery rate estimation procedures.
The second involves construction of shrinkage estimators that utilize the
mixture model for multiple testing. The procedures are illustrated with
applications to a gene expression profiling experiment in prostate cancer.
