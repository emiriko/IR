Measuring correlations between forward dijets in deuteron-gold collisions at
RHIC will further test the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) picture of the nuclear
wavefunction at small-x, which successfully predicted the suppressed production
of high-p_T particles at forward rapidities in d+Au collisions: R_dA<1. I
present predictions for the correlation in azimuthal angle between forward
dijets in the CGC framework, with both multiple scatterings and non-linear QCD
evolution at small-x taken into account.
