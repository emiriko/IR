Let k be a global field, p an odd prime number different from char(k) and S,
T disjoint, finite sets of primes of k. Let G_S^T(k)(p)=Gal(k_S^T(p)|k) be the
Galois group of the maximal p-extension of k which is unramified outside S and
completely split at T. We prove the existence of a finite set of primes S_0,
which can be chosen disjoint from any given set M of Dirichlet density zero,
such that the cohomology of G_{S\cup S_0}^T(k)(p) coincides with the etale
cohomology of the associated marked arithmetic curve. In particular, cd
G_{S\cup S_0}^T(k)(p)=2. Furthermore, we can choose S_0 in such a way that
k_{S\cup S_0}^T(p) realizes the maximal p-extension k_\p(p) of the local field
k_\p for all \p\in S\cup S_0, the cup-product H^1(G_{S\cup S_0}^T(k)(p),\F_p)
\otimes H^1(G_{S\cup S_0}^T(k)(p),\F_p) --> H^2(G_{S\cup S_0}^T(k)(p),\F_p) is
surjective and the decomposition groups of the primes in S establish a free
product inside G_{S\cup S_0}^T(k)(p). This generalizes previous work of the
author where similar results were shown in the case T=\emptyset under the
restrictive assumption p\nmid Cl(k) and \zeta_p\notin k.
