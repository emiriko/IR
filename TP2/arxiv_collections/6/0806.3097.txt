We show that the classical Rosenbluth method for sampling self-avoiding walks
can be extended to a general algorithm for sampling many families of objects,
including self-avoiding polygons. The implementation relies on an elementary
move which is a generalisation of kinetic growth; rather than only appending
edges to the endpoint, edges may be inserted at any vertex providing the
resulting objects still lie within the same family. We implement this method
using pruning and enrichment to sample self-avoiding walks and polygons. The
algorithm can be further extended by mixing it with length-preserving moves,
such pivots and crank-shaft moves.
