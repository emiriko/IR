The quantum computing scheme described in Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 190504 (2007),
when viewed as a cluster state computation, features a 3-D cluster state, novel
adjustable strength error correction capable of correcting general errors
through the correction of Z errors only, a threshold error rate approaching 1%
and low overhead arbitrarily long-range logical gates. In this work, we review
the scheme in detail framing discussion solely in terms of the required 3-D
cluster state and its stabilizers.
