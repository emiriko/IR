We propose a generalization of the reduction of Poisson manifolds by
distributions introduced by Marsden and Ratiu. Our proposal overcomes some of
the restrictions of the original procedure, and makes the reduced Poisson
structure effectively dependent on the distribution. Different applications are
discussed, as well as the algebraic interpretation of the procedure and its
formulation in terms of Dirac structures.
