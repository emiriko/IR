We present a method based on mean-field states generated by triaxial
quadrupole constraints which are projected on particle number and angular
momentum and mixed by the generator coordinate method on the quadrupole moment.
This method is equivalent to a seven-dimensional GCM calculation, mixing all
five degrees of freedom of the quadrupole operator and the gauge angles for
protons and neutrons. A first application to Mg24 permits to analyze in detail
the effects of triaxial deformations and of K-mixing.
