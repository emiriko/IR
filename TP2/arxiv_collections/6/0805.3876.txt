We outline the proofs of the factorization theorems for exclusive two-body
charmonium production in B-meson decay and e^+e^- annihilation to all orders in
perturbation theory in quantum chromodynamics. We find that factorized
expressions hold up to corrections of order m_c/m_b in B-meson decay and
corrections of order m_c^2/s in e^+e^- annihilation, where m_c is the
charm-quark mass, m_b is the bottom-quark mass, and root-s is the e^+e^-
center-of-momentum energy.
