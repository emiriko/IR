Fermion superpartners - neutralinos and charginos in the supersymmetric
economical 3-3-1 model are studied. By imposition R parity, their masses and
eigenstates are derived.
  Assuming that Bino-like is dark matter, its mass density is calculated. The
cosmological dark matter density gives a bound on mass of LSP neutralino in the
range of 20 - 100 GeV, while the bound on mass of the lightest slepton is in
the range of 60 - 130 GeV
