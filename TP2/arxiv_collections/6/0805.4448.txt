We give in this paper some equivalent definitions of the so called
$\rho$-Carleson measures when $\rho(t)=(\log(4/t))^p(\log\log(e^4/t))^q$, $0\le
p,q<\infty$. As applications, we characterize the pointwise multipliers on
$LMOA(\mathbb S^n)$ and from this space to $BMOA(\mathbb S^n)$. Boundedness of
the Ces\`aro type integral operators on $LMOA(\mathbb S^n)$ and from
$LMOA(\mathbb S^n)$ to $BMOA(\mathbb S^n)$ is considered as well.
