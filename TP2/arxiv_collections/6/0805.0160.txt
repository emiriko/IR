A brief review of the $p_T$ dependence of the dihadron correlations from RHIC
is presented. We attempt to construct a consistent picture that can describe
the data as a whole, focusing on the following important aspects, 1) the
relation between jet fragmentation of survived jet and medium response to
quenched jets, 2) the possible origin of the medium response and its relation
to intermediate $p_T$ physics for single hadron production, 3) the connection
between the near-side ridge and away-side cone, 4) and their relations to low
energy results.
