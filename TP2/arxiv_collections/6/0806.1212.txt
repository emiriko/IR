We study comodule functors for comonads arising from mixed distributive laws.
Their Galois property is reformulated in terms of a (so-called) regular arrow
in Street's bicategory of comonads. Between categories possessing equalizers,
we introduce the notion of a regular adjunction. An equivalence is proven
between the category of pre-torsors over two regular adjunctions $(N_A,R_A)$
and $(N_B,R_B)$ on one hand, and the category of regular comonad arrows
$(R_A,\xi)$ from some equalizer preserving comonad ${\mathbb C}$ to $N_BR_B$ on
the other. This generalizes a known relationship between pre-torsors over equal
commutative rings and Galois objects of coalgebras.Developing a bi-Galois
theory of comonads, we show that a pre-torsor over regular adjunctions
determines also a second (equalizer preserving) comonad ${\mathbb D}$ and a
co-regular comonad arrow from ${\mathbb D}$ to $N_A R_A$, such that the
comodule categories of ${\mathbb C}$ and ${\mathbb D}$ are equivalent.
