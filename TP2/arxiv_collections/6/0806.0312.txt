We explore the character of finite-time singularities that are possible to
arise in FRW universes and in specific braneworld configurations. For FRW
universes, we derive a first classification of singularities that is based on
the behaviour of the Hubble rate. We further extend and complete this
classification with the use of the Bel-Robinson energy. The braneworld models
that we study consist of a three-brane embedded in a five-dimensional bulk
space that is inhabited by a scalar field or a perfect fluid. Our analysis that
is performed with the method of asymptotic splittings shows that these
braneworlds can exhibit three main types of singularities that arise within
finite distance from the brane.
