The surface gravity of any Killing horizon, in any spacetime dimension, can
be interpreted as a local, two-dimensional expansion rate seen by freely
falling observers when they cross the horizon. Any two-dimensional congruence
of geodesics invariant under the Killing flow can be used to define this
expansion, provided that the observers have unit Killing energy.
