The LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC) is developing and running analysis
pipelines to search for gravitational-wave transients emitted by astrophysical
events such as compact binary mergers or core-collapse supernovae. However,
because of the non-Gaussian, non-stationary nature of the noise exhibited by
the LIGO detectors, residual false alarms might be found at the end of the
pipelines. A critical aspect of the search is then to assess our confidence for
gravitational waves and to distinguish them from those false alarms. Both the
'Compact Binary Coalescence' and the 'Burst' working groups have been
developing a detection checklist for the validation of candidate-events,
consisting of a series of tests which aim to corroborate a detection or to
eliminate a false alarm. These tests include for example data quality checks,
analysis of the candidate appearance, parameter consistency studies and
coherent analysis. In this paper, the general methodology used for candidate
validation is presented. The method is illustrated with an example of simulated
gravitational-wave signal and a false alarm.
