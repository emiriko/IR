We show that a new state of matter, the d-wave Mott-insulator state (d-Mott
state) (introduced recently by [H. Yao, W. F. Tsai, and S. A. Kivelson, Phys.
Rev. B 76, 161104 (2007)]), which is characterized by a non-zero expectation
value of a local plaquette operator embedded in an insulating state, can be
engineered using ultra-cold atomic fermions in two-dimensional double-well
optical lattices. We characterize and analyze the parameter regime where the
$d$-Mott state is stable. We predict the testable signatures of the state in
the time-of-flight measurements.
