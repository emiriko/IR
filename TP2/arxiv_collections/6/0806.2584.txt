Starting from gauged N=8 supergravity in three dimensions we construct
actions for multiple membranes by taking the limit to global supersymmetry for
different choices of the embedding tensor. This provides a general framework
that reproduces many recent results on multiple membrane actions as well as
generalisations thereof. As examples we discuss conformal (non-conformal)
gaugings leading to multiple M2-branes (D2-branes) and massive deformations of
these systems.
