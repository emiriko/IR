The rotation of the bodies and the eccentricity of the orbit have significant
effects on the emitted gravitational radiation of binary systems. This work
focuses on the evaluation of the gravitational wave polarization states for
spinning compact binaries. We consider binaries on eccentric orbits and the
spin-orbit interaction up to the 1.5 post-Newtonian order in a way which is
independent of the parameterization of the orbit. The equations of motion for
angular variables are included. The formal expressions of the polarization
states are given with the inclusion of higher order corrections to the
waveform.
