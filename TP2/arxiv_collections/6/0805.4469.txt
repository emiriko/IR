We study polygonal analogues of several moving boundary problems and their
time discretization which preserves the constant area speed property. We
establish various polygonal analogues of geometric formulas for moving
boundaries and make use of the geometric formulas for our numerical scheme and
its analysis of general constant area speed motion of polygons. Accuracy and
efficiency of our numerical scheme are checked through numerical simulations
for several polygonal motions such as motion by curvature and area-preserving
advected flow etc.
