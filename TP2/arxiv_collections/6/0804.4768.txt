A pressure chamber is designed to study the crumpling process under an
ambient force. The compression force and its resulting radius for the ball obey
a power law with an exponent that is independent of the thickness and initial
size of the sheet. However, the exponent is found to be material-dependent and
less than the universal value, 0.25, claimed by the previous simulations. The
power law behavior disappears at high pressure when the compressibility drops
discontinuously, which is suggestive of a jammed state.
