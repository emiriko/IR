The performance of thick GEMs (THGEMs) was compared to that of thin GEMs in
two-phase Ar avalanche detectors, in view of their potential application in
coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering, dark-matter search and in other
rare-event experiments. The detectors comprised a 1 cm thick liquid-Ar layer
followed by either a double-THGEM or a triple-GEM multiplier, operated in the
saturated vapor above the liquid phase. Three types of THGEMs were studied:
those made of G10 and Kevlar and that with resistive electrodes (RETHGEM). Only
the G10-made THGEM showed a stable performance in two-phase Ar with gains
reaching 3000. Successful operation of two-phase Ar avalanche detectors with
either thin- or thick-GEM multipliers was demonstrated at low detection
thresholds, of 4 and 20 primary electrons respectively. Compared to the
triple-GEM the double-THGEM multiplier yielded slower anode signals; this
allowed applying a pulse-shape analysis to effectively reject noise signals.
Noise rates of both multipliers were evaluated in two-phase Ar; with detection
thresholds of 20 electrons and applying pulse-shape analysis noise levels as
low as 0.007 Hz per 1 cm2 of active area were reached.
