By using the DiPerna and Lions techniques for the nonrelativistic Boltzmann
equation, it is shown that there exists a global mild solution to the Cauchy
problem for the relativistic Boltzmann equation with the assumptions of the
relativistic scattering cross section including some relativistic hard
interactions and the initial data satifying finite mass, ``inertia'', energy
and entropy.
