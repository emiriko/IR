In this paper, we study the classical problem of estimating the proportion of
a finite population. First, we consider a fixed sample size method and derive
an explicit sample size formula which ensures a mixed criterion of absolute and
relative errors. Second, we consider an inverse sampling scheme such that the
sampling is continue until the number of units having a certain attribute
reaches a threshold value or the whole population is examined. We have
established a simple method to determine the threshold so that a prescribed
relative precision is guaranteed. Finally, we develop a multistage sampling
scheme for constructing fixed-width confidence interval for the proportion of a
finite population. Powerful computational techniques are introduced to make it
possible that the fixed-width confidence interval ensures prescribed level of
coverage probability.
