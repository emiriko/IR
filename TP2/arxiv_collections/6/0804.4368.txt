Numerical modelling of coherent spin relaxation in nanomagnets, formed by
magnetic molecules of high spins, is accomplished. Such a coherent spin
dynamics can be realized in the presence of a resonant electric circuit coupled
to the magnet. Computer simulations for a system of a large number of
interacting spins is an efficient tool for studying the microscopic properties
of such systems. Coherent spin relaxation is an ultrafast process, with the
relaxation time that can be an order shorter than the transverse spin dephasing
time. The influence of different system parameters on the relaxation process is
analysed. The role of the sample geometry on the spin relaxation is
investigated.
