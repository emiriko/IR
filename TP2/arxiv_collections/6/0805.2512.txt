Motivated by recent observations of phase-segregated binary Bose-Einstein
condensates, we propose a method to calculate the excess energy due to the
interface tension of a trapped configuration. By this method one should be able
to numerically reproduce the experimental data by means of a simple
Thomas-Fermi approximation, combined with interface excess terms and the
Laplace equation. Using the Gross-Pitaevskii theory, we find expressions for
the interface excesses which are accurate in a very broad range of the
interspecies and intraspecies interaction parameters. We also present
finite-temperature corrections to the interface tension which, aside from the
regime of weak segregation, turn out to be small.
