We present a group of transformations in the space of generalized connections
that contains the set of transformations generated by the flux variables of
loop quantum gravity. This group is labelled by certain SU(2)-valued functions
on the bundle of directions in the spatial manifold. A further generalization
is obtained by considering functions that depend on germs of analytic curves,
rather than just on directions.
