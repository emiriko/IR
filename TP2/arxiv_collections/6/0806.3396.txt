Dirac's equations are formulated in a consistent way by using only elements
from each of R, C, and H. In H, the quaternions, the symmetry resulting from a
"single" conjugation (i, j, or k) results in three conserved currents -
possibly associated with "color." The role that the numerical field plays is
discussed and speculated on.
