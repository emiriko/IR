We provide predictions for the rapidity distributions of exclusive
photoproduced J/psi and Upsilon mesons, and Z^0 bosons, at the Tevatron and
LHC. We use the equivalent-photon approximation with the photon-proton cross
sections given by the impact parameter dependent dipole saturation model, which
has already been shown to give a good description of a wide variety of HERA
data. We derive the quark-antiquark light-cone wave functions of timelike
neutral electroweak bosons. An essential difference is pointed out between the
amplitude for timelike heavy boson photoproduction and the amplitude for deeply
virtual Compton scattering.
