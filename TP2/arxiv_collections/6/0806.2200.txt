We present the NLO QCD corrections for light Higgs pair production via vector
boson fusion at the LHC within the CP conserving type II two higgs doublet
model in the form of a fully flexible parton--level Monte Carlo program. Scale
dependences on integrated cross sections and distributions are reduced with QCD
K-factors of order unity.
