We discuss various methods used to investigate the geometric complexity of
earthquakes and earthquake faults, based both on a point-source representation
and the study of interrelations between earthquake focal mechanisms. We briefly
review the seismic moment tensor formalism and discuss in some detail the
representation of double-couple (DC) earthquake sources by normalized
quaternions. Non-DC earthquake sources like the CLVD focal mechanism are also
considered. We obtain the characterization of the earthquake complex source
caused by summation of disoriented DC sources. We show that commonly defined
geometrical fault barriers correspond to the sources without any CLVD
component. We analyze the CMT global earthquake catalog to examine whether the
focal mechanism distribution suggests that the CLVD component is likely to be
zero in tectonic earthquakes. Although some indications support this
conjecture, we need more extensive and significantly more accurate data to
answer this question fully.
