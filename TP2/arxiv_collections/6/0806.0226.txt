An asymmetry between the probabilities P(\nu_{\mu}\to\nu_{e}) and
P(\bar{\nu_{\mu}}\to\bar{\nu_{e}}) would be direct indication of CP violation
at the fundamental level. Planck scale effects on neutrino mixing, we have
derived the mixing angles of neutrino flavour due to Planck scale effects. It
has been shown that Jarlskog determinant remains nearly invariant due to Planck
scale effects.
