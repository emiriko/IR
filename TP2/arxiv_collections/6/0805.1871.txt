The Mellin-Barnes technique to evaluate master integrals and the algorithm
called FIRE to solve IBP relations with the help of Groebner bases are briefly
reviewed. In FIRE, an extension of the classical Buchberger algorithm to
construct Groebner bases is combined with the well-known Laporta algorithm. It
is explained how both techniques are used when evaluating the three-loop
correction to the static QCD quark potential. First results are presented: the
coefficients of n_l^3 and n_l^2, where n_l is the number of light quarks.
