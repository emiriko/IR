We investigate the role of jet and shower parton broadening by the strong
colour field in the $\Delta\eta$-$\Delta\phi$ correlation of high $p_T$
particles. When anisotropic momentum broadening ($\Delta p_z > \Delta p_T$) is
given to jet and shower partons in the initial stage, a ridge-like structure is
found to appear in the two hadron correlation. The ratio of the peak to the
pedestal yield is overestimated.
