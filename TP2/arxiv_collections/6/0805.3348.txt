We study procedures for the optimization of efficiency of light storage and
retrieval based on the dynamic form of electromagnetically induced transparency
(EIT) in warm Rb vapor. We present a detailed analysis of two recently
demonstrated optimization protocols: a time-reversal-based iteration procedure,
which finds the optimal input signal pulse shape for any given control field,
and a procedure based on the calculation of an optimal control field for any
given signal pulse shape. We verify that the two procedures are consistent with
each other, and that they both independently achieve the maximum memory
efficiency for any given optical depth. We observe good agreement with
theoretical predictions for moderate optical depths (<25), while at higher
optical depths the experimental efficiency falls below the theoretically
predicted values. We identify possible effects responsible for this reduction
in memory efficiency.
