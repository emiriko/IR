We evaluate in perturbative QCD the semi-inclusive Drell-Yan cross-section
for the production of a single hadron accompaining the lepton pair. We
demonstrate to one loop level a collinear factorization formula within the
fracture functions approach. We propose such a process as a factorization
analyzer in hadronic collisions. Phenomenological implications at the hadron
colliders are briefly discussed.
