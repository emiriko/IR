We present a study on the spectra for heavy flavor (charm and bottom) decayed
electrons in 200 GeV $p+p$ collisions and provide the relative contributions of
charm and bottom hadrons from the PYTHIA calculations. The results suggest that
the crossing point of the electron spectra from charm and bottom decays is
above 7 GeV/$c$ and bottom contribution is not dominant for electron $p_{T}<3$
GeV/$c$. The upper limit of the relative cross section ratio is reported as
$\sigma_{b\bar{b}}/\sigma_{c\bar{c}}\leq(0.49\pm0.09\pm0.09)%$. We also compare
the $v_2$ distribution from simulation to the experimental data in 200 GeV
$Au+Au$ collisions and estimate the possible charm $v_2$.
