By applying 'Darmois-Israel formalism', we establish a new class of thin
shell wormhole in the context of global monopole resulting from the breaking of
a global O(3) symmetry. Since global monopole is asymptotically conical (no
longer asymptotically flat), we call it as conical thin shell wormhole.
Different characteristics of this conical thin shell wormhole, namely, time
evolution of the throat, stability, total amount of exotic matter have been
discussed.
