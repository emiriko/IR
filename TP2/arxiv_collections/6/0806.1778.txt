We propose an eavesdropping experiment with linear optical 1-3
phase-covariant quantum cloner. In this paper, we have designed an optical
circuit of the cloner and shown how the eavesdropper (Eve) utilizes her clones.
We have also optimized the measurement scheme for Eve by numerical calculation.
The optimized measurement is easy to implement with liner optics.
