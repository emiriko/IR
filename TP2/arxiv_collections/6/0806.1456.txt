Point contacts (PC) Andreev reflection dV/dI spectra for the
antiferromagnetic (T_N =6K) superconductor (Tc=11K) ErNi2B2C have been measured
for the two main crystallographic directions. Observed retention of the Andreev
reflection minima in dV/dI up to Tc directly points to unusual superconducting
order parameter (OP) vanishing at Tc. Temperature dependence of OP was obtained
from dV/dI using recent theory of Andreev reflection including pair-breaking
effect. For the first time existence of a two superconducting OPs in ErNi2B2C
is shown. A distinct decrease of both OPs as temperature is lowered below T_N
is observed.
