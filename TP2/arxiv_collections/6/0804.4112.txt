We study null rays propagation in a spacetime of static
Schwarzschild--Tangherlini black holes in arbitrary number of dimensions. We
focus on the bending angle and the retarded time delay for rays emitted in the
vicinity of a black hole and propagating to the infinity. We obtain an analytic
expression in terms of elementary functions which approximate the bending angle
and time delay in these spacetimes with high accuracy. We analyze the relative
error of the developed analytic approximations and show that it is quite small
in the complete domain of the parameter space for the rays reaching the
infinity and for different number of the spacetime dimensions. Possible
applications of the obtained results are briefly discussed.
