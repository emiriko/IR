The AC and DC conductivity anisotropies in the low temperature orthorhombic
phase of lightly doped La(2-x)Sr(x)CuO(4) are ascribed to the rotational
symmetry broken, localized impurity states resulting from the trapping of doped
holes by Sr ions. The two lowest-energy p-wave-like states are split by
orthorhombicity and partially filled with holes. This leaves a unique imprint
in AC conductivity, which shows two distinct infrared continuum absorption
energies. Furthermore, the existence of two independent channels for hopping
conductivity, associated to the two orthorhombic directions, explains
quantitatively the observed low temperature anisotropies in DC conductivity.
