We study inhomogeneous one-dimensional Hubbard systems using the density
matrix renormalization group method. Different heterostructures are
investigated whose configuration is modeled varying parameters like the on-site
Coulomb potential and introducing local confining potentials. We investigate
their Luttinger liquid properties through the parameter K_rho, which
characterizes the decay of the density-density correlation function at large
distances. Our main goal is the investigation of possible realization of
engineered materials and the ability to manipulate physical properties by
choosing an appropriate spatial and/or chemical modulation.
