In this work we derive local gradient and Laplacian estimates of the
Aronson-B\'enilan and Li-Yau type for positive solutions of porous medium
equations posed on Riemannian manifolds with a lower Ricci curvature bound. We
also prove similar results for some fast diffusion equations. Inspired by
Perelman's work we discover some new entropy formulae for these equations.
