Canonical quantization of a gauge theory in the spatial axial gauge produces
an anisotropic Hamiltonian and matter particles surrounded by physically
unrealistic asymmetric electric or chromoelectric fields. We show how to
restore rotational symmetry for a nonabelian theory with a gauge fixing
condition $A^a_3=0$. We also discuss similarities between recovering isotropy
in the spatial axial gauge and finding gauge invariant quantities in the Weyl
gauge in both abelian and nonabelian field theories.
