A holographic dark energy from Ricci scalar curvature called Ricci dark
energy was proposed recently. In this model the future event horizon area is
replaced by the inverse of the Ricci scalar curvature. We study the evolution
of equation of state of the Ricci dark energy and the transition from
decelerated to accelerated expansion of the universe in the Brans-Dicke theory,
which is a natural extension of general relativity. We find that the current
acceleration of our universe is well explained.
