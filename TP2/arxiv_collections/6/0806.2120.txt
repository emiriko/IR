By performing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy of the bilayer
colossal magnetoresistive (CMR) manganite, $La_{2-2x}Sr_{1+2x}Mn_{2}O_{7}$, we
provide the complete mapping of the Fermi level spectral weight topology. Clear
and unambiguous bilayer splitting of the in-plane 3d$_{x^2-y^2}$ band, mapped
throughout the Brillouin zone, and the full mapping of the 3d$_{3z^2-r^2}$ band
are reported. Peculiar doping and temperature dependencies of these bands imply
that as transition from the ferromagnetic metallic phase approaches, either as
a function of doping or temperature, coherence along the c-axis between planes
within the bilayer is lost, resulting in reduced interplane coupling. These
results suggest that interplane coupling plays a large role in the CMR
transition.
