By using topological current theory, we study the inner topological structure
of disclinations during the melting of two-dimensional systems. From
two-dimensional elasticity theory, it is found topological currents for
topological defects in homogeneous equation. The evolution of disclinations is
studied, and the branch conditions for generating, annihilating, crossing,
splitting, and merging of disclinations are given.
