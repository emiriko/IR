We discuss properties of dipolar SLE(k) under conditioning. We show that k=2,
which describes continuum limits of loop erased random walks, is characterized
as being the only value of k such that dipolar SLE conditioned to stop on an
interval coincides with dipolar SLE on that interval. We illustrate this
property by computing a new bulk passage probability for SLE(2).
