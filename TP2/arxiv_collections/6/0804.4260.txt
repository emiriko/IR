A Time of Flight monitoring system has been developed for BES3.
  The light source is a 442-443 nm laser diode, which is stable and provides a
pulse width as narrow as 50 ps and a peak power as large as 2.6 W. Two
optical-fiber bundles with a total of 512 optical fibers, including spares, are
used to distribute the light pulses to the Time of Flight counters. The design,
operation, and performance of the system are described.
