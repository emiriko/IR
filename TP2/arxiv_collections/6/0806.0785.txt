We report on microwave photovoltage and simultaneous magnetotransport
measurements in a (Ga,Mn)As film oriented normal to the magnetic field. We
detect the ferromagnetic resonance over a broad frequency range of 2 GHz to
18.5 GHz and determine the spectroscopic g-factor and separate the Gilbert from
the inhomogeneous contribution to magnetization relaxation. Temperature
dependent measurements below the saturation magnetization indicate that the
photovoltage signal can serve as a sensitive tool to study the crystal
anisotropy. We demonstrate that the combination of spin dynamics with charge
transport is a promising tool to study microstructured ferromagnetic
semiconductor samples.
