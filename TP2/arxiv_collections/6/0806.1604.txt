We investigate the $J_1$-$J_2$ spin chain consisting of spins with magnitude
$\frac12$. The nearest-neighbor and the next-nearest-neighbor exchange
interactions are ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic, respectively, and induce
strong frustration. Both these interactions involve the bond alternation. We
find exact solutions for all the degenerate ground states on the phase boundary
of the ferromagnetic phase. The degeneracy remains irrespective of two
parameters representing the bond alternation. The exact solutions are of closed
forms for no bond alternation and of recursion formulae in general. The exact
solutions are applicable to the $\Delta$ chain as a special case.
