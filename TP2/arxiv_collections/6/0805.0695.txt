The genetic code structure into distinct multiplet-classes as well as the
numeric degeneracies of the latter are revealed by a two-step process. First,
an empirical inventory of the degeneracies (of the shuffled multiplets) in two
specific equal moieties of the experimental genetic code table is made and
transcribed in the form of a sequence of integers. Second, a Godel Encoding
procedure is applied to the latter sequence delivering, as an output, a Godel
Number the digits of which, from the decimal representation, could remarkably
describe the amino acids and the stops and allow us also to compute the exact
degeneracies, class by class. The standard and the vertebrate mitochondrial
genetic codes are considered and their multiplet structure is fully
established.
