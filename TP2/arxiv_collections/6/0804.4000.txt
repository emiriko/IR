We discuss the minimum requirements for a neutrino beta beam if theta_13 is
discovered by an upcoming reactor experiment, such as Double Chooz or Daya Bay.
We require that both neutrino mass hierarchy and leptonic CP violation can be
measured to competitive precisions with a single-baseline experiment in the
entire remaining theta_13 range. We find that for very high isotope production
rates, such as they might be possible using a production ring, a (B,Li) beta
beam with a gamma as low as 60 could already be sufficient to perform all of
these measurements. If only the often used nominal source luminosities can be
achieved, for example, a (Ne,He) beta beam from Fermilab to a possibly existing
water Cherenkov detector at Homestake with gamma \sim 190-350 (depending on the
Double Chooz best-fit) could outperform practically any other beam technology
including wide-band beam and neutrino factory.
