We develop a complete mathematical theory for the symmetrical solutions of
the generalized nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation based on the new concept of
angular pseudomomentum. We consider the symmetric solitons of a generalized
nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with a nonlinearity depending on the modulus
of the field. We provide a rigorous proof of a set of mathematical results
justifying that these solitons can be classified according to the irreducible
representations of a discrete group. Then we extend this theory to
non-stationary solutions and study the relationship between angular momentum
and pseudomomentum. We illustrate these theoretical results with numerical
examples. Finally, we explore the possibilities of the generalization of the
previous framework to the quantum limit.
