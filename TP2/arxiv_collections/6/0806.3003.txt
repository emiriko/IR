A micron sized single crystal of the superconductor BSCCO was studied using
silicon mechanical micro-oscillators at various tilt angles of the dc magnetic
field with respect to the c axis of the sample. Different phases of the vortex
matter were detected by measuring changes in the value and sign of the
oscillator resonant frequency variation with temperature. We could explain the
change in the sign of this variation at high temperatures as the transition
from the 2D liquid of decoupled pancakes to a reversible 3D vortex lattice. The
data indicates that this transition only depends on the magnetic field
perpendicular to the superconducting layers while the dissipation involved in
this process depends on the component parallel to them.
