We observed an unconventional parity-violating vortex in single domain
Sr2RuO4 single crystals using a transport measurement. The current-voltage
characteristics of submicron Sr2RuO4 shows that the induced voltage has
anomalous components which are even function of the bias current. The results
may suggest that the vortex itself has a helical internal structure
characterized by a Hopf invariant (a topological invariant). We also discuss
that the hydrodynamics of such a helical vortex causes the parity violation to
retain the topological invariant.
