Separate studies have reported that postural control during quiet standing
could be (1) impaired with muscle fatigue localized at the lower back, and (2)
improved through the use of plantar pressure-based electro-tactile biofeedback,
under normal neuromuscular state. The aim of this experiment was to investigate
whether this biofeedback could reduce postural destabilization induced by trunk
extensor muscles. Ten healthy adults were asked to stand as immobile as
possible in four experimental conditions: (1) no fatigue/no biofeedback, (2) no
fatigue/biofeedback, (3) fatigue/no biofeedback and (4) fatigue/biofeedback.
Muscular fatigue was achieved by performing trunk repetitive extensions until
maximal exhaustion. The underlying principle of the biofeedback consisted of
providing supplementary information related to foot sole pressure distribution
through electro-tactile stimulation of the tongue. Centre of foot pressure
(CoP) displacements were recorded using a force platform. Results showed (1)
increased CoP displacements along the antero-posterior axis in the fatigue than
no fatigue condition in the absence of biofeedback and (2) no significant
difference between the no fatigue and fatigue conditions in the presence of
biofeedback. This suggests that subjects were able to efficiently integrate an
artificial plantar pressure information delivered through electro-tactile
stimulation of the tongue that allowed them to suppress the destabilizing
effect induced by trunk extensor muscles fatigue.
