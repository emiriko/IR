The response function to an external prove is evaluated using the ring
approximation in nuclear matter. Contrary to what it is usually assumed, it is
shown that the summation of the ring series and the solution of the Dyson's
equation are two different approaches. The numerical results exhibit a
perceptible difference between both approximations.
