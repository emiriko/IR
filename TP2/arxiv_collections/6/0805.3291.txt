We present a critical analysis of Pade-based methods for the unitarization of
low energy amplitudes. We show that the use of certain Pade Approximants to
describe the resonance region may lead to inaccurate determinations. In
particular, we find that in the Linear Sigma Model the unitarization of the low
energy amplitude through the inverse amplitude method produces essentially
incorrect results for the mass and width of the sigma. Alternative sequences of
Pades are studied and we find that the diagonal sequences (i.e., [N/N]) have
much better convergence properties.
