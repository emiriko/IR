We propose a spin current diode which can work even in a small applied bias
condition (the linear-response regime). The prototypal device consists of a
hornlike electron waveguide with Rashba spin-orbit interaction, which is
connected to two leads with different widths. It is demonstrated that when
electrons are incident from the narrow lead, the generated spin conductance
fluctuates around a constant value in a wide range of incident energy. When the
transport direction is reversed, the spin conductance is suppressed strongly.
Such a remarkable difference arises from spin-flipped transitions caused by the
spin-orbit interaction.
