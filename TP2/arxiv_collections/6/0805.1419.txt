We calculate the baryon magnetic moments using covariant Chiral Perturbation
Theory ($\chi$PT) within the Extended-on-mass-shell (EOMS) renormalization
scheme. By fitting the two available low-energy constants (LECs), we improve
the Coleman-Glashow description of the data when we include the leading SU(3)
breaking effects coming from the lowest-order loops. This success is in
dramatic contrast with previous attempts at the same order using Heavy Baryon
(HB) $\chi$PT and covariant Infrared (IR) $\chi$PT. We also analyze the source
of this improvement with particular attention on the comparison between the
covariant results.
