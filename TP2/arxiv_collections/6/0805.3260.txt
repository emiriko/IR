We construct the most general perturbatively long-range integrable spin chain
with spins transforming in the fundamental representation of gl(N) and open
boundary conditions. In addition to the previously determined bulk moduli we
find a new set of parameters determining the reflection phase shift. We also
consider finite-size contributions and comment on their determination.
