Recent experimental data on the radiative decays B -> V gamma, where V is a
light vector meson, find small isospin violation in B -> K^* gamma while
isospin asymmetries in B -> rho gamma are of order 20%, with large
uncertainties. Using Soft-Collinear Effective Theory, we calculate isospin
asymmetries in these radiative B decays up to O(1/m_b), also including O(v
alpha_s) contributions from nonperturbative charming penguins (NPCP). In the
absence of NPCP contributions, the theoretical predictions for the asymmetries
are a few percent or less. Including the NPCP can significantly increase the
isospin asymmetries for both B -> V gamma modes. We also consider the effect of
the NPCP on the branching ratio and CP asymmetries in B^\pm -> V^\pm gamma.
