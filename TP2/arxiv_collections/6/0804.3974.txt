The collective behavior of correlated electrons in the VO$_2-$interface layer
of LaVO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ heterostructure is studied within a quarter-filled
$t_{2g}$-orbital Hubbard model on a square lattice. We argue that the ground
state is ferromagnetic driven by the double exchange mechanism, and is
orbitally and charge ordered due to a confined geometry and electron
correlations. The orbital and charge density waves open gaps on the entire
Fermi surfaces of all orbitals. The theory explains the observed insulating
behavior of the $p$-type interface between LaVO$_3$ and SrTiO$_3$.
