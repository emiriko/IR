Using a tilted field geometry, the effect of an in-plane magnetic field on
the even denominator nu = 5/2 fractional quantum Hall state is studied. The
energy gap of the nu = 5/2 state is found to collapse linearly with the
in-plane magnetic field above ~0.5 T. In contrast, a strong enhancement of the
gap is observed for the nu = 7/3 state. The radically distinct tilted-field
behaviour between the two states is discussed in terms of Zeeman and
magneto-orbital coupling within the context of the proposed Moore-Read pfaffian
wavefunction for the 5/2 fractional quantum Hall effect.
