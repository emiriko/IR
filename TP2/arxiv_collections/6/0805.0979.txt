We introduce a three-junction SQUID that can be effectively used as an
optimal tunable element in Josephson quantum computing applications. This
device can replace the simple dc SQUID generally used as tunable element in
this kind of applications, with a series of advantages for the coherence time
and for the tolerance to small errors. We study the device both theoretically
and experimentally at 4.2 K, obtaining a good agreement between the results.
