Graphity models are characterized by configuration spaces in which states
correspond to graphs and Hamiltonians that depend on local properties of graphs
such as the degrees of vertices and numbers of short cycles. As statistical
systems, graphity models can be studied analytically by estimating their
partition functions or numerically by Monte Carlo simulations. Results
presented here are based on both of these approaches and give new information
about the high- and low-temperature behavior of the models and the transitions
between them. In particular, it is shown that matter degrees of freedom must
play an important role in order for the low-temperature regime to be described
by graphs resembling interesting extended geometries.
