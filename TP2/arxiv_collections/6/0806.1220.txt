We have studied quantum spin dynamics of small condensates of cold sodium
atoms. For a condensate initially prepared in a mean field ground state, we
show that coherent spin dynamics are {\em purely} driven by quantum
fluctuations of collective spin coordinates and can be tuned by quadratic
Zeeman coupling and magnetization. These dynamics in small condensates can be
probed in a high-finesse optical cavity where temporal behaviors of excitation
spectra of a coupled condensate-photon system reveal the time evolution of
populations of atoms at different hyperfine spin states.
