An important problem in creating efficient public transport is obtaining data
about the set of trips that passengers make, usually referred to as an
Origin/Destination (OD) matrix. Obtaining this data is problematic and
expensive in general, especially in the case of buses because on-board
ticketing systems do not record where and when passengers get off a bus. In
this paper we describe a novel and inexpensive system that uses off-the-shelf
Bluetooth hardware to accurately record passenger journeys. Here we show how
our system can be used to derive passenger OD matrices, and additionally we
show how our data can be used to further improve public transport services.
