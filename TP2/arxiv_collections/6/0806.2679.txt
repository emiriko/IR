One-dimensional Yang-Mills Equations are considered from a point of view of a
class of nonlinear Klein-Gordon-Fock models. The case of self-dual Nahm
equations and non-self-dual models are discussed. A quasiclassical quantization
of the models is performed by means of generalized zeta-function and its
representation in terms of a Green function diagonal for a heat equation with
the correspondent potential. It is used to evaluate the functional integral and
quantum corrections to mass in the quasiclassical approximation.
  Quantum corrections to a few periodic (and kink) solutions of the Nahm as a
particular case of the Ginzburg-Landau (phi-in-quadro) and and Sin-Gordon
models are evaluated in arbitrary dimensions. The Green function diagonal for
heat equation with a finite-gap potential is constructed by universal
description via solutions of Hermit equation. An alternative approach based on
Baker-Akhiezer functions for KP equation is proposed . The generalized
zeta-function and its derivative at zero point as the quantum corrections to
mass is expressed in terms of elliptic integrals.
