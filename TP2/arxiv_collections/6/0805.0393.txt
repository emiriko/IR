It is proposed a novel design of an X-ray monochromator which uses three
crystals. The exit beam turns in horizontal plane on the angle $2\alpha$ with
respect to the incoming beam. So, this kind of monochromator is suitable for
side beam-lines; several tunable beam-lines can be built for a one fan beam of
synchrotron radiation (from wiggler or bending magnet).
  In contrast to the double-crystal scheme of general position considered
previously (which also suitable for side beam-lines), the new variant does not
lead to a tilt of exit beam profile.
