We compute the energy functional of a three-level Lipkin model via a
Legrendre transform and compare exact numerical results with analytical
solutions obtained from the random phase approximation (RPA). Except for the
region of the phase transition, the RPA solutions perform very well. We also
study the case of three non-degenerate levels and again find that the RPA
solution agrees well with the exact numerical result. For this case, the
analytical results give us insight into the form of the energy functional in
the presence of symmetry-breaking one-body potentials.
