In the two previous papers of this serie, we have created a library, called
Population, dedicated to seeded region growing by pixels aggregation and we
have proposed different growing processes to get a partition with or without a
boundary region to divide the other regions or to get a partition invariant
about the seeded region initialisation order. Using this work, we implement
some algorithms belonging to the field of SRGPA using this library and these
growing processes.
