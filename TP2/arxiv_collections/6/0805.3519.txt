We present experimental results on a Bose gas in a quasi-2D geometry near the
Berezinskii, Kosterlitz and Thouless (BKT) transition temperature. By measuring
the density profile, \textit{in situ} and after time of flight, and the
coherence length, we identify different states of the gas. In particular, we
observe that the gas develops a bimodal distribution without long range order.
In this state, the gas presents a longer coherence length than the thermal
cloud; it is quasi-condensed but is not superfluid. Experimental evidence
indicates that we observe the superfluid transition (BKT transition).
