Free scalar field theory on 2 dimensional flat spacetime, cast in
diffeomorphism invariant guise by treating the inertial coordinates of the
spacetime as dynamical variables, is quantized using LQG type `polymer'
representations for the matter field and the inertial variables. The quantum
constraints are solved via group averaging techniques and, analogous to the
case of spatial geometry in LQG, the smooth (flat) spacetime geometry is
replaced by a discrete quantum structure. An overcomplete set of Dirac
observables, consisting of (a) (exponentials of) the standard free scalar field
creation- annihilation modes and (b) canonical transformations corresponding to
conformal isometries, are represented as operators on the physical Hilbert
space. None of these constructions suffer from any of the `triangulation'
dependent choices which arise in treatments of LQG. In contrast to the standard
Fock quantization, the non- Fock nature of the representation ensures that the
algebra of conformal isometries as well as that of spacetime diffeomorphisms
are represented in an anomaly free manner. Semiclassical states can be analysed
at the gauge invariant level. It is shown that `physical weaves' necessarily
underly such states and that such states display semiclassicality with respect
to, at most, a countable subset of the (uncountably large) set of observables
of type (a). The model thus offers a fertile testing ground for proposed
definitions of quantum dynamics as well as semiclassical states in LQG.
