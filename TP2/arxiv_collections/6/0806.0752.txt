The newly discovered oxypnictide family of superconductors show very high
critical temperatures of up to 55K. Whilst there is growing evidence that
suggests a nodal order parameter, point contact Andreev reflection spectroscopy
can provide crucial information such as the gap value and possibly the number
of energy gaps involved. For the oxygen deficient NdFeAsO0.85 with a Tc of
45.5K, we show that there is clearly a gap value at 4.2K that is of the order
of 7meV, consistent with previous studies on oxypnictides with lower Tc.
Additionally, taking the spectra as a function of gold tip contact pressure
reveals important changes in the spectra which may be indicative of more
complex physics underlying this structure.
