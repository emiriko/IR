This paper deals with a one--dimensional model for granular materials, which
boils down to an inelastic version of the Kac kinetic equation, with
inelasticity parameter $p>0$. In particular, the paper provides bounds for
certain distances -- such as specific weighted $\chi$--distances and the
Kolmogorov distance -- between the solution of that equation and the limit. It
is assumed that the even part of the initial datum (which determines the
asymptotic properties of the solution) belongs to the domain of normal
attraction of a symmetric stable distribution with characteristic exponent
$\a=2/(1+p)$. With such initial data, it turns out that the limit exists and is
just the aforementioned stable distribution. A necessary condition for the
relaxation to equilibrium is also proved. Some bounds are obtained without
introducing any extra--condition. Sharper bounds, of an exponential type, are
exhibited in the presence of additional assumptions concerning either the
behaviour, near to the origin, of the initial characteristic function, or the
behaviour, at infinity, of the initial probability distribution function.
