We investigate the possibility of bistable lasing in microcavity lasers as
opposed to bulk lasers. To that end, the dynamic behavior of a microlaser
featuring two coupled, interacting modes is analytically investigated within
the framework of a semiclassical laser model, suitable for a wide range of
cavity shapes and mode geometries. Closed-form coupled mode equations are
obtained for all classes of laser dynamics. We show that bistable operation is
possible in all of these classes. In the simplest case (class-A lasers)
bistability is shown to result from an interplay between coherent
(population-pulsation) and incoherent (hole-burning) processes of mode
interaction. We find that microcavities offer better conditions to achieve
bistable lasing than bulk cavities, especially if the modes are not degenerate
in frequency. This results from better matching of the spatial intensity
distribution of microcavity modes. In more complicated laser models (class-B
and class-C) bistability is shown to persist for modes even further apart in
frequency than in the class-A case. The predictions of the coupled mode theory
have been confirmed using numerical finite-difference time-domain calculations.
