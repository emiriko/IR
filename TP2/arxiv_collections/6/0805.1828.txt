We report the results of the X-ray diffraction study of B2O3 glass in the
pressure interval up to 10 GPa in the 300-700 K temperature range, the results
of in-situ volumetric measurements of the glass at pressures up to 9 GPa at
room temperature, and first-principles simulations data at pressures up to
250GPa. The behavior of B2O3 glass under pressure can be described as two broad
pressure-overlapping transitions. The first transition starts at P > 1 GPa and
proceeds without any changes in thecoordination number of the boron atoms; the
other one starts at P > 5 GPa and is accompanied by a gradual increase of
coordination number. The second transition is completely reversible; the
residual densification of the B2O3 glass after decompression is associated with
the incomplete reversibility of the first transformation. The fraction of boron
atoms transferred to the 4-coordination state in the glass at P < 10 GPa is
much smaller than was assumed from indirect experimental data [4], but is
considerably larger (by tens of times) than was previously suggested by the
classical molecular dynamics simulations [5,6]. The observed transformations
under both compression and decompression are quite broad, contrary to the
assumption in Ref. [7]. On the basis of ab-initio results, we also predict the
one more transformation under higher pressures to a super-dense phase, in which
B atoms become 5- and 6-fold coordinated.
