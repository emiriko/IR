Recently, arising from an enlighting analysis of Baskaran and Grishchuk in
Class. Quant. Grav. 21, 4041-4061 (2004), some papers in the literature have
shown the presence and importance of the so-called "magnetic" components of
gravitational waves (GWs), which have to be taken into account in the context
of the total response functions of interferometers for GWs propagating from
arbitrary directions. In Int. Journ. Mod. Phys. A 22, 13, 2361-2381 (2007) and
Int. J. Mod. Phys. D 16, 9, 1497-1517 (2007) accurate response functions for
the Virgo and LIGO interferometers have been analysed. However, some results
which have been shown in Int. Journ. Mod. Phys. A 22, 13, 2361-2381 (2007) look
in contrast with the results which have been shown in Int. J. Mod. Phys. D 16,
9, 1497-1517 (2007). In fact, in Int. Journ. Mod. Phys. A 22, 13, 2361-2381
(2007) it was claimed that the "magnetic" component of GWs could, in principle,
extend the frequency range of Earth based interferometers, while in Int. J.
Mod. Phys. D 16, 9, 1497-1517 (2007) such a possibility has been banned. This
contrast has been partially solved in the Proceedings of the XLIInd Rencontres
de Moriond, Gravitational Waves and Experimental Gravity, La Thuile, Val
d'Aosta Italy (March 12-18 2007). The aim of this review paper is to re-analyse
all the framework of the "magnetic" components of GWs with the goal of solving
the mentioned contrast in definitive way. Accurate response funtions for the
Virgo and LIGO interferometers will be also re-discussed in detail.
