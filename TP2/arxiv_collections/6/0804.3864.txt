We study theoretically the current-induced magnetic domain wall motion in a
metallic nanowire with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. The anisotropy can
reduce the critical current density of the domain wall motion. We explain the
reduction mechanism and identify the maximal reduction conditions. This result
facilitates both fundamental studies and device applications of the current-
induced domain wall motion.
