Gluinos are expected to be one of the most massive sparticles (supersymmetric
partners of usual particles) which constitute the Minimal Supersymmetric
Standard Model (MSSM). The gluinos are the partners of the gluons and they are
color octet fermions, due this fact they can not mix with the other particles.
Therefore in several scenarios, given at SPS convention, they are the most
massive particles and their nature is a Majorana fermion. Therefore their
production is only feasible at a very energetic machine such as the Large
Hadron Collider (LHC). Being the fermion partners of the gluons, their role and
interactions are directly related with the properties of the supersymmetric QCD
(sQCD). We review the mechanisms for producing gluinos at the LHC and
investigate the total cross section and differential distributions, making an
analysis of their uncertainties, such as the gluino and squark masses, as
obtained in several scenarios, commenting on the possibilities of
discriminating among them.
