The Zaller theory of opinion formation is reformulated with one free
parameter $\mu$, which measures the largest possible ideological distance which
can be made by a citizen in one mental step. Our numerical results show the
transient effects: {\it i)} the political awareness, measured by the number of
received messages, increases with time first exponentially, later linearly;
{\it ii)} for small $\mu$ correlations are present between previously and newly
received messages; {\it iii)} these correlation lead to a hyperdiffusion effect
in the space of attitudes of messages. Citizens with small $\mu$ are more prone
to extremal opinions.
