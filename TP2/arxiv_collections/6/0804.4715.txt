A recent breakthrough in the theory of (type A) Macdonald polynomials is due
to Haglund, Haiman and Loehr, who exhibited a combinatorial formula for these
polynomials in terms of a pair of statistics on fillings of Young diagrams. The
inversion statistic, which is the more intricate one, suffices for specializing
a closely related formula to one for the type A Hall-Littlewood Q-polynomials
(spherical functions on p-adic groups). An apparently unrelated development, at
the level of arbitrary finite root systems, led to Schwer's formula (rephrased
and rederived by Ram) for the Hall-Littlewood P-polynomials of arbitrary type.
The latter formula is in terms of so-called alcove walks, which originate in
the work of Gaussent-Littelmann and of the author with Postnikov on discrete
counterparts to the Littelmann path model. In this paper, we relate the above
developments, by deriving a Haglund-Haiman-Loehr type formula for the
Hall-Littlewood P-polynomials of type A from Ram's version of Schwer's formula
via a "compression" procedure.
