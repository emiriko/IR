In this paper we present a new thermodynamically consistent phase transition
model describing the evolution of a liquid substance, e.g., water, in a rigid
container $\Omega$ when we freeze the container. Since the density
$\varrho_{2}$ of ice with volume fraction $\beta_{2}$, is lower than the
density $\varrho_{1}$ of water with volume fraction $\beta_{1}$, experiments -
for instance the freezing of a glass bottle filled with water - show that the
water pressure increases up to the rupture of the bottle. When the container is
not impermeable, freezing may produce a non-homogeneous material, for instance
water ice or sorbet. Here we describe a general class of phase transition
processes including this example as particular case. Moreover, we study the
resulting nonlinear and singular PDE system from the analytical viewpoint
recovering existence of a global (in time) weak solution and also uniqueness
for some particular choices of the nonlinear functions involved.
