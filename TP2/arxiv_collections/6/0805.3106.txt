Early data of the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the LHC will allow us to
measure the cross sections for beauty and heavy quarkonia production in
proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 14 TeV to a reasonable
precision. Different experimental approaches employing single or di-muon
triggered events and b-tagging methods are discussed. The potential for
extracting the polarization of vector states from the decays J/psi to mu+ mu-
and Y to mu+ mu- is presented.
