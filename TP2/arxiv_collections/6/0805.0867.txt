We show that the Plancherel measure of the lamplighter random walk on a graph
coincides with the expected spectral measure of the absorbing random walk on
the Bernoulli percolation clusters. In the subcritical regime the spectrum is
pure point and we construct a complete orthonormal basis of finitely supported
eigenfunctions.
