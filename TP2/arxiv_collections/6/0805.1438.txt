We investigate theoretically resonant tunneling through double-bended
graphene nanoribbon structures, i.e., armchair-edged graphene nanoribbons
(AGNRs) in between two semi-infinite zigzag graphene nanoribbon (ZGNR) leads.
Our numerical results demonstrate that the resonant tunneling can be tuned
dramatically by the Fermi energy and the length and/or widths of the AGNR for
both the metallic and semiconductor-like AGNRs. The structure can also be use
to control the valley polarization of the tunneling currents and could be
useful for potential application in valleytronics devices.
