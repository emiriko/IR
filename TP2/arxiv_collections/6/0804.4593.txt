Ultra-cold atoms can be manipulated using microfabricated devices known as
atom chips. These have significant potential for applications in sensing,
metrology and quantum information processing. To date, the chips are loaded by
transfer of atoms from an external, macroscopic magneto-optical trap (MOT) into
microscopic traps on the chip. This transfer involves a series of steps, which
complicate the experimental procedure and lead to atom losses. In this paper we
present a design for integrating a MOT into a silicon wafer by combining a
concave pyramidal mirror with a square wire loop. We describe how an array of
such traps has been fabricated and we present magnetic, thermal and optical
properties of the chip.
