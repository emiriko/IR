We study a class of spherically symmetric Stephani cosmological models in the
presence of a self-interacting scalar field in both classical and quantum
domains. We discuss the construction of `canonical' wave packets resulting from
the solutions of a class of Wheeler-DeWitt equations in the Stephani Universe.
We suggest appropriate initial conditions which result in wave packets
containing some desirable properties, most importantly good classical and
quantum correspondence. We also study the situation from de-Broglie Bohm
interpretation of quantum mechanics to recover the notion of time and compare
the classical and Bohmian results. We exhibit that the usage of the canonical
prescription and appropriate choices of expansion coefficients result in the
suppression of the quantum potential and coincidence between classical and
Bohmian results. We show that, in some cases, contrary to
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker case, the bound state solutions also exist for all
positive values of the cosmological constant.
