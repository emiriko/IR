We propose an alternative fidelity measure (namely, a measure of the degree
of similarity) between quantum states and benchmark it against a number of
properties of the standard Uhlmann-Jozsa fidelity. This measure is a simple
function of the linear entropy and the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product between
the given states and is thus, in comparison, not as computationally demanding.
It also features several remarkable properties such as being jointly concave
and satisfying all of "Jozsa's axioms". The trade-off, however, is that it is
supermultiplicative and does not behave monotonically under quantum operations.
In addition, new metrics for the space of density matrices are identified and
the joint concavity of the Uhlmann-Jozsa fidelity for qubit states is
established.
