The potential concept that is successful in classical electrodynamics should
also be applicable to the nonlinear electromagnetic forces acting on matter.
The obvious method of determining these potentials should be provided by
Helmholtz's theorem. It is found, however, that the theorem fails in most
practical instances. Other methods to find the potentials - as pursued in
plasma physics - are examined and found to yield functions which depend on the
chosen coordinate system. Thus they cannot be considered as invariant
potentials from which physical forces may be derived. Practical consequences of
these mathematical findings are discussed.
