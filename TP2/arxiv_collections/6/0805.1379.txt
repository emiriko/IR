We introduce a minimal supersymmetric extension of a higgsless model for
electroweak symmetry breaking in a warped extra dimension. In contrast to the
non supersymmetric version, our model naturally contains a candidate for cold
dark matter. No KK-parity is required, because its stability is guaranteed by
an R-parity. We discuss the regions in parameter that are compatible with the
observed dark matter content of our universe and are allowed by electroweak
precision measurements as well as direct searches.
