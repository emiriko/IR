The inherent coupling of optical and mechanical modes in high finesse optical
microresonators provide a natural, highly sensitive transduction mechanism for
micromechanical vibrations. Using homodyne and polarization spectroscopy
techniques, we achieve shot-noise limited displacement sensitivities of
10^(-19) m Hz^(-1/2). In an unprecedented manner, this enables the detection
and study of a variety of mechanical modes, which are identified as radial
breathing, flexural and torsional modes using 3-dimensional finite element
modelling. Furthermore, a broadband equivalent displacement noise is measured
and found to agree well with models for thermorefractive noise in silica
dielectric cavities. Implications for ground-state cooling, displacement
sensing and Kerr squeezing are discussed.
