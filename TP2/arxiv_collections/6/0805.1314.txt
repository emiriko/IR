We apply the time-convolutionless (TCL) projection operator technique to the
model of a central spin which is coupled to a spin bath via nonuniform
Heisenberg interaction. The second-order results of the TCL method for the
coherences and populations of the central spin are determined analytically and
compared with numerical simulations of the full von Neumann equation of the
total system. The TCL approach is found to yield an excellent approximation in
the strong field regime for the description of both the short-time dynamics and
the long time behavior.
