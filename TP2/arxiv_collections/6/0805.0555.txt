The LanHEP program version 3.0 for Feynman rules generation from the
Lagrangian is described. It reads the Lagrangian written in a compact form,
close to the one used in publications. It means that Lagrangian terms can be
written with summation over indices of broken symmetries and using special
symbols for complicated expressions, such as covariant derivative and strength
tensor for gauge fields. Supersymmetric theories can be described using the
superpotential formalism and the 2-component fermion notation. The output is
Feynman rules in terms of physical fields and independent parameters in the
form of CompHEP model files, which allows one to start calculations of
processes in the new physical model. Alternatively, Feynman rules can be
generated in FeynArts format or as LaTeX table. One-loop counterterms can be
generated in FeynArts format.
