Using Langevin dynamics simulations, we investigate the influence of
polymer-pore interactions on the dynamics of biopolymer translocation through
nanopores. We find that an attractive interaction can significantly change the
translocation dynamics. This can be understood by examining the three
components of the total translocation time $\tau \approx \tau_1+\tau_2+\tau_3$
corresponding to the initial filling of the pore, transfer of polymer from the
\textit{cis} side to the \textit{trans} side, and emptying of the pore,
respectively. We find that the dynamics for the last process of emptying of the
pore changes from non-activated to activated in nature as the strength of the
attractive interaction increases, and $\tau_3$ becomes the dominant
contribution to the total translocation time for strong attraction. This leads
to a new dependence of $\tau$ as a function of driving force and chain length.
Our results are in good agreement with recent experimental findings, and
provide a possible explanation for the different scaling behavior observed in
solid state nanopores {\it vs.} that for the natural $\alpha$-hemolysin
channel.
