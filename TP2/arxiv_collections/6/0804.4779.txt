The central value and theoretical uncertainties on the cross section ratio
sigma_W/sigma_Z at the Tevatron are evaluated using the NNLO calculations and
the latest MSTW PDFs. The partial width, total width and branching ratios of
the W boson in the Standard Model, in the light of the latest electroweak
calculations, are also updated.
