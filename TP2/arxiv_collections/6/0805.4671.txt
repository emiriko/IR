Critical phenomena in globally coupled excitable elements are studied by
focusing on a saddle-node bifurcation at the collective level. Critical
exponents that characterize divergent fluctuations of interspike intervals near
the bifurcation are calculated theoretically. The calculated values appear to
be in good agreement with those determined by numerical experiments. The
relevance of our results to jamming transitions is also mentioned.
