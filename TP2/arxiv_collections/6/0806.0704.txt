We study the interaction of Anderson localized states in an open 1D random
system by varying the internal structure of the sample. As the frequencies of
two states come close, they are transformed into multiply-peaked quasi-extended
modes. Level repulsion is observed experimentally and explained within a model
of coupled resonators. The spectral and spatial evolution of the coupled modes
is described in terms of the coupling coefficient and Q-factors of resonators.
