We have calculated the leading-twist next-to-leading order (NLO), i.e.,
O(alpha_s), correction to the light-cone sum-rules prediction for the
electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon. We have used the Ioffe nucleon
interpolation current and worked in M_N=0 approximation, with M_N being the
mass of the nucleon. In this approximation, only the Pauli form factor F_2
receives a correction and the calculated correction is quite sizable (cca 60%).
The numerical results for the proton form factors show the improved agreement
with the experimental data. We also discuss the problems encountered when going
away from M_N=0 approximation at NLO, as well as, gauge invariance of the
perturbative results. This work presents the first step towards the NLO
accuracy in the light-cone sum rules for baryon form factors.
