Glassy matter, as subjected to high shear rates, exhibit shear thinning :
i.e., the viscosity diminishes with increasing shear rate. Meanwhile one
prominent difference between the transport in micropores and that in macroscale
is the (relatively) larger roughness observed inside micropores. As the pore
size decreases, the surface-to-volume ratio increases and therefore, surface
roughness will greatly affect the transport in micropores. By treating the
glass as a shear-thinning matter and using the rate-dependent model together
with the boundary perturbation method, we can analytically obtain the transport
results up to the second order.
