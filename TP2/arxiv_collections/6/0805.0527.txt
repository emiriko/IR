By the use of complete orthonormal sets of nonrelativistic scalar orbitals
introduced by the author in previous papers the new complete orthonormal basis
sets for two-and four-component spinor wave functions, and Slater spinor
orbitals useful in the quantum-mechanical description of the spin - 1/2
particles by the quasirelativistic and relativistic equations are established
in position, momentum and four-dimensional spaces. These function sets are
expressed through the corresponding nonrelativistic orbitals. The analytical
formulas for overlap integrals over four component relativistic Slater spinor
orbitals with the same screening constants in position space are also derived.
The relations obtained in this study can be useful in the study of different
problems arising in the quasirelativistic and relativistic quantum mechanics
when the position, momentum and four dimensional spaces are employed.
