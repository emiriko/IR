We report on a program of geodetic measurements between 1994 and 2007 which
used the Very Long Baseline Array and up to 10 globally distributed antennas.
One of the goals of this program was to monitor positions of the array at a 1
millimeter level of accuracy and to tie the VLBA into the International
Terrestrial Reference Frame. We describe the analysis of these data and report
several interesting geophysical results including measured station
displacements due to crustal motion, earthquakes, and antenna tilt. In terms of
both formal errors and observed scatter, these sessions are among the very best
geodetic VLBI experiments.
