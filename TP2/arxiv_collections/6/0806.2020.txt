It has recently been shown that the auxiliary field method is an interesting
tool to compute approximate analytical solutions of the Schr\"{o}dinger
equation. This technique can generate the spectrum associated with an arbitrary
potential $V(r)$ starting from the analytically known spectrum of a particular
potential $P(r)$. In the present work, general important properties of the
auxiliary field method are proved, such as scaling laws and independence of the
results on the choice of $P(r)$. The method is extended in order to find
accurate analytical energy formulae for radial potentials of the form $a
P(r)+V(r)$, and several explicit examples are studied. Connections existing
between the perturbation theory and the auxiliary field method are also
discussed.
