We investigate the pion weak decay constant (F_pi) and pion mass (m_pi) at
finite density within the framework of the nonlocal chiral quark model from the
instanton vacuum with the finite quark-number chemical potential (mu) taken
into account. We mainly focus on the Nambu-Goldstone phase below the critical
value of the chemical potential mu_c ~ 320 MeV, which is determined
consistently within the present framework. The breakdown of Lorentz invariance
at finite density being considered, the time (F^t_pi) and space (F^s_pi)
components are computed separately, and the corresponding results turn out to
be: F^t_pi = 82.96 MeV and F^s_pi = 80.29 MeV at mu_c, respectively. Using the
in-medium Gell-Mann-Oakes-Renner (GOR) relation, we show that the pion mass
increases by about 15% at mu_c.
