We use representations and differentiation algorithms of posets, in order to
obtain results concerning unsolved problems on figurate numbers. In particular,
we present criteria for natural numbers which are the sum of three octahedral
numbers, three polygonal numbers of positive rank or four cubes with two of
them equal. Some identities of the Rogers-Ramanujan type involving this class
of numbers are also obtained.
