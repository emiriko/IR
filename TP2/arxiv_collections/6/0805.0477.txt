A pulsed atom laser derived from a Bose-Einstein condensate is used to probe
a second target condensate. The target condensate scatters the incident atom
laser pulse. From the spatial distribution of scattered atoms, one can infer
important properties of the target condensate and its interaction with the
probe pulse. As an example, we measure the s-wave scattering length that, in
low energy collisions, describes the interaction between the |F=1,m_F=-1> and
|F=2,m_F=0> hyperfine ground states in 87Rb.
