We review definitions and properties of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces
attached to Gaussian variables and processes, with a view to applications in
nonparametric Bayesian statistics using Gaussian priors. The rate of
contraction of posterior distributions based on Gaussian priors can be
described through a concentration function that is expressed in the reproducing
Hilbert space. Absolute continuity of Gaussian measures and concentration
inequalities play an important role in understanding and deriving this result.
Series expansions of Gaussian variables and transformations of their
reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces under linear maps are useful tools to compute
the concentration function.
