Many neural learning algorithms require to solve large least square systems
in order to obtain synaptic weights. Moore-Penrose inverse matrices allow for
solving such systems, even with rank deficiency, and they provide minimum-norm
vectors of synaptic weights, which contribute to the regularization of the
input-output mapping. It is thus of interest to develop fast and accurate
algorithms for computing Moore-Penrose inverse matrices. In this paper, an
algorithm based on a full rank Cholesky factorization is proposed. The
resulting pseudoinverse matrices are similar to those provided by other
algorithms. However the computation time is substantially shorter, particularly
for large systems.
