Author offers and researches a new idea - filling tubes by electronic gases.
He shows: If the insulating envelope (cover) of the tube is charged positively,
the electrons within the tube are not attracted to covering. Tube (as a whole)
remains a neutral (uncharged) body. The electron gas in the tube has very low
density and very high conductivity, close to superconductivity. If we take the
density (pressure) of electron gas as equal to atmospheric pressure, the
thickness of insulator film may be very small and the resulting tube is very
light.
  Author shows the offered tubes can be applied to many technical fields. For
example: (1) Transfer of energy over very long distance with very small
electric losses. (2) Design of cheap high altitude electric lines without
masts. (3) Transfer of energy from one continent to another continent through
the ionosphere. (4) Transfer of a plasma beam (which can convey thrust and
energy) from Earth surface to a space ship. (5) Observation of the sky by
telescope without atmospheric hindrances. (6) Dirigibles (air balloons) of the
highest lift force. (7) Increasing of gun range severalfold. (8) Transfer of
matter. And so on.
  Key words: AB tubes, electronic tubes, superconductivity, transmission
energy.
