The present paper deals to the quintom model of dark energy. We introduce a
first-order formalism, which shows how to relate the potential that specifies
the scalar field model to Hubble parameter. Reviewing briefly the quintom
scenario of dark energy, we present a general procedure to solve the equations
of motion for quintom model driven by a couple scalar fields with first-order
differential equations.
