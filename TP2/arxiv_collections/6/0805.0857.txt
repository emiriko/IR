The aim of a joint research and development project at the BME and HWU is to
produce a cheap, reliable, low-power and CMOS-MEMS process compatible
capacitive type relative humidity (RH) sensor that can be incorporated into a
state-of-the-art, wireless sensor network. In this paper we discuss the
preparation of our new capacitive structure based on post-CMOS MEMS processes
and the methods which were used to characterize the thin film porous alumina
sensing layer. The average sensitivity is approx. 15 pF/RH% which is more than
a magnitude higher than the values found in the literature. The sensor is
equipped with integrated resistive heating, which can be used for maintenance
to reduce drift, or for keeping the sensing layer at elevated temperature, as
an alternative method for temperature-dependence cancellation.
