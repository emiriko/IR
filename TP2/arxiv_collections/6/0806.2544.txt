We investigate entanglement properties at quantum phase transitions of an
integrable extended Hubbard model in the momentum space representation. Two
elementary subsystems are recognized: the single mode of an electron, and the
pair of modes (electrons coupled through the eta-pairing mechanism). We first
detect the two/multi-partite nature of each quantum phase transition by a
comparative study of the singularities of Von Neumann entropy and quantum
mutual information. We establish the existing relations between the
correlations in the momentum representation and those exhibited in the
complementary picture: the direct lattice representation. The presence of
multipartite entanglement is then investigated in detail through the Q-measure,
namely a generalization of the Meyer-Wallach measure of entanglement. Such a
measure becomes increasingly sensitive to correlations of a multipartite nature
increasing the size of the reduced density matrix. In momentum space, we
succeed in obtaining the latter for our system at arbitrary size and we relate
its behaviour to the nature of the various QPTs.
