Diamond thin films were growth using Tequila as precursor by Pulsed Liquid
Injection Chemical Vapor Deposition (PLI-CVD) onto both silicon (100) and
stainless steel 304 at 850 C. The diamond films were characterized by Scanning
Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Raman spectroscopy. The spherical crystallites
(100 to 400 nm) show the characteristic 1332 cm-1 Raman band of diamond.
