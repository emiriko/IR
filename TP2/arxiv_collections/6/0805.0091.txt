Using the Cryogenic, High-Accuracy Refraction Measuring System (CHARMS) at
NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, we have measured the absolute refractive
index of five specimens taken from a very large boule of Corning 7980 fused
silica from temperatures ranging from 30 to 310 K at wavelengths from 0.4 to
2.6 microns with an absolute uncertainty of +/-1 x 10^-5. Statistical
variations in derived values of the thermo-optic coefficient (dn/dT) are at the
+/-2 x 10^-8/K level. Graphical and tabulated data for absolute refractive
index, dispersion, and thermo-optic coefficient are presented for selected
wavelengths and temperatures along with estimates of uncertainty in index.
Coefficients for temperature-dependent Sellmeier fits of measured refractive
index are also presented to allow accurate interpolation of index to other
wavelengths and temperatures. We compare our results to those from an
independent investigation (which used an interferometric technique for
measuring index changes as a function of temperature) whose samples were
prepared from the same slugs of material from which our prisms were prepared in
support of the Kepler mission. We also compare our results with sparse
cryogenic index data from measurements of this material from the literature.
