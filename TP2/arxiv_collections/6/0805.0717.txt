The forward photoproduction amplitude for gamma p to Upsilon p is calculated
in a pQCD k_t-factorization approach with an unintegrated gluon distribution
constrained by inclusive deep-inelastic structure functions. The total cross
section for diffractive Upsilons is compared with a recent HERA data. We also
discuss the 2S/1S ratio in diffractive Upsilon-production. The amplitude is
used to predict the cross section for exclusive Upsilon production in hadronic
reactions. Differential distributions for the exclusive p pbar to p Upsilon
pbar process are calculated for Tevatron energies. We also show predictions for
LHC. Absorption effects are included.
