We describe an electron spectrometer designed for a precision measurement of
the neutron $\beta$-asymmetry with spin-polarized ultracold neutrons. The
spectrometer consists of a 1.0-Tesla solenoidal field with two identical
multiwire proportional chamber and plastic scintillator electron detector
packages situated within 0.6-Tesla field-expansion regions. Select results from
performance studies of the spectrometer with calibration sources are reported.
