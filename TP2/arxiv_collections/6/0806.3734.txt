We assess the reliability of the recently developed approach denominated
Dominant Reaction Pathways (DRP) by studying the folding of a 16-residue
beta-hairpin, within a coarse-grained Go-type model. We show that the DRP
predictions are in quantitative agreement with the results of Molecular
Dynamics simulations, performed in the same model. On the other hand, in the
DRP approach, the computational difficulties associated to the decoupling of
time scales are rigorously bypassed. The analysis of the important transition
pathways supports a picture of the beta-hairpin folding in which the reaction
is initiated by the collapse of the hydrophobic cluster.
