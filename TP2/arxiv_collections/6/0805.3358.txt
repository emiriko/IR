We present the result for the first moment of the scalar and axial-vector
current correlator in third order of the strong coupling constant alpha_s and
give the details of a recent evaluation of the pseudo-scalar correlator. The
results can be used to reduce the theoretical uncertainty due to higher order
corrections for the determination of fundamental parameters of QCD in the
context of lattice calculations.
