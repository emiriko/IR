In this chapter, we present and discuss a new generalized proportional
conflict redistribution rule. The Dezert-Smarandache extension of the
Demster-Shafer theory has relaunched the studies on the combination rules
especially for the management of the conflict. Many combination rules have been
proposed in the last few years. We study here different combination rules and
compare them in terms of decision on didactic example and on generated data.
Indeed, in real applications, we need a reliable decision and it is the final
results that matter. This chapter shows that a fine proportional conflict
redistribution rule must be preferred for the combination in the belief
function theory.
