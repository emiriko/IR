The paper deals with the study of superfluidity by a Ginzburg-Landau model
that investigates the material by a second order phase transition, in which any
particle has simultaneouly a normal and superfluid motion. This pattern is able
to describe the classical effects of superfluidity as the phase diagram, the
vortices, the second sound and the thermomechanical effect. Finally, the
vorticities and turbulence are described by an extension of the model in which
the material time derivative is used
