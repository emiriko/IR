The properties of a class of topological quantum phase transition (TQPT) are
analyzed based on a model proposed by Haldane. We study the effect of finite
temperature on this phase transition. We have found that finite temperature
would drive this TQPT to be a crossover, while it is stable against the weak
short range interaction. When the interaction is strong enough, however, this
TQPT is unstable and other states would emerge. Then we investigate the effect
of the on-site energy in the original haldane model. The critical difference
between our TQPT and the topological phase transition in conventional quantum
Hall system is discussed. Finally, we discuss the potential application of our
analysis to a topological phase transition proposed in a realistic system.
