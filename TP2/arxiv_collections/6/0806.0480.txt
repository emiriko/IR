An SO(5)xU(1) gauge-Higgs unification model in the Randall-Sundrum warped
space with top and bottom quarks is constructed. Additional fermions on the
Planck brane make exotic particles heavy by effectively changing boundary
conditions of bulk fermions from those determined by orbifold conditions. Gauge
couplings of a top quark multiplet trigger electroweak symmetry breaking by the
Hosotani mechanism, simultaneously giving a top quark the observed mass. The
bottom quark mass is generated by combination of brane interactions and the
Hosotani mechanism, where only one ratio of brane masses is relevant when the
scale of brane masses is much larger than the Kaluza-Klein scale (\sim 1.5
TeV). The Higgs mass is predicted to be 49.9 (53.5) GeV for the warp factor
10^{15} (10^{17}). The Wilson line phase turns out \pi/2 and the Higgs
couplings to W and Z vanish so that the LEP2 bound for the Higgs mass is
evaded. In the flat spacetime limit the electroweak symmetry is unbroken.
