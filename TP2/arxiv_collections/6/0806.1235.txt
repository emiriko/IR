Conformal technicolor is a paradigm for new physics at LHC that may solve the
problems of strong electroweak symmetry breaking for quark masses and precision
electroweak data. We give explicit examples of conformal technicolor theories
based on a QCD-like sector. We suggest a practical method to test the conformal
dynamics of these theories on the lattice.
