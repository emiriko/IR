We describe algorithms, and experimental strategies, for the Pareto optimal
control problem of simultaneously driving an arbitrary number of quantum
observable expectation values to their respective extrema. Conventional quantum
optimal control strategies are less effective at sampling points on the Pareto
frontier of multiobservable control landscapes than they are at locating
optimal solutions to single observable control problems. The present algorithms
facilitate multiobservable optimization by following direct paths to the Pareto
front, and are capable of continuously tracing the front once it is found to
explore families of viable solutions. The numerical and experimental
methodologies introduced are also applicable to other problems that require the
simultaneous control of large numbers of observables, such as quantum optimal
mixed state preparation.
