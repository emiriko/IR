Using isospin relations, we predict the Standard-Model correlation between
S_{pi^0 K_S}=(sin 2beta)_{pi^0 K_S} and A_{pi^0 K_S}, the mixing-induced and
direct CP asymmetries of B^0-> pi^0 K_S. The calculation uses flavour SU(3)
only to fix the isospin-3/2 amplitude through the B^\pm->pi^\pm pi^0 branching
ratio, and thus has a small irreducible theoretical error. It can reach percent
level precision thanks to expected future lattice-QCD progress for the
calculation of the relevant SU(3)-breaking form-factor ratio, and serves as a
benchmark for new-physics searches. We obtain an interesting picture in the
A_{pi^0 K_S} - S_{pi^0 K_S} plane, where the current experimental data show a
discrepancy with the Standard Model, and comment on the direct CP asymmetries
of B^0->pi^-K^+ and B^+ -> pi^0 K^+. A modified electroweak penguin with a
large new CP-violating phase can explain the discrepancy and allows us to
accommodate also the corresponding data for other b->s penguin-dominated
decays.
