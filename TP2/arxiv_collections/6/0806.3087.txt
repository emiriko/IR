We implement the seesaw mechanism in the 3-3-1 model with right-handed
neutrinos. This is accomplished by the introduction of a scalar sextet into the
model and the spontaneous violation of the lepton number. We identify the
Majoron as a singlet under $SU_L(2)\otimes U_Y(1)$ symmetry, which makes it
safe under the current bounds imposed by electroweak data. The main result of
this work is that the seesaw mechanism works already at TeV scale with the
outcome that the right-handed neutrino masses lie in the electroweak scale, in
the range from MeV to tens of GeV. This window provides a great opportunity to
test their appearance at current detectors, though when we contrast our results
with some previous analysis concerning detection sensitivity at LHC, we
conclude that further work is needed in order to validate this search.
