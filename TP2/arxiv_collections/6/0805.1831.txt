We propose a technique capable of imaging a distinct physical object with
sub-Rayleigh resolution in an ordinary far-field imaging setup using
single-photon sources and linear optical tools only. We exemplify our method
for the case of a rectangular aperture and two or four single-photon emitters
obtaining a resolution enhanced by a factor of two or four, respectively.
