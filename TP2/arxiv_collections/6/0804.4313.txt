The structural, elastic and electronic properties of ReN are investigated by
first-principles calculations based on density functional theory. Two competing
structures, i.e., CsCl-like and NiAs-like structures, are found and the most
stable structure, NiAs-like, has a hexagonal symmetry which belongs to space
group P63/mmc with a=2.7472 and c=5.8180 \AA. ReN with hexagonal symmetry is a
metal ultra-incompressible solid and has less elastic anisotropy. The
ultra-incompressibility of ReN is attributed to its high valence electron
density and strong covalence bondings. Calculations of density of states and
charge density distribution, together with Mulliken atomic population analysis,
show that the bondings of ReN should be a mixture of metallic, covalent, and
ionic bondings. Our results indicate that ReN can be used as a potential
ultra-incompressible conductor. In particular, we obtain a superconducting
transition temperature T$_c$=4.8 K for ReN.
