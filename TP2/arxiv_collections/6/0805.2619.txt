X-ray refraction and absorption by neon atoms under the influence of an 800
nm laser with an intensity of 10^13 W/cm^2 is investigated. For this purpose,
we use an ab initio theory suitable for optical strong-field problems. Its
results are interpreted in terms of a three-level model. On the Ne 1s --> 3p
resonance, we find electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) for x rays.
Our work opens novel perspectives for ultrafast x-ray pulse shaping.
