It is shown that in supersymmetric SU(N) models with N>5 the so-called doubly
lopsided mass matrix structure can emerge in a natural way. The non-trivial
flavor structure is entirely accounted for by the SU(N) gauge symmetry and
supersymmetry, without any flavor symmetry. The hierarchy among the families
results directly from a hierarchy of scales in the chain of breaking from
SU(N)to the Standard Model group. A simple SU(7) example is presented.
