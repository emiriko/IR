In this paper, the authors develop a method of detecting correlations between
epidemic patterns in different regions that are due to human movement and
introduce a null model in which the travel-induced correlations are cancelled.
They apply this method to the well-documented cases of seasonal influenza
outbreaks in the United States and France. In the United States (using data for
1972-2002), the authors observed strong short-range correlations between
several states and their immediate neighbors, as well as robust long-range
spreading patterns resulting from large domestic air-traffic flows. The
stability of these results over time allowed the authors to draw conclusions
about the possible impact of travel restrictions on epidemic spread. The
authors also applied this method to the case of France (1984-2004) and found
that on the regional scale, there was no transportation mode that clearly
dominated disease spread. The simplicity and robustness of this method suggest
that it could be a useful tool for detecting transmission channels in the
spread of epidemics.
