Let $P$ be a probability distribution on $\mathbb{R}^d$ (equipped with an
Euclidean norm $|\cdot|$). Let $ r> 0 $ and let $(\alpha_n)_{n \geq1}$ be an
(asymptotically) $L^r(P)$-optimal sequence of $n$-quantizers. We investigate
the asymptotic behavior of the maximal radius sequence induced by the sequence
$(\alpha_n)_{n \geq1}$ defined for every $n \geq1$ by $\rho(\alpha_n) =
\max{|a|, a \in\alpha_n}$. When $\card(\supp(P))$ is infinite, the maximal
radius sequence goes to $\sup{|x|, x \in\operatorname{supp}(P)}$ as $n$ goes to
infinity. We then give the exact rate of convergence for two classes of
distributions with unbounded support: distributions with hyper-exponential
tails and distributions with polynomial tails. In the one-dimensional setting,
a sharp rate and constant are provided for distributions with hyper-exponential
tails.
