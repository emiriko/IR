Transverse energy ($E_T$) has been measured with both of its components,
namely hadronic ($E_T^{had}$) and electromagnetic ($E_T^{em}$) in a common
phase space at mid-rapidity for 62.4 GeV Au+Au collisions by the STAR
experiment. $E_T$ production with centrality and $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ is studied
with similar measurements from SPS to RHIC and is compared with a final state
gluon saturation model (EKRT). The most striking feature is the observation of
a nearly constant value of $E_T/N_{ch} \sim 0.8$ GeV from AGS, SPS to RHIC. The
initial energy density estimated by the boost-invariant Bjorken hydrodynamic
model, is well above the critical density for a deconfined matter of quarks and
gluons predicted by lattice QCD calculations.
