We extend the concept of classicality in quantum optics to spin states. We
call a state ``classical'' if its density matrix can be decomposed as a
weighted sum of angular momentum coherent states with positive weights.
Classical spin states form a convex set C, which we fully characterize for a
spin-1/2 and a spin-1. For arbitrary spin, we provide ``non-classicality
witnesses''. For bipartite systems, C forms a subset of all separable states. A
state of two spins-1/2 belongs to C if and only if it is separable, whereas for
a spin-1/2 coupled to a spin-1, there are separable states which do not belong
to C. We show that in general the question whether a state is in C can be
answered by a linear programming algorithm.
