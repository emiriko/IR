Grainy numbers are defined as tuples of bits. They form a lattice where the
meet and the join operations are an addition and a multiplication. They may be
substituted for the real numbers in the definition of fuzzy sets. The aim is to
propose an alternative negation for the complement that we'll call supplement.
