A new theoretical model for self dynamic response is developed using
Vibration-Transit (V-T) theory, and is applied to liquid sodium at all
wavevectors q from the hydrodynamic regime to the free particle limit. In this
theory the zeroth-order Hamiltonian describes the vibrational motion in a
single random valley harmonically extended to infinity. This Hamiltonian is
tractable, is evaluated a priori for monatomic liquids, and the same
Hamiltonian (the same set of eigenvalues and eigenvectors) is used for
equilibrium and nonequlibrium theory. Here, for the self intermediate
scattering function Fself(q,t) we find the vibrational contribution is in near
perfect agreement with molecular dynamics (MD) through short and intermediate
times, at all q. This is direct confirmation that normal mode vibrational
correlations are present in the motion of the liquid state. The primary transit
effect is diffusive motion of the vibrational equilibrium positions, as the
liquid transits rapidly among random valleys. This motion is modeled as a
standard random walk, and the resulting theoretical Fself(q,t) is in excellent
agreement with MD results at all q and t. In the limit for q to infinity, the
theory automatically exhibits the correct approach to the free-particle limit.
Also in the limit for q to zero, the hydrodynamic limit emerges as well. In
contrast to the benchmark theories of generalized hydrodynamics and mode
coupling, the present theory is near a priori, while achieving modestly better
accuracy. Therefore, in our view, it constitutes an improvement over the
traditional theories.
