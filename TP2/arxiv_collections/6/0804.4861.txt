We characterize the interaction between a single atom or similar microscopic
system and a light field via the scattering ratio. For that, we first derive
the electrical field in a strongly focused Gaussian light beam, and then
consider the atomic response. Following the simple scattering model, the
fraction of scattered optical power for a weak coherent probe field leads to
unphysical scattering ratios above 1 in the strong focusing regime. A refined
model considering interference between exciting and scattered field into
finite-sized detectors or optical fibers is presented, and compared to
experimental extinction measurements for various focusing strengths.
