The assumption of a flat prior distribution plays a critical role in the
anthropic prediction of the cosmological constant. In a previous paper we
analytically calculated the distribution for the cosmological constant,
including the prior and anthropic selection effects, in a large toy
``single-jump'' landscape model. We showed that it is possible for the fractal
prior distribution we found to behave as an effectively flat distribution in a
wide class of landscapes, but only if the single jump size is large enough. We
extend this work here by investigating a large ($N \sim 10^{500}$) toy
``multi-jump'' landscape model. The jump sizes range over three orders of
magnitude and an overall free parameter $c$ determines the absolute size of the
jumps. We will show that for ``large'' $c$ the distribution of probabilities of
vacua in the anthropic range is effectively flat, and thus the successful
anthropic prediction is validated. However, we argue that for small $c$, the
distribution may not be smooth.
