In a previous work, the authors proposed a Grammatical Evolution algorithm to
automatically generate Lindenmayer Systems which represent fractal curves with
a pre-determined fractal dimension. This paper gives strong statistical
evidence that the probability distributions of the execution time of that
algorithm exhibits a heavy tail with an hyperbolic probability decay for long
executions, which explains the erratic performance of different executions of
the algorithm. Three different restart strategies have been incorporated in the
algorithm to mitigate the problems associated to heavy tail distributions: the
first assumes full knowledge of the execution time probability distribution,
the second and third assume no knowledge. These strategies exploit the fact
that the probability of finding a solution in short executions is
non-negligible and yield a severe reduction, both in the expected execution
time (up to one order of magnitude) and in its variance, which is reduced from
an infinite to a finite value.
