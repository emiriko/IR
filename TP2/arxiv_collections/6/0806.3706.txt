In this paper we apply Clark-Ocone formula to deduce an explicit integral
representation for the renormalized self-intersection local time of the $d$%
-dimensional fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter $H\in (0,1)$.
  As a consequence, we derive the existence of some exponential moments for
this random variable.
