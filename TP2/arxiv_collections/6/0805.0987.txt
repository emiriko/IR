Mixtures are convex combinations of laws. Despite this simple definition, a
mixture can be far more subtle than its mixed components. For instance, mixing
Gaussian laws may produce a potential with multiple deep wells. We study in the
present work fine properties of mixtures with respect to concentration of
measure and Sobolev type functional inequalities. We provide sharp Laplace
bounds for Lipschitz functions in the case of generic mixtures, involving a
transportation cost diameter of the mixed family. Additionally, our analysis of
Sobolev type inequalities for two-component mixtures reveals natural relations
with some kind of band isoperimetry and support constrained interpolation via
mass transportation. We show that the Poincar\'e constant of a two-component
mixture may remain bounded as the mixture proportion goes to 0 or 1 while the
logarithmic Sobolev constant may surprisingly blow up. This counter-intuitive
result is not reducible to support disconnections, and appears as a
reminiscence of the variance-entropy comparison on the two-point space. As far
as mixtures are concerned, the logarithmic Sobolev inequality is less stable
than the Poincar\'e inequality and the sub-Gaussian concentration for Lipschitz
functions. We illustrate our results on a gallery of concrete two-component
mixtures. This work leads to many open questions.
