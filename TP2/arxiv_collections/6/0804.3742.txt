An enquiry into the physical nature of time and space and into the ontology
of quantum mechanics from a metageometric perspective, resulting from the
belief that geometric thought and language are powerless to farther
understanding of these issues, restricting instead physical progress.
  The nature and assumptions of quantum gravity are analysed critically,
including misgivings about the relevance of the Planck scale to it and its lack
of observational referent in the natural world.
  The anthropic foundations of geometry are investigated. The exclusive use of
geometric thought from antiquity to present-day physics is found to permeate
all new attempts towards better theories, including quantum gravity and, within
it, even pregeometry.
  The problem of the ether is found to have perpetuated itself up to the
present by transmuting its form from mechanical, through metric, to geometric.
  A clarification is made of the physical, mathematical, and psychological
foundations of relativity and quantum theories. The former is founded
geometrically on measurement-based clock-reading separations ds. The latter is
founded metageometrically on the experiment-based concepts of premeasurement
and transition things, inspired in the physically unexplored aspect of time as
a consciousness-related product. A concept of metageometric time is developed
and coordinate time t is recovered from it. Discovery of the connection between
quantum-mechanical metageometric time elements and general-relativistic clock
time elements ds is deemed necessary for a combined understanding of time.
  Time is conjectured to be the missing link between general relativity and
quantum mechanics.
