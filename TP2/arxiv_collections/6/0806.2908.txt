In a previous paper, the authors determined, among other things, the main
terms for the one-level densities for low-lying zeros of symmetric power
L-functions in the level aspect. In this paper, the lower order terms of these
one-level densities are found. The combinatorial difficulties, which should
arise in such context, are drastically reduced thanks to Chebyshev polynomials,
which are the characters of the irreducible representations of SU(2). %
