We study the signature change in a perfect fluid Friedmann-Robertson-Walker
quantum cosmological model. In this work the Schutz's variational formalism is
applied to recover the notion of time. This gives rise to a
Schrodinger-Wheeler-DeWitt equation with arbitrary ordering for the scale
factor. We use the eigenfunctions in order to construct wave packets and
evaluate the time-dependent expectation value of the scale factor which
coincides with the ontological interpretation. We show that these solutions
exhibit signature transitions from a finite Euclidean to a Lorentzian domain.
Moreover, such models are equivalent to a classical system where, besides the
perfect fluid, a repulsive fluid is present.
