We study the spinodal instabilities of asymmetric nuclear matter at finite
temperature within the microscopic Brueckner--Hartree--Fock (BHF) approximation
using the realistic Argonne V18 nucleon-nucleon potential plus a three-body
force of Urbana type. Our results are compared with those obtained with the
Skyrme force SLy230a and the relativistic mean field models NL3 and TW. We find
that BHF predicts a larger spinodal region. This result is a direct consequence
of the fact that our Brueckner calculation predicts a larger critical
temperature and saturation density of symmetric nuclear matter than the Skyrme
and relativistic mean field ones. We find that the instability is always
dominated by total density fluctuations, in agreement with previous results of
other authors. We study also the restoration of the isospin symmetry in the
liquid phase, {\it i.e.,} the so-called isospin distillation or fragmentation
effect, finding that its efficiency increases with increasing proton fraction
and decreases as temperature and density increase. In general, we find that the
Brueckner results are comparable to those obtained with the Skyrme and the
relativistic mean field models, although the restoration of isospin symmetry is
not so efficient in this case.
