Motivated by speculations about infrared deviations from the standard
behavior of local quantum field theories, we explore the possibility that such
effects might show up as an anomalous running of coupling constants. The most
sensitive probes are presently given by the anomalous magnetic moments of the
electron and the muon, that suggest that alpha_{em} runs 1.00047 +- 0.00018
times faster than predicted by the Standard Model. The running of alpha_{em}
and alpha_s up to the weak scale is confirmed with a precision at the % level.
