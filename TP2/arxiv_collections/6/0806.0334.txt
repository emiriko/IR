Doppler shift observations of several spacecrafts during near Earth flybys
show an unexplained frequency shift. This shift is interpreted as an unexpected
velocity change called Earth flyby anomaly. A theory of non-privileged
reference frames is used to study the Doppler shift in such frames which are
experimentally justified by the measured dipole anisotropy of the cosmic
microwave background (CMB) in the solar system. The system in which the CMB is
isotropic defines the privileged reference frame. The calculated frequency
shift in non-privileged reference frames may give an explanation of the
anomalous Earth flybys.
