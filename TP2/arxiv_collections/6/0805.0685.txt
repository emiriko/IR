The term {\em complexity} is used informally both as a quality and as a
quantity. As a quality, complexity has something to do with our ability to
understand a system or object -- we understand simple systems, but not complex
ones. On another level, {\em complexity} is used as a quantity, when we talk
about something being more complicated than another.
  In this chapter, we explore the formalisation of both meanings of complexity,
which happened during the latter half of the twentieth century.
