The motion of overdamped particles in a one-dimensional spatially-periodic
potential is considered. The potential is also randomly-fluctuating in time,
due to multiplicative colored noise terms, and has a deterministic tilt.
Numerical aimulations show two distinct parameter regimes, corresponding to
free-running near-deterministic particles, and particles which are trapped in
local minima of the potential with intermittent escape flights. Perturbation
and asymptotic methods are developed to understand the drift velocity and
diffusion coefficient in each parameter regime.
