We have performed a temperature-dependent angle-integrated laser
photoemission study of iron oxypnictide superconductors LaFeAsO:F and LaFePO:F
exhibiting critical transition temperatures (Tc's) of 26 K and 5 K,
respectively. We find that high-Tc LaFeAsO:F exhibits a temperature-dependent
pseudogap-like feature extending over ~0.1 eV about the Fermi level at 250 K,
whereas such a feature is absent in low-Tc LaFePO:F. We also find ~20-meV
pseudogap-like features and signatures of superconducting gaps both in
LaFeAsO:F and LaFePO:F. We discuss the possible origins of the unusual
pseudogap-like features through comparison with the high-Tc cuprates.
