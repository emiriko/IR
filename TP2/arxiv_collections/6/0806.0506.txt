This paper concerns the problem of non-ideal state transfer along the
alternating open chain of spins $s=1/2$ with XY Hamiltonian. It is found that
the state transfer along the chain with even number of spins $N$ ($N=4,6,8$)
may be realized with high probability. Privilege of even $N$ in comparison with
odd $N$ is demonstrated.
