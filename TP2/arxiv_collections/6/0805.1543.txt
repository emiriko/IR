We explore the general phenomenology of resonant inelastic scattering (RIXS)
using CuB2O4, a network of CuO4 plaquettes electronically isolated by B+3 ions.
Spectra show a small number of well-separated features, and we exploit the
simple electronic structure to explore RIXS phenomenology by developing a
calculation which allows for intermediate-state effects ignored in standard
approaches. These effects are found to be non-negligible and good
correspondence between our model and experiment leads to a simple picture of
such phenomenology as the genesis of d-d excitations at the K edge and
intermediate-state interference effects.
