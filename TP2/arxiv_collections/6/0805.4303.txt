We consider a long-range Ising antiferromagnet (LRIAF) put in a transverse
field. Applying quantum Monte Carlo method, we study the variation of order
parameter (spin correlation in Trotter time direction), susceptibility and
average energy of the system for various values of the transverse field at
different temperatures. The antiferromagnetic order is seen to get immediately
broken as soon as the thermal or quantum fluctuations are added. We also
discuss the phase diagram for the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model with the
same LRIAF bias, also in presence of a transverse field. We find that while the
antiferromagnetic order is immediately broken as one adds an infinitesimal
transverse field or thermal fluctuation to the system, an infinitesimal SK spin
glass disorder is enough to induce a stable glass order in the antiferromagnet.
This glass order eventually gets destroyed as the thermal or quantum
fluctuations increased beyond their threshold values and the transition to para
phase occurs. Indications of this novel phase transition are discussed. Because
of the presence of full frustration, this surrogate property of the LRIAF for
incubation of stable spin glass phase in it (induced by addition of a small
disorder) should enable eventually the study of classical and quantum spin
glass phases by using some perturbation theory with respect to the disorder.
