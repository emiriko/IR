This is a version submitted to proceedings of sqm09. The space time of hard
interaction induced radiation (collinear, double log) and
jet-QGM-interaction-induced radiation (bremsstrahlung + pionization) is more
clarified. A hand-drawing picture is attached for interested reader. To measure
y=1.2 to 2.2 more suppressed (than y=0) open charm pT spectrum is predicted and
suggested as a good test.
