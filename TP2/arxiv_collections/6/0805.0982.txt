The commensurate $p/q$-filled $n$-component Hubbard chain was investigated by
bosonization and high-precision density-matrix renormalization-group analysis.
It was found that depending on the relation between the number of components
$n$, and the filling parameter $q$, the system shows metallic or insulating
behavior, and for special fillings bond-ordered (dimerized, trimerized,
tetramerized etc.) ground state develops in the insulating phase. A mean-field
analysis shows that this bond ordering is a direct consequence of the
spin-exchange interaction, which plays a crucial role in the one-parameter
Hubbard model -- not only for infinite Coulomb repulsion, but for intermediate
values as well.
