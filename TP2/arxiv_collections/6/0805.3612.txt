We study the dynamical fluctuations of various particle yield ratios at
different incident energies. Assuming that the particle production yields in
the hydronic final state are due to equilibrium chemical processes
($\gamma=1$), the experimental results available so far are compared with the
hadron resonance gas model (HRG) taking into account the limited momentum
acceptance in heavy-ion collisions experiments. Degenerated light and conserved
strange quarks are presumed at all incident energies. At the SPS energies, the
HRG with $\gamma=1$ provides a good description for the measured dynamical
fluctuations in $(K^++K^-)/(\pi^++\pi^-)$. To reproduce the RHIC results,
$\gamma$ should be larger than one. We also studied the dynamical fluctuations
of $(p+\bar{p})/(\pi^++\pi^-)$. It is obvious that the energy-dependence of
these dynamical fluctuations is non-monotonic.
