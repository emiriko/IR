This paper is committed to calculations near a type of future singularity
driven by phantom energy. At the singularities considered, the scale factor
remains finite but its derivative diverges. The general behavior of barotropic
phantom energy producing this singularity is calculated under the assumption
that near the singularity such fluid is the dominant contributor. We use the
semiclassical formula for renormalized stress tensors of conformally invariant
fields in conformally flat spacetimes and analyze the softening/enhancing of
the singularity due to quantum vacuum contributions. This dynamical analysis is
then compared to results from thermodynamical considerations. In both cases,
the vacuum states of quantized scalar and spinor fields strengthen the
accelerating expansion near the singularity whereas the vacuum states of vector
fields weaken it.
