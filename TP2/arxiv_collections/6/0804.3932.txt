Various issues concerned with the design and sensitivity of the Anderson
bridge are discussed. We analyse the circuit using the tools of Network
Analysis to determine the conditions under which the balance may be obtained
with greater sensitivity and discuss how to obtain these under practical
circumstances in an undergraduate laboratory.
