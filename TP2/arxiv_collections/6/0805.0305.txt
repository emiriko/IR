We study the effect of electron-electron interactions in the quasiparticle
dispersion of a graphene bilayer within the Hartree-Fock-Thomas-Fermi theory by
using a four-bands model. We find that the electronic fluid can be described by
a non-interacting-like dispersion but with renormalized parameters. We compare
our results with recent cyclotron resonance experiments in this system.
