We study a scheme for electrical detection, using electron spin resonance, of
coherent vibrations in a molecular single electron level trapped near a
conduction channel. Both equilibrium spin-currents and non-equilibrium spin-
and charge currents are investigated. Inelastic side-band anti-resonances
corresponding to the vibrational modes appear in the electron spin resonance
spectrum.
