It is known that the M2-brane worldvolume superalgebra includes two p-form
central charges that encode the M-theory intersections involving M2-branes. In
this paper we show by explicit computation that the Bagger-Lambert Lagrangian
realizes the M2-brane superalgebra, including also the central extensions.
Solitons of the Bagger-Lambert theory, that are interpreted as worldvolume
realizations of intersecting branes, are shown to saturate a BPS-bound given in
terms of the corresponding central charge.
