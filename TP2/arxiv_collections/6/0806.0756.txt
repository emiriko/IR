For 52 target nuclei with deuteron as projectile, we calculate the reaction
cross sections and elastic scattering angular distributions, as well as the
$\chi^2$ values for 11 kinds of deuteron optical model potentials: our global
deuteron optical potentials and 10 folding optical potentials calculated with 2
phenomenological global nucleon optical potentials given by Koning \textit{et
al}(KD) and by Varner\textit{et al}(CH89), and 8 microscopic nucleon optical
potentials with the generalized Skyrme force parameters(GS1-6) and modified
Skyrme force parameters(SKa, SKb). We find that for constructing the folding
deuteron optical potential, both SKa and SKb are the best Skyrme force
parameters of the microscopic nucleon optical potential proposed by Q. Shen
\textit{et al}.
