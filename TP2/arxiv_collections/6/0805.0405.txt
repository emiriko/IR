The superconducting transition temperature, Tc, of bilayers comprising
underdoped La2-xSrxCuO4 films capped by a thin heavily overdoped metallic
La1.65Sr0.35CuO4 layer, is found to increase with respect to Tc of the bare
underdoped films. The highest Tc is achieved for x = 0.12, close to the
'anomalous' 1/8 doping level, and exceeds that of the optimally-doped bare
film. Our data suggest that the enhanced superconductivity is confined to the
interface between the layers. We attribute the effect to a combination of the
high pairing scale in the underdoped layer with an enhanced phase stiffness
induced by the overdoped film.
