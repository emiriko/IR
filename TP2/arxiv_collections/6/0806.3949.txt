The Quick Medical Reference (QMR) is a compendium of statistical knowledge
connecting diseases to findings (symptoms). The information in QMR can be
represented as a Bayesian network. The inference problem (or, in more medical
language, giving a diagnosis) for the QMR is to, given some findings, find the
probability of each disease. Rejection sampling and likelihood weighted
sampling (a.k.a. likelihood weighting) are two simple algorithms for making
approximate inferences from an arbitrary Bayesian net (and from the QMR
Bayesian net in particular). Heretofore, the samples for these two algorithms
have been obtained with a conventional "classical computer". In this paper, we
will show that two analogous algorithms exist for the QMR Bayesian net, where
the samples are obtained with a quantum computer. We expect that these two
algorithms, implemented on a quantum computer, can also be used to make
inferences (and predictions) with other Bayesian nets.
