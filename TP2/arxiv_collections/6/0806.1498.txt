At tree-level Higgs production in association with a b-quark pair proceeds
through the small Yukawa bottom coupling in the Standard Model. Even in the
limit where this coupling vanishes, electroweak one-loop effects, through the
top-Higgs Yukawa coupling in particular, can still trigger this reaction. This
contribution is small for Higgs masses around 120GeV but it quickly picks up
for higher Higgs masses especially because the one-loop amplitude develops a
leading Landau singularity and new thresholds open up. These effects can be
viewed as the production of a pair of top quarks which rescatter to give rise
to Higgs production through WW fusion. We study the leading Landau singularity
in detail. Since this singularity is not integrable when the one-loop amplitude
is squared, we regulate the cross section by taking into account the width of
the internal top and W particles. This requires that we extend the usual box
one-loop function to the case of imaginary masses. We show how this can be
implemented analytically in our case. We study in some detail the cross section
at the LHC as a function of the Higgs mass and show how some distributions can
be drastically affected compared to the tree-level result.
