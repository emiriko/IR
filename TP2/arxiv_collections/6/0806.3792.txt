The author proposes and investigates his old idea - a living human in space
without the encumbrance of a complex space suit. Only in this condition can
biological humanity seriously attempt to colonize space because all planets of
Solar system (except the Earth) do not have suitable atmospheres. Aside from
the issue of temperature, a suitable partial pressure of oxygen is lacking. In
this case the main problem is how to satiate human blood with oxygen and delete
carbonic acid gas (carbon dioxide). The proposed system would enable a person
to function in outer space without a space suit and, for a long time, without
food. That is useful also in the Earth for sustaining working men in an
otherwise deadly atmosphere laden with lethal particulates (in case of nuclear,
chemical or biological war), in underground confined spaces without fresh air,
under water or a top high mountains above a height that can sustain
respiration.
