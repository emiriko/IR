We show theoretically that a directional dipole wave can be perfectly
reflected by a single point-like oscillating dipole. Furthermore, we find that
in the case of a strongly focused plane wave up to 85 % of the incident light
can be reflected by the dipole. Our results hold for the full spectrum of the
electromagnetic interactions and have immediate implications for achieving
strong coupling between a single propagating photon and a single quantum
emitter.
