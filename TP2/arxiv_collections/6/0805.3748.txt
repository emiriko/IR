Electric and magnetic properties of a high temperature ferromagnetic oxide
semiconductor, cobalt-doped rutile TiO2, are summarized. The cobalt-doped
rutile TiO2 epitaxial thin films with different electron densities and cobalt
contents were grown on r-sapphire substrates with laser molecular beam epitaxy.
Results of magnetization, magnetic circular dichroism, and anomalous Hall
effect measurements were examined for samples with systematically varied
electron densities and cobalt contents. The samples with high electron
densities and cobalt contents show the high temperature ferromagnetism,
suggesting that charge carriers induce the ferromagnetism.
