We study an adaptation to the logarithmic case of the Kobayashi-Eisenman
pseudo-volume form, or rather an adaptation of its variant defined by Claire
Voisin, for which she replaces holomorphic maps by holomorphic
K-correspondences. We define an intrinsic logarithmic pseudo-volume form
\Phi_{X,D} for every pair (X,D) consisting of a complex manifold X and a normal
crossing Weil divisor, the positive part of which is reduced. We then prove
that \Phi_{X,D} is generically non-degenerate when X is projective and K_X+D is
ample. This result is analogous to the classical Kobayashi-Ochiai theorem. We
also show the vanishing of \Phi_{X,D} for a large class of log-K-trivial pairs,
which is an important step in the direction of the Kobayashi conjecture about
infinitesimal measure hyperbolicity in the logarithmic case.
