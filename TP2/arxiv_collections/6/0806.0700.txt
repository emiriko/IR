A modification of the standard product used in local field theory by means of
an associative deformed product is proposed. We present a class of deformed
products, one for every spin S=0,1/2,1, that induces a nonlocal theory,
displaying different form for different fields. This type of deformed product
is naturally supersymmetric and it has an intriguing duality.
