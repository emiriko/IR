We examine the multiple Hamiltonian structure and construct a symplectic
realization of the Volterra model. We rediscover the hierarchy of invariants,
Poisson brackets and master symmetries via the use of a recursion operator. The
rational Volterra bracket is obtained using a negative recursion operator.
