We discuss the complicated resonance structure of the endohedral atom
photoionization cross section. Very strong enhancement and interference
patterns in the photoionization cross-section of the valent and subvalent
subshells of noble gas endohedral atoms A@C60 are demonstrated. It is shown
also that the atomic Giant resonance can be either completely destroyed or
remains almost untouched depending on the velocity of photoelectrons that are
emitted in the resonance's decay process. These effects are results of dynamic
modification of the incoming beam of radiation due to polarization of the
fullerenes electron shell and reflection of photoelectrons be the fullerenes
shell static potential. We have considered the outer np- and subvalent
ns-subshells for Ne, Ar, Kr and Xe noble gas atoms. The modification of the
Giant resonances is considered for a whole sequence of endohedrals with atoms
and ions Xe, Ba, La, Ce+, Ce+4, Eu. The polarization of the fullerene shell is
expressed via the total photoabsorption cross section. The photoelectron
reflection from the static potential is taken into account in the frame of the
so-called bubble potential that is a spherical -type potential.
