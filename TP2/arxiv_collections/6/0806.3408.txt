The dissipative dynamics anticipated in the proof of 't Hooft's existence
theorem -- "For any quantum system there exists at least one deterministic
model that reproduces all its dynamics after prequantization" -- is constructed
here explicitly. We propose a generalization of Liouville's classical phase
space equation, incorporating dissipation and diffusion, and demonstrate that
it describes the emergence of quantum states and their dynamics in the
Schroedinger picture. Asymptotically, there is a stable ground state and two
decoupled sets of degrees of freedom, which transform into each other under the
energy-parity symmetry of Kaplan and Sundrum. They recover the familiar Hilbert
space and its dual. Expectations of observables are shown to agree with the
Born rule, which is not imposed a priori. This attractor mechanism is
applicable in the presence of interactions, to few-body or field theories in
particular.
