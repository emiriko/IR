The purpose of this paper to analyze in some detail the arguably simplest
case of diversity-induced reseonance: that of a system of globally-coupled
linear oscillators subjected to a periodic forcing. Diversity appears as the
parameters characterizing each oscillator, namely its mass, internal frequency
and damping coefficient are drawn from a probability distribution. The main
ingredients for the diversity-induced-resonance phenomenon are present in this
system as the oscillators display a variability in the individual responses but
are induced, by the coupling, to synchronize their responses. A steady state
solution for this model is obtained. We also determine the conditions under
which it is possible to find a resonance effect.
