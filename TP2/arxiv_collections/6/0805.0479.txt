We use QCD sum rule approach to calculate the masses of the ground-state
Lambda_Q and Sigma_Q^(*) baryons. Contributions of the operators up to
dimension six are included in operator product expansion. The resulting heavy
baryonic masses from the calculations are m_{Lambda_b}=5.69 +/- 0.13 GeV, and
m_{Lambda_c}=2.31 +/- 0.19 GeV for Lambda_Q; m_{Sigma_b}=5.73 +/- 0.21 GeV,
m_{Sigma_b^*}=5.81 +/- 0.19 GeV, m_{Sigma_c}=2.40 +/- 0.31 GeV and
m_{Sigma_c^*}=2.56 +/- 0.24 GeV for Sigma_Q^(*), respectively, which are in
good agreement with the experimental values.
