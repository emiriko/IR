The fully unintegrated, off-diagonal quark-quark correlator for a spin-0
hadron is parameterized in terms of so-called generalized parton correlation
functions. Such objects are of relevance for the phenomenology of certain hard
exclusive reactions. In particular, they can be considered as {\it mother
distributions} of generalized parton distributions on the one hand and
transverse momentum dependent parton distributions on the other. Therefore, our
study provides new, model-independent insights into the recently proposed
nontrivial relations between generalized and transverse momentum dependent
parton distributions. As a by-product we obtain the first complete
classification of generalized parton distributions beyond leading twist.
