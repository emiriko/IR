The single largest background to future $\bar{\nu_{\mu}}\to \bar{\nu_e}$
($\nu_\mu \to \nu_e$) oscillation searches is neutral current (NC) $\pi^{0}$
production. MiniBooNE, which began taking antineutrino data in January 2006,
has the world's largest sample of reconstructed $\pi^{0}$'s produced by
antineutrinos. These neutral pions are primarily produced through the $\Delta$
resonance but can also be created through ``coherent production.'' The latter
process is the coherent sum of glancing scatters of antineutrinos off a neutron
or proton, in which the nucleus is kept intact but a $\pi^{0}$ is created. A
signature of this process is a $\pi^{0}$ which is highly forward-going. It is
advantageous to study coherent production using antineutrinos rather than
neutrinos because the ratio of coherent to resonant scattering is enhanced in
antineutrino running. The first measurement of NC coherent $\pi^{0}$ production
in the MiniBooNE antineutrino data is discussed here.
