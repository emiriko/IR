We report here an assessment of carrier multiplication (CM) yields in PbSe
and PbS nanocrystals (NCs) by a quantitative analysis of biexciton and exciton
dynamics in transient photoluminescence decays. Interest in CM, the generation
of more than one electron and hole in a semiconductor after absorption of one
photon, has renewed in recent years because of reports suggesting greatly
increased efficiencies in nanocrystalline materials compared to the bulk form,
in which CM was otherwise too weak to be of consequence in photovoltaic energy
conversion devices. In our PbSe and PbS NC samples, however, we estimate using
transient photoluminescence that at most 0.25 additional e-h pairs are
generated per photon even at energies hv > 5Eg, instead of the much higher
values reported in the literature. We argue by comparing NC CM estimates and
reported bulk values on an absolute energy basis, which we justify as
appropriate on physical grounds, that the data reported thus far are
inconclusive with respect to the importance of nanoscale-specific phenomena in
the CM process.
