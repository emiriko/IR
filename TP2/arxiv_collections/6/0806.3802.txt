Expander graphs have been recently proposed to construct efficient compressed
sensing algorithms. In particular, it has been shown that any $n$-dimensional
vector that is $k$-sparse (with $k\ll n$) can be fully recovered using
$O(k\log\frac{n}{k})$ measurements and only $O(k\log n)$ simple recovery
iterations. In this paper we improve upon this result by considering expander
graphs with expansion coefficient beyond 3/4 and show that, with the same
number of measurements, only $O(k)$ recovery iterations are required, which is
a significant improvement when $n$ is large. In fact, full recovery can be
accomplished by at most $2k$ very simple iterations. The number of iterations
can be made arbitrarily close to $k$, and the recovery algorithm can be
implemented very efficiently using a simple binary search tree. We also show
that by tolerating a small penalty on the number of measurements, and not on
the number of recovery iterations, one can use the efficient construction of a
family of expander graphs to come up with explicit measurement matrices for
this method. We compare our result with other recently developed
expander-graph-based methods and argue that it compares favorably both in terms
of the number of required measurements and in terms of the recovery time
complexity. Finally we will show how our analysis extends to give a robust
algorithm that finds the position and sign of the $k$ significant elements of
an almost $k$-sparse signal and then, using very simple optimization
techniques, finds in sublinear time a $k$-sparse signal which approximates the
original signal with very high precision.
