The preliminary results of J/psi spectra at high transverse momentum
(5<p_T<14 GeV/c) in p+p and Cu+Cu collisions at s_NN = 200 GeV are reported.
The nuclear modification factor is measured to be 0.9+/-0.2 at p_T>5 GeV/c. The
correlations between J/psi and charged hadrons are also studied in p+p
collisions to understand the J/psi production mechanism at high p_T.
