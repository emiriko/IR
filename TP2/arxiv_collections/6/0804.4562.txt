In the first three years of the physics program at the Relativistic Heavy Ion
Collider (RHIC) a picture was established in which the suppression of hadrons
at high transverse momenta (p_T) in central Au+Au collisions is explained by
energy loss of quark and gluon jets in a medium of high color-charge density.
Measurements of single particle spectra for a smaller nucleus (Cu), for
different center-of-mass energies and with higher statistics were performed in
the subsequent years and are used to test predictions and assumptions of jet
quenching models in more detail. The measurements presented here are consistent
with a parton energy loss scenario so that these models can be used to relate
the observed suppression to properties of the created medium.
