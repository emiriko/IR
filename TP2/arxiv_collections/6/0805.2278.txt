We examine the parametrization of the QCD coupling in the Evolution
Equations, including DGLAP. Our conclusion is that the well-known
parametrization, where the argument of the coupling is k^2_{\perp}/\beta or
just k^2_{\perp}, stands only if the lowest integration limit in the transverse
momentum space (the starting point mu^2 of the Q^2 -evolution) obeys the
relation mu >> Lambda_{QCD} \exp {(\pi/2)}, otherwise the coupling should be
replaced by the more complicated expression presented in Eq. (37).
