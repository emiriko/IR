We show that the unparticle action that is made gauge invariant by the
inclusion of an open Wilson line factor can be transformed into the
integral-differential operator action that avoids the use of the Wilson line
factor. The two forms of the action should therefore give the same Feynman
diagrams. We also show that it is relatively easy to construct Feynman diagrams
using the operator action.
