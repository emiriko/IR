We propose to realize the itinerant ferromagnetism of two-component cold
fermionic atoms in the $p$-orbital bands in optical lattices. The band flatness
in the two-dimensional honeycomb lattice dramatically amplifies the interaction
effect driving the ferromagnetic transition even with a relatively weak
repulsive interaction. This scheme has the advantage that the stability of the
system can be maintained without suffering decaying to the molecular state as
one approaches the Feshbach resonance from the side with positive scattering
length. Experimental signatures and detections are also discussed.
