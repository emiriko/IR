The Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) spin interacting model can be defined
on an arbitrary graph. We explain the construction of the AKLT Hamiltonian.
Given certain conditions, the ground state is unique and known as the
Valence-Bond-Solid (VBS) state. It can be used in measurement-based quantum
computation as a resource state instead of the cluster state. We study the VBS
ground state on an arbitrary connected graph. The graph is cut into two
disconnected parts: the block and the environment. We study the entanglement
between these two parts and prove that many eigenvalues of the density matrix
of the block are zero. We describe a subspace of eigenvectors of the density
matrix corresponding to non-zero eigenvalues. The subspace is the degenerate
ground states of some Hamiltonian which we call the block Hamiltonian.
