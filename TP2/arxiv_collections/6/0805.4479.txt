In this paper we imitate the traditional method which is used customarily in
the General Relativity and some mathematical literatures to derive the
Gauss-Codazzi-Ricci equations for dimensional reduction. It would be more
distinct concerning geometric meaning than the vielbein method. Especially, if
the lower dimensional metric is independent of reduced dimensions the
counterpart of the symmetric extrinsic curvature is proportional to the
antisymmetric Kaluza-Klein gauge field strength. For isometry group of internal
space, the SO(n) symmetry and SU(n) symmetry are discussed. And the
Kaluza-Klein instanton is also enquired.
