In a recent work, Dantas and Stilck studied a model that generalizes the
contact process model with diffusion. Our approach, based on the supercritical
expansion, showed that for a weak diffusion regime the crossover exponent
between the directed percolation and compact directed percolation universality
classes was $\phi\approx 2$. However this approach did not work for reduced
diffusion rates higher than $D\approx 0.3$, where $0\leq D\leq 1$ and D=1
corresponds to an infinite diffusion rate. Thus, in the present work we
estimate this crossover exponent for higher diffusion rates using a numerical
simulation approach.
