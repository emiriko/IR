Recently V. Kokilashvili, N. Samko, and S. Samko have proved a sufficient
condition for the boundedness of the Cauchy singular integral operator on
variable Lebesgue spaces with radial oscillating weights over Carleson curves.
This condition is formulated in terms of Matuszewska-Orlicz indices of weights.
We prove a partial converse of their result.
