A model for strangelets at finite temperature is built, in which the quark
masses are dynamically generated. The dynamical chiral symmetry breaking inside
strangelets at finite temperature is investigated. It is found that the chiral
symmetry is going to break spontaneously inside the strangelets at some finite
temperature, and then the masses of strange quarks inside the strangelets
increase as the temperature rises. The phenomenon that strange quark mass
increases with temperature after the chiral symmetry breaks spontaneously is
illustrated by some typical numerical examples.
