We derive a quenched invariance principle for random walks in random
environments whose transition probabilities are defined in terms of weighted
cycles of bounded length. To this end, we adapt the proof for random walks
among random conductances by Sidoravicius and Sznitman (Probab. Theory Related
Fields 129 (2004) 219--244) to the non-reversible setting.
