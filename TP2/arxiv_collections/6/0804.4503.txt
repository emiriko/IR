We perform a detailed study of the critical behavior of the mean field
diluted Ising ferromagnet by analytical and numerical tools. We obtain
self-averaging for the magnetization and write down an expansion for the free
energy close to the critical line. The scaling of the magnetization is also
rigorously obtained and compared with extensive Monte Carlo simulations. We
explain the transition from an ergodic region to a non trivial phase by
commutativity breaking of the infinite volume limit and a suitable vanishing
field. We find full agreement among theory, simulations and previous results.
