Carbon-rich meteorites, carbonaceous chondrites, contain many biologically
relevant organic molecules and delivered prebiotic material to the young Earth.
We present compound-specific carbon isotope data indicating that measured
purine and pyrimidine compounds are indigenous components of the Murchison
meteorite. Carbon isotope ratios for uracil and xanthine of delta13C=+44.5per
mil and +37.7per mil, respectively, indicate a non-terrestrial origin for these
compounds. These new results demonstrate that organic compounds, which are
components of the genetic code in modern biochemistry, were already present in
the early solar system and may have played a key role in life's origin.
