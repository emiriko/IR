We report muon spin relaxation measurements on two Ti3+ containing
perovskites, LaTiO3 and YTiO3, which display long range magnetic order at low
temperature. For both materials, oscillations in the time-dependence of the
muon polarization are observed which are consistent with three-dimensional
magnetic order. From our data we identify two magnetically inequivalent muon
stopping sites. The muon spin relaxation results are compared with the magnetic
structures of these compounds previously derived from neutron diffraction and
muon spin relaxation studies on structurally similar compounds.
