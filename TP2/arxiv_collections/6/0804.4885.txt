SimDialog is a visual editor for dialog in computer games. This paper
presents the design of SimDialog, illustrating how script writers and
non-programmers can easily create dialog for video games with complex branching
structures and dynamic response characteristics. The system creates dialog as a
directed graph. This allows for play using the dialog with a state-based cause
and effect system that controls selection of non-player character responses and
can provide a basic scoring mechanism for games.
