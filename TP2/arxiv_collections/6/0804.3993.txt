The production of e+e- pairs in C+C collisions at 1 GeV/u was investigated
with the HADES experiment at GSI, Darmstadt. In the invariant-mass region $
0.15\: GeV/c^{2} \leq M_{ee} \leq 0.5\: GeV/c^{2}$ the measured pair yield
shows a strong excess above the contribution expected from hadron decays after
freeze-out. The data are in good agreement with the results of the former DLS
experiment for the same system and energy.
