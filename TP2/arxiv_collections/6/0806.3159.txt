The structural properties of the ROFeM (R=La, Nd; M=As, P) materials have
been analyzed by means of electron diffraction, high-resolution
transmission-electron microscopy (TEM) and in-situ cooling TEM observations.
The experimental results demonstrate that the layered ROFeM crystals often
contain a variety of structural defects, such as stacking faults and
small-angle boundaries. The in-situ TEM investigations reveal that, in
association with the remarkable spin-density-wave (SDW) instability near 150 K,
complex structural transitions can be clearly observed in both crystal symmetry
and local microstructure features.
