In this article a simple and easy to install low magnetic field extension of
the SQUID magnetometer Quantum Design MPMS-7 is described. This has been
accomplished by complementing the MPMS-7 magnet control system with a
laboratory current supply for the low magnetic field region (B \leq 200G). This
hard- and software upgrade provides a significant gain in the magnetic field
accuracy up to an order of magnitude compared with the standard instrument's
setup and is improving the resolution to better than 0.01G below 40G. The field
control has been integrated into the Quantum Design MultiVu software for a
transparent and user-friendly operation of this extension. The improvements
achieved are especially useful, when low magnetic field strengths (B < 1G) are
required at high precision. The specific advantages of this application are
illustrated by sophisticated magnetic characterisation of lowdimensional
superconductors like Sc3CoC4 and SnSe2{Co({\eta}-C5H5)2}x.
