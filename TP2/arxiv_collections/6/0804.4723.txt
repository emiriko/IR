In this paper, we estimate how quickly and how precisely a reactor's
operational status and thermal power can be monitored over hour to month time
scales, using the antineutrino rate as measured by a cubic meter scale
detector. Our results are obtained from a detector we have deployed and
operated at 25 meter standoff from a reactor core. This prototype can detect a
prompt reactor shutdown within five hours, and monitor relative thermal power
to three percent within seven days. Monitoring of short-term power changes in
this way may be useful in the context of International Atomic Energy Agency's
(IAEA) Reactor Safeguards Regime, or other cooperative monitoring regimes.
