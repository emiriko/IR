This is the first of four articles studying some slight generalisations
H(n,m) of Khovanov's diagram algebra, as well as quasi-hereditary covers K(n,m)
of these algebras in the sense of Rouquier, and certain infinite dimensional
limiting versions. In this article we prove that H(n,m) is a cellular symmetric
algebra and that K(n,m) is a cellular quasi-hereditary algebra. In subsequent
articles, we relate these algebras to level two blocks of degenerate cyclotomic
Hecke algebras, parabolic category O and the general linear supergroup,
respectively.
