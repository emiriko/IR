We compute the next-to-leading order perturbative QCD corrections to the
correlators of nucleon interpolating currents in relativistic nuclear matter.
The main new result is the calculation of the O(alpha_s) perturbative
corrections to the coefficient functions of the vector quark condensate in
matter. This condensate appears in matter due to the violation of Lorentz
invariance. The NLO perturbative QCD corrections turn out to be large which
implies that the NLO corrections must be included in a sum rule analysis of the
properties of both bound nucleons and relativistic nuclear matter.
