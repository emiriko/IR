We have considered a system of two superconducting charge qubits capacitively
coupled to a microwave resonator. The dynamics of the Bloch vectors are
investigated for different regimes. By means of the Bloch vectors and cross
dyadic we quantify the degree of entanglement contained in the generated
entangled state. We consider different values of the system parameters to
discuss the dynamics of the channel capacity between the qubits. We show that
there is an important role played by initial state settings, coupling constant
and the mean photon number on generating entangled state with high degree of
entanglement and high capacity.
