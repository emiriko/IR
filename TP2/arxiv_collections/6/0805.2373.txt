Objects exhibiting statistics other than the familiar Bose and Fermi ones are
natural in theories with topologically nontrivial objects including geons,
strings, and black holes. It is argued here from several viewpoints that the
statistics of ordinary particles with which we are already familiar are likely
to be modified due to quantum gravity effects. In particular, such
modifications are argued to be present in loop quantum gravity and in any
theory which represents spacetime in a fundamentally piecewise-linear fashion.
The appearance of unusual statistics may be a generic feature (such as the
deformed position-momentum uncertainty relations and the appearance of a
fundamental length scale) which are to be expected in any theory of quantum
gravity, and which could be testable.
