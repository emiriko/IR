A new approach for integration of motion in many-body systems of interacting
polyatomic molecules is proposed. It is based on splitting time propagation of
pseudo-variables in a modified phase space, while the real translational and
orientational coordinates are decoded by processing transformations. This
allows to overcome the barrier on the order of precision of the integration at
a given number of force-torque evaluations per time step. Testing in dynamics
of water versus previous methods shows that the obtained algorithms
significantly improve the accuracy of the simulations without extra
computational costs.
