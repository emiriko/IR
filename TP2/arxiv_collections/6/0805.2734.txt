The determination of the spin of the quantum states exchanged in the various
non-standard interactions is a relevant aspect in the identification of the
corresponding scenarios. We discuss the identification reach at LHC on the
spin-2 of the lowest-lying Randall-Sundrum resonance, predicted by gravity with
one warped extra dimension, against spin-1 and spin-0 non-standard exchanges
with the same mass and producing the same number of events in the cross
section. We focus on the angular distributions of leptons produced in the
Drell-Yan process at the LHC, in particular we use as basic observable a
normalized integrated angular asymmetry A_{CE}. Our finding is that the 95%
C.L. identification reach on the spin-2 of the RS resonance (equivalently, the
exclusion reach on both the spin-1 and spin-0 hypotheses for the peak) is up to
a resonance mass scale of the order of 1.0 or 1.6 TeV in the case of weak
coupling between graviton excitations and SM particles (k/{\bar M}_{Pl}=0.01)
and 2.4 or 3.2 TeV for larger coupling constant (k/{\bar M}_{Pl}=0.1) for a
time-integrated LHC luminosity of 10 or 100 fb^{-1}, respectively. Also, some
comments are given on the complementary r\^oles of the angular analysis and the
eventual discovery of the predicted second graviton excitation in the
identification of the RS scenario.
