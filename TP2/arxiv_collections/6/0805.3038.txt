Computations in small Coxeter groups and infinite dihedral groups suggest
that Kazhdan-Lusztig cells for unequal parameters obey to some "semicontinuity"
phenomenon (as the parameter vary). The aim of this paper is to provide a
rigorous theoretical background that allows to state some precise conjectures.
