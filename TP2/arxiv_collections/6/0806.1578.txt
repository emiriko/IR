The SiZer method is extended to nonparametric hazard estimation and also to
censored density and hazard estimation. The new method allows quick, visual
statistical inference about the important issue of statistically significant
increases and decreases in the smooth curve estimate. This extension has
required the opening of a new avenue of research on the interface between
statistical inference and scale space.
