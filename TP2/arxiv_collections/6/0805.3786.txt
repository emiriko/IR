The momentum distribution of an expanding cloud of one-dimensional hard-core
anyons is studied by an exact numerical approach, and shown to become
indistinguishable from that of a non-interacting spin-polarized Fermi gas for
large enough times (dynamical fermionization). We also consider the expansion
of one-dimensional anyons with strongly attractive short-range interactions
suddenly released from a parabolic external potential, and find that momentum
distribution approaches that of its dual system, the ideal Bose gas (dynamical
bosonization). For both processes the characteristic time scales are
identified, and the effect of the initial confinement is analyzed comparing the
dynamics associated with both harmonic and hard-wall traps.
