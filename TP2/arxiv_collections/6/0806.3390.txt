We have evaluated the contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the
electron from six tenth-order Feynman diagrams which contain eighth-order
vacuum-polarization function formed by two light-by-light scattering diagrams
connected by three photons. The integrals are constructed by two different
methods. In the first method the subtractive counter terms are used to deal
with ultraviolet (UV) singularities together with the requirement of
gauge-invariance. In the second method, the Ward-Takahashi identity is applied
to the light-by-light scattering amplitudes to eliminate UV singularities.
Numerical evaluation confirms that the two methods are consistent with each
other within their numerical uncertainties. Combining the two results
statistically and adding small contribution from the muons and/or tau leptons,
we obtain $ 0.000 399 9 (18) (\alpha/\pi)^5$. We also evaluated the
contribution to the muon $g-2$ from the same set of diagrams and found $ -1.263
44 (14) (\alpha/\pi)^5$.
