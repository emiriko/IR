Spin-dependent interaction in hadrons is considered in the approach of the
QCD string. The string moment of inertia, which ensures the correct (inverse)
Regge slope 2*pi*sigma, is found to suppress the spin-orbit interaction. For
light quarks and moderate angular momenta the suppression constitutes around
25% whereas for large angular momenta the spin-orbit interaction is suppressed
by the factor L^(-2/5). For heavy quarks the effect manifests itself as a
string correction for the spin-dependent potential.
