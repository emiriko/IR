In this note we establish a uniform bound for the distribution of a sum
$S_n=X_1+\cdots+X_n$ of independent non-homogeneous Bernoulli trials.
Specifically, we prove that $\sigma_n \mathbb{P}(S_n\!=\!j)\leq\eta$ where
$\sigma_n$ denotes the standard deviation of $S_n$ and $\eta$ is a universal
constant. We compute the best possible constant $\eta\sim 0.4688$ and we show
that the bound also holds for limits of sums and differences of Bernoullis,
including the Poisson laws which constitute the worst case and attain the
bound. We also investigate the optimal bounds for $n$ and $j$ fixed. An
application to estimate the rate of convergence of Mann's fixed point
iterations is presented.
