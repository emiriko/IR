Within the framework of the Color Glass Condensate model, we evaluate quark
and gluon Generalized Parton Distributions (GPDs) and the cross section of
Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering (DVCS) in the small-$x_{B}$ region. We
demonstrate that the DVCS cross section becomes independent of energy in the
limit of very small $x_{B}$, which clearly indicates saturation of the DVCS
cross section. Our predictions for the GPDs and the DVCS cross section at
high-energies can be tested at the future Electron-Ion Collider and in
ultra-peripheral nucleus-nucleus collisions at the LHC.
