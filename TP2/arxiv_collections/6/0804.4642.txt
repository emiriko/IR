The article presents an improved theoretical description of dissociative
recombination of HCO$^+$ and DCO$^+$ ions with a low energy electron. In the
previous theoretical study (Phys. Rev. A {\bf 74}, 032707) on HCO$^+$, the
vibrational motion along the CO coordinate was neglected. Here, all vibrational
degrees of freedom, including the CO stretch coordinate, are taken into
account. The theoretical dissociative recombination cross-section obtained is
similar to the previous theoretical result at low collision energies ($<$0.1
eV) but somewhat larger at higher ($>$0.1 eV) energies. Therefore, the present
study suggests that motion along the CO coordinate does not play a significant
role in the process at low collision energies. The theoretical cross-section is
still approximately 2-3 times lower than the data from a recent merged-beam
experiment.
