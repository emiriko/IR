Motivated by partial group actions on unital algebras, in this article we
extend many results obtained by Exel and Dokuchaev to the context of partial
actions of Hopf algebras, according to Caenepeel and Jansen. First, we
generalize the theorem about the existence of an enveloping action, also known
as the globalization theorem. Second, we construct a Morita context between the
partial smash product and the smash product related to the enveloping action.
Third, we dualize the globalization theorem to partial coactions and finally,
we define partial representations of Hopf algebras and show some results
relating partial actions and partial representations.
