Double-stranded DNA `overstretches' at a pulling force of about 65 pN,
increasing in length by a factor of 1.7. The nature of the overstretched state
is unknown, despite its considerable importance for DNA's biological function
and technological application. Overstretching is thought by some to be a
force-induced denaturation, and by others to consist of a transition to an
elongated, hybridized state called S-DNA. Within a statistical mechanical model
we consider the effect upon overstretching of extreme sequence heterogeneity.
`Chimeric' sequences possessing halves of markedly different AT composition
elongate under fixed external conditions via distinct, spatially segregated
transitions. The corresponding force-extension data display two plateaux at
forces whose difference varies with pulling rate in a manner that depends
qualitatively upon whether the hybridized S-form is accessible. This
observation implies a test for S-DNA that could be performed in experiment. Our
results suggest that qualitatively different, spatially segregated
conformational transitions can occur at a single thermodynamic state within
single molecules of DNA.
