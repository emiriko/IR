The effects of quenched disorder on nonequilibrium phase transitions in the
directed percolation universality class are revisited. Using a strong-disorder
energy-space renormalization group, it is shown that for any amount of disorder
the critical behavior is controlled by an infinite-randomness fixed point in
the universality class of the random transverse-field Ising models. The
experimental relevance of our results are discussed.
