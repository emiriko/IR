A future high-energy electron-ion collider would explore the non-linear
weakly-coupled regime of QCD, and test the Color Glass Condensate (CGC)
approach to high-energy scattering. Hard diffraction in deep inelastic
scattering off nuclei will provide many fundamental measurements. In this work,
the nuclear diffractive structure function F_{2,A}^D is predicted in the CGC
framework, and the features of nuclear enhancement and suppression are
discussed.
