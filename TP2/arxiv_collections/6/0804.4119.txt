From an SU(2)$\otimes $SU(2) chiral quark potential model incorporating
spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking the asymptotic $\pi $ and $\sigma $
exchange pieces of the $NN$ potential are generated. From them the $\pi NN$ and
$\sigma NN$ coupling constants can be extracted. The generalization to
SU(3)$\otimes $SU(3) allows for a determination of $\pi B_{8}B_{8}$ and $%
\sigma B_{8}B_{8}$ coupling constants according to exact SU(3) hadron symmetry.
The implementation of the values of the couplings at $Q^{2}=0$ provided by QCD
sum rules and/or phenomenology makes also feasible the extraction of the
meson-baryon-baryon form factors. In this manner a quite complete knowledge of
the couplings may be attained.
