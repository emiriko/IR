Charge and spin orderings are studied on the simplest 1D and the 2D square
lattice within the generalized Falicov-Kimball model with Hund coupling between
localized and itinerant electrons. Using the restricted phase diagrams method
(RPDM) a number of simple rules of formation of various sorts of ground state
phases have been detected. In particular, relationships between density of
current carriers (electrons or holes) and type of charge and magnetic
arrangement has been determined. In 2D in the mixed valence regime only axial
stripes (vertical or horizontal) have been found for intermediate values of the
coupling constants. They are composed of ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic
chains interchanged with non-magnetic ones. For band fillings close to the half
filling stripe phases oriented along one of the main diagonal direction are
formed. The results suggest a possibility of tuning modulations of charge and
magnetic superstructures with a change of doping.
