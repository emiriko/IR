We study the effect of inhomogeneities in Hall conductivity on the nature of
the Zero Resistance States seen in the microwave irradiated two-dimensional
electron systems in weak perpendicular magnetic fields, and we show that
time-dependent domain patterns may emerge in some situations. For an annular
Corbino geometry, with an equilibrium charge density that varies linearly with
radius, we find a time-periodic non-equilibrium solution, which might be
detected by a charge sensor, such as an SET. For a model on a torus, in
addition to static domain patterns seen at high and low values of the
equilibrium charge inhomogeneity, we find that, in the intermediate regime, a
variety of nonstationary states can also exist. We catalog the possibilities we
have seen in our simulations. Within a particular phenomenological model, we
show that linearizing the nonlinear charge continuity equation about a
particularly simple domain wall configuration and analyzing the eigenmodes
allows us to estimate the periods of the solutions to the full nonlinear
equation.
