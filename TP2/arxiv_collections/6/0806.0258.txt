Let G be a finite abelian group. A number field K is called a Hilbert-Speiser
field of type G if for every tame G-Galois extension L/K has a normal integral
basis, i.e., the ring of integers O_L is free as an O_K[G]-module. Let C_p
denote the cyclic group of prime order p. We show that if p >= 7 (or p=5 and
extra conditions are met) and K is totally real with K/Q ramified at p, then K
is not Hilbert-Speiser of type C_p.
