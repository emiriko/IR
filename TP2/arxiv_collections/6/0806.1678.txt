We study the resonance eigenstates of a particular quantization of the open
baker map. For any admissible value of Planck's constant, the corresponding
quantum map is a subunitary matrix, and the nonzero component of its spectrum
is contained inside an annulus in the complex plane, $|z_{min}|\leq |z|\leq
|z_{max}|$. We consider semiclassical sequences of eigenstates, such that the
moduli of their eigenvalues converge to a fixed radius $r$. We prove that, if
the moduli converge to $r=|z_{max}|$, then the sequence of eigenstates
converges to a fixed phase space measure $\rho_{max}$. The same holds for
sequences with eigenvalue moduli converging to $|z_{min}|$, with a different
limit measure $\rho_{min}$. Both these limiting measures are supported on
fractal sets, which are trapped sets of the classical dynamics. For a general
radius $|z_{min}|< r < |z_{max}|$, we identify families of eigenstates with
precise self-similar properties.
