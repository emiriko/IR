Adams and Bishop have proposed in 1994 a novel region growing algorithm
called seeded region growing by pixels aggregation (SRGPA). This paper
introduces a framework to implement an algorithm using SRGPA. This framework is
built around two concepts: localization and organization of applied action.
This conceptualization gives a quick implementation of algorithms, a direct
translation between the mathematical idea and the numerical implementation, and
an improvement of algorithms efficiency.
