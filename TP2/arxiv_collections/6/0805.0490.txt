It is well known that electro-hydrodynamical effects in freely suspended
liquid films can flow the liquid. Here we report a purely electrically driven
rotation in water and some other liquid suspended films with full control on
the velocity and the chirality of the rotating vortices. The device, which is
called ``film motor'', consists of a quasi two-dimensional electrolysis cell in
an external in-plane electric field, crossing the mean electrolysis current
density. If either the external field or the electrolysis voltage exceeds some
threshold (while the other one is not zero), the liquid film begins to rotate.
The device works perfectly with both DC and AC fields.
