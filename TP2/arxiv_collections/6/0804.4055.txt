We study fermion mass matrices of the cascade form which are compatible with
the tri-bimaximal lepton mixing and generation mass hierarchy. The flat-cascade
lepton matrices imply a parameter-independent relation among the mixing angles
and mass eigenvalues. The relation has several indications that the atmospheric
neutrino mixing angle is close to maximal and the other two angles have a
correlation independently of neutrino mass eigenvalues. We also discuss
phenomenological aspects of the cascade matrices; flavor-violating rare decays
of charged leptons, thermal leptogenesis, and leptonic CP violation. Possible
dynamical origins of the cascades are illustrated based on flavor symmetry and
in higher-dimensional theory.
