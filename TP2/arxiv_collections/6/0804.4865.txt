Video sharing sites, such as YouTube, use video responses to enhance the
social interactions among their users. The video response feature allows users
to interact and converse through video, by creating a video sequence that
begins with an opening video and followed by video responses from other users.
Our characterization is over 3.4 million videos and 400,000 video responses
collected from YouTube during a 7-day period. We first analyze the
characteristics of the video responses, such as popularity, duration, and
geography. We then examine the social networks that emerge from the video
response interactions.
