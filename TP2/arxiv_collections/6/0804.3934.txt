The fully three dimensional governing equations in the electron
magnetohydrodynamic (EMHD) regime for a plasma with inhomogeneous density is
obtained. These equations in the two dimensional (2-D) limit can be cast in
terms of the evolution of two coupled scalar fields. The nonlinear simulations
for the two dimensional case are carried out to understand the propagation of
EMHD magnetic structures in the presence of inhomogeneity. A novel effect
related to trapping of dipolar magnetic structures in the high density plasma
region in the EMHD regime is observed. The interpretation of this phenomena as
well as its relevance to the problem of hot spot generation in the context of
fast ignition is presented.
