We present an analytic solution of type IIB supergravity plus D7-branes,
describing the addition of any number of flavors to the Klebanov-Strassler
background. The dual field theory and its self-similar RG flow, described by a
cascade of Seiberg dualities also in the presence of flavors, are discussed.
The solution indicates that the dual gauge theory enjoys a duality wall in the
UV. We stress the correspondence between Seiberg duality on the field theory
side, and large gauge transformations on the RR and NSNS potentials on the
gravity side. This contribution is mostly based on arxiv:0706.1238.
