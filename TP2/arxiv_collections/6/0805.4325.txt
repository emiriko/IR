It is shown that a sufficiently strong external electric field causes a
decrease in the transition temperature of ferroelectric, antiferroelectric, and
metal-insulator transitions. The temperature dependence of the critical
electric field suppressing a low-temperature phase is obtained. The relation
between the low-temperature charge gap (the band gap) in the insulating phase
and the metal-insulator transition temperature is also inferred.
