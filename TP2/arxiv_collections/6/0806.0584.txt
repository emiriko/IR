We explicitly compute up to the fifth mass-level the partition function of
ten-dimensional pure spinor worldsheet variables including the spin dependence.
After adding the contribution from the (x^{\mu}, \theta^{\alpha}, p_{\alpha})
matter variables, we reproduce the massive superstring spectrum. Even though
pure spinor variables are bosonic, the pure spinor partition function contains
fermionic states which first appear at the second mass-level. These fermionic
states come from functions which are not globally defined in pure spinor space,
and are related to the b ghost in the pure spinor formalism. This result
clarifies the proper definition of the Hilbert space for pure spinor variables.
