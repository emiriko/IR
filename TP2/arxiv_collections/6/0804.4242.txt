Tunneling of microwaves through a smooth barrier in a transmission line is
considered. In contrast to standard wave barriers, we study the case where the
dielectric permittivity is positive, and the barrier is caused by the
inhomogeneous dielectric profile. It is found that reflectionless, superluminal
tunneling can take place for waves with a finite spectral width. The
consequences of these findings are discussed, and an experimental setup testing
our predictions is proposed.
