We identify a new mechanism for cooperative emission of light by an ensemble
of N dipoles near a metal nanostructure supporting a surface plasmon.The
cross-talk between emitters due to virtual plasmon exchange leads to a
formation of three plasmonic super-radiant modes whose radiative decay rates
scales with N, while the total radiated energy is thrice that of a single
emitter. Our numerical simulations indicate that the plasmonic Dicke effect
survives non-radiative losses in the metal.
