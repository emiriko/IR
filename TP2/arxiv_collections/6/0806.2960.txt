Using a field-theoretic approach, we systematically generalize the usual
semiclassical approximation for a harmonically trapped ideal Bose gas in such a
way that its range of applicability is essentially extended. With this we can
analytically calculate thermodynamic properties even for small particle
numbers. In particular, it now becomes possible to determine the critical
temperature as well as the temperature dependence of both heat capacity and
condensate fraction in low-dimensional traps, where the standard semiclassical
approximation is not even applicable.
