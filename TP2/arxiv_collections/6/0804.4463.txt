The interplay of strong interaction and strong disorder, as contained in the
Anderson-Hubbard model, is addressed using two non-perturbative numerical
methods: the Lanczos algorithm in the grand canonical ensemble at zero
temperature and Quantum Monte Carlo. We find distinctive evidence for a
zero-energy anomaly which is robust upon variation of doping, disorder and
interaction strength. Its similarities to, and differences from, pseudogap
formation in other contexts, including perturbative treatments of interactions
and disorder, classical theories of localized charges, and in the clean Hubbard
model, are discussed.
