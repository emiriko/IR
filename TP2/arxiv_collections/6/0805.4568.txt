Quantum coherent control of slow light for all-optical switching is
investigated in a multi-level system of solids for an understanding of
self-induced ultraslow light. In an optical population shelving system of a
rare-earth doped solid, dynamics of the slow light are presented by using a
third optical field controlling shelved atom population. Unlike two-photon
coherence-based delayed all-optical switching utilizing electromagnetically
induced transparency, the present method relies on one-photon coherence
controlling shelved atom population.
