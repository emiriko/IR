Precision fiber optic gyroscopes were mounted mechanically de-coupled above
spinning rings inside a cryostat. Below a critical temperature (typically <30
K), the gyroscopes measure a significant deviation from their usual offset due
to Earth's rotation. This deviation is proportional to the applied angular ring
velocity with maximum signals towards lower temperatures. The anomalous
gyroscope signal is about 8 orders of magnitude smaller then the applied
angular ring velocity, compensating about one third of the Earth rotation
offset at an angular top speed of 420 rad/s. Moreover, our data shows a parity
violation as the effect appears to be dominant for rotation against the Earth's
spin. No systematic effect was found to explain this effect including the
magnetic environment, vibration and helium gas friction suggesting that our
observation is a new low temperature phenomenon. Tests in various
configurations suggest that the rotating low temperature helium may be the
source of our anomalous signals.
