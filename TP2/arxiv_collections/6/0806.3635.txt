We consider the reduction of problems on general noncommutative $L_p$-spaces
to the corresponding ones on those associated with finite von Neumann algebras.
The main tool is a unpublished result of the first named author which
approximates any noncommutative $L_p$-space by tracial ones. We show that under
some natural conditions a map between two von Neumann algebras extends to their
crossed products by a locally compact abelian group or to their noncommutative
$L_p$-spaces. We present applications of these results to the theory of
noncommutative martingale inequalities by reducing most recent general
noncommutative martingale/ergodic inequalities to those in the tracial case.
