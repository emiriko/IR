In this essentially Unsolved Problems of Noise (UPoN) paper we further study
the question recently posed in Fluctuation and Noise Letters (December 2007),
if there is and interaction between bodies with correlated information content,
and weather the observed weight transients during/after changing the
information content in memory devices is due to a new type of interaction, a
new type of "fifth force", or it is only a classical mechanism. We briefly
discuss the issue of the great experimental uncertainty of the Newtonian
gravitation constant. We also mention the peculiar experiments about sudden
weight changes of humans and animals at the moment of death. The extended
monitoring of four 4GB flash drives with no casing and various information
content indicate a significant correlation between their weight variations and
the fluctuations of ambient humidity. This is an evidence for the role of
humidity and hygroscopic components, at least, for long-term weight
fluctuations. A sequence of information changing experiments with such a flash
drives at stable humidity conditions shows a significant variability of the
transients of the absolute mass with some dependence on the information
content. Finally, a related new experiment was carried out with olive oil and
chilli pepper powder that was dissolved in it while the mass variations were
recorded and a positive mass transient of 0.3 milligram was observed for about
10 minutes. The process represents the writing of new random information into a
medium. The only classical interpretation of this mechanism would be the
compression of trapped air between the grains by the surface tension of the
oil, or that of in pores by capillary forces, and the resulting decrease of the
Archimedes force due volume reduction.
