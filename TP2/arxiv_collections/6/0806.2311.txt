Two dissimilar Josephson junctions, which are connected to a heater can act
as precise batteries. Because of the difference in thermoelectric power of
these batteries, circuit with two dissimilar batteries, under heat flow $\Delta
T\sim 10^{-5}K$ would have a net EMF $10^{-11} V$ around the zero-resistance
loop leading to a loop's magnetic flux oscillating in time. It is shown its
theoretical value is proportional to both the temperature difference as well as
the disparity in the thermoelectric powers of the two junctions.
