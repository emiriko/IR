Recently the second two authors characterized quasiperiodic Sturmian words,
proving that a Sturmian word is non-quasiperiodic if and only if it is an
infinite Lyndon word. Here we extend this study to episturmian words (a natural
generalization of Sturmian words) by describing all the quasiperiods of an
episturmian word, which yields a characterization of quasiperiodic episturmian
words in terms of their "directive words". Even further, we establish a
complete characterization of all episturmian words that are Lyndon words. Our
main results show that, unlike the Sturmian case, there is a much wider class
of episturmian words that are non-quasiperiodic, besides those that are
infinite Lyndon words. Our key tools are morphisms and directive words, in
particular "normalized" directive words, which we introduced in an earlier
paper. Also of importance is the use of "return words" to characterize
quasiperiodic episturmian words, since such a method could be useful in other
contexts.
