I formulate the problem of closing the detection loophole as a constrained
optimization problem. Numerical methods can then be used to maximize the
detector efficiency subject to the constraint that there exists a local realist
explanation for the quantum correlations observed in the EPR experiment in
question. Any detector efficiency larger than this maximum rules out all local
realist explanations, and hence closes the detection loophole.
