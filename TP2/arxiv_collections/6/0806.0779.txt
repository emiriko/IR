We investigate the decay of entanglement, due to decoherence, of multi-qubit
systems that are initially prepared in highly (in some cases maximally)
entangled states. We assume that during the decoherence processes each qubit of
the system interacts with its own, independent environment. We determine, for
systems with a small number of qubits and for various decoherence channels, the
initial states exhibiting the most robust entanglement. We also consider a
restricted version of this robustness optimization problem, only involving
states equivalent under local unitary transformations to the |GHZ> state.
