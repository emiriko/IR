The $v_{2}$ and $v_{4}$ of pions, kaons and protons have been measured by
PHENIX in 200 GeV Au+Au collisions up to $p_{T}$$\sim$6 GeV/c and 4 GeV/c,
respectively. The $v_{4}$ of all these identified particles have been found to
scale with the number of constituent quarks and all these particles have a
similar $v_{4}$/$v_{2}^{2}$ ratio which is close to 0.9. The scaling behavior
of $v_2$ is studied at high-$p_{T}$ and a deviations from the universal scaling
is observed for transverse kinetic energy ($K_{ET}/nq$) higher than 1 GeV.
