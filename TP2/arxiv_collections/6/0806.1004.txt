We investigate the analytic structure of solutions of non-relativistic
Schr"odinger equations describing Coulombic many-particle systems. We prove the
following: Let psi(x) with x=(x_1,...,x_N) in R^{3N} denote an N-electron
wavefunction of such a system with one nucleus fixed at the origin. Then in a
neighbourhood of a coalescence point, for which x_1=0 and the other electron
coordinates do not coincide, and differ from 0, psi can be represented locally
as psi(x) = psi^(1)(x) + |x_1|psi^(2)(x) with psi^(1), psi^(2) real analytic. A
similar representation holds near two-electron coalescence points. The
Kustaanheimo-Stiefel transform and analytic hypoellipticity play an essential
role in the proof.
