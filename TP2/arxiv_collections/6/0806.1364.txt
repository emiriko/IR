Let $K=k(C)$ be the function field of a complete nonsingular curve $C$ over
an arbitrary field $k$. The main result of this paper states that a morphism
$\phi:{\mathbb P}^N_K\to{\mathbb P}^N_K$ is isotrivial if and only if it has
potential good reduction at all places $v$ of $K$; this generalizes results of
Benedetto for polynomial maps on ${\mathbb P}^1_K$ and Baker for arbitrary
rational maps on ${\mathbb P}^1_K$. We offer two proofs: the first uses
algebraic geometry and geometric invariant theory, and it is new even in the
case N=1. The second proof uses non-archimedean analysis and dynamics, and it
more directly generalizes the proofs of Benedetto and Baker. We will also give
two applications. The first states that an endomorphism of ${\mathbb P}^N_K$ of
degree at least two is isotrivial if and only if it has an isotrivial iterate.
The second gives a dynamical criterion for whether (after base change) a
locally free coherent sheaf ${\mathcal E}$ of rank $N+1$ on $C$ decomposes as a
direct sum ${\mathcal L}\oplus...\oplus{\mathcal L}$ of $N+1$ copies of the
same invertible sheaf ${\mathcal L}$.
