We study axisymmetric self-gravitating non-linear $\sigma$-model in
five-dimensional spacetime admitting three commutating Killing vector fields.
We show that the only asymptotically flat black ring solution with a regular
event horizon is the black ring characterized by mass and two angular momenta
with constant mapping.
