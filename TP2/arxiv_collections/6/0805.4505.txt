Exploiting a 3+1 analysis of the Mars-Simon tensor, conditions on a vacuum
initial data set ensuring that its development is isometric to a subset of the
Kerr spacetime are found. These conditions are expressed in terms of the
vanishing of a positive scalar function defined on the initial data
hypersurface. Applications of this result are discussed.
