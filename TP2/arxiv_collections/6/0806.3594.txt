We study a system of self-propelled agents in which each agent has a part of
omnidirectional or panoramic view of its sensor disc, the field of vision of
the agent in this case is only a sector of a disc bounded by two radii and the
included arc. The inclination of these two radii is characterized as the view
angle. Contrary to our intuition, we find that, the non-omnidirectional-view
for swarm agents with periodic boundary conditions in noiseless Vicsek model
can accelerate the transient process of the emergence of the ordered state. One
consequent implication is that, there are generally superfluous communications
in the Vicsek Model, which may even obstruct the possible fast swarm emergence.
This phenomenon may invoke further efforts and attentions to explore the
underlying mechanism of the emergence in self-propelled agents.
