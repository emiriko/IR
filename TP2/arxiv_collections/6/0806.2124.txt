Proving the existence of speculative financial bubbles even a posteriori has
proven exceedingly difficult so anticipating a speculative bubble ex ante would
at first seem an impossible task. Still as illustrated by the recent turmoil in
financial markets initiated by the so called subprime crisis there is clearly
an urgent need for new tools in our understanding and handling of financial
speculative bubbles. In contrast to periods of fast growth, the nature of
market dynamics profoundly changes during speculative bubbles where self
contained strategies often leads to unconditional buying. A critical question
is therefore whether such a signature can be quantified, and if so, used in the
understanding of what are the sufficient and necessary conditions in the
creation of a speculative bubble. Here we show a new technique, based on agent
based simulations, gives a robust measure of detachment of trading choices
created by feedback, and predicts the onset of speculative bubbles in
experiments with human subjects. We use trading data obtained from experiments
with humans as input to computer simulations of artificial agents that use
adaptive strategies defined from game theory....
