Forward-backward multiplicity correlations have been measured with the STAR
detector for Au+Au, Cu+Cu and {\it p+p} collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200
GeV. A strong, long-range correlation is observed for central heavy ion
collisions that vanishes in semi-peripheral events and {\it pp} collisions.
There is no apparent scaling of correlation strength with the number of
participants involved in the collision. Both the Dual Parton Model and the
Color Glass condensate indicate that the long range correlations are due to
multiple parton interactions. This suggests that the dense partonic matter
might have been created in mid-central and central Au+Au collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV.
