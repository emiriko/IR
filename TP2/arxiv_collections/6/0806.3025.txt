The beta-delayed charged particle emission from ^11Li has been studied with
emphasis on the three-body n+alpha+^6He and five-body 2alpha+3n channels from
the 10.59 and 18.15 MeV states in ^11Be. Monte Carlo simulations using an
R-matrix formalism lead to the conclusion that the ^AHe resonance states play a
significant role in the break-up of these states. The results exclude an
earlier assumption of a phase-space description of the break-up process of the
18.15 MeV state. Evidence for extra sequential decay paths is found for both
states.
