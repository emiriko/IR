Constrictions in fractional quantum Hall (FQH) systems not only facilitate
backscattering between counter-propagating edge modes, but also may reduce the
constriction filling fraction $\nu_c$ with respect to the bulk filling fraction
$\nu_b$. If both $\nu_b$ and $\nu_c$ correspond to incompressible FQH states,
at least part of the constriction region is surrounded by composite edges,
whose low energy dynamics is characterized by a charge mode and one or several
neutral modes. In the incoherent regime, decay of neutral modes describes the
equilibration of composite FQH edges, while in the limit of coherent transport,
the presence of neutral modes gives rise to universal conductance fluctuations.
In addition, neutral modes renormalize the strength of scattering across the
constriction, and thus can determine the relative strength of forward and
backwards scattering.
