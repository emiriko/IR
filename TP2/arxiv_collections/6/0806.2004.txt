We have performed synchrotron radiation X-ray and neutron diffraction
measurements on magnetoelectric multiferroic CuFe1-xAlxO2 (x=0.0155), which has
a proper helical magnetic structure with incommensurate propagation wave vector
in the ferroelectric phase. The present measurements revealed that the
ferroelectric phase is accompanied by lattice modulation with a wave number 2q,
where q is the magnetic modulation wave number. We have calculated the Fourier
spectrum of the spatial modulations in the local electric polarization using a
microscopic model proposed by Arima [T. Arima, J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 76, 073702
(2007)]. Comparing the experimental results with the calculation results, we
found that the origin of the 2q-lattice modulation is not conventional
magnetostriction but the variation in the metal-ligand hybridization between
the magnetic Fe^3+ ions and ligand O^2- ions. Combining the present results
with the results of a previous polarized neutron diffraction study [Nakajima et
al., Phys. Rev. B 77 052401 (2008)], we conclude that the microscopic origin of
the ferroelectricity in CuFe1-xAlxO2 is the variation in the metal-ligand
hybridization with spin-orbit coupling.
