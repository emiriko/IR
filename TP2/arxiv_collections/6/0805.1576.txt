Manifestation of dynamical instability and Hamiltonian chaos in the
fundamental near-resonant matter-radiation interaction has been found
analitically and in a Monte Carlo simulation in the behavior of atoms moving in
a rigid optical lattice. Character of diffusion of spontaneously emitting atoms
changes abruptly in the range of the values of parameters and initial
conditions where their Hamiltonian dynamics is shown to be chaotic
