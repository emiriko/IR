A precision measurement of the mass of the h_c(1P1) state of charmonium has
been made using a sample of 24.5 million psi(2S) events produced in e+e-
annihilation at CESR. The reaction used was psi(2S) -> pi0 h_c, pi0 -> gamma
gamma, h_c -> gamma eta_c, and the reaction products were detected in the
CLEO-c detector.
  Data have been analyzed both for the inclusive reaction and for the exclusive
reactions in which eta_c decays are reconstructed in fifteen hadronic decay
channels. Consistent results are obtained in the two analyses. The averaged
results of the present measurements are M(h_c)=3525.28+-0.19 (stat)+-0.12(syst)
MeV, and B(psi(2S) -> pi0 h_c)xB(h_c -> gamma eta_c)= (4.19+-0.32+-0.45)x10^-4.
Using the 3PJ centroid mass, Delta M_hf(1P)=<M(chi_cJ)> - M(h_c) =
+0.02+-0.19+-0.13 MeV.
