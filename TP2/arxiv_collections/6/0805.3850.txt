The broader scope of our investigations is the search for the way in which
concepts and their combinations carry and influence meaning and what this
implies for human thought. More specifically, we examine the use of the
mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics as a modeling instrument and
propose a general mathematical modeling scheme for the combinations of
concepts. We point out that quantum mechanical principles, such as
superposition and interference, are at the origin of specific effects in
cognition related to concept combinations, such as the guppy effect and the
overextension and underextension of membership weights of items. We work out a
concrete quantum mechanical model for a large set of experimental data of
membership weights with overextension and underextension of items with respect
to the conjunction and disjunction of pairs of concepts, and show that no
classical model is possible for these data. We put forward an explanation by
linking the presence of quantum aspects that model concept combinations to the
basic process of concept formation. We investigate the implications of our
quantum modeling scheme for the structure of human thought, and show the
presence of a two-layer structure consisting of a classical logical layer and a
quantum conceptual layer. We consider connections between our findings and
phenomena such as the disjunction effect and the conjunction fallacy in
decision theory, violations of the sure thing principle, and the Allais and
Elsberg paradoxes in economics.
