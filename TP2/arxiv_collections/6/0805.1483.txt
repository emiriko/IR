An Onsager-like relation is proposed as a new criterion for constructing and
analysing the lattice Boltzmann (LB) method. For LB models obeying the
relation, we analyse their linearized stability, establish their diffusive
limit, and find new constraints for those with free parameters. The new
relation seems of fundamental importance for the LB method.
