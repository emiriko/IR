Measurement of fusion cross sections for the 6,7Li + 24Mg reactions by the
characteristic gamma-ray method has been done at energies from below to well
above the respective Coulomb barriers. The fusion cross sections obtained from
these gamma-ray cross sections for the two systems are found to agree well with
the total reaction cross sections at low energies. The decrease of fusion cross
sections with increase of energy is consistent with the fact that other
channels, in particular breakup open up with increase of bombarding energy.
This shows that there is neither inhibition nor enhancement of fusion cross
sections for these systems at above or below the barrier. The critical angular
momenta (lcr) deduced from the fusion cross sections are found to have an
energy dependence similar to other Li - induced reactions.
