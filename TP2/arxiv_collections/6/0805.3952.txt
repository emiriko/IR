This is the first part in a series of two papers, where we consider a
specific microscopic model of spacetime. In our model Planck size quantum black
holes are taken to be the fundamental building blocks of space and time.
Spacetime is assumed to be a graph, where black holes lie on the vertices. In
this first paper we construct our model in details, and show how classical
spacetime emerges at the long distance limit from our model. We also consider
the statistics of spacetime.
