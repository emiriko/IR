A revised self-synchronizing stream cipher based on chaotic coupled maps is
proposed. This system adds input and output functions aim to strengthen its
security. The system performs basic floating-point analytical computation on
real numbers, incorporating auxiliarily with algebraic operations on integer
numbers.
