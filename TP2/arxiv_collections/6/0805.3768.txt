Phonon-assisted singlet-singlet relaxation in semiconductor quantum dot
molecules is studied theoretically. Laterally coupled quantum dot structures
doped with two electrons are considered. We take into account interaction with
acoustic phonon modes via deformation potential and piezoelectric coupling. We
show that piezoelectric mechanism for the considered system is of great
importance and for some ranges of quantum dot molecule parameters is the
dominant contribution to relaxation. It is shown that the phonon-assisted
tunneling rates reach much higher values (up to 160 ns$^{-1}$ even at zero
temperature) in comparison with other decoherence processes like spin-orbit
coupling ($\sim$ 0.01 ns$^{-1}$). The influence of Coulomb interaction is
discussed and its consequences are indicated. We calculate the relaxation rates
for GaAs quantum dot molecules and study the dependence on quantum dot size,
distance and offset between the constituent quantum dots. In addition the
temperature dependence of the tunneling rates is analyzed.
