N=1 SQCD with N_c colors and two types of light quarks: N_l flavors with
smaller masses m_l and N_h=N_F-N_l flavors with larger masses m_h,
N_c<N_F<3N_c, 0<m_l \leq m_h \ll \Lambda, is considered within the dynamical
scenario in which quarks can form the coherent colorless diquark-condensate.
There are several phase states at different values of parameters r=m_l/m_h,
N_l, and N_F. Properties of these phases and the mass spectra therein are
described.
