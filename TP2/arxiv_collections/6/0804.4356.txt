Researchers have devoted themselves to exploring static features of social
networks and further discovered many representative characteristics, such as
power law in the degree distribution and assortative value used to
differentiate social networks from nonsocial ones. However, people are not
satisfied with these achievements and more and more attention has been paid on
how to uncover those dynamic characteristics of social networks, especially how
to track community evolution effectively. With these interests, in the paper we
firstly display some basic but dynamic features of social networks. Then on its
basis, we propose a novel core-based algorithm of tracking community evolution,
CommTracker, which depends on core nodes to establish the evolving
relationships among communities at different snapshots. With the algorithm, we
discover two unique phenomena in social networks and further propose two
representative coefficients: GROWTH and METABOLISM by which we are also able to
distinguish social networks from nonsocial ones from the dynamic aspect. At
last, we have developed a social network model which has the capabilities of
exhibiting two necessary features above.
