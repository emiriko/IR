High-temperature bivariate expansions have been derived for the two-spin
correlation-function in a variety of classical lattice XY (planar rotator)
models in which spatially isotropic interactions among first-neighbor spins
compete with spatially isotropic or anisotropic (in particular uniaxial)
interactions among next-to-nearest-neighbor spins. The expansions, calculated
for cubic lattices of dimension d=1,2 and 3, are expressed in terms of the two
variables K1=J1/kT and K2=J2/kT, where J1 and J2 are the nearest-neighbor and
the next-to-nearest-neighbor exchange couplings, respectively. This report
deals in particular with the properties of the d=3 uniaxial XY model (ANNNXY
model) for which the bivariate expansions have been computed through the 18-th
order, thus extending by 12 orders the results so far available and making a
study of this model possible over a wide range of values of the competition
parameter R=J2/J1.
