In high transition temperature (T_c) superconductivity, charge doping is a
natural tuning parameter that takes copper oxides from the antiferromagnet to
the superconducting region. In the metallic state above T_c the standard
Landau's Fermi-liquid theory of metals as typified by the temperature squared
(T^2) dependence of resistivity appears to break down. Whether the origin of
the non-Fermi-liquid behavior is related to physics specific to the cuprates is
a fundamental question still under debate. We uncover a new transformation from
the non-Fermi- to a standard Fermi-liquid state driven not by doping but by
magnetic field in the overdoped high-T_c superconductor Tl_2Ba_2CuO_{6+x}. From
the c-axis resistivity measured up to 45 T, we show that the Fermi-liquid
features appear above a sufficiently high field which decreases linearly with
temperature and lands at a quantum critical point near the superconductivity's
upper critical field -- with the Fermi-liquid coefficient of the T^2 dependence
showing a power-law diverging behavior on the approach to the critical point.
This field-induced quantum criticality bears a striking resemblance to that in
quasi-two dimensional heavy-Fermion superconductors, suggesting a common
underlying spin-related physics in these superconductors with strong electron
correlations.
