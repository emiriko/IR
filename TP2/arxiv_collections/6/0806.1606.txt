A counter-intuitive result in entanglement theory was shown in [PRL 91 037902
(2003)], namely that entanglement can be distributed by sending a separable
state through a quantum channel. In this work, following an analogy between the
entanglement and secret key distillation scenarios, we derive its classical
analog: secrecy can be distributed by sending non-secret correlations through a
private channel. This strengthens the close relation between entanglement and
secrecy.
