We discuss collapse of icosadeltahedral shells subjected to uniform external
pressure. We demonstrate that there is a universal collapse pressure curve. The
parameter that uniquely determines the collapse pressure is shown to be the
Foppl-von Karman number of the non-pressurized shells. Numerical results are
interpreted in terms of buckling instabilities of spheres and cylinders under
hydrostatic pressure.
