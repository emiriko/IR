We discover new vacuum solutions of the JIMWLK equation, which correspond to
center of a gauge group. We improve the color glass condensate (CGC) model by
an explicit usage of a density matrix. Studying scattering of CGC states in an
external color field, we observe that an amplitude is naturally expressed via
group characters. We construct an example that shows how new thin effects may
be potentially observed in peripheral collisions. We prove that at any parton
density a gluonic CGC state does not become a true black disk. We find a wave
function of a true black disk and show that it necessarily contains many
quarks. This result corresponds to the necessity of nonvacuum Reggeon loops in
a formation of a true black disk.
