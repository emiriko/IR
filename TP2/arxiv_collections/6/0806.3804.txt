Some properties of intrinsic transverse momentum dependent nucleon
distribution functions are considered in the simple quark-diquark model. The
transverse target polarization dependent asymmetries for SIDIS are calculated
and compared with recent results of COMPASS. The model describes well the
measured asymmetries. Generalization of quark-diquark model for Sivers function
is discussed.
