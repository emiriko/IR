Emerging 3D chips stacking and MEMS/Sensors packaging technologies are using
DRIE (Deep Reactive Ion Etching) to etch through-silicon via (TSV) for advanced
interconnections. The interconnection step can be done prior to or post CMOS
manufacturing, each requiring different etch process performances. A review of
the DRIE capability in terms of etching profile, etch rate, etch depth has been
carried out. Excellent tool flexibility allows a wide range of basic and
complex profiles to be achieved. Unlike other techniques, DRIE has the
capability to etch feature sizes ranging from sub-micron to millimeter width.
The main specificity of the DRIE is that etch rate is sensitive to the total
exposed area and the aspect ratio. For the TSV applications, where the total
exposed area is lower than 10%, high etch rates are achievable. A study has
also been done to highlight the importance of via profile for the success of
the refilling step. In addition, due to the high flexibility of DRIE, we also
explore the capability of using this technique for wafer thinning and plasma
die separation.
