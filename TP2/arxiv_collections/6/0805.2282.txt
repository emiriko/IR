We study universal quantum computation in the cavity quantum electrodynamics
(CQED) framework exploiting two orthonormal two-photon generalized binomial
states as qubit and dispersive interactions of Rydberg atoms with high-$Q$
cavities. We show that an arbitrary qubit state may be generated and that
controlled-NOT and 1-qubit rotation gates can be realized via standard
atom-cavity interactions.
