This work describes an innovative concept for the development of organized
molecular systems thanks to the template effect of the pre-structured
semi-conductive SmSi(111) interface. This substrate was selected because Sm
deposition in the submonolayer range leads to a 8x2-reconstruction, which is a
well-defined one-dimensional semi-metallic structure. Adsorption of aromatic
molecules (1,4-di-(9-ethynyltriptycenyl)-benzene) on SmSi(111)-8x2 and
Si(111)-7x7 interfaces has been investigated by scanning tunneling microscopy
(STM) at room temperature. Density functional theory (DFT) and semi-empirical
(ASED+) calculations have been performed to define the nature of the molecular
adsorption sites of the target molecule on SmSi as well as their self-alignment
on this interface. Experimental data and theoretical results are in good
agreement.
