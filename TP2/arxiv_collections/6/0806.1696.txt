We have investigated the ground state phase diagram of the 1D AF spin-1/2
Heisenberg model with the staggered Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction in
an external uniform magnetic field $H$. We have used the exact diagonalization
technique. In the absence of the uniform magnetic field (H=0), we have shown
that the DM interaction induces a staggered chiral phase. The staggered chiral
phase remains stable even in the presence of the uniform magnetic field. We
have identified that the ground state phase diagram consists of four Luttinger
liquid, staggered chiral, spin-flop, and ferromagnetic phases.
