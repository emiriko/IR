The existence of a liquid-gas phase transition for hot nuclear systems at
subsaturation densities is a well established prediction of finite temperature
nuclear many-body theory. In this paper, we discuss for the first time the
properties of such phase transition for homogeneous nuclear matter within the
Self-Consistent Green's Functions approach. We find a substantial decrease of
the critical temperature with respect to the Brueckner-Hartree-Fock
approximation. Even within the same approximation, the use of two different
realistic nucleon-nucleon interactions gives rise to large differences in the
properties of the critical point.
