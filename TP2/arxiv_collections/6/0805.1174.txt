We calculate the low energy contribution to quarkonium correlators in
Euclidean time in lattice QCD. This contribution was found to give the dominant
source of the temperature dependence of the correlators. We have found that the
low energy contribution is well described by a quasi-particle model and have
determined the effective temperature dependent heavy quark mass.
