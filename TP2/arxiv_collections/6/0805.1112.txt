Using first-principles density functional calculations, we study the
electronic and magnetic properties of ferromagnetic insulating
double-perovskite compound La2NiMnO6, which has been reported to exhibit
interesting magnetic field sensitive dielectric anomaly as a function of
temperature. Our study reveals existence of very soft infra-red active phonons
that couple strongly with spins at the Ni and Mn sites through modification of
the super-exchange interaction. We suggest that these modes are the origin for
observed dielectric anomaly in La2NiMnO6.
