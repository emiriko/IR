Broyden's method, widely used in quantum chemistry electronic-structure
calculations for the numerical solution of nonlinear equations in many
variables, is applied in the context of the nuclear many-body problem. Examples
include the unitary gas problem, the nuclear density functional theory with
Skyrme functionals, and the nuclear coupled-cluster theory. The stability of
the method, its ease of use, and its rapid convergence rates make Broyden's
method a tool of choice for large-scale nuclear structure calculations.
