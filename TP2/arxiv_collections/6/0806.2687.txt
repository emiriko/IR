The problem of forward production of hadrons in heavy-ion collision at RHIC
is revisited with modification of the theoretical treatment on the one hand and
with the use of new data on the other. The basic formalism for hadronization
remains the same as before, namely, recombination, but the details of momentum
degradation and quark regeneration are improved. Recent data on the p/pi and
pbar/p ratios are used to constrain the value of the degradation parameter. The
p_T spectrum of the average charged particles is well reproduced. A prediction
on the p_T dependence of the pbar/p ratio at eta=3.2 is made.
