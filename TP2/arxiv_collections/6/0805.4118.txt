We use functional Bethe Ansatz equations to calculate the cumulants of the
total current in the partially asymmetric exclusion process. We recover known
formulas for the first two cumulants (mean value of the current and diffusion
constant) and obtain an explicit finite size formula for the third cumulant.
The expression for the third cumulant takes a simple integral form in the limit
where the asymmetry scales as the inverse of the square root of the size of the
system, which corresponds to a natural separation between weak and strong
asymmetry.
