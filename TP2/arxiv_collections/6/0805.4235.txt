Employing a novel type of non-commutative product in the Dirac-Kahler twisted
superspace on a lattice, we formulate a field theoretically rigid framework of
extended supersymmetry on a lattice. As a first example of this treatment, we
calculate one-loop (in some cases any loops) quantum corrections for a twisted
Wess-Zumino model with N \times N hermitian matrix superfields on a two
dimensional lattice. The calculations are entirely given in a lattice
superfield framework. We report that the mass and the coupling constant are
exactly protected from the radiative corrections at non-zero lattice spacing as
far as the planar diagrams are concerned, which implies the realization of
exact lattice supersymmetry w.r.t. all the supercharges in the large-N limit.
