Heat capacity measurements were performed on recently discovered iron based
layered superconductors, non doped LaFePO and fluorine doped LaFePO. A
relatively large electronic heat capacity coefficient and a small normalized
heat capacity jump at Tc = 3.3 K were observed in LaFePO. LaFePO0.94F0.06 had a
smaller electronic heat capacity coefficient and a larger normalized heat
capacity jump at Tc = 5.8 K. These values indicate that these compounds have
strong electron electron correlation and magnetic spin fluctuation, which are
the signatures of unconventional superconductivity mediated by spin
fluctuation.
