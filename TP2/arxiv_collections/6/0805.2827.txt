A model of an electron and a Dirac monopole interacting through an axially
symmetric non-hermitian but \mathcal{PT}-symmetric potential is discussed in
detail. The intriguing localization of the wave-packet as a result of the
anomalous breaking of the scale symmetry is shown to provide a scale for the
system. The symmetry algebra for the system, which is the conformal algebra
SO(2,1), is discussed and is shown to belong to the enveloping algebra of the
combined algebra, composed of the Virosoro algebra, \{L_n, n\in \mathbb{N}\}
and an abelian algebra, \{P_n,n\in \mathbb{N}\}.
