Anatomical shape differences in cortical structures in the brain can be
associated with various neuropsychiatric and neuro-developmental diseases or
disorders. Labeled Cortical Distance Map (LCDM), can be a powerful tool to
quantize such morphometric differences. In this article, we investigate various
issues regarding the analysis of LCDM distances in relation to morphometry. The
length of the LCDM distance vector provides the number of voxels (approximately
a multiple of volume (in mm^3)); median, mode, range, and variance of LCDM
distances are all suggestive of size, thickness, and shape differences. However
these measures provide a crude summary based on LCDM distances which may convey
much more information about the tissue in question. To utilize more of this
information, we pool (merge) the LCDM distances from subjects in the same group
or condition. The statistical methodology we employ require normality and
within and between sample independence. We demonstrate that the violation of
these assumptions have mild influence on the tests. We specify the types of
alternatives the parametric and nonparametric tests are more sensitive for. We
also show that the pooled LCDM distances provide powerful results for group
differences in distribution, left-right morphometric asymmetry of the tissues,
and variation of LCDM distances. As an illustrative example, we use gray matter
(GM) tissue of ventral medial prefrontal cortices (VMPFCs) from subjects with
major depressive disorder, subjects at high risk, and control subjects. We find
significant evidence that VMPFCs of subjects with depressive disorders are
different in shape compared to those of normal subjects.
