We investigate the possible formation of a molecular condensate, which might
be, for instance, the analogue of the alpha condensate of nuclear physics, in
the context of multicomponent cold atoms fermionic systems. A simple
paradigmatic model of N-component fermions with contact interactions loaded
into a one-dimensional optical lattice is studied by means of low-energy and
numerical approaches. For attractive interaction, a quasi-long-range molecular
superfluid phase, formed from bound-states made of N fermions, emerges at low
density. We show that trionic and quartetting phases, respectively for N=3,4,
extend in a large domain of the phase diagram and are robust against small
symmetry-breaking perturbations.
