The only place in the world where at this time standard model Higgs bosons
can be produced and detected is the Tevatron at Fermilab. In this contribution,
the most recent results on the search for a low mass Higgs boson are presented,
using datasets of up to 1.9 fb-1. In the absence of signal, the combined
Tevatron cross section limit at a Higgs boson mass of 115 GeV is determined to
be 6.2 (4.3 expected) times the standard model (SM) expectation, at 95 %
confidence level. The expected gain in sensitivity from the forthcoming larger
dataset and improved analysis methods will likely make an exclusion or
observation at low mass possible in the near future.
