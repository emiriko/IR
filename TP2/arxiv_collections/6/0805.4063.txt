We investigate the axial-vector transition constants of the baryon
antidecuplet to the octet and decuplet within the framework of the
self-consistent SU(3) chiral quark-soliton model. Taking into account
rotational 1/N_c and linear m_s corrections and using the symmetry-conserving
quantization, we calculate the axial-vector transition constants. It is found
that the leading-order contributions are generally almost canceled by the
rotational 1/N_c corrections. Thus, the m_s corrections turn out to be
essential contributions to the axial-vector constants. The decay width of the
Theta^+ to NK transition is determined to be Gamma(Theta -> NK)=0.71, MeV,
based on the result of the axial-vector transition constant g_A^* (Theta ->
NK)=0.05. In addition, other strong decays of the baryon antidecuplet are
investigated.
