One-loop scattering on a stack of D3 branes was considered in arXiv:0801.0218
[hep-th]. Divergence was found and its cancelation mechanism was proposed,
wherein it was conjectured that the D-brane geometry be introduced in the form
of counter vertex operators. Here we verify the conjecture at the first few
leading orders in an expansion method that we call large-$r_0$ expansion. We
comment on the relation with the Fischler-Susskind mechanism and discuss the
implications of our result for AdS/CFT.
