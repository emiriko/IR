In this note I report and discuss the physical scheme and the main
approximations used by the event generator code DY\_AB. This Monte Carlo code
is aimed at preliminary simulation, during the stage of apparatus planning, of
Drell-Yan events characterized by azimuthal asymmetries, in experiments with
moderate center of mass energy $\sqrt{s}$ $<<$ 100 GeV.
