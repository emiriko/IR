We present first results on event-by-event elliptic flow fluctuations in
nucleus-nucleus collisions corrected for effects of non-flow correlations where
the magnitude of non-flow correlations has been independently measured in data.
Over the measured range in centrality, we see large relative fluctuations of
25-50%. The results are consistent with predictions from both color glass
condensate and Glauber type initial condition calculations of the
event-by-event participant eccentricity fluctuations.
