We describe the architecture of an original biofeedback system for balance
improvement for fall prevention and present results of a feasibility study. The
underlying principle of this biofeedback consists of providing supplementary
information related to foot sole pressure distribution through a wireless
embedded tongue-placed tactile output device. Twelve young healthy adults
voluntarily participated in this experiment. They were asked to stand as
immobile as possible with their eyes closed in two conditions of nobiofeedback
and biofeedback. Centre of foot pressure (CoP) displacements were recorded
using a force platform. Results showed reduced CoP displacements in the
biofeedback relative to the no-biofeedback condition. On the whole, the present
findings evidence the effectiveness of this system in improving postural
control on young healthy adults. Further investigations are needed to
strengthen the potential clinical value of this device.
