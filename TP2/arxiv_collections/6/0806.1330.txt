These proceedings summarize the sensitivity for the ATLAS and CMS experiments
at the LHC to discover a Standard Model Higgs boson with relatively low
integrated luminosity per experiment. A brief discussion on the expected
performance from these experiments in searches for one or more of the Higgs
bosons from the minimal version of the supersymmetric theories is also
included.
