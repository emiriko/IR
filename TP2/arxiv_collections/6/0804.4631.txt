We study the bosonic analog of Andreev reflection at a normal-superfluid
interface where the superfluid is a boson condensate. We model the normal
region as a zone where nonlinear effects can be neglected. Against the
background of a decaying condensate, we identify a novel contribution to the
current of reflected atoms. The group velocity of this Andreev reflected
component differs from that of the normally reflected one. For a
three-dimensional planar or two-dimensional linear interface Andreev reflection
is neither specular nor conjugate.
