The rapidly rising fields of spintronics and quantum information science have
led to a strong interest in developing the ability to coherently manipulate
electron spins. Electron spin resonance (ESR) is a powerful technique to
manipulate spins that is commonly achieved by applying an oscillating magnetic
field. However, the technique has proven very challenging when addressing
individual spins. In contrast, by mixing the spin and charge degrees of freedom
in a controlled way through engineered non-uniform magnetic fields, electron
spin can be manipulated electrically without the need of high-frequency
magnetic fields. Here we realize electrically-driven addressable spin rotations
on two individual electrons by integrating a micron-size ferromagnet to a
double quantum dot device. We find that the electrical control and spin
selectivity is enabled by the micro-magnet's stray magnetic field which can be
tailored to multi-dots architecture. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of
manipulating electron spins electrically in a scalable way.
