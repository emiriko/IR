We propose a simple Monte Carlo method to calculate the interfacial free
energy between the substrate and the material. Using this method we investigate
the interfacial free energys of the hard sphere fluid and solid phases near a
smooth hard wall. According to the obtained interfacial free energys of the
coexisting fluid and solid phases and the Young equation we are able to
determine the contact angle with high accuracy, cos$\theta$ = 1:010(31), which
indicates that a smooth hard wall can be wetted completely by the hard sphere
crystal at the interface between the wall and the hard sphere fluid.
