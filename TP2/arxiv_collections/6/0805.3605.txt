Equivocation rate has been widely used as an information-theoretic measure of
security after Shannon[10]. It simplifies problems by removing the effect of
atypical behavior from the system. In [9], however, Merhav and Arikan
considered the alternative of using guessing exponent to analyze the Shannon's
cipher system. Because guessing exponent captures the atypical behavior, the
strongest expressible notion of secrecy requires the more stringent condition
that the size of the key, instead of its entropy rate, to be equal to the size
of the message. The relationship between equivocation and guessing exponent are
also investigated in [6][7] but it is unclear which is a better measure, and
whether there is a unifying measure of security.
  Instead of using equivocation rate or guessing exponent, we study the wiretap
channel in [2] using the success exponent, defined as the exponent of a
wiretapper successfully learn the secret after making an exponential number of
guesses to a sequential verifier that gives yes/no answer to each guess. By
extending the coding scheme in [2][5] and the converse proof in [4] with the
new Overlap Lemma 5.2, we obtain a tradeoff between secrecy and reliability
expressed in terms of lower bounds on the error and success exponents of
authorized and respectively unauthorized decoding of the transmitted messages.
  From this, we obtain an inner bound to the region of strongly achievable
public, private and guessing rate triples for which the exponents are strictly
positive. The closure of this region is equivalent to the closure of the region
in Theorem 1 of [2] when we treat equivocation rate as the guessing rate.
However, it is unclear if the inner bound is tight.
