We prove a change of variable formula for the 2D fractional Brownian motion
of index H bigger of equal to 1/4. For H strictly bigger than 1/4, our formula
coincides with that obtained by using the rough paths theory. For H=1/4 (the
more interesting case), there is an additional term that is a classical Wiener
integral against an independent standard Brownian motion.
