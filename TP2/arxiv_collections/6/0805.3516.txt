For arbitrary $\beta > 0$, we use the orthogonal polynomials techniques
developed by R. Killip and I. Nenciu to study certain linear statistics
associated with the circular and Jacobi $\beta$ ensembles. We identify the
distribution of these statistics then prove a joint central limit theorem. In
the circular case, similar statements have been proved using different methods
by a number of authors. In the Jacobi case these results are new.
