It is shown that a new type of the self-similar spherical ionization waves
may exist in gases. All spatial scales and the propagation velocity of such
waves increase exponentially in time. Conditions for existence of these waves
are established, their structure is described and approximate analytical
relationships between the principal parameters are obtained. It is notable that
spherical ionization waves can serve as the simplest, but structurally complete
and physically transparent model of streamer in homogeneous electric field.
