We consider a class of strongly q-log-convex polynomials based on a
triangular recurrence relation with linear coefficients, and we show that the
Bell polynomials, the Bessel polynomials, the Ramanujan polynomials and the
Dowling polynomials are strongly q-log-convex. We also prove that the Bessel
transformation preserves log-convexity.
