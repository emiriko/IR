This paper deals with analytic families of holomorphic iterated function
systems. Using real analyticity of the pressure function (which we prove), we
establish a classification theorem for analytic families of holomorphic
iterated function systems which depend continuously on a parameter when the
space of holomorphic iterated function systems is endowed with the
"$\lambda$-topology". This classification theorem allows us to generalize some
geometric results from the paper ("Lambda-Topology vs. Pointwise Topology", to
appear in Ergod. Th. & Dynam. Sys.) of the authors, and gives us a better and
clearer understanding of the global structure of the space of conformal IFSs.
