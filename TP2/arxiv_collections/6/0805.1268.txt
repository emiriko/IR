Using a shell model which is capable of describing the spectra of upper
$g_{9/2}$-shell nuclei close to the $N=Z$ line, we study the structure of two
isomeric states $7^{+}$ and $21^{+}$ in the odd-odd $N=Z$ nucleus $^{94}$Ag. It
is found that both isomeric states exhibit a large collectivity. The $7^{+}$
state is oblately deformed, and is suggested to be a shape isomer in nature.
The $21^{+}$ state becomes isomeric because of level inversion of the $19^{+}$
and $21^{+}$ states due to core excitations across the $N=Z=50$ shell gap.
Calculation of spectroscopic quadrupole moment indicates clearly an enhancement
in these states due to the core excitations. However, the present shell model
calculation that produces the $19^{+}$-$21^{+}$ level inversion cannot accept
the large-deformation picture of Mukha {\it et al.} in Nature {\bf 439}, 298
(2006).
