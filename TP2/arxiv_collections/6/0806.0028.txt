In the present paper we analyze the critical properties of a quantum
spherical spin glass model with short range, random interactions. Since the
model allows for rigorous detailed calculations, we can show how the effective
partition function calculated with help of the replica method for the spin
glass fluctuating fields separates into a mean field contribution for the
replica diagonal fields and a strictly short range partition function for the
replica off-diagonal fields. The mean field part coincides with previous
results. The short range part describes a phase transition in a Q^3-field
theory, where the fluctuating fields depend on a space variable and two
independent time variables.This we analyze using the renormalization group with
dimensional regularization and minimal subtraction of dimensional poles. By
generalizing standard field theory methods to our particular situation, we can
identify the critical dimensionality as d_c = 5 at very low temperatures due to
the dimensionality shift D_c = d_c + 1. we then perform a \epsilon' expansion
to order one loop to calculate the critical exponents by solving the
renormalization group equations.
