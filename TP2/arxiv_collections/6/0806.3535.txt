Using a sample of 68 million KL -> 3pi0 decays collected in 1996-1999 by the
KTeV (E832) experiment at Fermilab, we present a detailed study of the KL ->
3pi0 Dalitz plot density. We report the first observation of interference from
KL->pi+pi-pi0 decays in which pi+pi- rescatters to 2pi0 in a final-state
interaction. This rescattering effect is described by the Cabibbo-Isidori
model, and it depends on the difference in pion scattering lengths between the
isospin I=0 and I=2 states, a0-a2. Using the Cabibbo-Isidori model, we present
the first measurement of the KL-> 3pi0 quadratic slope parameter that accounts
for the rescattering effect.
