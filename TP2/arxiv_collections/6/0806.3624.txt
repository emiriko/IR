We present results on the strong and electroweak NLO corrections to the
production of a Higgs boson plus two hard jets via weak interactions at the
LHC. The calculation includes all weak-boson fusion and quark-antiquark
annihilation diagrams as well as all related interferences. We discuss
corrections of different origin (QCD corrections of vector-boson-fusion type
and interferences, electroweak corrections induced by quark or photonic initial
states, heavy-Higgs-boson effects, etc.) and give some new results for
distributions for a Higgs-boson mass of 200 GeV. The electroweak corrections
are of the same size as the QCD corrections, viz. typically at the level of
5-10% for a Higgs-boson mass up to \sim 700 GeV. In general, they do not simply
rescale differential distributions, but induce distortions at the level of 10%.
The discussed corrections have been implemented in a flexible Monte Carlo event
generator.
