The in-plane magnetic penetration depth \lambda_{ab} in optimally doped
(BiPb)_2(SrLa)_2CuO_{6+\delta} (OP Bi2201) was studied by means of muon-spin
rotation. The measurements of \lambda_{ab}^{-2}(T) are inconsistent with a
simple model of a d-wave order parameter and a uniform quasiparticle weight
around the Fermi surface. The data are well described assuming the angular gap
symmetry obtained in ARPES experiments [Phys. Rev. Lett {\bf 98}, 267004
(2007)], where it was shown that the superconducting gap in OP Bi2201 exists
only in segments of the Fermi surface near the nodes. We find that the
remaining parts of the Fermi surface, which are strongly affected by the
pseudogap state, do not contribute significantly to the superconducting
condensate. Our data provide evidence that high temperature superconductivity
and pseudogap behavior in cuprates are competing phenomena.
