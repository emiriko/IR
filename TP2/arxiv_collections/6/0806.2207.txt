We present a comprehensive study of the phase transitions in the single-field
reaction-diffusion stochastic systems with field-dependent mobility of a
power-low form and the internal fluctuations. Using variational principles and
mean-field theory it was shown that the noise can sustain spatial patterns and
leads to disordering phase transitions. We have shown that the phase
transitions can be of critical or non-critical character.
