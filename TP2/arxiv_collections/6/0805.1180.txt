We consider the anomalous dimension of the fermionic highest states Tr(psi^L)
in the su(1|1) sector of N=4 SYM at strong coupling. In the thermodynamical
L->OO limit it is described by a BES-like integral equation recently proposed
by Rej, Staudacher and Zieme. The strong coupling regime of this equation is
analyzed numerically and analytically by Neumann expansion methods which have
been developed for the sl(2) sector. We compute analytically the first two
terms of the strong coupling expansion and present numerical results for the
next correction. We illustrate various specific features valid for the su(1|1)
sector. In particular, at next-to-leading order, we find and solve a singular
integral equation describing the scaling continuum limit of the Neumann
coefficients.
