Adiabatic quantum computation is based on the adiabatic evolution of quantum
systems. We analyse a particular class of qauntum adiabatic evolutions where
either the initial or final Hamiltonian is a one-dimensional projector
Hamiltonian on the corresponding ground state. The minimum energy gap which
governs the time required for a successful evolution is shown to be
proportional to the overlap of the ground states of the initial and final
Hamiltonians. We show that such evolutions exhibit a rapid crossover as the
ground state changes abruptly near the transition point where the energy gap is
minimum. Furthermore, a faster evolution can be obtained by performing a
partial adiabatic evolution within a narrow interval around the transition
point. These results generalize and quantify earlier works.
