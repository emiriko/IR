A phylogenetic network is a directed acyclic graph that visualises an
evolutionary history containing so-called reticulations such as recombinations,
hybridisations or lateral gene transfers. Here we consider the construction of
a simplest possible phylogenetic network consistent with an input set T, where
T contains at least one phylogenetic tree on three leaves (a triplet) for each
combination of three taxa. To quantify the complexity of a network we consider
both the total number of reticulations and the number of reticulations per
biconnected component, called the level of the network. We give polynomial-time
algorithms for constructing a level-1 respectively a level-2 network that
contains a minimum number of reticulations and is consistent with T (if such a
network exists). In addition, we show that if T is precisely equal to the set
of triplets consistent with some network, then we can construct such a network
with smallest possible level in time O(|T|^(k+1)), if k is a fixed upper bound
on the level of the network.
