We show that Pr${_{0.5}}$Ca$_{0.5}$MnO${_3}$ with 2.5% Al substitution and
La${_{0.5}}$Ca$_{0.5}$MnO${_3}$ (LCMO) exhibit qualitatively similar and
visibly anomalous M-H curves at low temperature. Magnetic field causes a broad
first-order but irreversible antiferromagnetic (AF)-insulating (I) to
ferromagnetic (FM)-metallic (M) transition in both and gives rise to soft FM
state. However, the low temperature equilibrium state of
Pr$_{0.5}$Ca$_{0.5}$Mn$_{0.975}$Al$_{0.025}$O$_3$ (PCMAO) is FM-M whereas that
of LCMO is AF-I. In both the systems the respective equilibrium phase coexists
with the other phase with contrasting order, which is not in equilibrium, and
the cooling field can tune the fractions of the coexisting phases. It is shown
earlier that the coexisting FM-M phase behaves like `magnetic glass' in LCMO.
Here we show from specially designed measurement protocols that the AF-I phase
of PCMAO has all the characteristics of magnetic glassy states. It devitrifies
on heating and also recrystallizes to equilibrium FM-M phase after annealing.
This glass-like AF-I phase also shows similar intriguing feature observed in
FM-M magnetic glassy state of LCMO that when the starting coexisting fraction
of glass is larger, successive annealing results in larger fraction of
equilibrium phase. This similarity between two manganite systems with
contrasting magnetic orders of respective glassy and equilibrium phases points
toward a possible universality.
