Fast sweep projection onto Feshbach molecules has been widely used as a probe
of fermionic condensates. By determining the exact dynamics of a pair of atoms
in time varying magnetic fields, we calculate the number of condensed and
noncondensed molecules created after fast magnetic field sweeps from the BCS to
the BEC side of the resonances in $^{40}$K and $^{6}$Li, for different sweep
rates and a range of initial and final fields. We discuss the relation between
the initial fermionic condensate fraction and the molecular condensate fraction
measured after the sweep.
