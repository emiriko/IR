In this study, under general frame of MAny Connected Intelligent Particles
Systems (MACIPS), we reproduce two new simple subsets of such intelligent
complex network, namely hybrid intelligent systems, involved a few prominent
intelligent computing and approximate reasoning methods: self organizing
feature map (SOM), Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System and Rough Set Theory (RST).
Over this, we show how our algorithms can be construed as a linkage of
government-society interaction, where government catches various fashions of
behavior: solid (absolute) or flexible. So, transition of such society, by
changing of connectivity parameters (noise) from order to disorder is inferred.
Add to this, one may find an indirect mapping among financial systems and
eventual market fluctuations with MACIPS.
