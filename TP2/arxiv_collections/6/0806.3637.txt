We use the quasi-static particle-in-cell code QuickPIC to perform full-scale,
one-to-one LWFA numerical experiments, with parameters that closely follow
current experimental conditions. The propagation of state-of-the-art laser
pulses in both preformed and uniform plasma channels is examined. We show that
the presence of the channel is important whenever the laser self-modulations do
not dominate the propagation. We examine the acceleration of an externally
injected electron beam in the wake generated by 10 J laser pulses, showing that
by using ten-centimeter-scale plasma channels it is possible to accelerate
electrons to more than 4 GeV. A comparison between QuickPIC and 2D OSIRIS is
provided. Good qualitative agreement between the two codes is found, but the 2D
full PIC simulations fail to predict the correct laser and wakefield
amplitudes.
