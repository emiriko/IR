We calculate the quasiparticle properties of chiral two-dimensional Dirac
electrons in graphene within the Landau Fermi Liquid scheme based on $GW$
approximation in the presence of disorder. Disorder effects due to charged
impurity scattering plays a crucial role in density dependence of quasiparticle
quantities. Mode-coupling approach to scattering rate and self-energy in $GW$
approximation for quasiparticle renormalized Fermi velocity and
spin-antisymmetric Landau Fermi parameter incorporating the many-body
interactions and the disorder effects show reduction of these quantities by
5-15 percent at available experimental charge carrier density region.
