In this work, Lienard equations are considered. The limit cycles of these
systems are studied by applying the homotopy analysis method. The amplitude and
frequency obtained with this methodology are in good agreement with those
calculated by computational methods. This puts in evidence that the homotopy
analysis method is an useful tool to solve nonlinear differential equations.
