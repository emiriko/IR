We describe measurements on microwave coplanar resonators designed for
quantum bit experiments. Resonators have been patterned onto sapphire and
silicon substrates, and quality factors in excess of a million have been
observed. The resonant frequency shows a high sensitivity to magnetic field
applied perpendicular to the plane of the film, with a quadratic dependence for
the fundamental, second and third harmonics. Frequency shift of hundreds of
linewidths can be obtained.
