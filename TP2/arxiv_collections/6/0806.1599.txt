We report on an investigation of the double-layer manganite series
(La(1-z)Pr(z))1.2Sr1.8Mn2O7 (0 <= z <= 1), carried out on single crystals by
means of both macroscopic magnetometry and local probes of magnetism (muSR,
55Mn NMR). Muons and NMR demonstrate an antiferromagnetically ordered ground
state at non-ferromagnetic compositions (z >= 0.6), while more moderate Pr
substitutions (0.2 <= z <= 0.4) induce a spin reorientation transition within
the ferromagnetic phase.
  A large magnetic susceptibility is detected at {Tc,TN} < T < 250K at all
compositions. From 55Mn NMR spectroscopy, such a response is unambiguously
assigned to the intergrowth of a ferromagnetic pseudocubic phase
(La(1-z)Pr(z))(1-x)Sr(x)MnO3, with an overall volume fraction estimated as
0.5-0.7% from magnetometry. Evidence is provided for the coupling of the
magnetic moments of these inclusions with the magnetic moments of the
surrounding (La(1-z)Pr(z))1.2Sr1.8Mn2O7 phase, as in the case of finely
dispersed impurities. We argue that the ubiquitous intergrowth phase may play a
role in the marked first-order character of the magnetic transition and the
metamagnetic properties above Tc reported for double-layer manganites.
