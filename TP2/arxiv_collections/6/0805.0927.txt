This paper presents a detailed noise analysis and a noise-based optimization
procedure for resonant MEMS structures. A design for high sensitivity of MEMS
structures needs to take into account the noise shaping induced by damping
phenomena at micro scale. The existing literature presents detailed models for
the damping at microscale, but usually neglects them in the noise analysis
process, assuming instead a white spectrum approximation for the
mechano-thermal noise. The present work extends the implications of the complex
gas-solid interaction into the field of noise analysis for mechanical sensors,
and provides a semi-automatic procedure for behavioral macromodel extraction
and sensor optimization with respect to signal-to-noise ratio.
