Properties of single heavy flavor baryons in a non relativistic potential
model with colour coulomb plus power law confinement potential have been
studied. The ground state masses of single heavy baryons and the mass
difference between the ($J^{P}={3/2}^{+}$ and $J^{P}={1/2}^{+}$) states are
computed using a spin dependent two body potential. Using the spin-flavour
structure of the constituting quarks and by defining an effective confined mass
of the constituent quarks within the baryons, the magnetic moments are
computed. The masses and magnetic moments of the single heavy baryons are found
to be in accordance with the existing experimental values and with other
theoretical predictions. It is found that an additional attractive interaction
of the order of -200 Me$V$ is required for the antisymmetric states of
$\Lambda_{Q}$ (Q$\in c,b)$. It is also found that the spin hyperfine
interaction parameters play decisive role in hadron spectroscopy.
