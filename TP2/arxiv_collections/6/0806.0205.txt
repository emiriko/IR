Much evolutionary information is stored in the fluctuations of protein length
distributions. The genome size and non-coding DNA content can be calculated
based only on the protein length distributions. So there is intrinsic
relationship between the coding DNA size and non-coding DNA size. According to
the correlations and quasi-periodicity of protein length distributions, we can
classify life into three domains. Strong evidences are found to support the
order in the structures of protein length distributions.
