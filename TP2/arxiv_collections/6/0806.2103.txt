We study finite size effects for composite operators in the SU(2) sector of
the superconformal beta-deformed N=4 SYM theory. In particular we concentrate
on the spectrum of one single magnon. Since in this theory one-impurity states
are non BPS we compute their anomalous dimensions including wrapping
contributions up to four loops and discuss higher order effects.
