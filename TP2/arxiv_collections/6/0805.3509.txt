We study a lattice model of attractive colloids. It is exactly solvable on
sparse random graphs. As the pressure and temperature are varied it reproduces
many characteristic phenomena of liquids, glasses and colloidal systems such as
ideal gel formation, liquid-glass phase coexistence, jamming, or the reentrance
of the glass transition.
