We investigate solutions for a particular class of linear equations in
dendriform algebras. Motivations as well as several applications are provided.
The latter follow naturally from the intimate link between dendriform algebras
and Rota-Baxter operators, e.g. the Riemann integral or Jackson's q-integral.
