I did off-lattice 3D Monte Carlo simulations for polymer translocation
through a narrow pore at low external field, trying to be as close to a direct
approach as possible. The process was found non equilibrium globally, but
dynamics of the monomers close to the pore (the fold) was found close to quasi
equilibrium. I observed a tension (or pressure) buildup near the pore, and
subdiffusion for the displacement of the middle monomer in the pore, as
reported in the literature. I did not find the distribution of the reaction
coordinate after some time of free diffusion predicted by the fractional
diffusion equation.
