The framework of Large Extra Dimensions provides a way to explain why gravity
is weaker compared to the other forces in nature. A consequence of this model
is the possible production of D-dimensional Black Holes in high energy p-p
collisions at the Large Hadron Collider. The present work uses the CATFISH
Black Hole generator to study quantitatively how these events could be observed
in the hadronic channel at mid-rapidity using a particle tracking detector.
