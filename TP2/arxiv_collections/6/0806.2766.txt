In this study used is an approach based on measurements of the total energy
distribution (TED) of field emitted electrons in order to examine the
properties of Pd (133) from the aspect of both hydrogen adsorption and surface
hydrides formation. The most favourable sites offered to a hydrogen atom to be
adsorbed have been indicated and an attempt to describe the peaks of the
enhancement factor R spectrum to the specific adsorption sites has also been
made.
