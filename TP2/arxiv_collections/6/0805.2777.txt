The Casimir interaction between two concentric corrugated cylinders provides
the mechanism for non-contact gears. To this end, we calculate the Casimir
torque between two such cylinders, described by $\delta$-potentials, which
interact through a scalar field. We derive analytic expressions for the Casimir
torque for the case when the corrugation amplitudes are small in comparison to
the corrugation wavelengths. We derive explicit results for the Dirichlet case,
and exact results for the weak coupling limit, in the leading order. The
results for the corrugated cylinders approach the corresponding expressions for
the case of corrugated parallel plates in the limit of large radii of cylinders
(relative to the difference in their radii) while keeping the corrugation
wavelength fixed.
