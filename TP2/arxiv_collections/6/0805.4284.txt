The DC charge current, field-induced spin polarization and spin textures are
studied in the 1D gated superlattice with both fixed and varying Rashba and
Dresselhaus contributions to spin-orbit coupling. It is found that a spin
component with zero mean value can demonstrate non-vanishing field-induced spin
texture in a superlattice cell which can be probed experimentally, with the
highest amplitudes achievable in an interval of comparable Rashba and
Dresselhaus terms. The consideration of the finite parameters for collision
rate and temperature is found to be non-destructive for the calculated current
and spin characteristics depending on all states below the Fermi level.
