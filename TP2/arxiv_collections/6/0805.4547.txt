Two dimensional adelic objects were introduced by I. Fesenko in his study of
the Hasse zeta function associated to a regular model $\mathcal E$ of the
elliptic curve $E$. The Hasse-Weil $L$-function $L(E,s)$ of $E$ appears in the
denominator of the Hasse zeta function of $\mathcal E$. The two dimensional
adelic analysis predicts that the integrand $h$ of the boundary term of the two
dimensional zeta integral attached to $\mathcal E$ is mean-periodic. The
mean-periodicity of $h$ implies the meromorphic continuation and the functional
equation of $L(E,s)$. On the other hand, if $E$ is modular, several nice
analytic properties of $L(E,s)$, in particular the analytic continuation and
the functional equation, are obtained by the theory of the cuspical automorphic
representation of GL(2) over the ordinary ring of adele (one dimensional adelic
object). In this article we try to relate the theory of two dimensional adelic
object to the theory of cuspidal automorphic representation of GL(2) over the
one dimensional adelic object, under the assumption that $E$ is modular.
Roughly speaking, they are dual each other.
