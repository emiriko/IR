We investigate when the quantum correlations of a bipartite system, under the
influence of environments with memory, are not reproducible with certainty by a
classical local hidden variable model. To this purpose, we compare the dynamics
of a Bell inequality with that of entanglement, as measured by concurrence. We
find time regions when Bell inequality is not violated even in correspondence
to high values of concurrence (up to $\approx 0.8$). We also suggest that these
results may be observed by adopting a modification of a recent experimental
optical setup. These findings indicate that even highly entangled systems
cannot be exploited with certainty in contexts where the non classical
reproducibility of quantum correlations is required.
