Considering the gluon condensate corrections, the form factors relevant to
the semileptonic rare $B_c \rar D,D_s(J^{P}=0^{-}) l^{+}l^{-}$ with
$l=\tau,\mu,e$ and $B_c \rar D,D_s(J^{P}=0^{-})\nu\bar{\nu}$ transitions are
calculated in the framework of the three point QCD sum rules. The heavy quark
effective theory limit of the form factors are computed. The branching fraction
of these decays are also evaluated and compared with the predictions of the
relativistic constituent quark model. Analyzing of such type transitions could
give useful information about the strong interactions inside the pseudoscalar
$D_{s}$ meson and its structure.
