High resolution photoemission measurements have been carried out on
non-superconducting SmOFeAs parent compound and superconducting
Sm(O$_{1-x}$F$_x$)FeAs (x=0.12, and 0.15) compounds. The momentum-integrated
spectra exhibit a clear Fermi cutoff that shows little leading-edge shift in
the superconducting state which suggests the Fermi surface sheet(s) around the
$\Gamma$ point may not be gapped in this multiband superconductors. A robust
feature at 13 meV is identified in all these samples. Spectral weight
suppression near E$_F$ with decreasing temperature is observed in both undoped
and doped samples that points to a possible existence of a pseudogap in these
Fe-based compounds.
