We present first STAR measurement on two heavy-flavor particle correlations
in $\sqrt{s}=200$ GeV $p+p$ collisions at RHIC. Heavy-flavor (charm and bottom)
events are identified and separated on a statistical basis through their
characteristic decay topology using azimuthal correlation of non-photonic
electrons and reconstructed open charmed mesons. The results are compared to
simulations from PYTHIA and MC@NLO event generators. The gluon splitting
contribution is found to be small. The relative bottom contribution to the
non-photonic electrons is $\sim50%$ at $\pT > 5.5$ GeV/c.
