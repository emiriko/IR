We show that the GIT quotients of suitable loci in the Hilbert and Chow
schemes of 4-canonically embedded curves of genus $g\ge 3$ are the moduli space
$\bar{M}_g^{\text{ps}}$ of pseudo-stable curves constructed by Schubert in
\cite{Schubert} using Chow varieties and 3-canonical models. The only new
ingredient needed in the Hilbert scheme variant is a more careful analysis of
the stability with respect to a certain 1-ps $\lambda$ of the $m^{\text{th}}$
Hilbert points of curves $X$ with elliptic tails. We compute the exact weight
with which $\lambda$ acts, and not just the leading term in $m$ of this weight.
A similar analysis of stability of curves with rational cuspidal tails allows
us to determine the stable and semistable 4-canonical Chow loci. Although here
the geometry of the quotient is more complicated because there are strictly
semi-stable orbits, we are able to again identify it as
$\bar{M}_g^{\text{ps}}$. Our computations yield, as byproducts, examples of
both $m$-Hilbert unstable and $m$-Hilbert stable $X$ that are Chow strictly
semi-stable.
