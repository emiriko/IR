In the framework of General Relativity we develop a method for analysis of
the operation of the optical position meters in their photodetectors proper
reference frames. These frames are non-inertial in general due to the action of
external fluctuative forces on meters test masses, including detectors. For
comparison we also perform the calculations in the laboratory (globally
inertial) reference frame and demonstrate that for certain optical schemes
laboratory-based analysis results in unmeasurable quantities, in contrast to
the detector-based analysis. We also calculate the response of the simplest
optical meters to weak plane gravitational waves and fluctuative motions of
their test masses. It is demonstrated that for the round-trip meter analysis in
both the transverse-traceless (TT) and local Lorentz (LL) gauges produces equal
results, while for the forward-trip meter corresponding results differ in
accordance with different physical assumptions (e.g. procedure of clocks
synchronization) implicitly underlying the construction of the TT and LL
gauges.
