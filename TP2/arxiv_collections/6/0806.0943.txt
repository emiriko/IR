I study the effect of scalar and spin-orbit rescattering terms, in the
production of a nonzero Sivers-like asymmetry in proton-proton collisions
(nclusive production and Drell-Yan) at moderate center of mass energies
$\sqrt{s}$ $<$ 15 GeV and transverse momentum up to 3 GeV/c. An
ultrarelativistic generalization of the Glauber formalism is here used to (i)
fit the scalar and spin-orbit interaction terms on proton-proton elastic
scattering data, including analyzing power, (ii) transfer such information to
inclusive proton-proton scattering. It is shown that the phenomenological
interactions responsible for the nonzero analyzing power in proton-proton
elastic scattering produce a relevant nonzero analyzing power in inclusive
processes associated with proton-proton collisions. This could represent a
relevant (possibly higher-twist) contribution to the Sivers asymmetry.
