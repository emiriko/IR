We solve stationarity equations of the geometric measure of entanglement for
multi-qubit W-type states. In this way we compute analytically the maximal
overlap of one-parameter $n$-qubit and two-parameter four-qubit W-type states
and their nearest product states. Possible extensions to arbitrary W-type
states and geometrical interpretations of these results are discussed in
detail.
