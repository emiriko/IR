We report on the development of a multi-wavelength source locked to the ITU-T
grid at 100 GHz spacing and based on ultra-flattened dispersion photonic
crystal fibers. The ITU-T grid frequencies are generated by taking advantage of
multiple four-wave mixing processes. We experimentally obtained 250 products
spanning over 200nm by launching 03 strong pump signals. Simulations based on
Split-Step Fourier Method have been carried out in order to investigate and
improve the performance of this nonlinear optical device.
