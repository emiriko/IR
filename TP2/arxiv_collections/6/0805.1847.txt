The domain of application of quantization methods is traditionally restricted
to smooth classical observables. We show that the coherent states or
"anti-Wick" quantization enables us to construct fairly reasonable quantum
versions of irregular observables living on the classical phase space, such as
the angle function, the time function of a free particle and even a large set
of distributions comprising the tempered distributions.
