Genetic data obtained on population samples convey information about their
evolutionary history. Inference methods can extract this information (at least
partially) but they require sophisticated statistical techniques that have been
made available to the biologist community (through computer programs) only for
simple and standard situations typically involving a small number of samples.
We propose here a computer program (DIYABC) for inference based on Approximate
Bayesian Computation (ABC), in which scenarios can be customized by the user to
fit many complex situations involving any number of populations and samples.
Such scenarios involve any combination of population divergences, admixtures
and stepwise population size changes. DIYABC can be used to compare competing
scenarios, estimate parameters for one or more scenarios, and compute bias and
precision measures for a given scenario and known values of parameters (the
current version applies to unlinked microsatellite data). This article
describes key methods used in the program and provides its main features. The
analysis of one simulated and one real data set, both with complex evolutionary
scenarios, illustrates the main possibilities of DIYABC
