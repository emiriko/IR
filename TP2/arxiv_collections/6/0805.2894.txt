An explicit algorithm for calculating the optimized Euler angles for both
qubit state transfer and gate engineering given two arbitary fixed Hamiltonians
is presented. It is shown how the algorithm enables us to efficiently implement
single qubit gates even if the control is severely restricted and the
experimentally accessible Hamiltonians are far from orthogonal. It is further
shown that using the optimized Euler angles can significantly improve the
fidelity of quantum operations even for systems where the experimentally
accessible Hamiltonians are nearly orthogonal. Unlike schemes such as composite
pulses, the proposed scheme does not significantly increase the number of local
operations or gate operation times.
