We study the possible signatures of non-universal scalar masses in
supersymmetry at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). This is done, following our
recent study on gaugino non-universality, via a multichannel analysis, based
largely on the ratios of event rates for different final states, aimed at
minimizing irregularity in the pattern due to extraneous effects and errors. We
have studied (a) squark-slepton non-universality, (b) non-universality in
sfermion masses of the third family, (c) the effects of $SO(10) D$-terms in
supersymmetric Grand Unified Theories. After presenting an elaborate numerical
analysis of like- and opposite-sign dileptons, inclusive and hadronically quiet
trileptons as well as inclusive jet final states, we point out specific
features of the spectrum in each case, which can be differentiated in the above
channels from the spectrum for a minimal supergravity scenario with a universal
scalar mass at high scale. The event selection criteria, and the situations
where the signals are sizable enough for a comparatve study, are also
delineated. It is found that, with some exceptions, the trilepton channels are
likely to be especially useful for this purpose.
