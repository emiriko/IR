Heavy quark production probes QCD at the interface of the perturbative and
non-perturbative regimes. Studying the production of heavy quarks is an
important test of models in both regimes. In this article, recent results on
beauty and charm production from the CDF and D0 experiments at the Tevatron are
reported. These include measurements of correlated b-bbar production, the
psi(2S) production cross section, and Upsilon(1S) and Upsilon(2S) polarization.
