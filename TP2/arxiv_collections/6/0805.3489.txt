We use the functional renormalization group to analyze the temperature
dependence of the quasi-particle scattering rates in the two-dimensional
Hubbard model below half-filling. Using a band structure appropriate to
overdoped Tl2Ba2CuO(6+x) we find a strongly angle dependent term linearly
dependent on temperature which derives from an increasing scattering vertex as
the energy scale is lowered. This behavior agrees with recent experiments and
confirms earlier conclusions on the origin of the breakdown of the Landau Fermi
liquid near the onset of superconductivity.
