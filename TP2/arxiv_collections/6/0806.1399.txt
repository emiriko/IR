The analytic properties of the energy density rho(t) of the cosmic fluid, and
the Hubble parameter H(t), are investigated near to the future singularity
t=t_s assuming different forms for the equation of state. First, it is shown
that the inclusion of quantum effects coming from the conformal anomaly
modifies the singularity. Thereafter, we consider the effect coming from a bulk
viscosity in the fluid. The viscosity tends to reduce the magnitude of t_s, but
does not alter the singularity itself (the exponent). Main emphasis is laid on
the simple case when the equation of state is p=w*rho, with w a constant.
