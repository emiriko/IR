The motion of single quantum particle through Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC)
is considered within perturbation theory with respect to the particle-BEC
interaction. The Hamiltonian of BEC is diagonalized by means of Bogoliubov's
method. The process of dissipation due to the creation of excitation in BEC is
analyzed and the dissipation rate is calculated in the lowest order of
perturbation theory. The Landau's criterion for energy dissipation in BEC is
then recovered. The energy spectrum of the impurity particle due to the
interaction with BEC and its effective mass are evaluated.
