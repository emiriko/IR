Emergent anyons are the key elements of the topological quantum computation
and topological quantum memory. We study a two-component fermion model with
conventional two-body interaction in an open boundary condition and show that
several subsets in the low-lying excitations obey the same fusion rules as
those of the toric code model. Those string-like non-local excitations in a
given subset obey mutual semionic statistics. We show how to peel off one of
such subset from other degenerate subsets and manipulate anyons in cold dipolar
Fermi atoms or cold dipolar fermionic heteronuclear molecules in optical
lattices by means of the established techniques.
