In this paper, we develop a new method to find the exact solutions of the
Einstein's field equations by using which we construct time-periodic solutions.
The singularities of the time-periodic solutions are investigated and some new
physical phenomena, such as the time-periodic event horizon, are found. The
applications of these solutions in modern cosmology and general relativity are
expected.
