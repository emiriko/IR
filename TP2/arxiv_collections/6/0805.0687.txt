We introduce a novel class of stable nonlinear modes trapped in a lower-index
film core sandwiched between two optical lattices, or in the cylindrical core
of a radial lattice, imprinted in defocusing media. Such family of nonlinear
modes transforms into defect lattice solitons when the core width is
sufficiently small or into an array of kinks when the width is large enough. We
find that higher-order modes with multiple zeros inside the guiding core can be
stable in one-dimensional settings.
