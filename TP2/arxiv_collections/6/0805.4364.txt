This investigation describes and demonstrates a novel technique for the
visualization of magnetic fields. Two ferrofluid Hele-Shaw cells have been
constructed to facilitate the imaging of magnetic field lines. We deduce that
magnetically induced photonic band gap arrays similar to electrostatic liquid
crystal operation are responsible for the photographed images and seek to
mathematically prove the images are of dipole nature.
  A simple way of explaining this work is to think of the old magnetic iron
filling experiments; but now each iron filling is a molecule floating in a
liquid. Each molecule has the freedom to act as an independent lens that can be
aligned by an external magnetic field. Because each lens directs light, the
external field can be analyzed by following the light paths captured in the
photographs.
