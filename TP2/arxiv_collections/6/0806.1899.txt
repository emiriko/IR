We have developed a modeling method suitable to analyze single- and
multiple-electron resonances detected by electric-field-sensitive scanning
probe techniques. The method is based on basic electrostatics and a numerical
boundary-element approach. The results compare well to approximate analytical
expressions and experimental data.
