We introduce a one-dimensional valence bond solid (VBS) state with symplectic
symmetry SP(n) and construct the corresponding parent Hamiltonian. We argue
that there is a gap in the spectrum. We calculate exactly the static
correlation functions, which fall off exponentially. Hence the model introduced
here shares all properties of the Haldane scenario for integer-spin quantum
antiferromagnets. We further show that the VBS state possesses string order and
discuss its generalization to higher dimensions.
