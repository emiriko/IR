Recent $daily$ data of the Southern Oscillation Index have been analyzed. The
power spectrum indicates major intrinsic geophysical short periods. We find
interesting ``high frequency'' oscillations at 24, 27, 37, 76, 100 and 365
days. In particular the 24 days peaks may correspond to the Branstator-Kushnir
wave, the 27 days may be due to the moon effect rotation, the 37 days peaks is
most probably related to the Madden and Julian Oscillation. It is not yet clear
the explanations for the 76 days which may be associated with interseasonal
oscillation in the tropical atmosphere; the 100 days could be resulting from a
mere beat between the 37 and 27 periods, or the 76 and 365 days. Next these
periods are used to reconstruct the signal and to produce a forecast for the
next 9 months, at the time of writing. After cleansing the signal of those
periodicities a detrended fluctuation analysis is performed to reveal the
nature of the stochastic structures in the signal and whether specific
correlation can be found. We study the evolution of the distribution of first
return times, in particular between $extreme$ $events$. A markedly significant
difference from the expected distribution for uncorrelated events is found.
