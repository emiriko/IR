The newly discovered iron-based superconductors have attracted lots of
interests, and the corresponding theoretical studies suggest that the system
should have six bands. In this paper, we study the multiband effects on the
conductivity based on the exact solutions of one-dimensional two-band Hubbard
model. We find that the orbital degree of freedom might enhance the critical
value $U_c$ of on-site interaction of the transition from a metal to an
insulator. This observation is helpful to understand why undoped High-$T_c$
superconductors are usually insulators, while recently discovered iron-based
superconductors are metal. Our results imply that the orbital degree of freedom
in the latter cases might play an essential role.
