We analyze the sigma meson mass and width together with the pion-pion
scattering parameters in the context of non-local chiral quark models with
wave-function renormalization (WFR). We consider both non-local interactions
based on the frequently used exponential form factor, and on fits to the mass
and renormalization functions obtained in lattice calculations. In the case of
the sigma properties we obtain results which are less dependent on the
parameterization than in the standard local NJL model, and which are in
reasonable agreement with the recently reported empirical values. We also show
that the inclusion of the WFR tend to improve the description of the $\pi-\pi$
scattering parameters, with the lattice inspired parameterization providing the
best overall results. Finally, we analyze the connection of the non-local quark
models discussed here with Chiral Perturbation Theory, and present the model
predictions for the low energy constants relevant for $\pi-\pi$ scattering to
O(4) in the chiral expansion.
