In this paper, we provide a new upper bound for the alpha-domination number.
This result generalises the well-known Caro-Roditty bound for the domination
number of a graph. The same probabilistic construction is used to generalise
another well-known upper bound for the classical domination in graphs. We also
prove similar upper bounds for the alpha-rate domination number, which combines
the concepts of alpha-domination and k-tuple domination.
