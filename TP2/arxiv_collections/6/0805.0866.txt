The objective of this research was to study the influence of electroplating
parameters on electrodeposit characteristics for the production of nickel (Ni)
and nickel-iron (Ni-Fe) microparts by photoelectroforming. The research focused
on the most relevant parameter for industry, which is the current density,
because it determines the process time and the consumed energy. The results of
the Ni and Ni-Fe characterisations can be divided into two aspects closely
linked with each other ; the morphology and the hardness.
