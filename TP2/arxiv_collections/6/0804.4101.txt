We report modifications to the optical properties of fluorophores in the
vicinity of noble metal nanotips. The fluorescence from small clusters of
quantum dots has been imaged using an apertureless scanning near-field optical
microscope. When a sharp gold tip is brought close to the sample surface, a
strong distance-dependent enhancement of the quantum dot fluorescence is
observed, leading to a simultaneous increase in optical resolution. These
results are consistent with simulations of the electric field and fluorescence
enhancement near plasmonic nanostructures. Highly ordered periodic arrays of
silver nanotips have been fabricated by nanosphere lithography. Using
fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy, we have created high resolution
spatial maps of the lifetime components of vicinal fluorophores; these show an
order of magnitude increase in decay rate from a localized volume around the
nanotips, resulting in a commensurate enhancement in the fluorescence emission
intensity. Spatial maps of the Raman scattering signal from molecules on the
nanotips shows an enhancement of more than 5 orders of magnitude.
