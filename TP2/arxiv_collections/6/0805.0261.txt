In these lectures, we present and discuss the most recent results on
inclusive diffraction at the Tevatron collider and give the prospects at the
LHC. We also describe the search for exclusive events at the Tevatron. Of
special interest is the exclusive production of Higgs boson and heavy objects
($W$, top, stop pairs) at the LHC which will require precise measurements and
analyses of inclusive and exclusive diffraction to constrain further the gluon
density in the pomeron. At the end of these lectures, we describe the projects
to install forward detectors at the LHC to fulfil these measurements.
