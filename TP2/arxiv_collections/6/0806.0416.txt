Optical frequency combs generated by multiple four-wave mixing of two
stabilized single-frequency lasers in optical fibers are proposed for use as
high precision frequency markers, calibration of astrophysical spectrometers
and metrology. Use of highly nonlinear and photonic crystal fibers with very
short lengths and small group velocity dispersion, combined with energy and
momentum conservation required by the parametric generation, assures negligible
phase mismatch between comb frequencies. In contrast to combs from mode-locked
lasers or microcavities, the absence of a resonator allows large tuning of the
frequency spacing from tens of gigahertz to beyond teraHertz.
