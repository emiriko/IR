In the first part of this paper, we study the spin-S Kitaev model using spin
wave theory. We discover a remarkable geometry of the minimum energy surface in
the N-spin space. The classical ground states, called Cartesian or CN-ground
states, whose number grows exponentially with the number of spins N, form a set
of points in the N-spin space. These points are connected by a network of flat
valleys in the N-spin space, giving rise to a continuous family of classical
ground states. Further, the CN-ground states have a correspondence with dimer
coverings and with self avoiding walks on a honeycomb lattice. The zero point
energy of our spin wave theory picks out a subset from a continuous family of
classically degenerate states as the quantum ground states; the number of these
states also grows exponentially with N. In the second part, we present some
exact results. For arbitrary spin-S, we show that localized Z_2 flux
excitations are present by constructing plaquette operators with eigenvalues
\pm 1 which commute with the Hamiltonian. This set of commuting plaquette
operators leads to an exact vanishing of the spin-spin correlation functions,
beyond nearest neighbor separation, found earlier for the spin-1/2 model [G.
Baskaran, S. Mandal and R. Shankar, Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 247201 (2007)]. We
introduce a generalized Jordan-Wigner transformation for the case of general
spin-S, and find a complete set of commuting link operators, similar to the
spin-1/2 model, thereby making the Z_2 gauge structure more manifest. The
Jordan-Wigner construction also leads, in a natural fashion, to Majorana
fermion operators for half-integer spin cases and hard-core boson operators for
integer spin cases, strongly suggesting the presence of Majorana fermion and
boson excitations in the respective low energy sectors.
