We evaluate a Gaussian distance-type degree of nonclassicality for a
single-mode Gaussian state of the quantum radiation field by use of the
recently discovered quantum Chernoff bound. The general properties of the
quantum Chernoff overlap and its relation to the Uhlmann fidelity are
interestingly illustrated by our approach.
