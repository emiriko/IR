We consider gauge invariant quark two-point Green's functions in which the
gluonic phase factor follows a skew-polygonal line. Using a particular
representation for the quark propagator in the presence of an external gluon
field, functional relations between Green's functions with different numbers of
segments of the polygonal lines are established. An integral equation is
obtained for the Green's function having a phase factor along a single straight
line. The related kernels involve Wilson loops with skew-polygonal contours and
with functional derivatives along the sides of the contours.
