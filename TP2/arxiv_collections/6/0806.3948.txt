We study mixtures of spinless bosons and not spin-polarized fermions loaded
in two dimensional optical lattices. We approach the problem of the ground
state stability within the framework of the linear response theory; by the mean
of an iterative procedure, we are able to obtain a relation for the dependence
of boson-boson effective interaction on the absolute temperature of the sample.
Proceeding from such a formula, we write down analyitical expressions for
Supersolid (SS) and Phase Separation (PS) transition temperatures, and plot the
phase diagrams.
