Recently, it has been demonstrated that the chemical composition of jets in
heavy ion collisions is significantly altered compared to jets in the vacuum.
This signal can be used to probe the medium formed in nuclear collisions. In
this study we investigate the possibility that fast light quarks and gluons can
convert to heavy quarks when passing through a quark gluon plasma. We study the
rate of light to heavy jet conversions in a consistent Fokker-Planck framework
and investigate their impact on the production of high-$p_T$ charm and bottom
quarks at RHIC and LHC.
