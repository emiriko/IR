We provide a microscopic derivation for the non-Markovian master equation for
an atom-cavity system with cavity losses and show that they can induce
population trapping in the atomic excited state, when the environment outside
the cavity has a non-flat spectrum. Our results apply to hybrid solid state
systems and can turn out to be helpful to find the most appropriate description
of leakage in the recent developments of cavity quantum electrodynamics.
