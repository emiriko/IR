A missing energy discovery is possible at the LHC with the first 100 pb-1 of
understood data. We present a realistic strategy to rapidly narrow the list of
candidate theories at, or close to, the moment of discovery. The strategy is
based on robust ratios of inclusive counts of simple physics objects. We study
specific cases showing discrimination of look-alike models in simulated data
sets that are at least 10 to 100 times smaller than used in previous studies.
We discriminate supersymmetry models from non-supersymmetric look-alikes with
only 100 pb-1 of simulated data, using combinations of observables that trace
back to differences in spin.
