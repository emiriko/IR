We assume a triple geometric structure for the electromagnetic nuclear
interaction. This nuclear electromagnetism is used to calculate the binding
energies of the alpha particle and the A=3 isobar nuclides. The approximation
for the resultant wave equation which lead to the deuteron binding energy from
the modified Mathieu equation for the radial eigenvalue equation also
establishes proton-electron-proton magnetic bonds in these nuclides and
determines their binding energies. Completely theoretical calculations give
28.5 Mev., 7.64 Mev. and 8.42 Mev. for the binding energies of the alpha
particle, the helium 3 isotope and tritium respectively. These values admit
correction factors due to the approximations made.
