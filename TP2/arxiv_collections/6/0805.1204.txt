The excitation energy per residue nucleon (E*/A) and fast and thermal light
particle multiplicities are studied as a function of centrality defined as the
number of grey tracks emitted N_grey and by the mean number of primary
hadron-nucleon scatterings <nu> and mean impact parameter <b> extracted from
it. The value of E*/A and the multiplicities show an increase with centrality
for all systems, 14.6 GeV p-Au and 8.0 GeV pi-Au and pbar-Au collisions, and
the excitation energy per residue nucleon exhibits a uniform dependence on
N_grey.
