Results on $\Lambda$, $\bar{\Lambda}}$, $\Xi^{-}$, and $\bar{\Xi}^{+}$
production in central Pb+Pb reactions at 20A, 30A, 40A, 80A, and 158A GeV are
presented. The energy dependence of transverse mass spectra, rapidity spectra,
and multiplicities is discussed. Comparisons to string hadronic models (UrQMD
and HSD) and statistical hadron gas models are shown. While the latter provide
a reasonable description of all particle yields, the first class of models
fails to match the $\Xi^{-}$, and $\bar{\Xi}^{+}$ multiplicities.
