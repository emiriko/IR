We propose a hierarchical Bayesian model to estimate the proportional
contribution of source populations to a newly founded colony. Samples are
derived from the first generation offspring in the colony, but mating may occur
preferentially among migrants from the same source population. Genotypes of the
newly founded colony and source populations are used to estimate the mixture
proportions, and the mixture proportions are related to environmental and
demographic factors that might affect the colonizing process. We estimate an
assortative mating coefficient, mixture proportions, and regression
relationships between environmental factors and the mixture proportions in a
single hierarchical model. The first-stage likelihood for genotypes in the
newly founded colony is a mixture multinomial distribution reflecting the
colonizing process. The environmental and demographic data are incorporated
into the model through a hierarchical prior structure. A simulation study is
conducted to investigate the performance of the model by using different levels
of population divergence and number of genetic markers included in the
analysis. We use Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation to conduct
inference for the posterior distributions of model parameters. We apply the
model to a data set derived from grey seals in the Orkney Islands, Scotland. We
compare our model with a similar model previously used to analyze these data.
The results from both the simulation and application to real data indicate that
our model provides better estimates for the covariate effects.
