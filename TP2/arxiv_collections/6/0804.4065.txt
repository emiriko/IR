In this note we explain how to obtain cluster algebras from triangulations of
(punctured) discs following the approach of S. Fomin, M. Shapiro and D.
Thurston. Furthermore, we give a description of m-cluster categories via
diagonals (arcs) in (punctured) polygons and of m-cluster categories via powers
of translation quivers as given in joint work with R. Marsh.
