The unique Hamiltonian description of neuro- and psycho-dynamics at the
macroscopic, classical, inter-neuronal level of brain's neural networks, and
microscopic, quantum, intra-neuronal level of brain's microtubules, is
presented in the form of open Liouville equations. This implies the arrow of
time in both neuro- and psycho-dynamic processes and shows the existence of the
formal neuro-biological space-time self-similarity.
