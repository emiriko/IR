A continuous-variable Bell inequality, valid for an arbitrary number of
observers measuring observables with an arbitrary number of outcomes, was
recently introduced in [Cavalcanti \emph{et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 99},
210405 (2007)]. We prove that any $n$-mode quantum state violating this
inequality with quadrature measurements necessarily has a negative partial
transposition. Our results thus establish the first link between nonlocality
and bound entanglement for continuous-variable systems.
