Our recent arXiv preprints have described the experimental evidence for the
universal occurrence of short circuit photocurrents on illumination of solid
state surfaces by strongly absorbed light. A likely mechanism has been proposed
based on the photodesorption of surface ions to the surrounding atmosphere.
Analyses have been made of observed oscilloscope tracings of short circuit
photo voltages in terms of the linear rate theory in fair concomitance. Space
charge effects having been left unaccounted for, we now propose an approach to
them in the diffusion-free approximation.
