The puzzling absence of Pu magnetic moments in a PuAm environment is explored
using the self-consistent Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT) calculations in
combination with the Local Density Approximation. We argue that delta-Pu -Am
alloys provide an ideal test bed for investigating the screening of moments
from the single impurity limit to the dense limit. Several important effects
can be studied: volume expansion, shift of the bare Pu on-site f energy level,
and the reduction of the hybridization cloud resulting from the collective
character of the Kondo effect in the Anderson lattice. These effects compensate
each other and result in a coherence scale, which is independent of alloy
composition, and is around 800K. We emphasize the role of the DMFT
self-consistency condition, and multiplet splittings in Pu and Am atoms, in
order to capture the correct value of the coherence scale in the alloy.
