We present a method to measure dominant Standard Model backgrounds using data
containing high rapidity objects in pp collisions at the Large Hadron Collider.
The method is developed for analyses of early LHC data when robustness against
imperfections of background modeling and detector simulation can be a key to
the discovery of new physics at LHC.
