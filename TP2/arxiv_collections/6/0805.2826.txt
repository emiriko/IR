We study the reduction modulo $l$ of some elliptic representations; for each
of these representations, we give a particular lattice naturally obtained by
parabolic induction in giving the graph of extensions between its irreducible
sub-quotient of its reduction modulo $l$. The principal motivation for this
work, is that these lattices appear in the cohomology of Lubin-Tate towers.
