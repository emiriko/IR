The Hecke group algebra $HW_0$ of a finite Coxeter group $W_0$, as introduced
by the first and last author, is obtained from $W_0$ by gluing appropriately
its 0-Hecke algebra and its group algebra. In this paper, we give an equivalent
alternative construction in the case when $W_0$ is the classical Weyl group
associated to an affine Weyl group $W$. Namely, we prove that, for $q$ not a
root of unity, $HW_0$ is the natural quotient of the affine Hecke algebra
through its level 0 representation. We further show that the level 0
representation is a calibrated principal series representation for a suitable
choice of character, so that the quotient factors (non trivially) through the
principal central specialization. This explains in particular the similarities
between the representation theory of the classical 0-Hecke algebra and that of
the affine Hecke algebra at this specialization.
