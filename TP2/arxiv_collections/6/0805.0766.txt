Sponsored search involves running an auction among advertisers who bid in
order to have their ad shown next to search results for specific keywords.
Currently, the most popular auction for sponsored search is the "Generalized
Second Price" (GSP) auction in which advertisers are assigned to slots in the
decreasing order of their "score," which is defined as the product of their bid
and click-through rate. In the past few years, there has been significant
research on the game-theoretic issues that arise in an advertiser's interaction
with the mechanism as well as possible redesigns of the mechanism, but this
ranking order has remained standard.
  From a search engine's perspective, the fundamental question is: what is the
best assignment of advertisers to slots? Here "best" could mean "maximizing
user satisfaction," "most efficient," "revenue-maximizing," "simplest to
interact with," or a combination of these. To answer this question we need to
understand the behavior of a search engine user when she sees the displayed
ads, since that defines the commodity the advertisers are bidding on, and its
value. Most prior work has assumed that the probability of a user clicking on
an ad is independent of the other ads shown on the page.
  We propose a simple Markovian user model that does not make this assumption.
We then present an algorithm to determine the most efficient assignment under
this model, which turns out to be different than that of GSP. A truthful
auction then follows from an application of the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG)
mechanism. Further, we show that our assignment has many of the desirable
properties of GSP that makes bidding intuitive. At the technical core of our
result are a number of insights about the structure of the optimal assignment.
