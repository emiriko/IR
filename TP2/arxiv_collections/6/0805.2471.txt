The ordering matrix, which was originally introduced by de Gennes, is a
well-known mathematical device for describing orientational order of biaxial
nematic liquid crystal. In this paper we propose a new interpretation of the
ordering matrix. We slightly modify the definition of the ordering matrix and
call it the geometric order parameter. The geometric order parameter is a
linear transformation which transforms a tensorial quantity of an individual
molecule to a tensorial quantity observed at a macroscopic scale. The degree of
order is defined as the singular value of the geometric order parameter. We
introduce the anisotropy diagram, which is useful for classification and
comparison of various tensorial quantities. As indices for evaluating
anisotropies of tensorial quantities, we define the degree of anisotropy and
the degree of biaxiality. We prove that a simple diagrammatic relation holds
between a microscopic tensor and a macroscopic tensor. We provide a
prescription to formulate the Landau-de Gennes free energy of a system whose
constituent molecules have an arbitrary shape. We apply our prescription to a
system which consists of D_{2h}-symmetric molecules.
