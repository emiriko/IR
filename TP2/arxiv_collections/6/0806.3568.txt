We study charged fluid spheres under the 4-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell
space-time. The solutions thus obtained admitting conformal motion. We also
investigate whether the solutions set provide electromagnetic mass models such
that the physical parameters including the gravitational mass arise from the
electromagnetic field alone. In this connection three cases are studied here in
detail with the propositions: (1) $p = - \rho$, (2) $\sigma e^{\lambda/2} =
\sigma_0$ and (3) $8 \pi p - E^2 = p_0$ where $\rho$, $p$, $\sigma$ are
respectively the usual matter density, fluid pressure and charge density of the
spherical distribution. Based on these assumptions several features are
explored which seems physically very interesting.
