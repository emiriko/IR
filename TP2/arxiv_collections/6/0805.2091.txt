We propose pure quantum parton model of soft interactions. The model is based
on soft partons which interact eikonally and locally in a transverse plane. We
directly construct S-matrix operator and partons Fock space using developed
method of discretization of a transverse plane. Counting inelastic states we
explicitly derive AGK cancellations and cutting rules from relation between
inclusive and exclusive parton distributions. We also discuss black disk
behavior from the point of view of our model.
