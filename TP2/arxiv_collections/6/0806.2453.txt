We introduce an alternative thermal diffusive dynamics for the spin-S Ising
ferromagnet realized by means of a random walker. The latter hops across the
sites of the lattice and flips the relevant spins according to a probability
depending on both the local magnetic arrangement and the temperature. The
random walker, intended to model a diffusing excitation, interacts with the
lattice so that it is biased towards those sites where it can achieve an energy
gain. In order to adapt our algorithm to systems made up of arbitrary spins,
some non trivial generalizations are implied. In particular, we will apply the
new dynamics to two-dimensional spin-1/2 and spin-1 systems analyzing their
relaxation and critical behavior. Some interesting differences with respect to
canonical results are found; moreover, by comparing the outcomes from the
examined cases, we will point out their main features, possibly extending the
results to spin-S systems.
