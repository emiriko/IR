We examine the effects of a linearly polarized nonresonant radiative field on
the dynamics of rotationally inelastic $\text{Na}^{+} + \text{N}_2$ collisions
at eV collision energies. Our treatment is based on the Fraunhofer model of
matter wave scattering and its recent extension to collisions in electric
fields [arXiv:0804.3318v1]. The nonresonant radiative field changes the
effective shape of the target molecule by aligning it in the space-fixed frame.
This markedly alters the differential and integral scattering cross sections.
As the cross sections can be evaluated for a polarization of the radiative
field collinear or perpendicular to the relative velocity vector, the model
also offers predictions about steric asymmetry of the collisions.
