We propose an explanation of the LSND signal via quantum-decoherence of the
mass states, which leads to damping of the interference terms in the
oscillation probabilities. The decoherence parameters as well as their energy
dependence are chosen in such a way that the damping affects only oscillations
with the large (atmospheric) $\Delta m^2$ and rapidly decreases with the
neutrino energy. This allows us to reconcile the positive LSND signal with
MiniBooNE and other null-result experiments. The standard explanations of
solar, atmospheric, KamLAND and MINOS data are not affected. No new particles,
and in particular, no sterile neutrinos are needed. The LSND signal is
controlled by the 1-3 mixing angle $\theta_{13}$ and, depending on the degree
of damping, yields $0.0014 < \sin^2\theta_{13} < 0.034$ at $3\sigma$. The
scenario can be tested at upcoming $\theta_{13}$ searches: while the comparison
of near and far detector measurements at reactors should lead to a null-result
a positive signal for $\theta_{13}$ is expected in long-baseline accelerator
experiments. The proposed decoherence may partially explain the results of
Gallium detector calibrations and it can strongly affect supernova neutrino
signals.
