The dynamics of two-component Bose-Einstein condensates in rotating traps is
investigated. In the Thomas-Fermi limit, equations of motion are derived
showing multiple static solutions for a vortex free condensate. Dynamic
stability analysis of these solutions and comparison with Truncated Wigner
simulations enables us to identify the regimes for which vortex states will
occur. In addition, our analysis predicts centre-of-mass oscillations that are
induced by interspecies interactions and affect each component separately. For
attractive interspecies interactions, these oscillations lead to a stable
symmetry broken state.
