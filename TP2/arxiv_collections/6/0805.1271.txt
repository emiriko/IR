An upgraded Beam Emission Spectroscopy (BES) system has been deployed to
access low amplitude turbulence regions near internal transport barriers on the
DIII-D tokamak. Sixteen high sensitivity channels are being installed. A
significant increase in total signal to noise is achieved by: 1.) Increased
spatial volume sampling tailored to known turbulence characteristics; 2.) An
increased throughput spectrometer assembly to isolate the local beam
fluorescence, coupled to new large-area photoconductive photodiodes; 3.) A new
sharp edge interference filter designed to optimize detection of the beam
emission plus a significant fraction of the thermal deuterium charge exchange.
A new data acquisition system has been installed, providing an 8 times increase
in integration time or an increased sample rate. Preliminary results from the
upgraded system show a signal enhancement of greater than an order of
magnitude. A clear broadband density fluctuation signal is observed in H-mode
discharges with the upgraded BES system, demonstrating the significant
performance enhancement.
