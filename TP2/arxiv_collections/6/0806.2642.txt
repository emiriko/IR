Dissipation is ubiquitous in quantum systems, and its interplay with
fluctuations is critical to maintaining quantum coherence. We experimentally
investigate the dissipation dynamics in single-walled carbon nanotubes coupled
to superconductors. The voltage-current characteristics display gate-tunable
hysteresis, with sizes that perfectly correlate with the normal state
resistance RN, indicating the junction undergoes a periodic modulation between
underdamped and overdamped regimes. Surprisingly, when a device's Fermi-level
is tuned through a local conductance minimum, we observe a gate-controlled
transition from superconducting-like to insulating-like states, with a
"critical" R_N value of about 8-20 kohm.
