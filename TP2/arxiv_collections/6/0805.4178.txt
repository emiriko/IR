We present an optimization scheme that employs a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to
determine the properties of low-lying nucleon excitations within a realistic
photo-pion production model based upon an effective Lagrangian. We show that
with this modern optimization technique it is possible to reliably assess the
parameters of the resonances and the associated error bars as well as to
identify weaknesses in the models. To illustrate the problems the optimization
process may encounter, we provide results obtained for the nucleon resonances
$\Delta$(1230) and $\Delta$(1700). The former can be easily isolated and thus
has been studied in depth, while the latter is not as well known
experimentally.
