In this paper we study blow-up phenomena in general coupled nonlinear
Schrodinger equations with different dispersion coefficients. We find
sufficient conditions for blow-up and for the existence of global solutions. We
discuss several applications of our results to heteronuclear multispecies
Bose-Einstein condensates and to degenerate boson-fermion mixtures.
