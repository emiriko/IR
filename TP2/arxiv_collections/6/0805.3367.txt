Neutrinos are the least detectable Standard Model particle. By making use of
this fact, we consider dark matter annihilations and decays in the galactic
halo and show how present and future neutrino detectors could be used to set
general limits on the dark matter annihilation cross section and on the dark
matter lifetime.
