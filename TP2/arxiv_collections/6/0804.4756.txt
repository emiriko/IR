The static three-quark potential and pseudo-potential of a pure SU(3) gauge
theory are studied in a five-dimensional framework known as AdS/QCD. The
results support the Y-ansatz for the baryonic area law. A comparison with the
quark-antiquark calculations shows the universality of the string tension as
well as the spatial string tension. We also discuss extensions to SU(N) gauge
theories.
