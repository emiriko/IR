We derive an alternative representation for the $f$-electron spectral
function of the Falicov-Kimball model from the original one proposed by Brandt
and Urbanek. In the new representation, all calculations are restricted to the
real time axis, allowing us to go to arbitrarily low temperatures. The general
formula for the retarded Green's function involves two determinants of
continuous matrix operators that have the Toeplitz form. By employing the
Wiener-Hopf sum equation approach and Szeg\"o's theorem, we can derive exact
analytic formulas for the large-time limits of the Green's function; we
illustrate this for cases when the logarithm of characteristic function (which
defines the continuous Toeplitz matrix) does and does not wind around the
origin. We show how accurate these asymptotic formulas are to the exact
solutions found from extrapolating matrix calculations to the zero
discretization size limit.
