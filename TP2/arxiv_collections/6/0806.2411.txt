We consider the stability problem for shock layers in Slemrod's model of an
isentropic gas with capillarity. We show that these traveling waves are
monotone in the weak capillarity case, and become highly oscillatory as the
capillarity strength increases. Using a spectral energy estimate we prove that
small-amplitude monotone shocks are spectrally stable. We also show, through
the use of a novel spectral energy estimate, that monotone shocks have no
unstable real spectrum regardless of amplitude; this implies that any
instabilities of these monotone traveling waves, if they exist, must occur
through a Hopf-like bifurcation, where one or more conjugate pairs of
eigenvalues cross the imaginary axis. We then conduct a systematic numerical
Evans function study, which shows that monotone and mildly oscillatory profiles
in an adiabatic gas are spectrally stable for moderate values of shock and
capillarity strengths. In particular, we show that the transition from monotone
to non-monotone profiles does not appear to trigger any instabilities.
