We report on optically induced transport phenomena in freely suspended
channels containing a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG). The submicron
devices are fabricated in AlGaAs/GaAs heterostructures by etching techniques.
The photoresponse of the devices can be understood in terms of the combination
of photogating and a photodoping effect. The hereby enhanced electronic
conductance exhibits a time constant in the range of one to ten milliseconds.
