We study the rotational and vibrational heating of diatomic molecules placed
near a surface at finite temperature on the basis of macroscopic quantum
electrodynamics. The internal molecular evolution is governed by transition
rates that depend on both temperature and position. Analytical and numerical
methods are used to investigate the heating of several relevant molecules near
various surfaces. We determine the critical distances at which the surface
itself becomes the dominant source of heating and we investigate the transition
between the long-range and short-range behaviour of the heating rates. A simple
formula is presented that can be used to estimate the surface-induced heating
rates of other molecules of interest. We also consider how the heating depends
on the thickness and composition of the surface.
