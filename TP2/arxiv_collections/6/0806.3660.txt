Interaction of the superconducting condensate with deformations of the
crystal lattice is formulated assuming the electrostatic potential of Bernoulli
type and the effect of strain on material parameters. In the isotropic
approximation it is shown that within the Ginzburg-Landau theory both
contributions can be recast into the local but non-linear interaction term of
the free energy.
