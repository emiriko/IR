We analyse scaling laws that govern macromolecules of different topology:
polymer chains, homogeneous and miktoarm star polymers in a good solvent
possibly constrained by a porous medium. The latter is modelled by
long-range-correlated disorder with a pair correlation function g(r) that
decays with a power law g(r) r^{-a} at large distances r. We show that this
type of disorder changes the universality class of the system. Within the
frames of the field-theoretical renormalization group approach we obtain the
corresponding new universal critical exponents for systems of homogeneous and
star copolymers and discuss different consequences of the architecture
dependent change of the scaling behaviour.
