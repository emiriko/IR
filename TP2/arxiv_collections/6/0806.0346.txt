The dispersion relation for the electrostatic waves below the electron plasma
frequency in a dense quantum plasma is derived by using the magnetohydrodynamic
model. It is shown that in the classical case the dispersion relation reduces
to the expression obtained for the well-known Trivelpiece-Gould (TG) modes.
Attention is also devoted to the case of solitary waves associated with the
nonlinear TG modes.
