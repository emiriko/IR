This paper presents how to use feedback controller with helicopter dynamics
state space model. A simplified analysis is presented for controller design
using LQR of small scale helicopters for axial and forward flights. Our
approach is simple and gives the basic understanding about how to develop
controller for solving the stability of linear helicopter flight dynamics.
