Spin kinetics in $n$-type InAs quantum wells under intense terahertz laser
fields is investigated by developing fully microscopic kinetic spin Bloch
equations via the Floquet-Markov theory and the nonequilibrium Green's function
approach, with all the relevant scattering, such as the electron-impurity,
electron-phonon, and electron-electron Coulomb scattering explicitly included.
We find that a {\em finite} steady-state terahertz spin polarization induced by
the terahertz laser field, first predicted by Cheng and Wu [Appl. Phys. Lett.
{\bf 86}, 032107 (2005)] in the absence of dissipation, exists even in the
presence of all the scattering. We further discuss the effects of the terahertz
laser fields on the spin relaxation and the steady-state spin polarization. It
is found that the terahertz laser fields can {\em strongly} affect the spin
relaxation via hot-electron effect and the terahertz-field-induced effective
magnetic field in the presence of spin-orbit coupling. The two effects compete
with each other, giving rise to {\em non-monotonic} dependence of the spin
relaxation time as well as the amplitude of the steady state spin polarization
on the terahertz field strength and frequency. The terahertz field dependences
of these quantities are investigated for various impurity densities, lattice
temperatures, and strengths of the spin-orbit coupling. Finally, the importance
of the electron-electron Coulomb scattering on spin kinetics is also addressed.
