Collapse of a Gaussian beam in self-focusing Kerr media arrested by nonlinear
losses may lead to the spontaneous formation of a quasi-stationary nonlinear
unbalanced Bessel beam with finite energy, which can propagate without
significant distortion over tens of diffraction lengths, and without peak
intensity attenuation while the beam power is drastically diminishing.
