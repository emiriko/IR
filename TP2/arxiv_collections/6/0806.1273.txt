The exponential of the triangular matrix whose entries in the diagonal at
distance $n$ from the principal diagonal are all equal to the sum of the
inverse of the divisors of $n$ is the triangular matrix whose entries in the
diagonal at distance $n$ from the principal diagonal are all equal to the
number of partitions of $n$. A similar result is true for any pair of sequences
satisfying a special recurrence.
