We study a nonuniversal contribution to the dephasing rate of conduction
electrons due to local vibrational modes. The inelastic scattering rate is
strongly influenced by multiphonon excitations, exhibiting oscillatory
behaviour. For higher frequencies, it saturates to a finite, coupling dependent
value. In the strong coupling limit, the phonon is almost completely softened,
and the inelastic cross section reaches its maximal value. This represents a
magnetic field insensitive contribution to the dephasing time in mesoscopic
systems, in addition to magnetic impurities.
