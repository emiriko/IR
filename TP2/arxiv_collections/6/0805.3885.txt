The global-state fidelity cannot characterize those quantum phase transitions
(QPTs) induced by continuous level crossing due to its collapse around each
crossing point. In this paper, we take the isotropic Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG)
model and the antiferromagnetic one-dimensional Heisenberg model as examples to
show that the partial-state fidelity can signal such level-crossing QPTs.
Extending to the thermodynamic limit we introduce the partial-state fidelity
susceptibility and study its scaling behavior. The maximum of the partial-state
fidelity susceptibility goes like $N$ for the LMG model and $N^3$ for the
Heisenberg model.
