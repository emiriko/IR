Near-field radiative heat transfer is investigated in composite media
including nanoparticles. By modeling pair interactions only, the effective
thermal conductivity due to near field radiation is calculated based on a
thermal nodes model. We highlight the onset of a Near-Field percolation
occurring much earlier than the mechanical percolation at critical volume
fraction f=0.033. This 15 mechanism drastically increases the thermal
conductivity even at low volume fractions. It also indicates a simple
experimental protocol to prove Near-Field contact.
