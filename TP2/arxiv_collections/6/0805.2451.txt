To propose that black holes do not exist would be the fundamental way to
resolve the contradiction between event horizons and quantum mechanics. In this
paper we shall use the Lorentz and Levi-Civita conservation laws to explain how
an event horizon might not exist, and the reasons for its nonexistence are
presented by using the theory of classical gravity.
