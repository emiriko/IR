We present an inverse method to construct large classes of chaotic invariant
sets together with their exact statistics. The associated dynamical systems are
characterized by a probability distribution and a two-form. While our emphasis
is on classical systems, we briefly speculate about possible applications to
quantum field theory, in the context of generalizations of stochastic
quantization.
