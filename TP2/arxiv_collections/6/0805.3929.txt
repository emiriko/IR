Within the framework of Standard Model, the production mode of Higgs boson
through the fusion of the vector bosons $W$ or $Z$ (Vector Boson Fusion) is one
of the most important production mechanisms, providing a specific detection
signature. A detailed study regarding this issue is being undergone for ATLAS
detector in LHC and some general features of this analysis are being presented
in this note emphasizing in the study of Central Jet Veto.
