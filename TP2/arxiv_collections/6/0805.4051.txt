Differential cross sections for $\gamma p \to K^+\Lambda(1405)$ and $\gamma p
\to K^+\Sigma^0(1385)$ reactions have been measured in the photon energy range
from 1.5 to 2.4 GeV and the angular range of $0.8<\cos(\Theta)<1.0$ for the
$K^+$ scattering angle in the center-of-mass system. This data is the first
measurement of the $\Lambda(1405)$ photoproduction cross section. The
lineshapes of \LamS measured in $\Sigma^+\pi^-$ and $\Sigma^-\pi^+$ decay modes
were different with each other, indicating a strong interference of the isospin
0 and 1 terms of the $\Sigma\pi$ scattering amplitudes. The ratios of \LamS
production to \SigS production were measured in two photon energy ranges: near
the production threshold ($1.5<E_\gamma<2.0$ GeV) and far from it ($2.0
<E_\gamma<2.4$ GeV). The observed ratio decreased in the higher photon energy
region, which may suggest different production mechanisms and internal
structures for these hyperon resonances.
