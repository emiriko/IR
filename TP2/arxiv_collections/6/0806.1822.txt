The critical current of the spin transfer torque-driven magnetization
dynamics was studied by taking into account both spin pumping and the finite
penetration depth of the transverse spin current. We successfully reproduced
the recent experimental results obtained by Chen et al. [Phys. Rev. B {\bf 74},
144408 (2006)] and found that the critical current remains finite even in the
zero-thickness limit of the free layer. We showed that the remaining value of
the critical current is determined mainly by spin pumping.
