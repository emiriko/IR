High-dimensional data models, often with low sample size, abound in many
interdisciplinary studies, genomics and large biological systems being most
noteworthy. The conventional assumption of multinormality or linearity of
regression may not be plausible for such models which are likely to be
statistically complex due to a large number of parameters as well as various
underlying restraints. As such, parametric approaches may not be very
effective. Anything beyond parametrics, albeit, having increased scope and
robustness perspectives, may generally be baffled by the low sample size and
hence unable to give reasonable margins of errors. Kendall's tau statistic is
exploited in this context with emphasis on dimensional rather than sample size
asymptotics. The Chen--Stein theorem has been thoroughly appraised in this
study. Applications of these findings in some microarray data models are
illustrated.
