In this work we present the $J/\psi$ measurement in p+p collisions within the
STAR collaboration Quarkonium program. This measurements aim to be the baseline
measurement of a more comprehensive systematic study of quarkonium states
production in order to understand their in medium modification. Here we report
the total cross section and $p_T$ distribution, and find them to be consistent
with pQCD CEM predictions as well as to previous measurements at the same
center-of-mass energy.
