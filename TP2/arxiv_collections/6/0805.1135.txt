The list of textbook tunneling formulas is extended by deriving exact
expressions for the transmission coefficient in graphene ribbons with armchair
edges and the step-like and barrier-like profiles of site energies along the
ribbon. These expressions are obtained by matching wave functions at the
interfaces between the regions, where quasiparticles have constant but
different potential energies. It is shown that for an $U_0$ high barrier and
low-energy electrons and holes, the mode transmission of charge carriers in
this type of ribbons is described by the textbook formula, where the constant
barrier is replaced by an effective, energy-dependent barrier, $U_0\to U(E)$.
For the lowest/highest electron/hole mode, $U(E)$ goes, respectively, to zero
and nonzero value in metallic and semiconducting ribbons. This and other
peculiarities of through-barrier/step transmission in graphene are discussed
and compared with related earlier results.
