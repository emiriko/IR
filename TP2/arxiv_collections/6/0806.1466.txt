We examine quantum extensions of the continuous Painlev\'e equations,
expressed as systems of first-order differential equations for non-commuting
objects. We focus on the Painlev\'e equations II, IV and V. From their
auto-B\"acklund transformations we derive the contiguity relations which we
interpret as the quantum analogues of the discrete Painlev\'e equations.
