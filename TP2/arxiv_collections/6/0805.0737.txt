ALICE has been specifically optimized to study heavy-ion collisions at the
LHC, up to a charged particle density of 8000 per unit of rapidity in central
heavy-ion collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 5.5 TeV. The High Momentum Particle
Identification Detector (HMPID) has a proximity focusing geometry with a liquid
$\rm C_{6}F_{14}$ Cherenkov radiator coupled to Multi-Wire Pad Chambers (MWPC)
equipped with CsI photocathodes, over a total active area of 11 $\rm m^2$. It
has been designed to identify charged pions and kaons in the range 1 $\leq p
\leq$ 3 \GeV/$c$ and protons in the range 2 $\leq p \leq$ 5 \GeV/$c$. The
as-built detector and all relevant subsystems (gas, liquid $\rm C_{6}F_{14}$,
cooling and control) are described. Installation issues and first commissioning
results are also presented.
