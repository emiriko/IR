We present the interpretation that the recently discovered Z^+(4430) by the
Belle Collaboration can be a radial excitation of the cs-bar state. We give an
explicit cs-bar candidate for this state by calculating the mass value in our
semirelativistic quark potential model and also give a natural interpretation
on the reason why the decay mode Z-> J/\psi \pi^+ has not yet been seen while
Z-> \psi' \pi can be seen.
