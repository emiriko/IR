In this survey article we discuss a framework of noncommutative geometry with
differential graded categories as models for spaces. We outline a construction
of the category of noncommutative spaces and also include a discussion on
noncommutative motives. We propose a motivic measure with values in a motivic
ring. This enables us to introduce certain zeta functions of noncommutative
spaces.
