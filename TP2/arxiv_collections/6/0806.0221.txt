We investigate the transport properties for a Luttinger liquid coupled to two
identical Bose-Einstein condensation reservoirs. Using the approach of equation
of motion for the Green function of the system, we find that the distance
between the two resonant transmission probability peaks of the system is
determined by the bosonic interaction strengths, and the sharpness of these
resonant peaks is mainly determined by the Rabi frequency and phase of the
Bose-Einstein condensation reservoir. These results for the proposed system
involving a Luttinger liquid may build a bridge between the controling
transport properties of cold atom in atom physics and the interacting boson
transport in low-dimensional condensed matter physics.
