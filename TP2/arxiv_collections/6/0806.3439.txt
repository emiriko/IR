Properties of the one-dimensional totally asymmetric simple exclusion process
(TASEP), and their connection with the dynamical scaling of moving interfaces
described by a Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation are investigated. With
periodic boundary conditions, scaling of interface widths (the latter defined
via a discrete occupation-number-to-height mapping), gives the exponents
$\alpha=0.500(5)$, $z=1.52(3)$, $\beta=0.33(1)$. With open boundaries, results
are as follows: (i) in the maximal-current phase, the exponents are the same as
for the periodic case, and in agreement with recent Bethe ansatz results; (ii)
in the low-density phase, curve collapse can be found to a rather good extent,
with $\alpha=0.497(3)$, $z=1.20(5)$, $\beta=0.41(2)$, which is apparently at
variance with the Bethe ansatz prediction $z=0$; (iii) on the coexistence line
between low- and high- density phases, $\alpha=0.99(1)$, $z=2.10(5)$,
$\beta=0.47(2)$, in relatively good agreement with the Bethe ansatz prediction
$z=2$. From a mean-field continuum formulation, a characteristic relaxation
time, related to kinematic-wave propagation and having an effective exponent
$z^\prime=1$, is shown to be the limiting slow process for the low density
phase, which accounts for the above-mentioned discrepancy with Bethe ansatz
results. For TASEP with quenched bond disorder, interface width scaling gives
$\alpha=1.05(5)$, $z=1.7(1)$, $\beta=0.62(7)$. From a direct analytic approach
to steady-state properties of TASEP with quenched disorder, closed-form
expressions for the piecewise shape of averaged density profiles are given, as
well as rather restrictive bounds on currents. All these are substantiated in
numerical simulations.
