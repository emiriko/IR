Two-nucleon momentum distributions are calculated for the ground states of
3He and 4He as a function of the nucleons' relative and total momenta. We use
variational Monte Carlo wave functions derived from a realistic Hamiltonian
with two- and three-nucleon potentials. The momentum distribution of pp pairs
is found to be much smaller than that of pn pairs for values of the relative
momentum in the range (300--500) MeV/c and vanishing total momentum. However,
as the total momentum increases to 400 MeV/c, the ratio of pp to pn pairs in
this relative momentum range grows and approaches the limit 1/2 for 3He and 1/4
for 4He, corresponding to the ratio of pp to pn pairs in these nuclei. This
behavior should be easily observable in two-nucleon knock-out processes, such
as A(e,e'pN).
