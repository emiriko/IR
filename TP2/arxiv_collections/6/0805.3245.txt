N=4 superconformal n-particle quantum mechanics on the real line is governed
by two prepotentials, U and F, which obey a system of partial nonlinear
differential equations generalizing the Witten-Dijkgraaf-Verlinde-Verlinde
(WDVV) equation. For U=0 one remains with the WDVV equation which suggests an
ansatz for F in terms of a set of covectors to be found. One approach
constructs such covectors from suitable polytopes, another method solves
Veselov's \vee-conditions in terms of deformed Coxeter root systems. I relate
the two schemes for the A_n example.
