Existence of gluonic resonances is among the early expectations of QCD.
Today, QCD calculations predict the lightest glueball to be a scalar state with
mass within a range of about 900-1700 MeV but there is no consensus about its
experimental evidence. In a re-analysis of the phase shifts for pi pi
scattering up to 1800 MeV where such states should show up we find the broad
resonance f_0(600)/\sigma contributing to the full mass range and the narrow
f_0(980) and f_0(1500) but no evidence for f_0(1370). Phenomenological
arguments for the broad state to be a glueball are recalled. It is argued that
the large radiative width of f_0(600)/\sigma reported recently is not in
contradiction to this hypothesis but is mainly due to pi pi rescattering. The
small ``direct'' radiative component is consistent with QCD sum rule
predictions for the light glueball.
