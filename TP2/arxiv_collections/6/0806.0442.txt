Conditions are given, sufficient for the distribution of an
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with L\'evy noise to be absolutely continuous or to
possess a smooth density. For the processes with non-degenerate drift
coefficient, these conditions are a necessary ones. A multidimensional analogue
for the non-degeneracy condition on the drift coefficient is introduced.
