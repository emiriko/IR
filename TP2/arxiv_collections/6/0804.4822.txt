Photoinduced phase transitions from insulating to metallic states,
accompanied by structural re-arrangements, have been recently reported in
complex transition-metal oxides. However, the optical control of a purely
electronic phase transition, where the thermodynamic phase is determined by the
distribution of excitations, has remained elusive. Here we report optical
control of the electronic phase in an underdoped Bi2212 crystal through
impulsive photoinjection of quasiparticles (QP) via ultrashort laser pulses,
avoiding significant laser heating. An abrupt transition of the transient
optical electronic response is observed at a critical fluence of Ipump=70
uJ/cm^2. We show that the measured dynamics is consistent with an inhomogenous
first-order superconducting-to-normal state phase transition, triggered by a
sudden shift of the chemical potential.
