We generalize the computation of supersymmetric contributions to the muon
anomalous magnetic moment (g-2)_mu to the NMSSM. In the presence of a light
CP-odd Higgs scalar, these can differ considerably from the MSSM. We discuss
the amount of these contributions in regions of the parameter space of the
general NMSSM compatible with constraints from B physics. In the mSUGRA-like
cNMSSM, constraints from (g-2)_mu prefer regions in parameter space
corresponding to a low SUSY breaking scale.
