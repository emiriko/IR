In the framework of the littlest Higgs model with T-parity (LHT), we study
the production processes of T-even (T_+) and T-odd (T_-) partners of the top
quark at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). We show that the signal events can be
distinguished from the standard-model backgrounds, and that information about
mass and mixing parameters of the top partners can be measured with relatively
good accuracies. With the measurements of these parameters, we show that a
non-trivial test of the LHT can be performed. We also discuss a possibility to
reconstruct the thermal relic density of the lightest T-odd particle A_H using
the LHC results, and show that the scenario where A_H becomes dark matter may
be checked.
