Identified hadron spectra and ratios provide a unique tool to study the bulk
particle production in heavy-ion collisions and explore the QCD phase diagram.
In these proceedings we present the analysis of charged pion, kaon and
(anti)proton distributions from sqrt(s_NN)=200 and 62.4 GeV Cu+Cu collisions,
collected by the STAR experiment. New measurements extend the systematic
studies of bulk properties, addressing the energy and the system size
dependence of freeze-out parameters at RHIC. The available centrality selection
of Cu+Cu data bridge the gap between the smaller d+Au and larger Au+Au systems,
allowing a detailed study of baryon relative to meson and strangeness
production as function of system size.
