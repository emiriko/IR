By way of explaining how a brain works logically, human associative memory is
modeled with logical and memory neurons, corresponding to standard digital
circuits. The resulting cognitive architecture incorporates basic psychological
elements such as short term and long term memory. Novel to the architecture are
memory searches using cues chosen pseudorandomly from short term memory.
Recalls alternated with sensory images, many tens per second, are analyzed
subliminally as an ongoing process, to determine a direction of attention in
short term memory.
