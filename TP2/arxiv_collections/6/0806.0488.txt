We give two new expressions of subresultants, nested subresultant and reduced
nested subresultant, for the recursive polynomial remainder sequence (PRS)
which has been introduced by the author. The reduced nested subresultant
reduces the size of the subresultant matrix drastically compared with the
recursive subresultant proposed by the authors before, hence it is much more
useful for investigation of the recursive PRS. Finally, we discuss usage of the
reduced nested subresultant in approximate algebraic computation, which
motivates the present work.
