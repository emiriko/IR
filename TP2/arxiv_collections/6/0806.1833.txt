We study waves in a chain of dispersively coupled phase oscillators. Two
approaches -- a quasi-continuous approximation and an iterative numerical
solution of the lattice equation -- allow us to characterize different types of
traveling waves: compactons, kovatons, solitary waves with exponential tails as
well as a novel type of semi-compact waves that are compact from one side.
Stability of these waves is studied using numerical simulations of the initial
value problem.
