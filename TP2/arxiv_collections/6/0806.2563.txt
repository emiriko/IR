The DMRG method is applied to integrable models of antiferromagnetic spin
chains for fundamental and higher representations of SU(2), SU(3), and SU(4).
  From the low energy spectrum and the entanglement entropy, we compute the
central charge and the primary field scaling dimensions. These parameters allow
us to identify uniquely the Wess-Zumino-Witten models capturing the low energy
sectors of the models we consider.
