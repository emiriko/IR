Using an RPA approximation, we have calculated the strengths of the singlet
and triplet pairing interactions which arise from the exchange of spin and
orbital fluctuations for a 2-orbital model of the Fe-pnictide superconductors.
When the system is doped with F, the electron pockets become dominant and we
find that the strongest pairing occurs in the singlet d-wave pairing and the
triplet p-wave pairing channels, which compete closely. The pairing structure
in the singlet d-wave channel corresponds to a superposition of near neighbor
intra-orbital singlets with a minus sign phase difference between the $d_{xz}$
and $d_{yz}$ pairs. The leading pairing configuration in the triplet channel
also involves a nearest neighbor intra-orbital pairing. We find that the
strengths of both the singlet and triplet pairing grow, with the singlet
pairing growing faster, as the onsite Coulomb interaction approaches the value
where the S=1 particle-hole susceptibility diverges.
