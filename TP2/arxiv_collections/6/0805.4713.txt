We present the study of Kondo effect in an interacting quantum wire. We
mainly emphasis the effect of strong electronic correlations in the study of
renormalization group flow diagram and the stability analysis of fixed points
for both magnetic and nonmagnetic impurities. We observe that the behavior of
the system is either in the single channel or in the two channel Kondo effect
depending on the initial values of coupling constants and strong correlations.
