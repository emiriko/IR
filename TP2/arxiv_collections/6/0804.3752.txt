A substantial amount of research, as well as media hype, has surrounded RFID
technology and its privacy implications. Currently, researchers and the media
focus on the privacy threats posed by RFID, while consumer groups choose to
boycott products bearing RFID tags. At the same, however, a very similar
technology has quietly become part of our everyday lives: Bluetooth. In this
paper we highlight the fact that Bluetooth is a widespread technology that has
real privacy implications. Furthermore, we explore the applicability of
RFID-based solutions to address these privacy implications.
