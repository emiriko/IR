A correlation between the production and kinematic properties of the
fragments issued of fission and multifragmentation is established in the study
of the reaction 136Xe+hydrogen at 1 GeV per nucleon, measured in inverse
kinematics at the FRagment Separator (GSI, Darmstadt). Such observables are
analysed in a comprehensive study, selected as a function of the decay mode,
and related to the isotopic properties of the fragments in the
intermediate-mass region. Valuable information can be deduced on the
characteristics of the heaviest product in the reaction, which has been
considered a fundamental observable for tagging the thermodynamic properties of
finite nuclear systems.
