We report on our F-statistic search for white-dwarf binary signals in the
Mock LISA Data Challenge 1B (MLDC1B). We focus in particular on the
improvements in our search pipeline since MLDC1, namely refinements in the
search pipeline and the use of a more accurate detector response (rigid
adiabatic approximation). The search method employs a hierarchical
template-grid based exploration of the parameter space, using a coincidence
step to distinguish between primary (``true'') and secondary maxima, followed
by a final (multi-TDI) ``zoom'' stage to provide an accurate parameter
estimation of the final candidates.
