We have proposed a novel numerical method to calculate accurately the
physical quantities of the ground state with the tensor-network wave function
in two dimensions. We determine the tensor network wavefunction by a projection
approach which applies iteratively the Trotter-Suzuki decomposition of the
projection operator and the singular value decomposition of matrix. The norm of
the wavefunction and the expectation value of a physical observable are
evaluated by a coarse grain renormalization group approach. Our method allows a
tensor-network wavefunction with a high bond degree of freedom (such as D=8) to
be handled accurately and efficiently in the thermodynamic limit. For the
Heisenberg model on a honeycomb lattice, our results for the ground state
energy and the staggered magnetization agree well with those obtained by the
quantum Monte Carlo and other approaches.
