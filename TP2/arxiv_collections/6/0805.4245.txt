We reconsider the Affleck-Dine mechanism for baryogenesis and show that the
baryonic isocurvature fluctuations are generated in many inflation models in
supergravity. The inflationary scale and the reheating temperature must satisfy
certain constraints to avoid too large baryonic isocurvature fluctuations.
