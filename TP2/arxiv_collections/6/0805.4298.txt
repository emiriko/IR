The first realization of a polariton condensate was recently achieved in a
CdTe microcavity [Kasprzak et al., Nature 443, 409 (2006)]. We compare the
experimental phase boundaries, for various detunings and cryostat temperatures,
with those found theoretically from a model which accounts for features of
microcavity polaritons such as reduced dimensionality, internal composite
structure, disorder in the quantum wells, polariton-polariton interactions, and
finite lifetime.
