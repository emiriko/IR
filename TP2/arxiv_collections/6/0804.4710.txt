A set of ballpark parameters for laser, plasma, and accelerator technologies
that define for electron energies reaching as high as TeV are identified. These
ballpark parameters are carved out from the fundamental scaling laws that
govern laser acceleration, theoretically suggested and experimentally explored
over a wide range in the recent years. In the density regime on the order of
10^{16} cm^{-3}, the appropriate laser technology, we find, matches well with
that of a highly efficient high fluence LD driven Yb ceramic laser. Further,
the collective acceleration technique applies to compactify the beam stoppage
stage by adopting the beam-plasma wave deceleration, which contributes to
significantly enhance the stopping power and energy recovery capability of the
beam. Thus we find the confluence of the needed laser acceleration parameters
dictated by these scaling laws and the emerging laser technology. This may
herald a new technology in the ultrahigh energy frontier.
