Two different quantum processes are considered in a perturbed vacuum cavity:
time refraction and dynamical Casimir effect. They are shown to be physically
equivalent, and are predicted to be unstable, leading to an exponential growth
in the number of photons created in the cavity. The concept of an effective
Unruh acceleration for these processes is also introduced, in order to make a
comparison in terms of radiation efficiency, with the Unruh radiation
associated with an accelerated frame in unbounded vacuum.
