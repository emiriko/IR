Electrostatic transducers for vibration energy scavenging have been an object
to numerous studies, but are still facing major issues relating to their
conditioning circuit. One of the most popular ones uses a charge pump and a
flyback circuit based on a Buck DC-DC converter (Fig. 1). A commutation between
the energy accumulation in the charge pump and the recharge of the buffer
capacitor Cres is assured by a switch which is the major bottleneck in the
energy harvester circuit. The commutation timing of the switch determines the
efficiency of the energy harvesting. In previous papers [1] the switch
commutates periodically with some fixed duty ratio. However, this solution is
not appropriate when the environment parameters, e.g. the vibration frequency,
change. We found that the switching should be ordered by the internal state of
the circuit, an not by some fixed timing scenario. We presents how to find the
optimal operation mode of the harvester. To validate the study, the system was
modeled using a mixed VHDL-AMS - ELDO model.
