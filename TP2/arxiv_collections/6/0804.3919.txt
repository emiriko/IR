We present experimental and theoretical studies of the magnetoresistance
oscillations induced by resonance transitions of electrons between
tunnel-coupled states in double quantum wells. The suppression of these
oscillations with increasing temperature is irrelevant to the thermal
broadening of the Fermi distribution and reflects the temperature dependence of
the quantum lifetime of electrons. The gate control of the period and amplitude
of the oscillations is demonstrated.
