Au(111) or similar noble metal surfaces feature Tamm-Shockley surface states
that are known to possess considerable spin-orbit splitting of the Rashba type
of order $\Delta=0.1$ eV. When interacting with an electromagnetic field such
states are expected to have resonances when the frequency of the field is near
the energy of the spin-orbit splitting $\Delta$. These resonances originate in
the intersubband transitions between spin-split subbands. Such resonances can
be observed in the frequency dependence of the surface impedance. Plasmons in
thin metal films are gapless and can be strongly affected by these spin
resonances, acquiring significant modification of the spectrum when it
intersects the $\omega=\Delta$ line. Finally, an interesting demonstration of
the intersubband resonances can be obtained when metal films are coated with
ionic dielectrics that have a frequency of longitudinal/transverse optical
phonons above/below $\Delta$. The dielectric function between the two optical
phonon frequencies is negative which forbids propagation of conventional
plasmon-polaritons. However, the presence of spin-orbit-split surface states
allows plasmon-polaritons to exist in this otherwise forbidden range of
frequencies.
