We present a method which delivers a continuous, high-density beam of slow
and internally cold polar molecules. In our source, warm molecules are first
cooled by collisions with a cryogenic helium buffer gas. Cold molecules are
then extracted by means of an electrostatic quadrupole guide. For ND$_3$ the
source produces fluxes up to $(7 \pm ^{7}_{4}) \times 10^{10}$ molecules/s with
peak densities up to $(1.0 \pm ^{1.0}_{0.6}) \times 10^9$ molecules/cm$^3$. For
H$_2$CO the population of rovibrational states is monitored by depletion
spectroscopy, resulting in single-state populations up to $(82 \pm 10)%$.
