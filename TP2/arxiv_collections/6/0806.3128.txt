Using an external electric field, one can modulate the bandgap of Bernal
stacked bilayer graphene by breaking A-~B symmetry. We analyze strain effects
on the bilayer graphene using the extended Huckel theory and find that reduced
interlayer distance results in higher bandgap modulation, as expected.
Furthermore, above about 2.5 angstrom interlayer distance, the bandgap is
direct, follows a convex relation to electric field and saturates to a value
determined by the interlayer distance. However, below about 2.5 angstrom, the
bandgap is indirect, the trend becomes concave and a threshold electric field
is observed, which also depends on the stacking distance.
