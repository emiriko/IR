We study a single channel one dimensional Kondo Model where the impurity spin
is replaced by an su(n) spin. Using Abelian bosonization and canonical
transformation we explicitly show that this system has an exactly solvable
point. The calculation also shows that there are $n$ collective excitation
modes in the system, one charged and $n-1$ neutral spin excitation modes.
