We demonstrate that a monolayer graphene membrane is impermeable to standard
gases including helium. By applying a pressure difference across the membrane,
we measure both the elastic constants and the mass of a single layer of
graphene. This pressurized graphene membrane is the world's thinnest balloon
and provides a unique separation barrier between 2 distinct regions that is
only one atom thick.
