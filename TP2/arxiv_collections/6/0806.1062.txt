The capacity of a time-varying block-memoryless channel in which the
transmitter and the receiver have access to (possibly different) noisy causal
channel side information (CSI) is obtained. It is shown that the capacity
formula obtained in this correspondence reduces to the capacity formula
reported in \cite{Gold07} for the special case where the transmitter CSI is a
deterministic function of the receiver CSI.
