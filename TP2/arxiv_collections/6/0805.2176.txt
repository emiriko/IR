This document provides a proof that the solutions to the convectively
filtered Burgers equation, will converge to the entropy solution of the
inviscid Burgers equation when certain restrictions are put on the initial
conditions. It does so by first establishing convergence to a weak solution of
the inviscid Burgers equation and then showing that the weak solution is the
entropy solution. Then the results are extended to encompass more general
initial conditions.
