We study the constraints on the dark energy model with constant equation of
state parameter $w=p/\rho$ and the holographic dark energy model by using the
weak gravity conjecture. The combination of weak gravity conjecture and the
observational data gives $w<-0.7$ at the $3\sigma$ confidence level. The
holographic dark energy model realized by a scalar field is in swampland.
