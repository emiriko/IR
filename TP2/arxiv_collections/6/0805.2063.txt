We present a construction of a certain infinite complete partial order (CPO)
that differs from the standard construction used in Scott's denotational
semantics. In addition, we construct several other infinite CPO's. For some of
those, we apply the usual Fixed Point Theorem (FPT) to yield a fixed point for
every continuous function $\mu:2\to 2$ (where 2 denotes the set $\{0,1\}$),
while for the other CPO's we cannot invoke that theorem to yield such fixed
points. Every element of each of these CPO's is a binary string in the
monotypic form and we show that invalidation of the applicability of the FPT to
the CPO that Scott's constructed yields the concept of replication.
