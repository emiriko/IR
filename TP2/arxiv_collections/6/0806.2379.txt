Superconductivity with Tc of 45 K was realized in the tetragonal
ZrCuSiAs-type PrOxFeAs (x=0.75) under heat treatment of 1300 oC and pressure of
6 GPa for 2 hours. Although the sample prepared at 900 oC in vaccum possessed
the same phase as that treated in pressure, the electrical transport
measurement showed the similar behavior with its parent ReOFeAs (Re: rare-earth
metal). This pressure-induced superconductivity could give us a hint to
understand the origins of the newly-found iron based superconductors.
