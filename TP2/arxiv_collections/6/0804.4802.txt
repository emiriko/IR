This is an English translation of Euler's article "Principia motus fluidorum"
in which the Euler equation (in two three dimensions) has been established for
the first time in 1752. The actual publication has been delayed by nine years.
Finally, this article has been published in 1761 in Novi Commentarii Academiae
Scientiarum Petropolitanae.
