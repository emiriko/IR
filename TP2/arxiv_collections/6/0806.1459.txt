We synthesized the samples $Ba_{1-x}M_xFe_2As_2$ (M=La and K) with
$ThCr_2Si_2$-type structure. These samples were systematically characterized by
resistivity, thermoelectic power (TEP) and Hall coefficient ($R_H$).
$BaFe_2As_2$ shows an anomaly in resistivity at about 140 K. Substitution of La
for Ba leads to a shift of the anomaly to low temperature, but no
superconducting transition is observed. Potassium doping leads to suppression
of the anomaly in resistivity and induces superconductivity at 38 K as reported
by Rotter et al.\cite{rotter}. The Hall coefficient and TEP measurements
indicate that the TEP is negative for $BaFe_2As_2$ and La-doped $BaFe_2As_2$,
indicating n-type carrier; while potassium doping leads to change of the sign
in $R_H$ and TEP. It definitely indicates p-type carrier in superconducting
$Ba_{1-x}K_xFe_2As_2$ with double FeAs layers, being in contrast to the case of
$LnO_{1-x}F_xFeAs$ with single FeAs layer. A similar superconductivity is also
observed in the sample with nominal composition $Ba_{1-x}K_xOFe_2As_2$.
