Absolute total cross sections for np and pp scattering below 1000 MeV are
determined based on partial-wave analyses of NN scattering data. These cross
sections are compared with most recent ENDF/B and JENDL data files, and the
Nijmegen partial-wave analysis. Systematic deviations from the ENDF/B and JENDL
evaluations are found to exist in the low-energy region.
