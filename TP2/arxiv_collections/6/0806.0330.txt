We calculate flavour dependent lepton asymmetries within the $E_6$ inspired
Supersymmetric Standard Model ($\rm E_6SSM$), which has an extra $U(1)_N$
symmetry. In this model, the right-handed neutrino doesn't participate in gauge
interactions, allowing it to be used for both the see--saw mechanism and
leptogenesis. Extra Higgs, leptons and leptoquarks predicted by the E$_6$SSM
contribute to the ordinary lepton CP asymmetries induced by the decays of the
lightest right--handed neutrino (and sneutrino) and give rise to a set of extra
decay asymmetries. We find that the CP asymmetries can be relatively large,
even when the lightest right--handed neutrino is as light as $10^6 {GeV}$.
