The astrophysical S-factor for $^{16}$O + $^{16}$O is investigated within the
adiabatic molecular picture. It very well explains the available experimental
data. The collective radial mass causes a pronounced resonant structure in the
S-factor excitation function, providing a motivation for measuring the $^{16}$O
+ $^{16}$O fusion cross section at deep sub-barrier energies.
