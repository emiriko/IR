We update our previous results by increasing the luminosity, the efficiency,
and for the Ds+ the number of tags. We determine f{D+}=(205.8 +/- 8.5 +/- 2.5)
MeV, and an interim preliminary value of f{Ds+}=(267.9 +/- 8.2 +/- 3.9) MeV,
where both results are radiatively corrected. We agree with the recent most
precise unquenched Lattice-QCD calculation for the D+, but are in disagreement
for the Ds+. Several consequences are discussed, including the possibility of
physics beyond the Standard Model.
