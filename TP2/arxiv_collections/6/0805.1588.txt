Pair distribution function for delocalized quarks in the strongly coupled
quark gluon plasma (sQGP) as well as in the states at intermediate stages of
crossover from hadronic matter to sQGP are calculated using a molecule-like
aggregation model. The shapes of the obtained pair distribution functions
exhibit the character of liquid. The increasing correlation length in the
process of crossover indicates a diminishing viscosity of the fluid system.
