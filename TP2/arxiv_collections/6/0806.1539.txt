The operations of data set, such as intersection, union and complement, are
the fundamental calculation in mathematics. It's very significant that
designing fast algorithm for set operation. In this paper, the quantum
algorithm for intersection is presented. And its running time is
sqrt(|A|*|B|*|C|) for set operation C = A intersection B, while classical
computation needs O (|A| *|B|) steps of computation in general, where |.|
denotes the size of set. The presented algorithm is the combination of Grover's
algorithm, classical memory and classical iterative computation, and the
combination method decrease the complexity of designing quantum algorithm.The
method can be used to design other set operations also. Keywords: Set
