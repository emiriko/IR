Surface states of d_{x^2-y^2}-wave superconductors are studied using the
Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory. For a [110] surface it has been known that the
time-reversal symmetry (T) breaking surface state, (d+-is)-wave state, can
occur if the bare transition temperature of the s-wave order parameter (OP) is
positive. We show that even if this bare T_c is negative, it is possible to
break T because the coupling to the spontaneously generated magnetic field may
induce the s-wave OP. The T-breaking state is favored when the GL parameter
(kappa) is small.
