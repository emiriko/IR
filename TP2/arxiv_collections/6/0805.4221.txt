We present a computational study of a visualization method for invariant sets
based on ergodic partition theory, first proposed in [1,2]. The algorithms for
computation of the time averages of observables on phase space are developed
and used to provide an approximation of the ergodic partition of the phase
space. We term the graphical representation of this approximation - based on
time averages of observables - a Mesochronic Plot (from Greek: \textit{meso} -
mean, \textit{chronos} - time}. The method is useful for identifying
low-dimensional projections (e.g. two-dimensional slices) of invariant
structures in phase spaces of dimensionality bigger than two. We also introduce
the concept of the ergodic quotient space, obtained by assigning a point to
every ergodic set, and provide an embedding method whose graphical
representation we call the Mesochronic Scatter Plot (MSP). We use the Chirikov
standard map as a well-known and dynamically rich example in order to
illustrate the implementation of our methods. In addition, we expose
applications to other higher dimensional maps such as the Fro\'eschle map for
which we utilize our methods to analyze merging of resonances and, the
three-dimensional Extended standard map for which we study the conjecture on
its ergodicity [3]. We extend the study in our next paper [4] by investigating
the visualization of periodic sets using harmonic time averages. Both of these
methods are related to eigenspace structure of the Koopman operator.
