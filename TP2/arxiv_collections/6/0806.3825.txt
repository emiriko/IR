Using the coupled cluster method for high orders of approximation and
complementary exact diagonalization studies we investigate the ground state
properties of the spin-1/2 $J_1$--$J_2$ frustrated Heisenberg antiferromagnet
on the square lattice. We have calculated the ground-state energy, the magnetic
order parameter, the spin stiffness, and several generalized susceptibilities
to probe magnetically disordered quantum valence-bond phases. We have found
that the quantum critical points for both the N\'eel and collinear orders are
  $J_2^{c1}\approx (0.44 \pm 0.01)J_1$ and $J_2^{c2}\approx (0.59 \pm 0.01)J_1$
respectively, which are in good agreement with the results obtained by other
approximations. In contrast to the recent study by [Sirker et al. Phys. Rev. B
{\bf 73}, 184420 (2006)], our data do not provide evidence for the transition
from the N\'{e}el to the valence-bond solid state to be first order. Moreover,
our results are in favor of the deconfinement scenario for that phase
transition. We also discuss the nature of the magnetically disordered quantum
phase.
