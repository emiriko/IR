This paper presents the scientific body of knowledge behind the Human
Biodynamics Engine (HBE), a human motion simulator developed on the concept of
Euclidean motion group SE(3), with 270 active degrees of freedom,
force-velocity-time muscular mechanics and two-level neural control -
formulated in the fashion of nonlinear humanoid robotics. The following aspects
of the HBE development are described: geometrical, dynamical, control,
physiological, AI, behavioral and complexity, together with several simulation
examples.
