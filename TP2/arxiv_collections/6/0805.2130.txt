We consider population-imbalanced two-component Fermi gases under external
harmonic confinement interacting through short-range two-body potentials with
diverging s-wave scattering length. Using the fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo
method, the energies of the "normal state" are determined as functions of the
population-imbalance and the number of particles. The energies of the trapped
system follow, to a good approximation, a universal curve even for fairly small
systems. A simple parameterization of the universal curve is presented and
related to the equation of state of the bulk system.
