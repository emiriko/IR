We investigate the gravitational collapse of a spherically symmetric,
inhomogeneous star, which is described by a perfect fluid with heat flow and
satisfies the equation of state $p=\rho/3$ or $p=C\rho^\ga$ at its center.
Different from the ordinary process of gravitational collapsing, the energy of
the whole star is emitted into space. And the remaining spacetime is a
Minkowski one at the end of the process.
