The quantum grassmannian is known to be a graded quantum algebra with a
straightening law when the poset of generating quantum minors is endowed with
the standard partial ordering. In this paper it is shown that this result
remains true when the ordering is subjected to cyclic shifts. The method
involves proving that noncommutative dehomogenisation is possible at any
consecutive quantum minor.
