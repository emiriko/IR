The cluster analysis methods are used in order to perform a comparative study
of 15 EU countries in relation with the fluctuations of some basic
macroeconomic indicators. The statistical distances between countries are
calculated for various moving time windows, and the time variation of the mean
statistical distance is investigated. The decreasing of the mean statistical
distance between EU countries is reflected in the correlated fluctuations of
the basic ME indicators: GDP, GDP/capita, Consumption and Investments. This
empirical evidence can be seen as an economic aspect of globalization. The
Moving Average Minimal Length Path (MAMLP) algorithm allows to search for a
cluster-like structures derived both from the hierarchical organization of
countries and from their relative movement inside the hierarchy. It is found
that the strongly correlated countries with respect to GDP fluctuations can be
partitioned into stable clusters. Some of the highly correlated countries, with
respect to GDP fluctuations, display strong correlations also in the Final
Consumption Expenditure, while others are strongly correlated in Gross Capital
Formation. On the other hand, one notices the similitude of the classifications
regarding GDP and Net Exports fluctuations as concerns the squared sum of the
correlation coefficients (so called country sensitivity). The final structure
proves to be robust against the constant size time window moving over the
scanned time interval. The policy implications of the above empirical results
concern the economic clusters arising in the presence of Marshallian
externalities and the relationships between trade barriers, R&D incentives and
growth that must be accounted in elaborating a cluster-promotion policy.
