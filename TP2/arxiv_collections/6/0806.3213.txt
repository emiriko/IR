We report on the implementation of the Wannier Functions (WFs) formalism
within the full-potential linearized augmented plane wave method (FLAPW),
suitable for bulk, film and one-dimensional geometries. The details of the
implementation, as well as results for the metallic SrVO3, ferroelectric BaTiO3
grown on SrTiO3, covalently bonded graphene and a one-dimensional Pt-chain are
given. We discuss the effect of spin-orbit coupling on the Wannier Functions
for the cases of SrVO3 and platinum. The dependency of the WFs on the choice of
the localized trial orbitals as well as the difference between the maximally
localized and "first-guess" WFs are discussed. Our results on SrVO3 and BaTiO3,
e.g. the ferroelectric polarization of BaTiO3, are compared to results
published elsewhere and found to be in excellent agreement.
