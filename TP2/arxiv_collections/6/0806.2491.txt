Motivated by the telescoping proofs of two identities of Andrews and Warnaar,
we find that infinite q-shifted factorials can be incorporated into the
implementation of the q-Zeilberger algorithm in the approach of Chen, Hou and
Mu to prove nonterminating basic hypergeometric series identities. This
observation enables us to extend the q-WZ method to identities on infinite
series. As examples, we will give the q-WZ pairs for some classical identities
such as the q-Gauss sum, the $_6\phi_5$ sum, Ramanujan's $_1\psi_1$ sum and
Bailey's $_6\psi_6$ sum.
