The topic of interface effects in wave propagation has attracted great
attention due to their theoretical significance and practical importance. In
this paper we study nonlinear oscillatory systems consisting of two media
separated by an interface, and find a novel phenomenon: interface can select a
type of waves (ISWs). Under certain well defined parameter condition, these
waves propagate in two different media with same frequency and same wave
number; the interface of two media is transparent to these waves. The frequency
and wave number of these interface-selected waves (ISWs) are predicted
explicitly. Varying parameters from this parameter set, the wave numbers of two
domains become different, and the difference increases from zero continuously
as the distance between the given parameters and this parameter set increases
from zero. It is found that ISWs can play crucial roles in practical problems
of wave competitions, e.g., ISWs can suppress spirals and antispirals.
