The notion of a classical particle is inferred from Dirac quantum fields on a
curved space-time, by an eikonal approximation and a localization hypothesis
for amplitudes. This procedure allows to define a semi-classical version of the
spin-tensor from internal quantum degrees of freedom, which has a
Papapetrou-like coupling with the curvature.
