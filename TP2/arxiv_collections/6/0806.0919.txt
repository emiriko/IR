We begin with a short presentation of the basic concepts related to Lie
groupoids and Lie algebroids, but the main part of this paper deals with Lie
algebroids. A Lie algebroid over a manifold is a vector bundle over that
manifold whose properties are very similar to those of a tangent bundle. Its
dual bundle has properties very similar to those of a cotangent bundle: in the
graded algebra of sections of its external powers, one can define an operator
similar to the exterior derivative. We present the theory of Lie derivatives,
Schouten-Nijenhuis brackets and exterior derivatives in the general setting of
a Lie algebroid, its dual bundle and their exterior powers. All the results
(which, for their most part, are already known) are given with detailed proofs.
In the final sections, the results are applied to Poisson manifolds, whose
links with Lie algebroids are very close.
