The spin polarized charge transport is systematically analyzed as a thermally
driven stochastic process. The approach is based on Kramers' equation
describing the semiclassical motion under the inclusion of stochastic and
damping forces. Due to the relativistic spin-orbit coupling the damping
experiences a relativistic correction leading to an additional contribution
within the spin Hall conductivity. A further contribution to the conductivity
is originated from the averaged underlying crystal potential, the mean value of
which depends significantly on the electric field. We derive an exact
expression for the electrical conductivity. All corrections are estimated in
lowest order of a relativistic approach and in the linear response regime.
