We numerically investigate the intriguing effects produced by random
percolative disorder in two-dimensional Josephson-junction arrays. By dynamic
scaling analysis, we evaluate critical temperatures and critical exponents with
high accuracy. It is observed that, with the introduction of site-diluted
disorder, the Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition is eliminated and evolves
into a continuous transition with power-law divergent correlation length.
Moreover, genuine depinning transition and creep motion are studied, evidence
for distinct creep motion types is provided. Our results not only are in good
agreement with the recent experimental findings, but also shed some light on
the relevant phase transitions.
