We report high-pressure x-ray diffraction and magnetization measurements
combined with ab-initio calculations to demonstrate that the high-pressure
optical and transport transitions recently reported in TiOCl, correspond in
fact to an enhanced Ti3+-Ti3+ dimerization existing already at room
temperature. Our results confirm the formation of a metal-metal bond between
Ti3+ ions along the b-axis of TiOCl, accompanied by a strong reduction of the
electronic gap. The evolution of the dimerization with pressure suggests a
crossover from the spin-Peierls to a conventional Peierls situation at high
pressures.
