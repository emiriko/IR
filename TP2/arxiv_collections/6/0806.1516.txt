Higgs boson decays in flexible brane world models with stable, massive
gravi-vectors are considered. Such vectors couple bilinearly to the Standard
Model fields through either the Standard Model energy-momentum tensor, the weak
hypercharge field strength or the Higgs scalar. The role of the coupling
involving the extrinsic curvature is highlighted. It is found that within the
presently allowed parameter space, the decay rate of the Higgs into two
gravi-vectors (which would appear as an invisible Higgs decay) can be
comparable to the rate for any of the Standard Model decay modes.
