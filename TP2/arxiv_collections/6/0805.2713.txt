The paper tackles the problem of deriving a topological structure among stock
prices from high frequency historical values. Similar studies using low
frequency data have already provided valuable insights. However, in those cases
data need to be collected for a longer period and then they have to be
detrended. An effective technique based on averaging a metric function on short
subperiods of the observation horizon is suggested. Since a standard
correlation-based metric is not capable of catching dependencies at different
time instants, it is not expected to perform the best when dealing with high
frequency data. Hence, the choice of a more suitable metric is discussed. In
particular, a coherence-based metric is proposed, for it is able to detect any
possible linear relation between two times series, even at different time
instants. The averaging technique is employed to analyze a set of 100 high
volume stocks of the New York Stock Exchange, observed during March 2008.
