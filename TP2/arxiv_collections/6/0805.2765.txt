In a companion paper (hereafter referred to as Paper I), we have presented an
attempt to derive the finite-dimensional abstract quantum formalism within the
framework of information geometry. In this paper, we formulate a correspondence
principle, the Average-Value Correspondence Principle, that allows relations
between measurement results which are known to hold in a classical model of a
system to be systematically taken over into the quantum model of the system.
Using this principle, we derive the explicit form of the temporal evolution
operator (thereby completing the derivation of the abstract quantum formalism
begun in Paper I), and derive many of the correspondence rules (such as
operator rules, commutation relations, and Dirac's Poisson bracket rule) that
are needed to apply the abstract quantum formalism to model particular physical
systems.
