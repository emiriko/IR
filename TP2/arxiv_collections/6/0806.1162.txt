The BRAHMS measurement of proton-to-pion ratios in Au+Au and p+p collisions
at 62.4 and 200 GeV is presented as a function of transverse momentum and
collision centrality within the pseudorapidity range 0 < eta < 3.2. The p/pi
ratio measured for Au+Au system at 62.4 GeV, eta = 3.2 reaches astounding value
of 8-10 at pT >= 1.5 GeV/c. For these energy and pseudorapidity interval no
centrality dependency of p/pi ratio is observed. The baryon-to-meson ratio of
nucleus-nucleus data are consistent with results obtained for p+p interactions.
