We study resonant leptogenesis at the electroweak phase transition in the
singlet Majoron model with right-handed neutrinos. We consider a scenario,
where the SM gauge group and the lepton number break down spontaneously during
a second-order electroweak phase transition. We calculate the flavour- and
temperature-dependent leptonic asymmetries, by including the novel
contributions from the transverse polarisations of the W+/- and Z bosons. The
required resummation of the gauge-dependent off-shell heavy-neutrino
self-energies is consistently treated within the gauge-invariant framework of
the Pinch Technique. Taking into consideration the freeze-out dynamics of
sphalerons, we delineate the parameter space of the model that is compatible
with successful electroweak resonant leptogenesis. The phenomenological and
astrophysical implications of the model are discussed.
