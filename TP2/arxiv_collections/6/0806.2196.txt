Quantum Eletrodynamics (QED) is considered as the most successful of all
physical theories. It can predict numerical values of physical quantities to a
spectacular degree of accuracy. However, from the very early days it has been
known that, in QED, there are two important problems which are linked with the
very foundation of the theory. In 1952, Dyson put forward strong argumnts to
suggest that the perturbation seires in quantum electrodynamics can not be
convergent. Just three years latter, in 1955, Landau argued that the effective
running coupling constant in QED has a pole (Landau singularity) albeit at some
very high energy scale. This paper addresses, in details, the question of
stability of perturbative vacuum state of QED in the light of these two well
known problems.
  Landau has been a cult-like figure for many of us who studied theoretical
physics in the former Soviet Union. As an undergraduate student in the
department of theoretical physics of People's Friendship University, Moscow, in
1970's, I grew up hearing colourful stories about the legendary persona of Lev
Davidovich from my teachers some of whom had known him at personal level. It is
a great honour for me to contribute this article to the Landau centenary volume
of "Eletronics Journal of Theoretical Physics".
