Spin dynamics of a single electron and an exciton confined in CdTe/ZnTe
quantum dot is investigated by polarization-resolved correlation spectroscopy.
Spin memory effects extending over at least a few tens of nanoseconds have been
directly observed in magnetic field and described quantitatively in terms of a
simple rate equation model. We demonstrate an effective (68%) all-optical
read-out of the single carrier spin state through probing the degree of
circular polarization of exciton emission after capture of an oppositely
charged carrier. The perturbation introduced by the pulsed optical excitation
serving to study the spin dynamics has been found to be the main source of the
polarization loss in the read-out process. In the limit of low laser power the
read-out efficiency extrapolates to a value close to 100%. The measurements
allowed us as well to determine neutral exciton spin relaxation time ranging
from 3.4 +/- 0.1 ns at B = 0 T to 16 +/- 3 ns at B = 5 T.
