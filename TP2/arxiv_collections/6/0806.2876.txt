We have grown single crystals of EuFe2As2 and investigated its electrical
transport and thermodynamic properties. Electrical resistivity and specific
heat measurements clearly establish the intrinsic nature of magnetic phase
transitions at 20 K and 195 K. While the high temperature phase transition is
associated with the itinerant moment of Fe, the low temperature phase
transition is due to magnetic order of localized Eu-moments. Band structure
calculations point out a very close similarity of the electronic structure with
SrFe2As2. Magnetically, the Eu and Fe2As2 sublattice are nearly de-coupled.
