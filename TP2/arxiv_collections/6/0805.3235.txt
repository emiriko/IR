We have discussed the classical failure of the fuse system, the dielectric
breakdown and the quantum breakdown in the Anderson insulators. We have
discussed how the extreme value statistics and the resulting Gumbel
distribution arises in breakdown and failure processes, especially when the
disorder concentration is low. At high concentration of disorder near the
percolation threshold, we have discussed how the cross-over might take place
from extreme value to percolation statistics. We have discussed the system size
dependence that arises at the distribution of the failure current at low
disordered regime. Finally, the extension of Zener breakdown phenomenon for
band insulators to the disordered-induced Anderson insulators has been
discussed.
