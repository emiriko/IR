Relying solely on unitarity and the consistency with large-distance black
hole physics, we derive model-independent properties of the microscopic black
holes and of short-distance gravity in theories with N particle species. In
this class of theories black holes can be as light as M_{Planck}/\sqrt{N} and
be produced in particle collisions above this energy. We show, that the micro
black holes must come in the same variety as the species do, although their
label is not associated with any conserved charge measurable at large
distances. In contrast with big Schwarzschildian ones, the evaporation of the
smallest black holes is maximally undemocratic and is biased in favor of
particular species. With an increasing mass the democracy characteristic to the
usual macro black holes is gradually regained. The lowest possible mass above
which black holes become Einsteinian is \sqrt{N} M_{Planck}. This fact uncovers
the new fundamental scale (below the quantum gravity scale) above which gravity
changes classically, and the properties of black holes and gravity are such as
if some extra dimensions open up, although no such input exists in the theory.
Our observations indicate that geometry of space may be an emergent concept
following from large number of species and the consistency with macro black
hole physics. We apply our findings to the phenomenological properties of the
micro black holes that can be observed at LHC for large N. Extrapolating our
findings to small N, one may ask whether the existence of quark and lepton
flavors is already an evidence for emergent extra dimensions at short
distances.
