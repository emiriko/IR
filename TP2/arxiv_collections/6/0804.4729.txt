We indicate that the random aperiodic oscillation of the gluon distributions
in a modified BFKL equation has the positive Lyapunov exponents. This first
example of chaos in QCD evolution equations, raises the sudden disappearance of
the gluon distributions at a critical small value of the Bjorken variable $x$
and may stop the increase of the new particle events in a ultra high energy
hadron collider.
