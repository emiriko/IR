Laumon moduli spaces are certain smooth closures of the moduli spaces of maps
from the projective line to the flag variety of GL_n. We calculate the
equivariant cohomology rings of the Laumon moduli spaces in terms of
Gelfand-Tsetlin subalgebra of U(gl_n), and formulate a conjectural answer for
the small quantum cohomology rings in terms of certain commutative shift of
argument subalgebras of U(gl_n).
