There is a natural cancellation between the contributions of the $qqq$ and
$qqqq\bar q$ components to the axial charge of the N(1535) resonance. While the
probability of the former is larger than that of the latter, its coefficient in
the axial charge expression is exceptionally small. The magnitude of two of the
corresponding coefficients of the $qqqq\bar q$ components are in contrast large
and have the opposite sign. This result provides a phenomenological
illustration of the recent unquenched lattice calculation result that the axial
charge of the N(1535) resonance is very small, if not vanishing \cite{takah}.
The result sets an upper limit on the magnitude of the probability of $qqqq\bar
q$ components as well.
