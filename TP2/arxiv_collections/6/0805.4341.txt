We compare for Ho metal the x-ray absorption spectrum and the resonant soft
x-ray diffraction spectra obtained at the $3d_{5/2} \to 4f$ ($M_5$) resonance
for the magnetic 1st and 2nd order diffraction peaks $(0,0,\tau)$ and
$(0,0,2\tau)$ with the result of an atomic multiplet calculation. We find a
good agreement between experiment and simulation giving evidence that this kind
of simulation is well suited to quantitatively analyze resonant soft x-ray
diffraction data from correlated electron systems.
