Strong longitudinal color flux fields will be created in the initial stage of
high-energy nuclear collisions. We investigate analytically time evolution of
such boost-invariant color fields from Abelian-like initial conditions, and
next examine stability of the boost-invariant configurations against rapidity
dependent fluctuations. We find that the magnetic background field has an
instability induced by the lowest Landau level whose amplitude grows
exponentially. For the electric background field there is no apparent
instability although pair creations due to the Schwinger mechanism should be
involved.
