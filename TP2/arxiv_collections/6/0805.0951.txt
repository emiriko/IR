We present a method to calculate the One-loop mass correction to Kinks mass
in a (1+1)-dimensional field theoretical model in which the fluctuation
potential $V^{\prime\prime}(\phi_c)$ has shape invariance property. We use the
generalized zeta function regularization method to implement our setup for
describing quantum kink states.
