We propose to perform fully dynamical simulations at small quark masses by
reweighting in the quark mass. This approach avoids some of the technical
difficulties associated with direct simulations at very small quark masses. We
calculate the weight factors stochastically, using determinant breakup and low
mode projection to reduce the statistical fluctuations. We find that the weight
factors fluctuate only moderately on nHYP smeared dynamical Wilson-clover
ensembles, and we could successfully reweight 16^4, (1.85fm)^4 volume
configurations from m_q = 20MeV to m_q = 5MeV quark masses, reaching the
epsilon-regime. We illustrate the strength of the method by calculating the low
energy constant F from the epsilon-regime pseudo-scalar correlator.
