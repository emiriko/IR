Jahn-Teller systems and the Jahn-Teller effect are discussed in terms of
cavity QED models. By expressing the field modes in a quadrature
representation, it is shown that certain setups of a two-level system
interacting with a bimodal cavity is described by the Jahn-Teller
$E\times\epsilon$ Hamiltonian. We identify the corresponding adiabatic
potential surfaces and the conical intersection. The effects of a non-zero
geometrical Berry phase, governed by encircling the conical intersection, are
studied in detail both theoretically and numerically. The numerical analysis is
carried out by applying a wave packet propagation method, more commonly used in
molecular or chemical physics, and analytic expressions for the characteristic
time scales are presented. It is found that the collapse-revival structure is
greatly influenced by the geometrical phase and as a consequence, the field
intensities contain direct information about this phase. We also mention the
link between the Jahn-Teller effect and the Dicke phase transition in cavity
QED.
