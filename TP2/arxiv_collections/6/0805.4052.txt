In this paper, we calculate the transverse momentum diffusion coefficient
kappa_T of heavy quark and gluon penetration length in the deconfinement phase
of Sakai-Sugimoto model, which is known as a holographic dual of large N_c QCD.
We find that for the heavy quark moving through the thermal plasma with a
constant velocity v<1, the transverse momentum diffusion coefficient kappa_T is
proportional to lamda*gamma^{{1/3}}*T^4/T_d, and the gluon penetration length
delta x is proportional to E^{{2/5}}. These results are different from those
calculated in N=4 super-Yang-Mills theory, where kappa_T is proportional to
lambda*gamma^{{1/2}}*T^3 and delta x is proportional to E^{{1/3}},
respectively. In the high energy limit, the difference between the two pairs of
results should be evident, so we expect that the future LHC experiments can
tell us which model is more closely related to the realistic strongly coupled
QCD at finite temperature.
