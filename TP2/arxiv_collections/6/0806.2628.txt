We address four main areas in which graduate quantum mechanics education can
be improved: course content, textbook, teaching methods, and assessment tools.
We report on a three year longitudinal study at the Colorado School of Mines
using innovations in all these areas. In particular, we have modified the
content of the course to reflect progress in the field in the last 50 years,
used textbooks that include such content, incorporated a variety of teaching
techniques based on physics education research, and used a variety of
assessment tools to study the effectiveness of these reforms. We present a new
assessment tool, the Graduate Quantum Mechanics Conceptual Survey, and further
testing of a previously developed assessment tool, the Quantum Mechanics
Conceptual Survey. We find that graduate students respond well to
research-based techniques that have been tested mainly in introductory courses,
and that they learn much of the new content introduced in each version of the
course. We also find that students' ability to answer conceptual questions
about graduate quantum mechanics is highly correlated with their ability to
solve calculational problems on the same topics. In contrast, we find that
students' understanding of basic undergraduate quantum mechanics concepts at
the modern physics level is not improved by instruction at the graduate level.
