BaBar and Belle have recently revived the interest in charmonium
spectroscopy, discovering many unexpected resonances. In this review, I'll
focus mostly on the states found in B decays and double $\ccbar$. A better
understanding of their production mechanism can help to discriminate among
models, confirm tentative $J^{PC}$ assignments, and clarify the overall
picture.
