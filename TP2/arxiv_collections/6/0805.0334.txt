We investigated experimentally the high-temperature electrical resistance of
graphene interconnects. The test structures were fabricated using the focused
ion beam from the single and bi-layer graphene produced by mechanical
exfoliation. It was found that as temperature increases from 300 to 500K the
resistance of the single- and bi-layer graphene interconnects drops down by 30%
and 70%, respectively. The quenching and temperature dependence of the
resistance were explained by the thermal generation of the electron-hole pairs
and acoustic phonon scattering. The obtained results are important for the
proposed applications of graphene as interconnects in integrated circuits.
