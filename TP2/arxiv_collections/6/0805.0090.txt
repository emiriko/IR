The refractive optical design of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Near
Infrared Camera (NIRCam) uses three infrared materials in its lenses: LiF,
BaF2, and ZnSe. In order to provide the instrument's optical designers with
accurate, heretofore unavailable data for absolute refractive index based on
actual cryogenic measurements, two prismatic samples of each material were
measured using the cryogenic, high accuracy, refraction measuring system
(CHARMS) at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), densely covering the
temperature range from 15 to 320 K and wavelength range from 0.4 to 5.6
microns. Data reduction methods are discussed and graphical and tabulated data
for absolute refractive index, dispersion, and thermo-optic coefficient for
these three materials are presented for selected wavelengths and temperatures
along with estimates of index uncertainty. Coefficients for
temperature-dependent Sellmeier fits of measured index are also presented with
an example of their usage to predict absolute index at any wavelength or
temperature within the applicable range of those parameters.
