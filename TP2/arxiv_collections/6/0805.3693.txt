We propose an experiment to explore the magnetic phase transitions in
interacting fermionic Hubbard systems, and describe how to obtain the
ferromagnetic phase diagram of itinerant electron systems from these
observations. In addition signatures of ferromagnetic correlations in the
observed ground states are found: for large trap radii (trap radius $R_T > 4$,
in units of coherence length $\xi$), ground states are topological in nature --
a "skyrmion" in 2D, and a "hedgehog" in 3D.
