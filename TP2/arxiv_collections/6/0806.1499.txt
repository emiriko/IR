A new algorithm for jet finding in hadronic collisions is presented. The
algorithm, based on a Gaussian filter in $(\eta,\phi)$, is specifically
intended for use in heavy ion collisions and/or for detectors with limited
acceptance. The performance of the algorithm is compared to two conventional
algorithms, a seedless cone algorithm and a $k_\perp$ algorithm, for Pythia
simulated di-jet events in $\sqrt{s} = 200 \mathrm{GeV}$ $p + p$ collisions
with $4 \mathrm{GeV}/c \le \sqrt{Q^2} \le 16 \mathrm{GeV}/c$. The Gaussian
filter is found to perform as well as, and in some instances better than, the
conventional algorithms.
