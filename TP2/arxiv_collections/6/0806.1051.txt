We study M-theory compactified on a specific class of seven-dimensional
manifolds with SU(3) structure. The manifolds can be viewed as a fibration of
an arbitrary Calabi-Yau threefold over a circle, with a U-duality twist around
the circle. In some cases we find that in the four dimensional low energy
effective theory a (broken) non-Abelian gauge group appears. Furthermore, such
compactifications are shown to be dual to previously analyzed compactifications
of the heterotic string on K3 x T^2, with background gauge field fluxes on the
T^2.
