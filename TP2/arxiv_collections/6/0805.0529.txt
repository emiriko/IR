This paper is a revised version of arXiv:0805.0529 and Phys.Rev. D78, 064038
(2008), taking into account the erratum published in Phys.Rev. D85, 069903(E)
(2012). Geometrical and topological properties of the quasi-plane Szekeres
model and of the plane symmetric dust model are discussed. Some related
comments on the quasi-hyperbolical model are made. These properties include:
(1) The pattern of expansion in the plane symmetric case, and the Newtonian
model that imitates it; (2) The possibility of toroidal topology of the $t =$
const sections in the plane symmetric model; (3) The absence of apparent
horizons in the quasi-plane and quasi-hyperbolic models (they are globally
trapped); (4) Description of the toroidal topology in the Szekeres coordinates;
(5) Interpretation of the mass function in the quasi-plane model.
