The t-J model is regarded as a canonical model of spin-singlet pairing
induced by the {\em kinetic exchange interaction} responsible also for an
antiferromagnetic ordering in the strongly correlated narrow-band systems. In
the orbitally degenerate systems both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic
kinetic exchange interactions occur. I review briefly the analogy between the
singlet and triplet types of pairing, as well as draw some general conclusions
about the pairing induced by these exchange interactions. The general
discussion is also illustrated with a concrete case of a two-dimensional
lattice with the spin triplet pairing.
