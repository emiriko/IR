We present an explanation for the anomalous behavior in tunneling conductance
and noise through a point contact between edge states in the Jain series
$\nu=p/(2np+1)$, for extremely weak-backscattering and low temperatures [Y.C.
Chung, M. Heiblum, and V. Umansky, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf{91}}, 216804 (2003)].
We consider edge states with neutral modes propagating at finite velocity, and
we show that the activation of their dynamics causes the unexpected change in
the temperature power-law of the conductance. Even more importantly, we
demonstrate that multiple-quasiparticles tunneling at low energies becomes the
most relevant process. This result will be used to explain the experimental
data on current noise where tunneling particles have a charge that can reach
$p$ times the single quasiparticle charge. In this paper we analyze the
conductance and the shot noise to substantiate quantitatively the proposed
scenario.
