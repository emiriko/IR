We consider the problem of estimating the regression function in functional
linear regression models by proposing a new type of projection estimators which
combine dimension reduction and thresholding. The introduction of a threshold
rule allows to get consistency under broad assumptions as well as minimax rates
of convergence under additional regularity hypotheses. We also consider the
particular case of Sobolev spaces generated by the trigonometric basis which
permits to get easily mean squared error of prediction as well as estimators of
the derivatives of the regression function. We prove these estimators are
minimax and rates of convergence are given for some particular cases.
