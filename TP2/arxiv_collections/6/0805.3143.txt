We study the appearance of a Josephson spin current in a model triplet
superconductor junction with a magnetically-active tunnelling barrier. We find
three distinct mechanisms for producing a spin current, and we provide a
detailed discussion of the symmetry properties and the physical origins of
each. By combining these three basic mechanisms, we find that it is possible to
exercise fine control over the spin currents. In particular, we show that
unlike the charge current, the spin currents on either side of the barrier need
not be identical.
