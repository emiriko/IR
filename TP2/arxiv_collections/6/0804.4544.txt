We present the first-principles study of effects of the charge dopants such
as Cesium and Iodine encapsulated on the electronic structure of carbon
nanotubes. An encapsulated cesium atom donates an electron to the nanotube and
produces donor-like states below the conduction bands. In contrast, an iodine
trimer (I$_{3}$) accepts an electron from the nanotube and produces an
acceptor-like state above the valance band maximum. We find that a Cs atom
inside a metallic armchair carbon nanotube gives rise to spatial oscillations
of the density of states near the Fermi level.
