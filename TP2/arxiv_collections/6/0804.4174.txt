This is an attempt to construct a classical microscopic model of the electron
which underlies quantum mechanics. An electron is modeled, not as a point
particle, but as the end of an electromagnetic string, a line of flux. These
lines stretch across cosmic distances, but are almost unobservable because they
condense into pairs--which form the ether. Photons are modeled to propagate on
these line pairs, which act effectively as wave guides. These line pairs are
also responsible for the force of gravity--which is electromagnetic in
character.
