In families of Painlev\'e VI differential equations having common algebraic
solutions we classify all the members which come from geometry, i.e. the
corresponding linear differential equations which are Picard-Fuchs associated
to families of algebraic varieties. In our case, we have one family with zero
dimensional fibers and all others are families of curves. We use the
classification of families of elliptic curves with four singular fibers done by
Herfurtner in 1992 and generalize the results of Doran in 2001 and Ben Hamed
and Gavrilov in 2005.
