Recent developments in models with warped extra dimensions have opened new
possibilities for vector-like quark studies at hadron colliders. These new
vector-like quarks can mix sizably with light Standard Model quarks without
violating low energy constraints. We perform a model-independent analysis to
determine the Tevatron reach in the search for new quarks. We find that the
Tevatron has great potential to observe such quarks via their electroweak
single production due to their mixing with valence quarks. With 4 (8) fb-1
integrated luminosity, one may reach a 5\sigma statistical significance for a
heavy quark of mass 580 (630) GeV if the heavy quark-Standard Model quark
mixing parameter is order one.
