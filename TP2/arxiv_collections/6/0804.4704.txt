A new examination of the GLV all-orders opacity result for radiative energy
loss is presented. The opacity expansion is shown to be a Dyson expansion of a
Schrodinger-like (or diffusion) equation, a form also found in BDMPS-Z-ASW, AMY
and Higher Twist formalisms of radiative energy loss. A new, efficient
numerical evaluation of the GLV all-orders result gives results up to and
beyond ninth order in opacity. This presents a solution to this
Schrodinger-like equation to almost arbitrary accuracy for lengths and
densities applicable at RHIC and LHC. The first order is found to be most
important, although higher orders implemented in a geometry integration will be
needed for quantitative jet tomography.
