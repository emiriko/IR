The gluonic contribution to the nuclear modification factor R_AA is
investigated for central Au + Au collisions at sqrt(s) = 200 GeV employing a
perturbative QCD-based parton cascade including radiative processes. A flat
quenching pattern is found up to transverse momenta of 30 GeV which is slightly
smaller compared with results from the Gyulassy-Levai-Vitev formalism. We
demonstrate that the present microscopic transport description provides
challenging means of investigating both jet-quenching and a strong buildup of
elliptic flow in terms of the same standard perturbative QCD interactions.
