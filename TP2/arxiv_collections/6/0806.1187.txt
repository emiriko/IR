We study trial states modelling the heavy quark-antiquark ground state in
SU(2) Yang-Mills theory. A state describing the flux tube between quarks as a
thin string of glue is found to be a poor description of the continuum ground
state; the infinitesimal thickness of the string leads to UV artifacts which
suppress the overlap with the ground state. Contrastingly, a state which
surrounds the quarks with non-abelian Coulomb fields is found to have a good
overlap with the ground state for all charge separations. In fact, the overlap
increases as the lattice regulator is removed. This opens up the possibility
that the Coulomb state is the true ground state in the continuum limit.
