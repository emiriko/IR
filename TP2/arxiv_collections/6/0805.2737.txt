We propose and study a weak value (WV) protocol in the context of a solid
state setup, specifically, an electronic Mach-Zehnder interferometer. This is
the first specific proposal to measure both the real and imaginary part (i.e.,
complete tomography) of a WV. We also analyze the manifestation of many-body
physics in the WV to be measured, including finite temperature and
shot-noise-like contributions.
