Let $G$ be a permutation group acting on a set $V$. A partition $\pi$ of $V$
is distinguishing if the only element of $G$ that fixes each cell of $\pi$ is
the identity. The distinguishing number of $G$ is the minimum number of cells
in a distinguishing partition. We prove that if $G$ is a primitive permutation
group and $|V|\ge336$, its distinguishing number is two.
