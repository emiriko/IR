We study the formalism to include isospin-symmetry-breaking corrections when
extracting the up-down Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix element from
superallowed 0+ -> 0+ nuclear beta decay. We show that there are no first order
isospin-symmetry-breaking corrections to the relevant nuclear matrix elements.
We find corrections to the treatment of Towner and Hardy, and assess these
using schematic models of increasing complexity.
