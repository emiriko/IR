We introduce a stochastic model for the determination of phase noise in
optoelectronic oscillators. After a short overview of the main results for the
phase diffusion approach in autonomous oscillators, an extension is proposed
for the case of optoelectronic oscillators where the microwave is a limit-cycle
originated from a bifurcation induced by nonlinearity and time-delay. This
Langevin approach based on stochastic calculus is also successfully confronted
with experimental measurements.
