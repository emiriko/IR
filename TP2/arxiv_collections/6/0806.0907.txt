One-way quantum computing is an important and novel approach to quantum
computation. By exploiting the existing particle-particle interactions, we
report the first experimental realization of the complete process of
deterministic one-way quantum Deutsch-Josza algorithm in NMR, including graph
state preparation, single-qubit measurements and feed-forward corrections. The
findings in our experiment may shed light on the future scalable one-way
quantum computation.
