In this talk I summarize recent findings around the description of axial
vector mesons as dynamically generated states from the interaction of
pseudoscalar mesons and vector mesons, dedicating some attention to the two
$K_1(1270)$ states. Then I review the generation of open and hidden charm
scalar and axial states, and how some recent experiment supports the existence
of the new hidden charm scalar state predicted. I present recent results
showing that the low lying $1/2^+$ baryon resonances for S=-1 can be obtained
as bound states or resonances of two mesons and one baryon in coupled channels.
Then show the differences with the S=0 case, where the $N^*(1710)$ appears also
dynamically generated from the two pion one nucleon system, but the $N^*(1440)$
does not appear, indicating a more complex structure of the Roper resonance.
Finally I shall show how the state X(2175), recently discovered at BABAR and
BES, appears naturally as a resonance of the $\phi K \bar{K}$ system.
