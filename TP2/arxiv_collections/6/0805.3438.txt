Quantum theory of the gravitation in the causal approach is studied up to the
second order of perturbation theory. We prove gauge invariance and
renormalizability in the second order of perturbation theory for the pure
gravity system (massless and massive). Then we investigate the interaction of
massless gravity with matter (described by scalars and spinors) and massless
Yang-Mills fields. We obtain a difference with respect to the classical field
theory due to the fact that in quantum field theory one cannot enforce the
divergenceless property on the vector potential and this spoils the
divergenceless property of the usual energy-momentum tensor. To correct this
one needs a supplementary ghost term in the interaction Lagrangian.
