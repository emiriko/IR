An experiment is proposed to test Bell's theorem in a purely macroscopic
domain. If realized, it would determine whether Bell inequalities are satisfied
for a manifestly local, classical system. It is stressed why the inequalities
should not be presumed to hold for such a macroscopic system without actual
experimental evidence. In particular, by providing a purely classical,
topological explanation for the EPR-Bohm type spin correlations, it is
demonstrated why Bell inequalities must be violated in the manifestly local,
macroscopic domain, just as strongly as they are in the microscopic domain.
