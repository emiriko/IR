The distribution of gluon fields in hadrons is of fundamental interest in
QCD. Using lattice QCD we have observed the formation of gluon flux tubes
within tri-quark (baryon) systems for a wide variety of spatial distributions
of the color sources. In particular we have investigated configurations where
two of the quarks are close together and the third quark is some distance away,
which approximates a quark plus diquark string. We find that the string tension
of the quark-diquark string is the same as that of the quark-antiquark string
on the same lattice. We also compare the longitudinal and transverse profiles
of the gluon flux tubes for both sets of strings, and find them to be of
similar radii and to have similar vacuum suppression.
