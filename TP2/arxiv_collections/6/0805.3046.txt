We construct the charge symmetry violating (CSV) nucleon-nucleon potential
induced by the $\rho^0$-$\o$ mixing due to the neutron-proton mass difference
driven by the $NN$ loop. Analytical expression for for the two-body CSV
potential is presented containing both the central and non- central $NN$
interaction. We show that the $\rho$$NN$ tensor interaction can significantly
enhance the charge symmetry violating $NN$ interaction even if momentum
dependent off-shell $\rho^0$-$\omega$ mixing amplitude is considered. It is
also shown that the inclusion of form factors removes the divergence arising
out of the contact interaction. Consequently, we see that the precise size of
the computed scattering length difference depends on how the short range
aspects of the CSV potential are treated.
