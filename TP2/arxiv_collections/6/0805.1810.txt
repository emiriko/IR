We adapt the generalization of root systems of the second author and H.
Yamane to the terminology of category theory. We introduce Cartan schemes,
associated root systems and Weyl groupoids. After some preliminary general
results, we completely classify all finite Weyl groupoids with at most three
objects. The classification yields that there exist infinitely many standard,
but only 9 exceptional cases.
  Key words: Nichols algebra, reflection, root system, Weyl groupoid
