We have studied the entropy-driven mechanism leading to stationary patterns
formation in stochastic systems with local dynamics and non-Fickian diffusion.
We have shown that a multiplicative noise fulfilling a fluctuation-dissipation
relation is able to induce and sustain stationary structures with its intensity
growth. It was found that at small and large noise intensities the system is
characterized by unstable homogeneous states. At intermediate values of the
noise intensity three types of patterns are possible: nucleation, spinodal
decomposition and stripes with liner defects (dislocations). Our analytical
investigations are verified by computer simulations.
