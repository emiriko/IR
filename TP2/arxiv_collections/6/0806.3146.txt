We investigate the expression of natural numbers in any base from a quantum
point of view. In particular, resorting to the one-to-one correspondence
between natural numbers and Fock states, we construct a set of multiboson
operators and a set of translation operators, whose action on the Fock states
leads to the coefficients identifying a natural number in any base.
