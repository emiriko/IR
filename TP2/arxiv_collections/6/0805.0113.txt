In a series of published papers we reanalyzed treatments of the Veneziano
amplitudes and the models associated with them. In this work we demonstrate
that the already obtained partition function for these amplitudes can be
exactly mapped into that for the Polychronakos-Frahm spin chain which, in turn,
is obtainable from the Richardson-Gaudin XXX model. Reshetikhin and Varchenko
demonstrated that such a model is recoverable from their WKB-type analysis of
solutions of the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov (K-Z) equations. The linear
independence of solutions of these equations is controlled by determinants
whose form (up to a constant) coincides with the Veneziano (or Veneziano-like)
amplitudes.In the simplest case, when the K-Z equations are reducible to the
Gauss hypergeometric equation, the determinantal conditions coincide with those
which were discovered by Kummer in 19th century. Kummer's results admit
physical interpretation crucial for providing needed justification associating
determinanatal formula(s) with Veneziano-like amplitudes. General results are
illustrated by many examples. These include but are not limited to only high
energy physics since all high energy physics scattering processes can be looked
upon from much broader sctochastic theory of random fragmentation and
coagulation processes recently undergoing active development in view of its
applications in disciplines ranging from ordering in spin glasses and
population genetics to computer science, linguistics and economics,etc. In this
theory Veneziano amplitudes play the universal role since they are the
Poisson-Dirichlet-type distributions for these processes (analogous to the more
familiar Maxwell distribution for gases)
