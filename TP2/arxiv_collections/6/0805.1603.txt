In this study, we propose new Higgs production mechanisms with multi-photon
final states in the fermiophobic limit of the Two Higgs Doublet Model. The
processes are: gg -> hh, gg -> H h followed by H -> h h and gg -> A h followed
by A -> h Z. In the fermiophobic limit, gg -> h h and gg -> A h -> h h Z would
give rise to 4 photon signature while gg -> H h -> h h h can give a 6 photon
final state. We show that both the Fermilab Tevatron and CERN's Large Hadron
Collider can probe a substantial slice of the parameter space in this
fermiophobic scenario of the Two Higgs Doublet Model. If observed the above
processes can give some information on the triple Higgs couplings involved.
