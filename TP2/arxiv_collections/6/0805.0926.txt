In this paper we present the latest version of the TCAD environment BICEP'S
(Braunschweigs Integrated CAD-Environment for Product Planning and Process
Simulation). By using a central process database, which allows the exchange of
all relevant process data it is able to overcome many of the mentioned
obstacles. The database and process planning tool can be used by process
developers to document changes in process settings and the influence of such
changes on the process result. This information can then be used by the
designers to set-up a simulation file for a detailed analysis of the impact of
such parameter changes on the requested design. This will be shown by the
example of silicon etching using an atomistic etch simulator.
