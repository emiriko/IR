Recent results indicate that the J/psi suppression pattern differs with
rapidity showing a larger suppression at forward rapidity. J/psi suppression
mechanisms based on energy density (such as color screening, interaction with
co-movers, etc.) predict the opposite trend. On the other hand, it is expected
that more c\bar{c} pairs should be available to form quarkonia at mid-rapidity
via recombination. Some models provide a way to differentiate J/psi production
from initially produced c\bar{c} pairs and final state recombination of
uncorrelated pairs, via the rapidity and transverse momentum dependence of the
elliptic flow (v2).
  During 2007 data taking at RHIC, a large sample of Au+Au collisions at
sqrt(sNN)=200 GeV was collected. The statistics has been increased compared to
previous 2004 data set, thus allowing a more precise measurement of the J/psi
production at both mid and forward rapidity. Furthermore, the PHENIX experiment
benefited from the addition of a new detector, which improves the reaction
plane resolution and allows us to measure the J/psi v2. Comparing this
measurement to the positive D-mesons v2 (through non-photonic electron decays)
will help constraining the J/psi production mechanisms and getting a more
precise picture of the proportion of J/psi coming from direct production or
charm quark coalescence.
  Details on how the J/psi v2 is measured at both rapidities are presented. The
J/psi v2 as a function of transverse momentum are compared to existing models.
