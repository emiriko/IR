In this communication we report on a peculiar property of barrier
transmission that systems governed by the nonlinear Schroedinger equation share
with the linear one: For unit transmission the potential can be divided at an
arbitrary point into two sub-potentials, a left and a right one, which have
exactly the same transmission. This is a rare case of an exact property of a
nonlinear wave function which will be of interest, e.g., for studies of
coherent transport of Bose-Einstein condensates through mesoscopic waveguide
