I study an Extended Periodic Anderson Model (EPAM) with non-local
hybridisation, $V_{fc}$, and a coulomb interaction, $U_{fc}$, between localised
$f$ electrons and wide band conduction ($c$) electrons. Within DMFT, a quantum
phase transition (QPT) driven by soft $f$-valence fluctuations, accompanied by
a discontinuous jump in the Fermi volume, is found as $V_{fc}$ is tuned across
a critical value. Near the associated QCP, an unconventional superconductive
instability, driven by these extended, singular valence fluctuations, naturally
emerges. {\it All} these phenomena are representative of observations in
pressurised $CeCu_{2}Si_{2}$.
