The role of Chern-Simons (CS) actions is reviewed, starting from the
observation that all classical actions in Hamiltonian form can be viewed as 0+1
CS systems, in the same class with the coupling between the electromagnetic
field and a point charge. Some suggestions are derived that could shed some
light on the quantization problem in D=2n-1>3 dimensions.
