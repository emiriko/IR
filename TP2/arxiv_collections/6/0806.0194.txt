A globally controlled scheme for quantum transport is proposed. The scheme
works on a 1D chain of nearest neighbor coupled systems of qudits (finite
dimension), or qunats (continuous variable), taking any arbitrary initial
quantum state of the chain and producing a final quantum state which is
perfectly spatially mirrored about the mid-point of the chain. As a particular
novel application, the method can be used to transport continuous variable (CV)
quantum states. A physical realization is proposed where it is shown how the
quantum states of the microwave fields held in a chain of driven
superconducting coplanar waveguides can experience quantum mirror transport
when coupled by switchable Cooper Pair Boxes.
