We propose a new model for description of electrons beam dynamics in Free
Electron Laser (FEL) undulator, based on the method of linear time-dependent
invariants of quantum-mechanical charge particle. The magnetic field has
periodic structure along the undulator. For this problem, described by
time-dependent quadratic Hamiltonian, we obtain exact solution. The
time-evolutions of the tree quantum fluctuations: covariance cov(q,p), var(q)
and var(p) for the charge particle in this case are also determined. This
research will help to optimize the FEL undulator: for example, using a 2.5 GeV
linear electron accelerator it will be possible to emit radiation at 1.5 nm and
shorter length.
  This method could be applicable also to any device with periodic structure of
applied field (e.g. Tokamak, cyclic accelerators) for the case of charge
non-relativistic quantum particles.
