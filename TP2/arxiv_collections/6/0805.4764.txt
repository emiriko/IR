Heavy-light hadrons are studied in a mass loaded flux tube model. The study
indicates that the dynamics of mesons and baryons containing a $c$ quark is
well described by the mass loaded flux tube. The hypothesis of good
diquark-antiquark degeneracy is found reasonable in heavy-light quark systems.
The spectrum of charmed ($D$) and charmed strange ($D_s$) mesons is
systematically computed. $D$ and $D_s$ in 1D multiplets are predicted to have
lower masses in comparison with other theoretical predictions. The predicted
masses of the $1^-(1^3D_1)$ and the $3^-(1^3D_3)$ $D_s$ agree well with those
of recently observed $D_{s1}(2700)^{\pm}$ and $D_{sJ}(2860)$, respectively.
