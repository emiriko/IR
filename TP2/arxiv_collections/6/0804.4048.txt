The paper considers an opportunity for the creation of an artificial
two-component metamaterial with a negative refractive index within the radio
and optical frequency band, which possesses a spatial dispersion. It is shown
that there exists a spectral region where, under certain ratio of volume
fraction unit occupied with components, the metamaterial appears transparent
without attenuating the electromagnetic wave passing through it and possessing
a phase and group velocity of the opposite sign.
