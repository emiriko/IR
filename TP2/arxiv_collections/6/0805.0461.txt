A brief review of the search for variation of the fine structure constant in
quasar absorption spectra is presented. Special consideration is given to the
role of atomic calculations in the analysis of the observed data. A range of
methods which allow to perform calculations for atoms or ions with different
electron structure and which cover practically all periodic table of elements
is discussed. Critical compilation of the results of the calculations as well
as a review of the most recent results of the analysis are presented.
