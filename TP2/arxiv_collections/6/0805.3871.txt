RHIC-PHENIX has observed a large suppression pattern and azimuthal anisotropy
of non-photonic electron at mid-rapidity ($\mid\eta\mid<0.35$) in Au+Au
collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV. To understand these results and the
interaction of heavy quarks in the hot and dense medium, experimental
determination of production ratio of charm over bottom is one of the most
important topics, since the behavior of bottom may differ from charm in the
medium. We measured the ratio of charm over bottom and total cross section of
bottom via partial reconstruction of D$^0$$\to$e$^+$ K$^-$ $\nu_e$ decay in p+p
collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 200$ GeV. Total cross sections of charm and bottom
were also measured via di-electron continuum in p+p collisions at $\sqrt{s} =
200$ GeV.
