We investigated the time-dependent domain wall motion of epitaxial
PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 capacitors 100 nm-thick using modified piezoresponse force
microscopy (PFM). We obtained successive domain evolution images reliably by
combining the PFM with switching current measurements. We observed that domain
wall speed (v) decreases with increases in domain size. We also observed that
the average value of v, obtained under applied electric field (Eapp),showed
creep behavior: i.e. <v> ~ exp(-E0/Eapp)^$\mu$ with an exponent $\mu$ of 0.9
$\pm$ 0.1 and an activation field E0 of about 700 kV/cm.
