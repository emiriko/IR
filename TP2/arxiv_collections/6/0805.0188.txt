We investigate the shot noise generated by particle emission from a
mesoscopic capacitor into an edge state reflected and transmitted at a quantum
point contact (QPC). For a capacitor subject to a periodic voltage the
resulting shot noise is proportional to the number of particles (both electrons
and holes) emitted during a period. It is proportional to the product of
transmission and reflection probability of the QPC independent of the applied
voltage but proportional to the driving frequency. If two driven capacitors are
coupled to a QPC at different sides then the resulting shot noise is maximally
the sum of noises produced by each of the capacitors. However the noise is
suppressed depending on the coincidence of the emission of two particles of the
same kind.
