The technique of laser-assisted nanoimprinting lithography (LAN) has been
proposed to utilize an excimer laser to irradiate through a quartz mold and
melts a thin polymer film on the substrate for micro- to nano-scaled
fabrications. In the present study, the novel concept of that copper was
adopted as the substrate instead of silicon, which is conventionally used, was
proposed. The micro/nano structures on the copper substrate could be fabricated
by chemical/electrochemical etching or electroforming ; following by the
patterns have been transferred onto the substrate using LAN process.
Alternatives of the substrate materials could lead versatile applications in
micro/nano-fabrication. To demonstrate the feasibility of this concept
numerically, this study introduced optical multiple reflection theory to
perform both analytical and numerical modeling during the process and to
predict the thermal response theoretically.
