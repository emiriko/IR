Knowledge-based economy forces companies in the nation to group together as a
cluster in order to maintain their competitiveness in the world market. The
cluster development relies on two key success factors which are knowledge
sharing and collaboration between the actors in the cluster. Thus, our study
tries to propose knowledge management system to support knowledge management
activities within the cluster. To achieve the objectives of this study,
ontology takes a very important role in knowledge management process in various
ways; such as building reusable and faster knowledge-bases, better way for
representing the knowledge explicitly. However, creating and representing
ontology create difficulties to organization due to the ambiguity and
unstructured of source of knowledge. Therefore, the objectives of this paper
are to propose the methodology to create and represent ontology for the
organization development by using knowledge engineering approach. The
handicraft cluster in Thailand is used as a case study to illustrate our
proposed methodology.
