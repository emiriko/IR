It is shown that critical phenomena associated with Siegel disk, intrinsic to
1D complex analytical maps, survives in 2D complex invertible dissipative
H\'{e}non map. Special numerical method of estimation of the Siegel disk
scaling center position (for 1D maps it corresponds to extremum) for
multi-dimensional invertible maps are developed.
