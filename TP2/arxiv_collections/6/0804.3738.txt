We demonstrate that Fe sheathed LaO0.9F0.1FeAs wires with Ti as a buffer
layer were successfully fabricated by the powder-in-tube (PIT) method.
Comparing to the common two-step vacuum quartz tube synthesis method, the PIT
method is more convenient and safe for synthesizing the novel iron-based
layered superconductors. Structural analysis by mean of x-ray diffraction shows
that the main phase of LaO0.9F0.1FeAs was obtained by this synthesis method.
The transition temperature of the LaO0.9F0.1FeAs wire is around 25 K. The
micrograph shows a homogeneous microstructure with a grain size of 1-3
micrometers. The results suggest that the PIT process is promising in preparing
high-quality iron-based layered superconductor wires.
