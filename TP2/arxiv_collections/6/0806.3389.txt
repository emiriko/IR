Static solutions of 5-dimensional gravity with two spatial Killing vectors
are characterized by their rod structures. In this note we describe how the
orbifold singularities and the topologies of the horizons and asymptotic
regions can be determined from the corresponding rod diagrams. As an example we
introduce the black lens, a static 5-dimensional black hole with a horizon of
lens space topology which is asymptotically Minkowski space. The solution is
novel in that the asymptotic Minkowski space is not quotiented. However it
suffers from a naked singularity. While the conical and orbifold singularities
have been removed, two spherical curvature singularities remain. These
singularities do not contribute to the ADM mass, and the thermodynamics of the
black lens is well behaved, although its entropy is lower than that of a
Tangherlini black hole of the same mass.
