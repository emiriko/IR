This article presents a brief overview of the CMS experiment capabilities to
study the hot and dense matter created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.
The CERN Large Hadron Collider will provide collisions of Pb nuclei at 5.5 TeV
per nucleon. The CMS heavy ion group has developed a plethora of physics
analyses addressing many important aspects of heavy-ion physics in preparation
for a competitive and successful program.
