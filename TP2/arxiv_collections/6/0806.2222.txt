Particles labelled $1,...,n$ are initially arranged in increasing order.
Subsequently, each pair of neighboring particles that is currently in
increasing order swaps according to a Poisson process of rate 1. We analyze the
asymptotic behavior of this process as $n\to\infty$. We prove that the
space--time trajectories of individual particles converge (when suitably
scaled) to a certain family of random curves with two points of
non-differentiability, and that the permutation matrix at a given time
converges to a certain deterministic measure with absolutely continuous and
singular parts. The absorbing state (where all particles are in decreasing
order) is reached at time $(2+o(1))n$. The finishing times of individual
particles converge to deterministic limits, with fluctuations asymptotically
governed by the Tracy--Widom distribution.
