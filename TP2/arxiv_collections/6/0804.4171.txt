In a recent article, Alldredge et al. reported tunnelling data obtained at T
= 4.2 K by STM in Bi-2212 having different doping levels, p, and a new way to
fit the measured differential conductances, g(V), which are linearly
proportional to the local density of states of quasiparticle excitations at the
surface, N(E). The main point of the fitting procedure is to use an
energy-dependent inelastic scattering rate, G = aE (a is a constant). They
argue that by using an equation of the d-wave BCS density of states
(Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer) modified by Dynes et al. with G = aE, they were
able to fit any conductance obtained in Bi-2212 with a doping level between 0.1
and 0.22. In addition, they discuss a new energy scale Delta_0(p) similar to
that obtained in Raman measurements. Unfortunately, the paper is misleading.
