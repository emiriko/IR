A clinical study was performed comparing the efficacy of multimedia learning
modules with traditional textbooks for the first few topics of a calculus based
introductory electricity and magnetism course. Students were randomly assigned
to three different groups experiencing different presentations of the material;
one group received the multimedia learning module presentations and the other
two received the presentations via written text. All students were then tested
on their learning immediately following the presentations as well as two weeks
later. The students receiving the multimedia learning modules performed
significantly better than the students experiencing the text-based
presentations on both tests.
