One of the points at issue with closed-loop-type interferometers is beating
in the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) oscillations. Recent observations suggest the
possibility that the beating results from the Berry-phase pickup by the
conducting electrons in materials with the strong spin-orbit interaction (SOI).
In this study, we also observed beats in the AB oscillations in a gate-defined
closed-loop interferometer fabricated on a GaAs/AlGaAs two-dimensional
electron-gas heterostructure. Since this heterostructure has very small SOI,
the picture of the Berry-phase pickup is ruled out. The observation of beats in
this study, with the controllability of forming a single transverse subband
mode in both arms of our gate-defined interferometer, also rules out the
often-claimed multiple transverse subband effect. It is observed that nodes of
the beats with an h/2e period exhibit a parabolic distribution for varying the
side gate. These results are shown to be well interpreted, without resorting to
the SOI effect, by the existence of two-dimensional multiple longitudinal modes
in a single transverse subband. The Fourier spectrum of measured conductance,
despite showing multiple h/e peaks with the magnetic-field dependence that are
very similar to that from strong-SOI materials, can also be interpreted as the
two-dimensional multiple-longitudinal-modes effect.
