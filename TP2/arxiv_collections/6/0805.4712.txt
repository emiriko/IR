The rigidity of a network of elastic beams crucially depends on the specific
details of its structure. We show both numerically and theoretically that there
is a class of isotropic networks which are stiffer than any other isotropic
network with same density. The elastic moduli of these \textit{stiffest elastic
networks} are explicitly given. They constitute upper-bounds which compete or
improve the well-known Hashin-Shtrikman bounds. We provide a convenient set of
criteria (necessary and sufficient conditions) to identify these networks, and
show that their displacement field under uniform loading conditions is affine
down to the microscopic scale. Finally, examples of such networks with periodic
arrangement are presented, in both two and three dimensions.
