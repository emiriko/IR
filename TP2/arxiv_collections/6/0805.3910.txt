We review the status of the calculation of next-to-next-to-leading order
corrections to large angle Bhabha scattering in pure QED. After discussing the
electron-loop and photonic corrections, we focus on the recently calculated
two-loop virtual corrections involving a heavy-flavor fermion loop. We conclude
by assessing the numerical impact of these corrections on the Bhabha scattering
cross section at colliders operating at a center of mass energy of about 1-GeV.
