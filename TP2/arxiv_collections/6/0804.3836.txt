In this paper we simulate a two dimensional relativistic ideal gas by
implementing a relativistic elastic binary collision algorithm. We show that
the relativistic gas faithfully obeys J\"uttner's speed distribution function.
Furthermore, using this numeric simulation in conjunction with the energy
equipartition theorem for a relativistic gas, we conclude that a moving system
appears cooler.
