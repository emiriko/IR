We develop a theoretical framework to describe the dielectric response of
live cells in suspensions when placed in low external electric fields. The
treatment takes into account the presence of the cell's membrane and of the
charge movement at the membrane's surfaces. For spherical cells suspended in
aqueous solutions, we give an analytic solution for the dielectric function,
which is shown to account for the alpha and beta plateaus seen in many
experimental data. The effect of different physical parameters on the
dielectric curves is methodically analyzed.
