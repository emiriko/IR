The new iron based high Tc superconductors with Tc up to 55 K have stirred
new interest in this field. It is consensus that the BCS mechanism is not able
to explain the high Tc's. In the following we propose that spin holes in
antiferromagnetic clusters combine to make nonmagnetic bipolarons, which can
condense and lead to superconductivity.
