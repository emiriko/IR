We determine the shot noise asymmetry of a quantum dot under reversal of an
external magnetic field. The dot is coupled to edge states which invert their
chirality when the field is reversed, leading to a magnetoasymmetric
electrochemical potential in the nanostructure. Surprisingly, we find an exact
relation between the magnetoasymmetries corresponding to the nonlinear
conductance and the shot noise to leading order in the applied bias, implying a
higher-order fluctuation-dissipation relationship. Our calculations also show a
magnetoasymmetry of the full probability distribution of the transferred
charge.
