Thermal micro-actuators are a promising solution to the need for
large-displacement, gentle handling force, low-power MEMS actuators. Potential
applications of these devices are micro-relays, assembling and miniature
medical instrumentation. In this paper the development of thermal
microactuators based on SU-8 polymer is described. The paper presents the
development of a new microgripper which can realize a movement of the gripping
arms with possibility for positioning and manipulating of the gripped object.
Two models of polymeric microgripper electrothermo- mechanical actuated, using
low actuation voltages, designed for SU-8 polymer fabrication were presented.
The electro-thermal microgrippers were designed and optimized using finite
element simulations. Electro-thermo-mechanical simulations based on finite
element method were performed for each of the model in order to compare the
results. Preliminary experimental tests were carried out.
