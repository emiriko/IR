Owing to their large relatively thermal conductivity, peculiar,
non-hydrodynamic features are expected to characterize the acoustic-like
excitations observed in liquid metals. We report here an experimental study of
collective modes in molten nickel, a case of exceptional geophysical interest
for its relevance in Earth interior science. Our result shed light on
previously reported contrasting evidences: in the explored energy-momentum
region no deviation from the generalized hydrodynamic picture describing non
conductive fluids are observed. Implications for high frequency transport
properties in metallic fluids are discussed.
