We propose an experiment to search for extra "hidden-sector" U(1) gauge
bosons with gauge kinetic mixing with the ordinary photon, predicted by many
extensions of the Standard Model. The setup consists of a highly sensitive
magnetometer inside a superconducting shielding. This is then placed inside a
strong (but sub-critical) magnetic field. In ordinary electrodynamics the
magnetic field cannot permeate the superconductor and no field should register
on the magnetometer. However, photon -- hidden-sector photon -- photon
oscillations would allow to penetrate the superconductor and the magnetic field
would "leak" into the shielded volume and register on the magnetometer.
Although this setup resembles a classic ``light shining though a wall
experiment'' there are two crucial differences. First, the fields are (nearly)
static and the photons involved are virtual. Second, the magnetometer directly
measures the field-strength and not a probability. This improves the dependence
of the signal on the kinetic mixing chi (\ll 1) to chi^2 instead of chi^4. For
hidden photon masses in the range 0.002-200 meV the projected sensitivity for
the mixing parameter lies in the 5 10^-9 to 10^-6 range. This surpasses current
astrophysical and laboratory limits by several orders of magnitude -- ample
room to discover new physics.
