The mean-field pictures based on the standard time-dependent variational
approach have widely been used in the study of nonlinear many-boson systems
such as the Bose-Hubbard model. The mean-field schemes relevant to
Gutzwiller-like trial states $|F>$, number-preserving states $|\xi >$ and
Glauber-like trial states $|Z>$ are compared to evidence the specific
properties of such schemes. After deriving the Hamiltonian picture relevant to
$|Z>$ from that based on $|F>$, the latter is shown to exhibit a Poisson
algebra equipped with a Weyl-Heisenberg subalgebra which preludes to the
$|Z>$-based picture. Then states $|Z>$ are shown to be a superposition of $\cal
N$-boson states $|\xi>$ and the similarities/differences of the $|Z>$-based and
$|\xi>$-based pictures are discussed. Finally, after proving that the simple,
symmetric state $|\xi>$ indeed corresponds to a SU(M) coherent state, a dual
version of states $|Z>$ and $|\xi>$ in terms of momentum-mode operators is
discussed together with some applications.
