We study the Berezin-Toeplitz quantization on symplectic manifolds making use
of the full off-diagonal asymptotic expansion of the Bergman kernel. We give
also a characterization of Toeplitz operators in terms of their asymptotic
expansion. The semi-classical limit properties of the Berezin-Toeplitz
quantization for non-compact manifolds and orbifolds are also established.
