A real-space formulation is given for the recently discussed exciton
condensate in a symmetrically biased graphene bilayer. We show that in the
continuum limit an oddly-quantized vortex in this condensate binds exactly one
zero mode per valley index of the bilayer. In the full lattice model the zero
modes are split slightly due to intervalley mixing. We support these results by
an exact numerical diagonalization of the lattice Hamiltonian. We also discuss
the effect of the zero modes on the charge content of these vortices and deduce
some of their interesting properties.
