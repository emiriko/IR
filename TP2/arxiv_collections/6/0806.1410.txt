In a recent publication (Phys. Rev E 77, 056705 (2008)),we have presented the
stochastic Green function (SGF) algorithm, which has the properties of being
general and easy to apply to any lattice Hamiltonian of the form H=V-T, where V
is diagonal in the chosen occupation number basis and T has only positive
matrix elements. We propose here a modified version of the update scheme that
keeps the simplicity and generality of the original SGF algorithm, and enhances
significantly its efficiency.
