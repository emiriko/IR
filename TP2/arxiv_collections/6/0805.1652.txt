We propose a phonon-assisted tunnelling model for explanation of conductivity
dependence on temperature and temperature-dependent I-V characteristics in
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) molecules. The capability of this model for
explanation of conductivity peculiarities in DNA is illustrated by comparison
of the temperature dependent I-V data extracted from some articles with
tunnelling rate dependences on temperature and field strength computed
according to the phonon-assisted tunnelling theory.
