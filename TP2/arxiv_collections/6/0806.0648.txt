The reaction pp->{pp}_s\gamma, where {pp}_s is a proton pair with an
excitation energy E_{pp}<3 MeV, has been observed with the ANKE spectrometer at
COSY-Juelich for proton beam energies of T_p=0.353, 0.500, and 0.550 GeV. This
is equivalent to photodisintegration of a free 1S_0 diproton for photon
energies E\gamma ~ T_p/2. The differential cross sections measured for c.m.
angles 0 deg.<\theta_{pp}<20 deg. exhibit a steep increase with angle that is
compatible with E1 and E2 multipole contributions. The ratio of the measured
cross sections to those of np->d\gamma is on the 10^{-3}-10^{-2} level. The
increase of the pp->{pp}_s\gamma cross section with T_p might reflect the
influence of the Delta(1232) excitation.
