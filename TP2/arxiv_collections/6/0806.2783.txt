In loop quantum cosmology, non-perturbative quantum gravity effects lead to
the resolution of the big bang singularity by a quantum bounce without
introducing any new degrees of freedom. Though fundamentally discrete, the
theory admits a continuum description in terms of an effective Hamiltonian.
Here we provide an algorithm to obtain the corresponding effective action,
establishing in this way the covariance of the theory for the first time. This
result provides new insights on the continuum properties of the discrete
structure of quantum geometry and opens new avenues to extract physical
predictions such as those related to gauge invariant cosmological
perturbations.
