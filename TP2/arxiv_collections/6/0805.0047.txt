A natural procedure is introduced to replace the traditional, perturbatively
generated counter terms to yield a formulation of covariant, self-interacting,
nonrenormalizable scalar quantum field theories that has the added virtue of
exhibiting a divergence-free perturbation analysis. To achieve this desirable
goal it is necessary to reexamine the meaning of the free theory about which
such a perturbation takes place.
