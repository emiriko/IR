I derive the space-time distribution of energy and momentum deposited by a
fast parton traversing a perturbative quark-gluon plasma by considering the
fast parton as the source of an external color field interacting with the
medium. I include the medium's response to screen the fast parton's color field
by incorporating dielectric functions and compare to the unscreened result.
