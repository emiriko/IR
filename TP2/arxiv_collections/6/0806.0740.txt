In response to the interest to re-use Palapa B2R satellite nearing its End of
Life (EOL) time, an idea to incline the satellite orbit in order to cover a new
region has emerged in the recent years. As a prolate dual-spin vehicle, Palapa
B2R has to be stabilized against its internal energy dissipation effect. This
work is focused on analyzing the dynamics of the reusable satellite in its
inclined orbit. The study discusses in particular the stability of the prolate
dual-spin satellite under the effect of perturbed field of gravitation due to
the inclination of its elliptical orbit. Palapa B2R physical data was
substituted into the dual-spin's equation of motion. The coefficient of zonal
harmonics J2 was induced into the gravity-gradient moment term that affects the
satellite attitude. The satellite's motion and attitude were then simulated in
the perturbed gravitational field by J2, with the variation of orbit's
eccentricity and inclination. The analysis of the satellite dynamics and its
stability was conducted for designing a control system for the vehicle in its
new inclined orbit.
