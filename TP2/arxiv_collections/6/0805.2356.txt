This paper presents a comparative analysis of complexes made of one Rare Gas
(Rg) atom and molecular hydrogen, for all five stable Rg atoms. In particular,
the vibrational band origins have been calculated, as well as the structural
properties of the associated wavefunctions. The study is extended to cold
Rg-H$_2$ scattering. The molecular systems are studied variationally using a
very simple, yet effective, trial wavefunction. A large number of Potential
Energy Surfaces available from the literature is considered. A comparative
analysis shows that differences of up to two orders of magnitude exist for the
zero energy elastic cross sections of the five complexes. Corrections to the
model have also been considered, showing no significant effect.
