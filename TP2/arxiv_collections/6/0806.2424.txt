The aim of this paper is to explore and develop advanced spatial Bayesian
assessment methods and techniques for land use modeling. The paper provides a
comprehensive guide for assessing additional informational entropy value of
model predictions at the spatially explicit domain of knowledge, and proposes a
few alternative metrics and indicators for extracting higher-order information
dynamics from simulation tournaments. A seven-county study area in
South-Eastern Wisconsin (SEWI) has been used to simulate and assess the
accuracy of historical land use changes (1963-1990) using artificial neural
network simulations of the Land Transformation Model (LTM). The use of the
analysis and the performance of the metrics helps: (a) understand and learn how
well the model runs fits to different combinations of presence and absence of
transitions in a landscape, not simply how well the model fits our given data;
(b) derive (estimate) a theoretical accuracy that we would expect a model to
assess under the presence of incomplete information and measurement; (c)
understand the spatially explicit role and patterns of uncertainty in
simulations and model estimations, by comparing results across simulation runs;
(d) compare the significance or estimation contribution of transitional
presence and absence (change versus no change) to model performance, and the
contribution of the spatial drivers and variables to the explanatory value of
our model; and (e) compare measurements of informational uncertainty at
different scales of spatial resolution.
