We study reflected solutions of one-dimensional backward doubly stochastic
differential equations (BDSDEs in short). The "reflected" keeps the solution
above a given stochastic process. We get the uniqueness and existence by
penalization. For the existence of backward stochastic integral, our proof is
different from [KKPPQ] slightly. We also obtain a comparison theorem for
reflected BDSDEs.
