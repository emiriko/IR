We study pattern formation during tensile deformation of confined
viscoelastic layers. The use of a model system (PDMS with different degrees of
crosslinking) allows us to go continuously from a viscous liquid to an elastic
solid. We observe two distinct regimes of fingering instabilities: a regime
called "elastic" with interfacial crack propagation where the fingering
wavelength only scales with the film thickness, and a bulk regime called
"viscoelastic" where the fingering instability shows a Saffman-Taylor-like
behavior. We find good quantitative agreement with theory in both cases and
present a reduced parameter describing the transition between the two regimes
and allowing to predict the observed patterns over the whole range of
viscoelastic properties.
