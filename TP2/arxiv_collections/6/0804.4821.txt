The luminocity-distance -- redshift SN Ia data and the Cosmic Microwave
Background power spectrum are discussed in the context of the results and ideas
of the eminent Russian physicist-theorist N.A. Chernikov. His results include
the Boltzmann-Chernikov distribution in the kinetic theory of relativistic gas,
conformal invariant theory of scalar field, and the vacuum cosmological
creation of particles. We use these results for explanation of the origin of
matter content of the Universe in the modern relativistic physics.
