In a previous paper an asymptotic expansion for lambda_d in powers of 1/d was
developed. The results of computer computations for some terms in the
expansion, as well as various quantities associated to the expansion, are
herein presented. The computations (in integer arithmetic) are actually done
only for d=1, d=2, and d=3, but some results for arbitrary dimension follow
from the general structure of the theory. In particular we obtain the next term
in powers of 1/d, the 1/d^3 term in the asymptotic expansion for lambda_d, as
well as checking the correctness of the terms previously calculated by hand.
  For d=2 and d=3 a second expansion for lambda_d is defined and numerically
studied. Contrary to our hopes this second type of expansion appears not to be
convergent. There is not enough evidence to argue if the expansions for
lambda_d in powers of 1/d are convergent for either d=2 or d=3, but likely they
are not. (Certainly convergence, but at a very slow rate, remains an
interesting possibility in all our cases.)
