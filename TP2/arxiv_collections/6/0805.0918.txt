This special session on 3D TSV's will highlight some of the fabrication
processes and used technologies to create vias from the frontside of an active
circuit to its backside and potential implementation solutions to form complex
systems leveraging these novel possibilities. General techniques for via
formation are discussed as well as advanced integration solutions leveraging
the power of 3D TSV's.
