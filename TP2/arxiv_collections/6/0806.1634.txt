The limit cycle of the van der Pol oscillator, $\ddot{x}+ \epsilon (x^2-1)
\dot{x} + x =0$, is studied in the plane $(x,\dot{x})$ by applying the homotopy
analysis method. A recursive set of formulas that approximate the amplitude and
form of this limit cycle for the whole range of the parameter $\epsilon$ is
obtained. These formulas generate the amplitude with an error less than 0.1%.
To our knowledge, this is the first time where an analytical approximation of
the amplitude of the van der Pol limit cycle, with validity from the weakly up
to the strongly nonlinear regime, is given.
