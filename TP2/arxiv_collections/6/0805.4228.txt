We report on measurements of open charm production through both hadronic and
semi-leptonic decay channels in $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV heavy ion collision
at the STAR experiment at RHIC. We compare experimental results to theoretical
predictions from pQCD. The open charm $R_{AA}$ is also presented as evidence of
possible medium-induced energy loss.
