We determine the O(alpha_s^2) corrections to the partonic hemisphere soft
function relevant for thrust and jet mass distributions in e+e- annihilation in
the dijet limit. In this limit the distributions can be described by a
factorization theorem that sums large logarithmic terms and separates
perturbative from nonperturbative effects. Using the known O(alpha_s^2)
contributions of the jet functions and the hard coefficients in the
factorization theorem, constraints from renormalization group evolution and
nonabelian exponentiation, and results from numerical integration of
O(alpha_s^2) QCD matrix elements, the O(alpha_s^2) corrections of the soft
function can be determined unambiguously. We study the impact of subtracting
contributions related to the O(Lambda_QCD) renormalon in the partonic threshold
using the soft function gap proposed recently by Hoang and Stewart, and we
discuss the importance to account for the renormalization group evolution of
the gap parameter. As a byproduct we also present the previously unknown
next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic anomalous dimensions for the hard
coefficient that appear in the factorization theorem for the double
differential invariant mass distribution for heavy quark pair production at
high energies in the resonance region proven by Fleming etal.
