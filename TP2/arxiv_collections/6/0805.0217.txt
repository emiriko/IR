It is shown that the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen conclusion concerning the
`incompleteness' of Quantum Mechanics is invalidated by two logical errors in
their argument. If it were possible to perform the proposed gedanken experiment
it would, in fact, show that Quantum Mechanics is `complete' for the
observables discussed. Because, however, of the non square-integrable nature of
the wave function, the proposed experiment gives vanishing probabilities for
measurements performed in finite intervals of configuration or momentum space.
Hence no conclusion as to the `completeness', or otherwise, of Quantum
Mechanics can be drawn from the experiment.
