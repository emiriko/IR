A quantal system in an eigenstate, of operators with a continuous
nondegenerate eigenvalue spectrum, slowly transported round a circuit C by
varing parameters in its Hamiltonian, will acquire a generalized geometrical
phase factor. An explicit formula for a generalized geometrical phase is
derived in terms of the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian. As an illustration the
generalized geometrical phase is calculated for relativistic spinning particles
in slowly-changing electromagnetic fields. It is shown that the the S-matrix
and the usual scattering (with negligible reflexion) phase shift can be
interpreted as a generalized geometrical phase.
