We discover the unique, simple Lie Algebra of the Third Kind, or LATKe, that
stems from codimension 6 orbifold singularities and gives rise to a kind of
Yang-Mills theory which simultaneously is pure and contains matter. The root
space of the LATKe is 1-dimensional and its Dynkin diagram consists of one
point. The uniqueness of the LATKe is a vacuum selection mechanism.
