We derive the non-linear action of E8(8) on the constrained chiral superfield
in the light-cone superspace with eight complex Grassmann variables. We
construct (to lowest order in the coupling) the sixteen dynamical
supersymmetries which generate a Hamiltonian with E8(8) invariance in three
space-time dimensions, and show that it has only interactions with even powers
of the coupling constant.
