We study how dynamically breaking SQCD can be obtained on two intersecting
seven-branes in F-theory. In the mechanism which we present in this paper one
of the seven-branes is responsible for producing the low-energy gauge group and
the other one is for generating vector bundle moduli. The fundamental matter
charged under the gauge group is localized on the intersection. The mass of the
matter fields is controlled by the vector bundle moduli. The analysis of under
what conditions a sufficient number of the fundamental flavors becomes light
turns out to be equivalent to the analysis of non-perturbative superpotentials
for vector bundle moduli in Heterotic M-theory. We give an example in which we
present an explicit equation in the moduli space whose zero locus corresponds
to the fundamental fields becoming light. This allows us to provide a local
F-theory realization of massive ${\cal N}=1$, $SU(N_c)$ SQCD in the free
magnetic range which dynamically breaks supersymmetry.
