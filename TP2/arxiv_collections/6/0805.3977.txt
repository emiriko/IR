Based on the newly developed real-space spin-parallel pairing and
superconducting theory, we explore a simple explanation for the observed
checkerboard patterns in hole-doped Ca{2-x}Na{x}CuO{2}Cl{2} cuprate
superconductor. At a hole concentration x=1/8=0.125, the analytical results
show that there exists a phase competition between non-superconducting 4a*4b
(a=b) checkerboard phase and 8a*2c superconducting vortex phase, where a, b and
c are the lattice constants of the superconductor. At a lower hole
concentration x=1/16=0.0625, it is revealed that the metastable
4\sqrt{2}a*4\sqrt{2}a checkerboard phase can reorganize itself into a more
stable octahedron phase with the 4a*4a checkerboard symmetry.
