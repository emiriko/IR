We study the Doppler-broadened absorption of a weak monochromatic probe beam
in a thermal rubidium vapour cell on the D lines. A detailed model of the
susceptibility is developed which takes into account the absolute linestrengths
of the allowed electric dipole transitions and the motion of the atoms parallel
to the probe beam. All transitions from both hyperfine levels of the ground
term of both isotopes are incorporated. The absorption and refractive index as
a function of frequency are expressed in terms of the complementary error
function. The absolute absorption profiles are compared with experiment, and
are found to be in excellent agreement provided a sufficiently weak probe beam
with an intensity under one thousandth of the saturation intensity is used. The
importance of hyperfine pumping for open transitions is discussed in the
context of achieving the weak-probe limit. Theory and experiment show excellent
agreement, with an rms error better than 0.2% for the D2 line at 16.5 degrees
