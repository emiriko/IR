The suppression of spin-exchange relaxation in dense alkali-metal vapors
discovered in 1973 and governing modern atomic magnetometers is here
reformulated in terms of quantum measurement theory and the quantum Zeno
effect. This provides a new perspective of understanding decoherence in
spin-polarized atomic vapors.
