A novel design for vortex modulation of a passive chaotic micromixer, named a
circulation-disturbance micromixer (CDM), has been achieved and analyzed
experimentally and numerically. The systematic numerical analyses - topological
flow characteristics and particle tracking method - have been developed, that
enable visualization of detailed mixing patterns. To display the cross section
of mixing region of flows in our CDM, the biotin-streptavidin binding is
detected through the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) pair of
fluorescent proteins - R-phycoerythrin (RPE) and cross-linked allophycocyanin
(clAPC). We expect the diagnosis technique using FRET will be successfully
applied to biochemical analysis in microfluidic system.
