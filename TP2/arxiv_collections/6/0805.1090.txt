We prove conjectures on the relative entropy of entanglement (REE) for two
families of multipartite qubit states. Thus, analytic expressions of REE for
these families of states can be given. The first family of states are composed
of mixture of some permutation-invariant multi-qubit states. The results
generalized to multi-qudit states are also shown to hold. The second family of
states contain D\"ur's bound entangled states. Along the way, we have discussed
the relation of REE to two other measures: robustness of entanglement and
geometric measure of entanglement, slightly extending previous results.
