Recent work has shown that the low energy sector of certain quantum Hall
states is adiabatically connected to simple charge-density-wave patterns that
appear, e.g., when the system is deformed into a thin torus. Here it is shown
that the patterns emerging in this limit already determine the non-abelian
statistics of the $\nu=1$ Moore-Read state. Aside from the knowledge of these
patterns, the method only relies on the principle of adiabatic continuity, the
effectively noncommutative geometry in a strong magnetic field, and topological
as well as locality arguments.
