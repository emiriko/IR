The Bloch wavefunction leads either to mathematically impossible consequences
or suggests that the ground state energy is a function of size and shape when
the geometry of large crystals is considered in detail. It is incompatible with
the assumption underlying the Born-von Karman periodic boundary condition. The
source of the difficulty is the incorrect dependence of the Bloch wavefunction
on the wavenumber index k. The mathematically impossible consequences can be
overcome if the periodic part of the electron wavefunction is represented as
un(r), which is dependent only on the band index, n, and is independent of the
wavenumber index k. This correct form of the wavefunction is consistent with
the Bloch theorem and with all other properties of Bloch wavefunctions. The
correct form is also consistent with the Born-von Karman periodic boundary
condition. The correct form of the electronic wavefunction in a periodic solid
has profound consequences. It simplifies the calculation of electronic
structure as only one wavefunction per band, un(r), needs to be evaluated. It
brings about a conceptual unification between the band picture favored by
physicists and the bond picture favored by chemists. The correct form of the
electron wavefunction will simplify the understanding of many phenomena
involving valence electrons.
