We show that if $\Lambda$ is a codimension-one hyperbolic attractor for a
$C^r$ diffeomorphism $f$, where $2\leq r\leq \infty$, and $f$ is not Anosov,
then there is a neighborhood $\mathcal{U}$ of $f$ in $\mathrm{Diff}^r(M)$ and
an open and dense set $\mathcal{V}$ of $\mathcal{U}$ such that any
$g\in\mathcal{V}$ has a trivial centralizer on the basin of attraction for
$\Lambda$.
