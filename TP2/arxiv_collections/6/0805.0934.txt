This paper presents a new electrostatic MEMS (MicroElectroMechanical System)
based on a single high reliability totally free flexible membrane. Using four
electrodes, this structure enables four states which allowed large deflections
(4$\mu$m) with low actuation voltage (7,5V). This design presents also a good
contact force and improve the restoring force of the structure. As an example
of application, a Single Pole Double Throw (SPDT) for 24GHz applications, based
on this design, has been simulated.
