Recently B-factories have published new results on the $B \to K \eta \gamma$
decays being inspired by the theoretical suggestion to search for new physics
in $B \to P_1 P_2 \gamma$ decays. Using heavy meson chiral perturbation theory
we find mechanism which governs the amplitude in parts of the Dalitz plot where
either $K$ or $\eta$ mesons are soft. The dominant contributions in these cases
are coming from the nonresonant decay modes. We discuss also $B \to K \eta'
\gamma$ Dalitz plot. Our partially integrated rates are in agreement with the
experimental findings.
