Recent analyses have shown that a sequential fourth generation can be
consistent with precision electroweak data. We consider the possibility that
the new generation could be a mirror generation with $V+A$ rather than $V-A$
interactions. Specifically we consider an extension of the minimal
supersymmetric standard model with a light mirror generation (mirMSSM) .
Implications of this extension are explored. One consequence is an enhancement
of the tau neutrino magnetic moment by several orders of magnitude consistent
with the current limits on the magnetic moment of the tau. The masses of the
mirror generation arise due to electroweak symmetry breaking, and if a mirror
generation exists its mass spectrum must lye below a TeV, and thus should be
discovered at the LHC. Mirror particles and mirror sparticles produce many
characteristic signatures which should be detectable at the LHC. Heavy higgs
boson decays into mirror particles and an analysis of the forward-backward
asymmetries can distinguish a mirror generation from a sequential fourth
generation. The validity of the model can thus be tested at the LHC. A model of
the type discussed here could arise from a more unified structure such as grand
unification or strings where a mirror generation escapes the survival
hypothesis, i.e., a generation and a mirror generation do not tie up to acquire
a mass of size $M_{GUT}$ or $M_{string}$ due to a symmetry, and thus remain
massless down to the electroweak scale.
