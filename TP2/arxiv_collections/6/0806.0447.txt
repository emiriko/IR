Theoretical calculation of transverse momentum($p_T$) distribution of thermal
photons and dileptons originating from ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions
suffer from several uncertainties since the evaluation of these spectra needs
various inputs which are not yet known unambiguously. In the present work the
ratio of the $p_T$ spectra of thermal photons to lepton pairs has been
evaluated and it is shown that the ratio is insensitive to some of these
parameters.
