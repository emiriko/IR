Every finite dimensional real representation of a compact real semisimple Lie
algebra determines a metric 2-step nilpotent Lie algebra and a corresponding
simply connected metric 2-step nilpotent Lie group N. We study the differential
geometry of N using representation theory of the complexified complex
semisimple Lie algebra.
