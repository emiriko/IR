The elastic neutron scattering experiments were carried out on the solid
solutions CeRh_{1-x}Co_xIn_5 to clarify the nature of the antiferromagnetic
(AF) state in the vicinity of the quantum critical point (QCP): x_c ~0.8. The
incommensurate AF order with the wave vector of q_h=(1/2,1/2,~0.3) observed in
pure CeRhIn_5 is weakly suppressed upon doping with Co, and a commensurate
q_c=(1/2,1/2,1/2) and an incommensurate q_1=(1/2,1/2,~0.42) AF structures
evolve at intermediate Co concentrations. These AF orders are enhanced at
x=0.7, and furthermore the q_h AF order vanishes. These results suggest that
the AF correlations with the q_c and q_1 modulations are significantly enhanced
in the intermediate x range, and may be connected with the evolution of the
superconductivity observed above x~0.3.
