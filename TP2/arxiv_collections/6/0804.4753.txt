In this paper, a wavelet-based iterative learning control (WILC) scheme with
Fuzzy PD feedback is presented for a pneumatic control system with nonsmooth
nonlinearities and uncertain parameters. The wavelet transform is employed to
extract the learnable dynamics from measured output signal before it can be
used to update the control profile. The wavelet transform is adopted to
decompose the original signal into many low-resolution signals that contain the
learnable and unlearnable parts. The desired control profile is then compared
with the learnable part of the transformed signal. Thus, the effects from
unlearnable dynamics on the controlled system can be attenuated by a Fuzzy PD
feedback controller. As for the rules of Fuzzy PD controller in the feedback
loop, a genetic algorithm (GA) is employed to search for the inference rules of
optimization. A proportional-valve controlled pneumatic cylinder actuator
system is used as the control target for simulation. Simulation results have
shown a much-improved positiontracking performance.
