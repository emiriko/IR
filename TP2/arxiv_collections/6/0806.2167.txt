The ability to inject dopant atoms with high spatial resolution, flexibility
in dopant species and high single ion detection fidelity opens opportunities
for the study of dopant fluctuation effects and the development of devices in
which function is based on the manipulation of quantum states in single atoms,
such as proposed quantum computers. We describe a single atom injector, in
which the imaging and alignment capabilities of a scanning force microscope
(SFM) are integrated with ion beams from a series of ion sources and with
sensitive detection of current transients induced by incident ions. Ion beams
are collimated by a small hole in the SFM tip and current changes induced by
single ion impacts in transistor channels enable reliable detection of single
ion hits. We discuss resolution limiting factors in ion placement and
processing and paths to single atom (and color center) array formation for
systematic testing of quantum computer architectures in silicon and diamond.
