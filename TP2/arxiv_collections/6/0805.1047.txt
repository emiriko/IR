Simulations are performed to investigate turbulent properties of nonlinearly
interacting two-dimensional (2D) magnetic electron drift vortex (MEDV) modes in
a nonuniform unmagnetized plasma. The relevant nonlinear equations governing
the dynamics of the MEDV modes are the wave magnetic field and electron
temperature perturbations in the presence of the equilibrium density and
temperature gradients. The important nonlinearities come from the advection of
the electron fluid velocity perturbation and the electron temperature, as well
as from the nonlinear electron Lorentz force. Computer simulations of the
governing equations for the nonlinear MEDV modes reveal the generation of
streamer-like electron flows, such that the corresponding gradients in the
direction of the inhomogeneities tend to flatten out. By contrast, the
gradients in an orthogonal direction vary rapidly. Consequently, the inertial
range energy spectrum in decaying MEDV mode turbulence exhibits a much steeper
anisotropic spectral index. The magnetic structures in the MEDV mode turbulence
produce nonthermal electron transport in our nonuniform plasma.
