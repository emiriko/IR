We propose a super-resolution quantum lithography scheme based on coherent
population trapping in lambda-type atoms coupled to temporally-cascaded
standing-wave driving fields. By realizing effective multiplication of optical
intensity profiles on an atomic state density distribution, the scheme enables
an arbitrarily high degree of resolution enhancement without modifying the
atomic level structure of the photographic medium or the light source
configuration. It is also shown that the visibility of the super-resolution
patterns is preserved under a significant atomic state decoherence rate.
