This paper presents a reduced-order model for the Reynolds equation for
deformable structure and large displacements. It is based on the model
established in [11] which is piece-wise linearized using two different methods.
The advantages and drawbacks of each method are pointed out. The pull-in time
of a microswitch is determined and compared to experimental and other
simulation data.
