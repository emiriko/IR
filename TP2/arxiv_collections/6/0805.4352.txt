Resonant soft X-ray scattering with photon energies near the O K and the Cu
L3 edges was used to study charge ordering in the system
La_{1.8-x}Eu_{0.2}Sr_xCuO_4 as a function of temperature for x = 0.125 and
0.15. From the superstructure diffraction intensities a charge ordering with a
doping dependent wave vector is derived which is in this system well below the
transition temperature of the low-temperature tetragonal phase but well above
the onset of spin ordering. This indicates that charge ordering is the primary
driving force for the formation of stripe-like phases in two-dimensional doped
cuprates. Analysis of the lineshape of the scattered intensity as a function of
photon energy yields evidence for a high hole concentration in the stripes.
