We present the current status of searches for supersymmetry performed at the
Tevatron accelerator at Fermilab by the CDF and D0 collaborations using
luminosity of up to 2.1 fb-1. We focus on searches for charginos, neutralinos,
squarks, gluinos and sneutrinos in several supersymmetric scenarios. No
supersymmetric signal is detected and limits on the masses and production cross
sections for the supersymmetric particles are set.
