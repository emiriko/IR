Hard-scattering of point-like constituents (or partons) in p-p collisions was
discovered at the CERN-ISR in 1972 by measurements utilizing inclusive single
or pairs of hadrons with large transverse momentum ($p_T$).
  It was generally assumed following a seminal paper by Feynman, Field and Fox
(FFF) (and much discussed in a talk that I gave at the 1979 Rencontres de
Moriond) that ``everything you wanted to know about hard-scattering and jets''
could be measured by these methods. Recently, we found in PHENIX that the
$p_{T_a}$ distribution of away side hadrons from a single particle trigger
[with $p_{T_t}$] which is a leading fragment of the trigger jet, could not be
used to measure the fragmentation function of the away jet as originally
claimed by FFF. A new formula was derived which both exhibits scaling in the
variable $x_E\sim p_{T_a}/p_{T_t}$ (a hot topic in 1979) and relates $x_E$,
$\sim$ the ratio of the transverse momenta of the measured particles, to
$\hat{x}_h=\hat{p}_{T_a}/\hat{p}_{T_t}$, the ratio of the transverse momenta of
the away-side to trigger-side jets. Tests of the validity of the formula and
applications to Au+Au central collisions at RHIC (where jets can not be
reconstructed) are discussed.
