We study a class of piecewise linear solutions to the inviscid Burgers
equation driven by a linear forcing term. Inspired by the analogy with peakons,
we think of these solutions as being made up of solitons situated at the
breakpoints. We derive and solve ODEs governing the soliton dynamics, first for
continuous solutions, and then for more general shock wave solutions with
discontinuities. We show that triple collisions of solitons cannot take place
for continuous solutions, but give an example of a triple collision in the
presence of a shock.
