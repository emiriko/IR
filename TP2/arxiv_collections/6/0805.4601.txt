Intrigued by a recent Belle result for a large direct CP asymmetry in $B^0\to
D^+D^-$, we study the effects of a $\bar b\to \bar uu\bar d$ quark transition
by combining the asymmetry information with rates and asymmetries in
isospin-related decays. Arguing for a hierarchy among several contributions to
these decays, including an exchange amplitude which we estimate, we present
tests for factorization of the leading terms, and obtain an upper bound on the
ratio of $\bar b\to \bar uu\bar d$ and $\bar b\to \bar cc\bar d$ amplitudes. We
prove an approximate $\Delta I=1/2$ amplitude relation for $B\to D\bar D$, and
an approximate equality between CP asymmetries in $B^0\to D^+D^-$ and $B^+\to
D^+\bar D^0$. Violations of these relations by Belle measurements, at
$1.8\sigma$ and $3.6\sigma$ respectively, if confirmed, would indicate a
possible New Physics contribution in $\bar b\to \bar uu\bar d$. Applying flavor
SU(3), we extend this study to a total of ten processes including $\Delta S=0$
decays involving final $D_s$ and initial $B_s$ mesons, and $\Delta S=1$ decays
of $B$ and $B_s$ mesons into pairs of charmed pseudoscalar mesons. The decays
$B_s\to D\bar D$ provide useful information about a small exchange amplitude,
responsible for a decay rate difference between $B^+\to D^+\bar D^0$ and
$B^0\to D^+D^-$. A method for determining the weak phase $\gamma$, based on CP
asymmetries in $B^0(t)\to D^+D^-$ and the decay rate for $B_s\to D^+_sD^-_s$ or
$B^{+(0)}\to D^+_s\bar D^0 (D^-)$, is shown to involve high sensitivity to
SU(3) breaking.
