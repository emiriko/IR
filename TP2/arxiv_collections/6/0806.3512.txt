The idea of isotropic resonant magnetism in the visible range of frequencies
known from precedent publications is developed having in mind achievements of
the modern chemistry. Plasmonic colloidal nanoparticles covering a silica core
form a cluster with resonant and isotropic magnetic response. Two approximate
models giving the qualitative mutual agreement are used to evaluate the
magnetic polarizability of the cluster. It is shown that the electrostatic
interaction of nanocolloids decreases the resonant frequency of an individual
complex magnetic scatterer (nanocluster) compared to the previously studied
variant of a planar circular nanocluster with same size. This means the
reduction of the optical size of nanoclusters that presumably allows one to
avoid strong spatial dispersion within the frequency range of the negative
permeability.
