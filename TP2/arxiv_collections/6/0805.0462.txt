The search for variation of the fundamental constants such as the fine
structure constant $\alpha$ ($\alpha=e^2/\hbar c$) and the ratios of
fundamental masses (e.g., electron to proton mass ratio $\mu=m_e/m_p$) is
reviewed. Strong emphasis is given to establishing the relationships between
the change in the measured frequencies of atomic, molecular or nuclear
transitions and the corresponding change of the fundamental constants.
Transitions in which the sensitivity of the frequency change to the variation
of the fine structure constant is strongly enhanced are discussed and most
recent experimental results are presented. Most attention is given to the use
of atomic, molecular and nuclear transitions in the study of quasar absorption
spectra and in atomic clock experiments.
