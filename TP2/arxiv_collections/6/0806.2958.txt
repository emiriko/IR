The propagation of azimuthally symmetric guided waves in multiwalled carbon
nanotubes (MWCNTs) was analyzed theoretically in the mid-infrared and the
visible regimes. The MWCNTs were modeled as ensembles of concentric,
cylindrical, conducting shells. Slightly attenuated guided waves and antenna
resonances due to the edge effect exist for not-too-thick MWCNTs in the far-
and mid-infrared regimes. Interband transitions hinder the propagation of
guided waves and have a deleterious effect on the performance of a
finite-length MWCNT as an antenna. Propagation of surface-plasmon waves along
an MWCNT with a gold core was also analyzed. In the near-infrared and the
visible regimes, the shells behave effectively as lossy dielectrics suppressing
surface-plasmon-wave propagation along the gold core.
