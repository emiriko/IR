Recent experiments in underdoped hole-doped cuprates have shown the presence
of two energy scales in the Raman spectrum in the superconducting state. This
feature has a natural explanation in some models in which pseudogap and
superconductivity compete. In electron-doped cuprates antiferromagnetic
correlations are believed to survive in the superconducting state, and to
produce a pseudogap above the critical temperature. Contrary to hole-doped
systems, in electron-doped compounds only one energy scale appear since the
pair breaking Raman intensity peaks in both B$_{1g}$ (antinodal) and B$_{2g}$
(nodal) channels at a frequency of a few meV, typical of the superconducting
order parameter. In this paper we analyze the different effect in the Raman
spectrum of the competition between pseudogap and superconductivity in electron
and hole-doped cuprates. The difference in energy scales in both systems is
explained in terms of the different truncation of the Fermi surface induced by
the pseudogap. For electron-doped cuprates we also analyze the spectrum with
antiferromagnetism and a non-monotonic superconducting order parameter.
