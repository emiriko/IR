We consider the branching ratio and the CP asymmetries in B to f_0(980)K_S
decay to the end of determining the deviation of the time-dependent CP
asymmetry from sin(2 beta) arising from Standard Model physics. We obtain Delta
S_{f_0 K_S} within the context of the QCD factorization framework for the B to
f_0(980)K_S decay amplitudes assuming the f_0(980) is a q\bar{q} state and
employing a random scan over the theoretical parameter space to assess the
possible range in Delta S_{f_0 K_S}. Imposing the value of the experimental
branching ratio within 1 sigma and 3 sigma, respectively, of its central value
as a constraint, we find the range of Delta S_{f_0 K_S} to be [0.018, 0.033]
for a scan in which the parameters are allowed to vary within 1 sigma of their
central values and the range [-0.019, 0.064] for a scan in which the parameters
vary within 3 sigma of their central values.
