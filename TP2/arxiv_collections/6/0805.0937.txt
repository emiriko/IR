We present and discuss the fabrication process and the performance of a
flexible micro thermoelectric generator with electroplated Bi2Te3 thermocouples
in a SU-8 mold. Demonstrator devices generate 278uWcm-2 at dTmeas=40K across
the experimental set up. Based on model calculations, a temperature difference
of dTG=21.4K across the generator is assumed. Due to the flexible design and
the chosen generator materials, the performance stays high even for curved
contact surfaces. The measurement results correlate well with the model based
design optimization predictions.
