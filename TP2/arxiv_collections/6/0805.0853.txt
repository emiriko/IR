We study the influence of superconducting correlations on the electronic
specific heat in a diffusive superconductor-normal metal-superconductor
Josephson junction. We present a description of this system in the framework of
the diffusive-limit Green's function theory, taking into account finite
temperatures, phase difference as well as junction parameters. We find that
proximity effect may lead to a substantial deviation of the specific heat as
compared to that in the normal state, and that it can be largely tuned in
magnitude by changing the phase difference between the superconductors. A
measurement setup to confirm these predictions is also suggested.
