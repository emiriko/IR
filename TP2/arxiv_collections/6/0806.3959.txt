In this paper we have constructed a Hilbert space of states solving the
initial value constraints of GR in the instanton representation of Plebanski
gravity. The states are labelled by two free functions of position constructed
from the eigenvalues of the CDJ matrix. This comprises the physical degrees of
freedom of GR with a semiclassical limit corresponding to spacetimes of Petrov
Type I, D and O. The Hamiltonian constraint in this representation is a
hypergeometric differential equation on the states, for which we have provided
a closed form solution. Additionally, we have clarified the role of the Kodama
state within this Hilbert space structure, which provides a resolution to the
issue of its normalizability raised by various authors.
