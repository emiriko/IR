We present a nanomechanical device design to be used in a non-volatile
mechanical memory point. The structure is composed of a suspended slender
nanowire (width : 100nm, thickness 430nm length : 8 to 30$\mu$m) clamped at its
both ends. Electrodes are placed on each sides of the nanowire and are used to
actuate the structure (writing, erasing) and to measure the position through a
capactive bridge (reading). The structure is patterned by electron beam
lithography on a pre-stressed thermally grown silicon dioxide layer. When later
released, the stressed material relaxes and the beam buckles in a position of
lower energy. Such symmetric beams, called Euler beams, show two stable
deformed positions thus form a bistable structure. This paper will present the
fabrication, simulation and mechanical and electrical actuation of an in plane
bistable nanowire. Final paper will include a section on FEM simulations.
