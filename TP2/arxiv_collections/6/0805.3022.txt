We extend a result by Ojima on spontaneous symmetry breaking of Lorentz
boosts in thermal (KMS) states and show that it is in fact a special case in a
more general class of examples of spontaneous symmetry breaking of Lorentz
symmetry in relativistic many-body systems. Furthermore we analyse the nature
of the corresponding Goldstone phenomenon and the type of Goldstone excitations
(provided they have particle character).
