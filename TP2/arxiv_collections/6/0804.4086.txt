Two dimensional layers of graphene are currently drawing a great attention in
fundamental and applied nanoscience. Graphene consists of interconnected
hexagons of carbon atoms as in graphite. This article presents for the first
time the structures of graphene at the atomic level and shows how it differs
from that of benzene, due to the difference in the double bond and resonance
bond based radii of carbon. The carbon atom of an aliphatic compound such as
methane has a longer covalent single bond radius as in diamond. All the atomic
structures presented here have been drawn to scale.
