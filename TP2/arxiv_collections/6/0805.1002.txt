We study the intrinsic computational power of correlations exploited in
measurement-based quantum computation. By defining a general framework the
meaning of the computational power of correlations is made precise. This leads
to a notion of resource states for measurement-based \textit{classical}
computation. Surprisingly, the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger and
Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt problems emerge as optimal examples. Our work
exposes an intriguing relationship between the violation of local realistic
models and the computational power of entangled resource states.
