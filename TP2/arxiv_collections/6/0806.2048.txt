A new method of approximation scheme with potential application to a general
interacting quantum system is presented. The method is non-perturbative, self-
consistent, systematically improvable and uniformly applicable for arbitrary
strength of interaction. It thus overcomes the various limitations of the
exsting methods such as the perturbation theory, the variational method, the
WKBJ method and other approximation schemes. The current method has been
successfully applied to a variety of interacting systems including the
anharmonic/ double-well oscillators (with quartic-, sextic- and octic
couplings) and the scalar field theory with quartic-coupling in the symmetric
phase. The method yields important insight in to the structure and stability of
the interacting-vacuum of the theory. The results are in good agreement with
the exact predictions of supersymmetry where ever applicable. Possible further
applications in the areas of quantum statistics, finite temperature field
theory, condensed matter physics etc are also discussed.
