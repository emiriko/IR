Excitonic effects in optical spectra and electron-hole pair excitations are
described by solutions of the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) that accounts for
the Coulomb interaction of excited electron-hole pairs. Although for the
computation of excitonic optical spectra in an extended frequency range
efficient methods are available, the determination and analysis of individual
exciton states still requires the diagonalization of the electron-hole
Hamiltonian $\hat{H}$. We present a numerically efficient approach for the
calculation of exciton states with quadratically scaling complexity, which
significantly diminishes the computational costs compared to the commonly used
cubically scaling direct-diagonalization schemes. The accuracy and performance
of this approach is demonstrated by solving the BSE numerically for the
Wannier-Mott two-band model in {\bf k} space and the semiconductors MgO and
InN. For the convergence with respect to the $\vk$-point sampling a general
trend is identified, which can be used to extrapolate converged results for the
binding energies of the lowest bound states.
