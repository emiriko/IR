We study the glueball spectrum in the supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric
4D non-commutative dipole gauge theory from the holographic description. We
adopt the semiclassical WKB approximation to solve the dilaton and
antisymmetric tensor field equations on the dual supergravity backgrounds to
find the analytic formula of the spectrum of $0^{++}$ and $1^{--}$ glueballs,
respectively. In the supersymmetric theory we see that the dipole length plays
the intrinsic scale which reflects the discrete spectrum therein. In the
non-supersymmetric theory, the temperature (or the radius of compactification)
in there will now play the intrinsic scale and we see that the dipole has an
effect to produce attractive force between the gluons within the glueball. We
also study the confining force between the quarks within the baryon via strings
that hang into the dipole deformed AdS geometry and see that the dipole could
also produce an attractive force between the quarks. In particular, we find
that the baryon has two phases in which a big baryon is dual to the static
string while a small baryon is described by a moving dual string .
