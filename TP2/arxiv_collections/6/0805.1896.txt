In this review chapter we focus on the many-body dynamics of cold polar
molecules in the strongly interacting regime. In particular, we discuss a
toolbox for engineering many-body Hamiltonians based on the manipulation of the
electric dipole moments of the molecules, and thus of molecular interactions,
using external static and microwave fields. This forms the basis for the
realization of novel quantum phases in these systems.
