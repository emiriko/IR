To achieve propulsion at low Reynolds number, a swimmer must deform in a way
that is not invariant under time-reversal symmetry; this result is known as the
scallop theorem. We show here that there is no many-scallop theorem. We
demonstrate that two active particles undergoing reciprocal deformations can
swim collectively; moreover, polar particles also experience effective
long-range interactions. These results are derived for a minimal dimers model,
and generalized to more complex geometries on the basis of symmetry and scaling
arguments. We explain how such cooperative locomotion can be realized
experimentally by shaking a collection of soft particles with a homogeneous
external field.
