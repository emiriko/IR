Modelling MEMS involves a variety of software tools that deal with the
analysis of complex geometrical structures and the assessment of various
interactions among different energy domains and components. Moreover, the MEMS
market is growing very fast, but surprisingly, there is a paucity of modelling
and simulation methodology for precise performance verification of MEMS
products in the nonlinear regime. For that reason, an efficient and rapid
modelling approach is proposed that meets the linear and nonlinear dynamic
behaviour of MEMS systems.
