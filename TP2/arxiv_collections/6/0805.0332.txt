We study the "entanglement spectrum" (a presentation of the Schmidt
decomposition analogous to a set of "energy levels") of a many-body state, and
compare the Moore-Read model wavefunction for the $\nu$ = 5/2 fractional
quantum Hall state with a generic 5/2 state obtained by finite-size
diagonalization of the second-Landau-level-projected Coulomb interactions.
Their spectra share a common "gapless" structure, related to conformal field
theory. In the model state, these are the \textit{only} levels, while in the
"generic" case, they are separated from the rest of the spectrum by a clear
"entanglement gap", which appears to remain finite in the thermodynamic limit.
We propose that the low-lying entanglement spectrum can be used as a
"fingerprint" to identify topological order.
