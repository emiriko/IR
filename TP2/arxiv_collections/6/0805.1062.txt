The newly discovered superconductor La(O,F)FeAs (Tc = 26 K) was investigated
using the neutron scattering technique. No spin-density-wave (SDW) order was
observed in the normal state nor in the superconducting state, both with and
without an applied magnetic field of 9 T, consistent with the proposal that SDW
and superconductivity are competing in the laminar materials. While our
inelastic measurements offer no constraints on the spin dynamic response from
d-wave pairing, an upper limit for the magnetic resonance peak predicted from
an extended s-wave pairing mechanism is provided. Our measurements also support
the energy scale of the calculated phonon spectrum which is used in
electron-phonon coupling theory, and fails to produce the high observed Tc.
