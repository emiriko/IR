Dipion transitions of $\Upsilon (nS)$ with $n=5, n'=1,2,3$ are studied using
the Field Correlator Method, applied previously to dipion transitions with
$n=2,3,4$ The only two parameters of effective Lagrangian were fixed in that
earlier study, and total widths $\Gamma_{\pi\pi} (5, n')$ as well as pionless
decay widths $\Gamma_{BB} (5S), \Gamma_{BB^*} (5S), \Gamma_{B^*B^*}(5S)$ and
$\Gamma_{KK} (5, n')$ were calculated and are in a reasonable agreement with
experiment. The experimental $\pi\pi$ spectra for $(5,1)$ and (5,2) transitions
are well reproduced taking into account FSI in the $\pi\pi$.
