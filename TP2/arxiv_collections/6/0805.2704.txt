This paper presents the basics of the QQ-onia package, a software based upon
the Numerov method which can be used to solve the Schrodinger radial equation
using a suitable potential V(r) for the heavy quarkonium system. This package
also allows the analysis of relevant properties of those resonances such as the
wave functions at the origin, their corresponding derivatives for l \neq 0
states, typical heavy quark velocities, and mean square radii. Besides, it
includes a tool to analize the spin-dependent contributions to the heavy
quarkonia spectrum, providing the hyperfine splittings, as well as the nPJ
energy levels. Finally, a simple software implemented in QQ-onia to compute E1
transition rates is presented.
