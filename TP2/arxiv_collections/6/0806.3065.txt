This thesis presents a collection of different researches on non-standard
optics in view of enhancing the performances of the Advanced Gravitational
waves interferometric detectors, where the thermal noise of the test masses is
expected to be a limiting factor for their sensitivity.
  We provide a quantitative analysis of the impact of non-Gaussian beams on
different kinds of thermal noises. We developed the theory of mesa beam, in
view of a future implementation in advanced GW interferometers of the mesa beam
idea, focusing on the analytical derivation of the quantities (i.e. beam width,
divergence, propagation factor), which are chosen as ISO standard reference
parameters for the characterization of an optical beam. We also analytically
proved a new duality relation between optical cavities with non-spherical
mirrors. The interest of the GW community in this new beam technology led us to
the construction and testing of a prototype mesa beam Fabry-Perot cavity with
Mexican-hat mirror. Part of the work of this thesis was devoted to the
development of new simulation programs of optical systems. These programs
provided the theoretical expected behaviour of our experiment, in particular
cavity modes structure and misalignments sensitivity to be confronted with the
experimental results. We also explored another complementary way of reducing
the mirror thermal noise, beside the beam shaping, that is the multi-layered
coating thickness optimization. We show it to be effective in reducing the
coating noise and explore the possible implications for GW interferometers in
terms of sensitivity. During this analysis we developed an independent model
for the coating effective elastic parameters, which is based on the well
understood subject of homogenization theory.
