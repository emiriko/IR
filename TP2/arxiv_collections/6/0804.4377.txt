The nanostructure and the carbon distribution in a pearlitic steel processed
by torsion under high pressure was investigated by three-dimensional atom
probe. In the early stage of deformation (shear strain of 62),
off-stoichiometry cementite was analysed close to interphase boundaries and a
strong segregation of carbon atoms along dislocation cell boundaries was
observed in the ferrite. At a shear strain of 300, only few nanoscaled
off-stoichiometry cementite particles remain and a nanoscaled equiaxed grain
structure with a grain size of about 20 nm was revealed. 3D-AP data clearly
point out a strong segregation of carbon atoms along grain boundaries. The
influence of this carbon atom segregation on the nanostructure formation is
discussed and a scenario accounting for the nanocrystallisation during severe
plastic deformation is proposed.
