We present a picture of hard processes in a hot plasma in terms of the hard
scale part of the process, where perturbative QCD should be applicable, and the
soft scale part of the process, where we look to the AdS/CFT correspondence for
guidance to possible strong effective coupling phenomena. In particular we
estimate $\hat{q}$, the transport coefficient, supposing that at soft scales
partons in the plasma all cascade to small-$x$-values as indicated by strong
coupling SYM theory.
