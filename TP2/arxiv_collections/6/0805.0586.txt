The purpose of this work is to understand the effect of an external
environment on the adiabatic dynamics of a quantum critical system. By means of
scaling arguments we derive a general expression for the density of excitations
produced in the quench as a function of its velocity and of the temperature of
the bath. We corroborate the scaling analysis by explicitly solving the case of
a one-dimensional quantum Ising model coupled to an Ohmic bath.
