It is well known that the Fano scheme of lines on a cubic 4-fold is a
symplectic variety. We generalize this fact by constructing a closed p-form
with p=2n-4 on the Fano scheme of lines on a (2n-2)-dimensional hypersurface Y
of degree n. We provide several definitions of this form - via the Abel-Jacobi
map, via Hochschild homology, and via the linkage class, and compute it
explicitly for n = 4. In the special case of a Pfaffian hypersurface Y we show
that the Fano scheme is birational to a certain moduli space of sheaves on a
p-dimensional Calabi--Yau variety X arising naturally in the context of
homological projective duality, and that the constructed form is induced by the
holomorphic volume form on X. This remains true for a general non Pfaffian
hypersurface but the dual Calabi-Yau becomes non commutative.
