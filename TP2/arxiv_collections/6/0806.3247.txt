In models of electroweak symmetry breaking in which the SM fermions get their
masses by mixing with composite states, it is natural to expect the top quark
to show properties of compositeness. We study the phenomenological viability of
having a mostly composite top. The strongest constraints are shown to mainly
come from one-loop contributions to the T-parameter. Nevertheless, the presence
of light custodial partners weakens these bounds, allowing in certain cases for
a high degree of top compositeness. We find regions in the parameter space in
which the T-parameter receives moderate positive contributions, favoring the
electroweak fit of this type of models. We also study the implications of
having a composite top at the LHC, focusing on the process pp-> t\bar t t\bar t
(b\bar b) whose cross-section is enhanced at high-energies.
