We analyze pressure effects on stripe states within a selfconsistent
Hartree-Fock calculation for a model of a striped nickelates. The results show
a transition induced by high pressure and predict possible new spin states. We
describe characteristics in the phonon excitations at the predicted transition,
based on a real-space random phase approximation.
