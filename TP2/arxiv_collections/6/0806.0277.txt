Undoped graphene is semi-metallic and thus not suitable for many electronic
and optoelectronic applications requiring gapped semiconductor materials.
However, a periodic array of holes (antidot lattice) renders graphene
semiconducting with a controllable band gap. Using atomistic modelling, we
demonstrate that this artificial nanomaterial is a dipole-allowed direct gap
semiconductor with a very pronounced optical absorption edge. Hence, optical
infrared spectroscopy should be an ideal probe of the electronic structure. To
address realistic experimental situations, we include effects due to disorder
and the presence of a substrate in the analysis.
