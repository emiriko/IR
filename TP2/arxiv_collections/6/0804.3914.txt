The approach to reasoning about structural operational semantics style
specifications supported by the Abella system is discussed. This approach uses
lambda tree syntax to treat object language binding and encodes binding related
properties in generic judgments. Further, object language specifications are
embedded directly into the reasoning framework through recursive definitions.
The treatment of binding via generic judgments implicitly enforces distinctness
and atomicity in the names used for bound variables. These properties must,
however, be made explicit in reasoning tasks. This objective can be achieved by
allowing recursive definitions to also specify generic properties of atomic
predicates. The utility of these various logical features in the Abella system
is demonstrated through actual reasoning tasks. Brief comparisons with a few
other logic based approaches are also made.
