We propose a time-domain "interferometer" based on ultracold Bose atoms
loaded on a double well potential. By the adiabatic Rosen-Zener process, the
barrier between two wells is ramped down slowly, held for a while, then ramped
back. Starting with a coherent state of double well system, the final
occupations on one well show interesting interference fringes in the
time-domain. The fringe pattern is sensitive to the initial state, the
interatomic interaction, and the external forces such as gravity which can
change the shape of the double well. In this sense, this interferometric scheme
has the potentials for precision measurements with ultracold atoms. The
underlying mechanism is revealed and possible applications are discussed.
