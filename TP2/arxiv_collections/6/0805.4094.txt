Interaction of traveling wave of classic light with 1D-chain of coupled
quantum dots (QDs) in strong coupling regime has been theoretically considered.
The effect of space propagation of Rabi oscillations in the form of traveling
waves and wave packets has been predicted. Physical interpretation of the
effect has been given, principles of its experimental observation are
discussed.
