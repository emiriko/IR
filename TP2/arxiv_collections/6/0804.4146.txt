In this paper we report on the legacy of Higgs boson searches at LEP.
Specifically, the results of the statistical combination of the searches
carried out by the ALEPH, DELPHI, L3 and OPAL experiments are presented. In the
search for the Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson, a signal with mh<114.4 GeV/c^2
has been excluded at the 95% confidence level (CL) or higher. The LEP
collaborations also carried out extensive searches for Higgs particles
predicted by many scenarios beyond the Standard Model. Here we can only report
on a very small fraction of these searches and refer the reader to the complete
list of LEP-combined search results.
