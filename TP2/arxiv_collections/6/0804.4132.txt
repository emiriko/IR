We present a comprehensive analysis of hadron production in e+e- collisions
at different center-of-mass energies in the framework of the statistical model
of the hadron resonance gas. The model is formulated in the canonical ensemble
with exact conservation of all relevant quantum numbers. The parameters of the
underlying model were determined using a fit to the average multiplicities of
the latest measurements at $\sqrt{s}$ = 10, 29-35, 91 and 130-200 GeV. The
results demonstrate that, within the accuracy of the experiments, none of the
data sets is satisfactorily described with this approach, calling into question
the notion that particle production in e+e- collisions is thermal in origin.
