An integrable semi-discretization of the Camassa-Holm equation is presented.
The keys of its construction are bilinear forms and determinant structure of
solutions of the CH equation. Determinant formulas of $N$-soliton solutions of
the continuous and semi-discrete Camassa-Holm equations are presented. Based on
determinant formulas, we can generate multi-soliton, multi-cuspon and
multi-soliton-cuspon solutions. Numerical computations using the integrable
semi-discrete Camassa-Holm equation are performed. It is shown that the
integrable semi-discrete Camassa-Holm equation gives very accurate numerical
results even in the cases of cuspon-cuspon and soliton-cuspon interactions. The
numerical computation for an initial value condition, which is not an exact
solution, is also presented.
