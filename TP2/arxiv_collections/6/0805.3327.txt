It is recently announced by the {\bf Ut}{\it fit} collaboration that the CP
phase of the $B_s$ mixing amplitude, $\phi_{B_s}$, deviates more than $3
\sigma$ from the standard-model prediction. In this paper we discuss how large
correction to $\phi_{B_s}$ is possible in the supersymmetric SU(5) ground
unified model (SUSY SU(5) GUT) with right-handed neutrinos. Here, we assume the
supergravity-like boundary condition for the SUSY-breaking terms. We found that
the 95% probability region derived by the {\bf Ut}{\it fit} collaboration is
marginal in this model.
