Magnetic properties of two and three-dimensional clusters of quantum dots are
studied with exact diagonalization of a generalized Hubbard model. We study the
weak coupling limit, where the electrons interact only within a quantum dot and
consider cases where the second or third harmonic oscillator shell is partially
filled. The results show that in the case of half-filled shell the magnetism is
determined by the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model with spin 1/2, 1 or 3/2,
depending on the number of electrons in the open shell. For other fillings the
system in most cases favors a large total spin, indicating a ferromagnetic
coupling between the dots.
