We report some qualitatively new features of emergence, competition and
dynamical stabilization of dissipative rotating spiral waves (RSWs) in the
cellular-automaton model of laser-like excitable media proposed in
arXiv:cond-mat/0410460v2 ; arXiv:cond-mat/0602345 . Part of the observed
features are caused by unusual mechanism of excitation vorticity when the RSW's
core get into the surface layer of an active medium. Instead of the well known
scenario of RSW collapse, which takes place after collision of RSW's core with
absorbing boundary, we observed complicated transformations of the core leading
to regeneration (nonlinear "reflection" from the boundary) of the RSW or even
to birth of several new RSWs in the surface layer. Computer experiments on
bottlenecked evolution of such the RSW-ensembles (vortex matter) are reported
and a possible explanation of real experiments on spin-lattice relaxation in
dilute paramagnets is proposed on the basis of an analysis of the RSWs
dynamics. Chimera states in RSW-ensembles are revealed and compared with
analogous states in ensembles of nonlocally coupled oscillators. Generally, our
computer experiments have shown that vortex matter states in laser-like
excitable media have some important features of aggregate states of the usual
matter.
