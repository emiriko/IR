We propose a method by which to examine all possible partial difference Lax
pairs that consist of 'two by two' discrete linear problems, where the matrices
contain one separable term in each entry. We thereby derive new, higher-order
versions of the lattice sine-Gordon and lattice modified KdV equations, while
showing that there can be no other partial difference equations associated with
this type of Lax pair.
