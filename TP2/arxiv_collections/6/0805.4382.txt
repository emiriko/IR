The formation spectra of model KbarN and KbarNN systems formed by (K-, n)
reactions are investigated in order to obtain a theoretical basis for a proper
interpretation of experimental data concerning kaonic nuclear quasi-bound
states. It has been clarified that the experimentally observable kaonic nuclear
state K-pp should be regarded as the decaying state introduced by
Kapur-Peierls, which is different from the pole state solution of the Faddeev
equation.
