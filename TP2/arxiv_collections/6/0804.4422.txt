We develop a procedure for detecting Fermi liquid instabilities by extending
the analysis of Pomeranchuk to two-dimensional lattice systems. The method is
very general and straightforward to apply, thus providing a powerful tool for
the search of exotic phases. We test it by applying it to a lattice electron
model with interactions leading to $s$ and d-wave instabilities.
