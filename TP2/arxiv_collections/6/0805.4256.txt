We analyze and characterize maximal monotonicity of linear relations
(set-valued operators with linear graphs). An important tool in our study are
Fitzpatrick functions. The results obtained partially extend work on linear and
at most single-valued operators by Phelps and Simons and by Bauschke, Borwein
and Wang. Furthermore, a description of skew linear relations in terms of the
Fitzpatrick family is obtained. We also answer one of Simons problems by
showing that if a maximal monotone operator has a convex graph, then this graph
must actually be affine.
