Electron transport in the transistor structure based on thin undoped
GaAs-in-Al2O3 quantum wire is simulated by ensemble Monte-Carlo method taking
into account electron scattering by the phonons and surface roughness. The
influence of surface roughness height on electron drift velocity at 77 and 300
K is investigated for the values of longitudinal electric field strength of 0.1
and 1.0 kV/cm. A possibility of electron drift velocity control due to
variation of the bias applied to the gates, which results in the electron
scattering rate alteration, is ascertained.
