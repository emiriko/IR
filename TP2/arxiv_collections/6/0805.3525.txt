We investigate the topological insulating states of the $p$-band systems in
optical lattices induced by the onsite orbital angular momentum polarization,
which exhibit gapless edge modes in the absence of Landau levels. This effect
arises from the energy level splitting between the onsite $p_x+ip_y$ and
$p_x-ip_y$ orbitals by rotating each optical lattice site around its own
center. At large rotation angular velocities, this model naturally reduces to
two copies of Haldane's quantum Hall model without Landau levels. The
distribution of Berry curvature in the momentum space and the quantized Chern
numbers are calculated. The experimental realization is also discussed.
