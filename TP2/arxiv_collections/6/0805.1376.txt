Positive and negative streamers are studied in ambient air at 1 bar; they
emerge from a needle electrode placed 40 mm above a planar electrode. The
amplitudes of the applied voltage pulses range from 5 to 96 kV; most pulses
have rise times of 30 ns or shorter. Diameters, velocities and energies of the
streamers are measured. Two regimes are identified; a low voltage regime where
only positive streamers appear and a high voltage regime where both positive
and negative streamers exist. Below 5 kV, no streamers emerge. In the range
from 5 to 40 kV, positive streamers form, while the negative discharges only
form a glowing cloud at the electrode tip, but no streamers. For 5 to 20 kV,
diameters and velocities of the positive streamers have the minimal values of
d=0.2 mm and v \approx 10^5 m/s. For 20 to 40 kV, their diameters increase by a
factor 6 while the voltage increases only by a factor 2. Above the transition
value of 40 kV, streamers of both polarities form; they strongly resemble each
other, though the positive ones propagate further; their diameters continue to
increase with applied voltage. For 96 kV, positive streamers attain diameters
of 3 mm and velocities of 4*10^6 m/s, negative streamers are about 20 % slower
and thinner. An empirical fit formula for the relation between velocity v and
diameter d is v=0.5 d^2/(mm ns) for both polarities. Streamers of both
polarities dissipate energies of the order of several mJ per streamer while
crossing the gap.
