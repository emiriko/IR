Supersymmetry breakdown via gaugino condensation in heterotic string theory
can lead to models with a doubly suppressed gravitino mass. A TeV scale
gravitino can emerge from a condensate as large as the grand unified scale. We
analyze the properties of these models and discuss applications for particle
physics and cosmology.
