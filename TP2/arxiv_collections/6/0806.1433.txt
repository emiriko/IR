We present the complete NLO electroweak contribution of
$\mathcal{O}(\alpha^2_s \alpha)$ to the production of diagonal
squark--anti-squark pairs in proton--proton collisions. Compared to the
lowest-order $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s\alpha + \alpha^2)$ electroweak terms, the
NLO contributions are also significant. We discuss the LO and NLO electroweak
effects in cross sections and distributions at the LHC for the production of
squarks different from top squarks, in various supersymmetric benchmark
scenarios.
