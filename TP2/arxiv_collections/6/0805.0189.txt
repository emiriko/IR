Using a time-dependent linear (Rabi) coupling between the components of a
weakly interacting multicomponent Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), we propose a
protocol for transferring the wavefunction of one component to the other. This
"Rabi switch" can be generated in a binary BEC mixture by an electromagnetic
field between the two components, typically two hyperfine states. When the
wavefunction to be transfered is - at a given time - a stationary state of the
multicomponent Hamiltonian, then, after a time delay (depending on the Rabi
frequency), it is possible to have the same wavefunction on the other
condensate. The Rabi switch can be used to transfer also moving bright
matter-wave solitons, as well as vortices and vortex lattices in
two-dimensional condensates. The efficiency of the proposed switch is shown to
be 100% when inter-species and intra-species interaction strengths are equal.
The deviations from equal interaction strengths are analyzed within a two-mode
model and the dependence of the efficiency on the interaction strengths and on
the presence of external potentials is examined in both 1D and 2D settings.
