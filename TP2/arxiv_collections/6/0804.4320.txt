We discuss features of charmonium suppression at $\sqtr{s} = 200$ GeV within
the framework of the Glauber-Gribov theory and the comovers interaction model.
The latter approach has been extended by allowing for secondary charmonium
production due to recombination of $c\bar{c}$ pairs in the medium, estimated
from pp data at the same bombarding energy. Centrality and rapidity dependence
of the nuclear modification factor for J/psi in d+Au, Cu+Cu and Au+Au
collisions at RHIC are reproduced without fitting a single model parameter. A
strong suppression of J/psi is predicted for LHC energies.
