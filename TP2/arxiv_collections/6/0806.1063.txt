Tumor growth has long been a target of investigation within the context of
mathematical and computer modelling. The objective of this study is to propose
and analyze a two-dimensional probabilistic cellular automata model to describe
avascular solid tumor growth, taking into account both the competition between
cancer cells and normal cells for nutrients and/or space and a time-dependent
proliferation of cancer cells. Gompertzian growth, characteristic of some
tumors, is described and some of the features of the time-spatial pattern of
solid tumors, such as compact morphology with irregular borders, are captured.
The parameter space is studied in order to analyze the occurrence of necrosis
and the response to therapy. Our findings suggest that transitions exist
between necrotic and non-necrotic phases (no-therapy cases), and between the
states of cure and non-cure (therapy cases). To analyze cure, the control and
order parameters are, respectively, the highest probability of cancer cell
proliferation and the probability of the therapeutic effect on cancer cells.
With respect to patterns, it is possible to observe the inner necrotic core and
the effect of the therapy destroying the tumor from its outer borders inwards.
