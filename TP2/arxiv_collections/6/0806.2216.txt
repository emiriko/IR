This paper presents a Multi-Agent approach to the problem of recommending
training courses to engineering professionals. The recommendation system is
built as a proof of concept and limited to the electrical and mechanical
engineering disciplines. Through user modelling and data collection from a
survey, collaborative filtering recommendation is implemented using intelligent
agents. The agents work together in recommending meaningful training courses
and updating the course information. The system uses a users profile and
keywords from courses to rank courses. A ranking accuracy for courses of 90% is
achieved while flexibility is achieved using an agent that retrieves
information autonomously using data mining techniques from websites. This
manner of recommendation is scalable and adaptable. Further improvements can be
made using clustering and recording user feedback.
