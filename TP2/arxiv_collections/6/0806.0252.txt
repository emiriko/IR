We study the evolution of the susceptibility in the subcritical random graph
$G(n,p)$ as $n$ tends to infinity. We obtain precise asymptotics of its
expectation and variance, and show it obeys a law of large numbers. We also
prove that the scaled fluctuations of the susceptibility around its
deterministic limit converge to a Gaussian law. We further extend our results
to higher moments of the component size of a random vertex, and prove that they
are jointly asymptotically normal.
