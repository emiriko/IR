We report the temperature dependent x-ray powder diffraction of the
quaternary compound NdOFeAs (also called NdFeAsO) in the range between 300 K
and 95 K. We have detected the structural phase transition from the tetragonal
phase, with P4/nmm space group, to the orthorhombic or monoclinic phase, with
Cmma or P112/a1 (or P2/c) space group, over a broad temperature range from 150
K to 120 K, centered at T0 ~137 K. Therefore the temperature of this structural
phase transition is strongly reduced, by about ~30K, by increasing the internal
chemical pressure going from LaOFeAs to NdOFeAs. In contrast the
superconducting critical temperature increases from 27 K to 51 K going from
LaOFeAs to NdOFeAs doped samples. This result shows that the normal striped
orthorhombic Cmma phase competes with the superconducting tetragonal phase.
Therefore by controlling the internal chemical pressure in new materials it
should be possible to push toward zero the critical temperature T0 of the
structural phase transition, giving the striped phase, in order to get
superconductors with higher Tc.
