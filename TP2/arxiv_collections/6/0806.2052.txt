We present an accurate computation of the g-factors of the hyperfine states
of the hydrogen molecular ion H2+. The results are in good agreement with
previous experiments, and can be tested further by rf spectroscopy. Their
implication for high-precision two-photon vibrational spectroscopy of H2+ is
also discussed. It is found that the most intense hyperfine components of
two-photon lines benefit from a very small Zeeman splitting.
