We formulate a correspondence between non-relativistic conformal field
theories (NRCFTs) in d-1 spatial dimensions and gravitational theories in
AdS_{d+2} backgrounds with one compactified lightlike direction. The breaking
of the maximal SO(2,d+1) symmetry of AdS_{d+2} to the non-relativistic
conformal group arises from boundary conditions on bulk fields, without the
need to introduce non-vacuum sources of energy-momentum. As a check of the
proposal, we use the gravitational theory to reproduce the NRCFT state-operator
correspondence between scaling dimensions of primary operators and energy
eigenstates of the non-relativistic system placed in an external harmonic
potential.
