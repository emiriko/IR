Multiplicative cascades are often used to represent the structure of
multiscaling variables in many physical systems, specially turbulent flows. In
processes of this kind, these variables can be understood as the result of a
successive tranfer in cascade from large to small scales. For a given signal,
only its optimal wavelet basis can represent it in such a way that the cascade
relation between scales becomes explicit, i.e., it is geometrically achieved at
each point of the system. Finding such a basis is a data-demanding,
highly-complex task. In this paper we propose a formalism that allows to find
the optimal wavelet in an efficient, less data-demanding way. We confirm the
appropriateness of this approach by analyzing the results on synthetic signals
constructed with prescribed optimal bases. Although we show the validity of our
approach constrainted to given families of wavelets, it can be generalized for
a continuous unconstrainted search scheme.
