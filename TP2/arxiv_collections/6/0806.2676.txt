Based on a novel application of an archimedean type pairing to the geometry
and deformation theory of $K3$ surfaces, we construct a regulator
indecomposable $K_1$-class on a self-product of a $K3$ surface. In the
Appendix, we explain how this pairing is a special instance of a general
pairing on precycles in the equivalence relation defining Bloch's higher Chow
groups.
