Heavy-quarkonium states are expected to evidenciate the deconfinement of the
nuclear matter into a Quark-Gluon Plasma in heavy-ion collisions. To strive
conclusive information from quarkonium production modification in A+A
collisions, systematic measurements of the $J/\psi$ and $\Upsilon$ states in
p+p, d+Au and Au+Au collisions are necessary. To accomplish this mission the
STAR experiment has a Quarkonium program based on the development of specific
trigger setups that take advantage of the large STAR acceptance. In this work
we present the preliminary results of the $J/\psi$ and $\Upsilon$ measurement
in 200 GeV p+p and the first measurements of $\Upsilon$ in 200 GeV heavy ion
collisions.
