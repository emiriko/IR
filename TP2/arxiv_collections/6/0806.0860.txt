Recently, Liaw et al. proposed a remote user authentication scheme using
smartcards. They claimed a number of features of their scheme, e.g. a
dictionary of verification tables is not required to authenticate users; users
can choose their password freely; mutual authentication is provided between the
user and the remote system; the communication cost and the computational cost
are very low; users can update their password after the registration phase; a
session key agreed by the user and the remote system is generated in every
session; and the nonce-based scheme which does not require a timestamp (to
solve the serious time synchronization problem) etc.
  In this paper We show that Liaw et al.'s scheme does not stand with various
security requirements and is completely insecure.
