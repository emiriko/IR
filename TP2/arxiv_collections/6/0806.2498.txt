I review constraints on possible New Physics interactions from D0-anti-D0
mixing measurements. I consider the most general low energy effective
Hamiltonian and include leading order QCD running of effective operators. I
discuss constraints from an extensive list of popular New Physics models, each
of which could be discovered at the LHC, that can generate these operators. In
most of the scenarios, strong constraints that surpass those from other search
techniques could be placed on the allowed parameter space using the existent
evidence for observation of D-meson mixing.
