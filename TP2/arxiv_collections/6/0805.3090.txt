The optical properties of bulk $\lambda/2$ GaN microcavities working in the
strong light-matter coupling regime are investigated using angle-dependent
reflectivity and photoluminescence at 5 K and 300 K. The structures have an
Al$_{0.2}$Ga$_{0.8}$N/AlN distributed Bragg reflector as the bottom mirror and
either an aluminium mirror or a dielectric Bragg mirror as the top one. First,
the influence of the number of pairs of the bottom mirror on the Rabi splitting
is studied. The increase of the mirror penetration depth is correlated with a
reduction of the Rabi splitting. Second, the emission of the lower polariton
branch is observed at low temperature in a microcavity containing two Bragg
mirrors and exibiting a quality factor of 190. Our simulations using the
transfer-matrix formalism, taking into account the real structure of the
samples investigated are in good agreement with experimental results.
