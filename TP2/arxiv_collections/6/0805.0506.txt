Nanodroplets on chemically structured substrates move under the action of
disjoining pressure induced forces. A detailed analysis of them shows that even
in the absence of long-ranged lateral variations of the effective interface
potential, already the fact, that due their small size nano-droplets do not
sample the disjoining pressure at all distances from the substrate, can lead to
droplet motion towards the less wettable part of the substrate, i.e., in the
direction opposite to the one expected on the basis of macroscopic wettability
considerations.
