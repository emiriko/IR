When two sheets of Color Glass Condensate collide in a high energy heavy ion
collision, they form matter with very high energy densities called the Glasma.
We describe how this matter is formed, its remarkable properties and its
relevance for understanding thermalization of the Quark Gluon Plasma in heavy
ion collisions. Long range rapidity correlations contained in the near side
ridge measured in heavy ion collisions may allow one to directly infer the
properties of the Glasma.
