We report on the first absolute transition frequency measurement at the
10^{-15} level with a single, laser-cooled 40Ca+ ion in a linear Paul trap. For
this measurement, a frequency comb is referenced to the transportable Cs atomic
fountain clock of LNE-SYRTE and is used to measure the S1/2-D5/2
electric-quadrupole transition frequency. After the correction of systematic
shifts, the clock transition frequency f_Ca+ = 411 042 129 776 393.2 (1.0) Hz
is obtained, which corresponds to a fractional uncertainty within a factor of
three of the Cs standard. Future improvements are expected to lead to an
uncertainty surpassing the best Cs fountain clocks. In addition, we determine
the Lande g-factor of the D5/2 level to be gD5/2=1.2003340(3).
