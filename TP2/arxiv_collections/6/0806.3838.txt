We present a unified approach for qualitative and quantitative analysis of
stability and instability dynamics of positive bright solitons in
multi-dimensional focusing nonlinear media with a potential (lattice), which
can be periodic, periodic with defects, quasiperiodic, single waveguide, etc.
We show that when the soliton is unstable, the type of instability dynamic that
develops depends on which of two stability conditions is violated.
Specifically, violation of the slope condition leads to an amplitude
instability, whereas violation of the spectral condition leads to a drift
instability. We also present a quantitative approach that allows to predict the
stability and instability strength.
