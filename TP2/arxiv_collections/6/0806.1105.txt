Since several years the DAFNE Team has been discussing ideas and performing
experimental activities aimed at the collider luminosity increase. In this
paper we briefly describe the proposed ideas and discuss results of the most
relevant beam dynamics experimental studies that have been carried at DAFNE. We
also introduce the concept of crab waist collisions that is the base of the
undergoing DAFNE upgrade.
