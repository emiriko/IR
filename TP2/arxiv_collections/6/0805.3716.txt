String theory suggests that black hole microstates are quantum, horizon sized
`fuzzballs', rather than smooth geometries with horizon. Radiation from
fuzzballs can carry information and does not lead to information loss. But if
we let a shell of matter collapse then it creates a horizon, and it seems that
subsequent radiation will lead to information loss. We argue that the
resolution to this problem is that the shell can tunnel to the fuzzball
configurations. The amplitude for tunneling is small because we are relating
two macroscopically different configurations, but the number of states that we
can tunnel to, given through the Bekenstein entropy, is very large. These small
and large numbers can cancel each other, making it possible for the shell to
tunnel into fuzzball states before a significant amount of radiation has been
emitted. This offers a way to resolve the information paradox.
