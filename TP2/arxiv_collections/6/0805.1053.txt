In this paper we study some questions in connection with uniform
rectifiability and the $L^2$ boundedness of Calderon-Zygmund operators. We show
that uniform rectifiability can be characterized in terms of some new
adimensional coefficients which are related to the Jones' $\beta$ numbers. We
also use these new coefficients to prove that n-dimensional Calderon-Zygmund
operators with odd kernel of type $C^2$ are bounded in $L^2(\mu)$ if $\mu$ is
an n-dimensional uniformly rectifiable measure.
