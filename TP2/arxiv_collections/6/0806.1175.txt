The algebraic foundation of tropical polynomial algebra provides the
framework for the geometric construction of the supplement and the reversal of
tropical varieties, thereby inducing a duality of reduced tropical varieties;
for classes of tropical hypersurfaces the corresponding point symmetry is
obtained for their Newton polytopes and lattice polytopes.
