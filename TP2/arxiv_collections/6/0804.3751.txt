For every positive integer $n$ we construct a bigraded homology theory for
links, such that the corresponding invariant of the unknot is closely related
to the U(n)-equivariant cohomology ring of $\mathbb{CP}^{n-1}$; our
construction specializes to the Khovanov-Rozansky $sl_n$-homology. We are
motivated by the "universal" rank two Frobenius extension studied by M.
Khovanov in \cite{Kh3} for $sl_2$-homology.
