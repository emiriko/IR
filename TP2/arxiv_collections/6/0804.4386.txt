We argue that the idea that the parton system created in relativistic
heavy-ion collisions is formed in a state with transverse momenta close to
thermodynamic equilibrium and its subsequent dynamics at early times is
dominated by pure transverse hydrodynamics of the perfect fluid is compatible
with the data collected at RHIC. This scenario of early parton dynamics may
help to solve the problem of early equilibration.
