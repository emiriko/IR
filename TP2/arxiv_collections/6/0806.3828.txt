A concept of kinetic energy in quantum mechanics is analyzed. Kinetic energy
is a non-zero positive value in many cases of bound states, when a wave
function is a real-valued one and there are no visible motion and flux. This
can be understood, using expansion of the wave function into Fourier integral,
that is, on the basis of virtual plane waves. The ground state energy of a
hydrogen atom is calculated in a special way, regarding explicitly all the
terms of electrostatic and kinetic energies. The correct values of the ground
state energy and the radius of decay are achieved only when the electrostatic
energies of the electron and the proton (self-energies) are not taken into
account. This proves again that self-action should be excluded in quantum
mechanics. A model of a spherical ball with uniformly distributed charge of
particles is considered. It is shown that for a neutral ball (with compensated
electric charge) the electrostatic energy is a non-zero negative value in this
model. This occurs because the self-energy of the constituting particles should
be subtracted. So it shown that the energy of the electric field does not have
to be of a positive value in any imaginable problem.
