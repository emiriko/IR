We study theoretically the electronic transport through a single impurity in
a repulsive Luttinger liquid (LL), and find that above a threshold voltage
related to a strength of the impurity potential the DC current $\bar I$ is
accompanied by coherent oscillations with frequency $f = \bar I/e$. There is an
analogy with Josephson junctions: the well-known regime of power-law I-V curves
in the LL corresponds to damping of the Josephson current below the critical
one, while the oscillatory regime in the LL can be compared with the Josephson
oscillations above the critical current.
