A pair of dual frames with almost exponentially localized elements (needlets)
are constructed on $\RR_+^d$ based on Laguerre functions. It is shown that the
Triebel-Lizorkin and Besov spaces induced by Laguerre expansions can be
characterized in terms of respective sequence spaces that involve the needlet
coefficients.
