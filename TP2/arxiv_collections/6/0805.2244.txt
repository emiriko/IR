The microstructure of a CoNiAl FSMA was determined by conventional
transmission electron microscopy, electron diffraction studies together with
advanced microscopy techniques and in-situ Lorentz microscopy. 10 to 60 nm
sized rod-like precipitates of hcp $\epsilon$-Co were confirmed to be present
by HRTEM. The orientation relationship between the precipitates and B2 matrix
is described by the Burgers orientation relationship. The crystal structure of
the martensite obtained after cooling is tetragonal L10 with a (1-11) twinning
plane. The magnetic domain structure was determined during an in-situ cooling
experiment using the Fresnel mode of Lorentz microscopy. While transformation
proceeds from B2 austenite to L10 martensite, new domains are nucleated leading
to a decrease in domain width, with the magnetization lying predominantly along
a single direction. It was possible to completely describe the relationship
between magnetic domains and crystallographic directions in the austenite phase
though complications existed for the martensite phase.
