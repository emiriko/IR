Scanning tunneling spectroscopy at very low temperature on homogeneously
disordered superconducting Titanium Nitride thin films reveals strong spatial
inhomogeneities of the superconducting gap $\Delta$ in the density of states.
Upon increasing disorder, we observe suppression of the superconducting
critical temperature $T_c$ towards zero, enhancement of spatial fluctuations in
$\Delta$, and growth of the $\Delta/T_c$ ratio. These findings suggest that
local superconductivity survives across the disorder-driven
superconductor-insulator transition.
