In this paper, a channel that is contaminated by two independent Gaussian
noises $S ~ N(0,Q)$ and $Z_0 ~ N(0,N_0)$ is considered. The capacity of this
channel is computed when independent noisy versions of $S$ are known to the
transmitter and/or receiver. It is shown that the channel capacity is greater
then the capacity when $S$ is completely unknown, but is less then the capacity
when $S$ is perfectly known at the transmitter or receiver. For example, if
there is one noisy version of $S$ known at the transmitter only, the capacity
is $0.5\log(1+\frac{P}{Q(N_1/(Q+N_1))+N_0})$, where $P$ is the input power
constraint and $N_1$ is the power of the noise corrupting $S$. Further, it is
shown that the capacity with knowledge of any independent noisy versions of $S$
at the transmitter is equal to the capacity with knowledge of the statistically
equivalent noisy versions of $S$ at the receiver.
