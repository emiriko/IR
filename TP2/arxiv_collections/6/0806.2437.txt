We study the Kondo lattice model which is modified by the Holstein term,
involving both the Kondo exchange coupling and the electron-phonon coupling
constants, characterized by $J$ and $g$, respectively. The model is solved by
employing the dynamical mean-field theory in conjunction with exact
diagonalization technique. A zero temperature phase diagram of symmetry
unbroken states at half filling is mapped out which exhibits an interplay
between the two interactions and accounts for both spin and charge
fluctuations. When the Kondo exchange coupling is dominant the system is in
Kondo insulator state. Increasing $g$ for small values of $J$ leads to a Kondo
insulator-metal transition. Upon further enhancement of $g$ a transition to the
bipolaronic insulating phase takes place. Also a small region with non-Fermi
liquid behavior is found near the Kondo insulator-metal transition.
