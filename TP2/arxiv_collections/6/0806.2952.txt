Assume that $f(s) = F'(s)$ where $F$ is a double-well potential. Under
certain conditions on the Lipschitz constant of $f$ on $[-1,1]$, we prove that
arbitrary bounded global solutions of the semilinear equation $\Delta u = f(u)$
on hyperbolic space $\HH^n$ must reduce to functions of one variable provided
they admit asymptotic boundary values on the infinite boundary of $\HH^n$ which
are invariant under a cohomogeneity one subgroup of the group of isometries of
$\HH^n$. We also prove existence of these one-dimensional solutions.
