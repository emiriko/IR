Bohr's atomic model, its relationship to the radiation spectrum of the
hydrogen atom and the inherent hypotheses are revisited. It is argued that Bohr
could have adopted a different approach, focusing his analyzes on the
stationary orbit of the electron and its decomposition on two harmonic
oscillators and then imposing, as actually he did, Planck's quantization for
the oscillators' energies. Some consequences of this procedure are examined.
