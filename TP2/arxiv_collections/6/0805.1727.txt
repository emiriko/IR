Purpose: To present an algorithm for spatially sorting objects into an
annular structure. Design/Methodology/Approach: A swarm-based model that
requires only stochastic agent behaviour coupled with a pheromone-inspired
"attraction-repulsion" mechanism. Findings: The algorithm consistently
generates high-quality annular structures, and is particularly powerful in
situations where the initial configuration of objects is similar to those
observed in nature. Research limitations/implications: Experimental evidence
supports previous theoretical arguments about the nature and mechanism of
spatial sorting by insects. Practical implications: The algorithm may find
applications in distributed robotics. Originality/value: The model offers a
powerful minimal algorithmic framework, and also sheds further light on the
nature of attraction-repulsion algorithms and underlying natural processes.
