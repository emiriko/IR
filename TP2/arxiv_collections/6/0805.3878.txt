We present first evidence for the production of single top quarks at the
Fermilab Tevatron {\ppbar} collider. Both D0 and CDF experiments have measured
the single top production cross section with a 3-standard-deviation
significance using 0.9 fb$^{-1}$ and 2.2 fb$^{-1}$ of lepton+jets data,
respectively. A direct measurement of the CKM matrix element that describes the
$Wtb$ coupling is also performed for the first time.
