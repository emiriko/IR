In this work we propose a mathematical model, based in a modified version of
the Lotka-Volterra prey-predator equations, to predict the increasing in CO2
atmospheric concentration. We consider how the photosynthesis rate has changed
with the increase of CO2 and how this affects plant reproduction and CO2
absorptions rates. Total CO2 emissions (natural and manmade) and biomass
numerical parameter changes are considered. It is shown that the atmospheric
system can be in equilibrium under some specific conditions, and also some
comparisons with historical are done.
