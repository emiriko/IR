We study nuclear effects of charged current deep inelastic neutrino-iron
scattering in the framework of a chi^2 analysis of parton distribution
functions (PDFs). We extract a set of iron PDFs which are used to compute
x_Bj-dependent and Q^2-dependent nuclear correction factors for iron structure
functions which are required in global analyses of free nucleon PDFs. We
compare our results with nuclear correction factors from neutrino-nucleus
scattering models and correction factors for charged lepton-iron scattering. We
find that, except for very high x_Bj, our correction factors differ in both
shape and magnitude from the correction factors of the models and
charged-lepton scattering.
