The effect of finite nuclear mass on the magnetic-dipole transition
probabilities between fine-structure levels of the same term is investigated.
Based on a rigorous QED approach a nonrelativistic formula for the recoil
correction to first order in m_e/M is derived. Numerical results for
transitions of experimental interest are presented.
