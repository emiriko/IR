We investigate two directions beyond the traditional quantum secret sharing
(QSS). First, a restriction on QSS that comes from the no-cloning theorem is
that any pair of authorized sets in an access structure should overlap. From
the viewpoint of application, this places an unnatural constraint on secret
sharing. We present a generalization, called assisted QSS (AQSS), where access
structures without pairwise overlap of authorized sets is permissible, provided
some shares are withheld by the share dealer. We show that no more than
$\lambda-1$ withheld shares are required, where $\lambda$ is the minimum number
of {\em partially linked classes} among the authorized sets for the QSS. Our
result means that such applications of QSS need not be thwarted by the
no-cloning theorem. Secondly, we point out a way of combining the features of
QSS and quantum key distribution (QKD) for applications where a classical
information is shared by quantum means. We observe that in such case, it is
often possible to reduce the security proof of QSS to that of QKD.
