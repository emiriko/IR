Based on first-principles FLAPW-GGA calculations, we have investigated the
electronic structure of newly synthesized novel superconductors LaONiBi and
LaOCuBi, the first bismuth-containing compounds from the family of quaternary
oxypnictides which attract now a great deal of interest in search for novel
26-55K superconductors. The band structure, density of states and Fermi
surfaces are discussed. Our results indicate that the bonding inside of the
(La-O) and (Ni(Cu)-Bi) layers is covalent whereas the bonding between the
(La-O) and (Ni(Cu)- Bi) blocks is mostly ionic. For both oxybismuthides, the
DOSs at the Fermi level are formed mainly by the states of the (Ni(Cu)-Bi)
layers, the corresponding Fermi surfaces have a twodimensional character and
the conduction should be strongly anisotropic andhappen only on the (Ni(Cu)-Bi)
layers. As a whole, the new oxybismuthides may be described as low-TC
superconducting non-magnetic ionic metals.
