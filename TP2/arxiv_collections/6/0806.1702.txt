We show that the de Rham cohomology of any separated and smooth rigid variety
over a field of Laurent series of characteristic zero carries a natural formal
meromorphic connection, which we call the Gauss-Manin connection. We compare it
with the Gauss-Manin connection of a proper and smooth variety over a curve,
and with the Gauss-Manin connection of the Milnor fibration at an isolated
complex hypersurface singularity.
