New preliminary electroweak results from the HERA lepton-proton collider
experiments H1 and ZEUS are presented. These include new high Q^2 neutral
current cross section measurements and limits on a possible quark radius, in
the search for contact interactions, and on the quark-Z couplings, extracted in
combined electroweak and QCD fits. Furthermore, new charged current cross
section measurements as a function of the lepton-beam polarisation are
presented, as well as charged current measurement results, using the combined
HERA I data from H1 and ZEUS. Finally, measurements of the single W boson
production cross section and the W boson polarisation fractions are presented.
