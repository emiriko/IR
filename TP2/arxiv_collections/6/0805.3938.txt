This article is devoted first to anisotropic distributions of stored electric
charges in isotropic materials, second to charge trapping and induced
electrostatic potential in anisotropic dielectrics. On the one hand, we examine
the case of anisotropic trapped charge distributions in linear homogeneous
isotropic (LHI) insulators, obtained after an electron irradiation in a
scanning electron microscope. This injection leads to the formation of a mirror
image.
