We discuss generic properties of rotating nonlinear wave solutions, the so
called azimuthons, in nonlocal media. Variational methods allow us to derive
approximative values for the rotating frequency, which is shown to depend
crucially on the nonlocal response function. Further on, we link families of
azimuthons to internal modes of classical non-rotating stationary solutions,
namely vortex and multipole solitons. This offers an exhaustive method to
identify azimuthons in a given nonlocal medium.
