We study phase transition from the Mott insulator to superfluid in a periodic
optical lattice. Kibble-Zurek mechanism predicts buildup of winding number
through random walk of BEC phases, with the step size scaling as a the third
root of transition rate. We confirm this and demonstrate that this scaling
accounts for the net winding number after the transition.
