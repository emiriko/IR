A MacWilliams Identity for convolutional codes will be established. It makes
use of the weight adjacency matrices of the code and its dual, based on state
space realizations (the controller canonical form) of the codes in question.
The MacWilliams Identity applies to various notions of duality appearing in the
literature on convolutional coding theory.
