Multi-photon interference reveals strictly non-classical phenomena. Its
applications range from fundamental tests of quantum mechanics to photonic
quantum information processing, where a significant fraction of key experiments
achieved so far comes from multi-photon state manipulation. We review the
progress, both theoretical and experimental, of this rapidly advancing
research. The emphasis is given to the creation of photonic entanglement of
various forms, tests of the completeness of quantum mechanics (in particular,
violations of local realism), quantum information protocols for quantum
communication (e.g., quantum teleportation, entanglement purification and
quantum repeater), and quantum computation with linear optics. We shall limit
the scope of our review to "few photon" phenomena involving measurements of
discrete observables.
