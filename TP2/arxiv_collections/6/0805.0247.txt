The superfluid to one-dimensional Mott-insulator transition of a 87Rb
Bose-Einstein condensate is demonstrated. In the experiment, we apply a
one-dimensional optical lattice, formed by two laser beams with a wavelength of
852 nm, to a three dimensional BEC in a shallow trap. We use Kapitza-Dirac
scattering to determine the depth of the optical lattice without knowledge of
its exact geometry. We further study the dynamics of the transition as well as
steady-state phase behavior specific to the one-dimensional case.
