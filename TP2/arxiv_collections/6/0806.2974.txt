We show that the Quantum Zeno Effect prevails even if the entanglement with
the measuring probe is not complete. The dynamics towards the asymptotic regime
as a function of $N$, the number of measurements, reveals surprising results:
the transition probability, for some values of the coupling to the measuring
probe, may decrease much faster than the normal QZE.
