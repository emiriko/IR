Recent scanning tunneling microscopy in the superconducting regime of two
different cuprate families has revealed unidirectional bond-centered modulation
in the local electronic density of states. Motivated by this result we
investigate the emergence of modulated d-wave superconductivity coexisting with
charge domains that form along one of the crystal axes. While detailed stripe
profiles depend on the used form of the Gutzwiller factors, the tendency
towards a valence bond crystal remain robust. We also find closely related
stripe phase originating from the staggered flux phase, a candidate for the
pseudogap phase of lightly doped cuprates.
