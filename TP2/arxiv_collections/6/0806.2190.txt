Azimuthal correlations of direct photons at high transverse energy (8 $<$
E$_T$ $<$ 16 GeV) with away-side hadrons of transverse momentum (3 $<$ p$_T$
$<$ 6 GeV/c) have been measured over a broad range of centrality for $Au+Au$
collisions and $p+p$ collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. The presented
results are the first measurements at RHIC for $\gamma$-hadron azimuthal
correlations in $Au+Au$ collisions.
