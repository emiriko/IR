In this article we have studied a closed universe which a holographic energy
on the brane whose energy density is described by $\rho (H) =3c^{2}H^{2}$ and
we obtain an equation for the Hubble parameter, this equation gave us different
physical behavior depending if $c^2>1$ or $c^2<1$ against of the sign of the
brane tension.
