We present here potential dependent mechanical properties of amorphous
silicon studied through molecular dynamics (MD) at low temperature. On average,
the localization of elementary plastic events and the co-ordination
defect-sites appears to be correlated. For Tersoff potential and SW potential
the plastic events centered on defects-sites prefer 5-fold defect sites, while
for modified Stillinger-Weber potential such plastic events choose 3-fold
defect sites. We also analyze the non-affine displacement field in amorphous
silicon obtained for different shear regime. The non-affine displacement field
localizes when plastic events occur and shows elementary shear band formation
at higher shear strains.
