We discuss complementarity relations in a bipartite continuous variable
system. Building up from the work done on discrete d-dimensional systems, we
prove that for symmetric two-mode states, quantum complementarity relations can
be put in a simple relation with the elements of the variance matrix. When this
condition is not satisfied, such a connection becomes non-trivial. Our
investigation is the first step towards an operative characterization of the
complementarity in a scenario that has not been investigated so far.
