A method for engineering the behavior of populations of rhythmic elements is
presented. The framework, which is based on phase models, allows a nonlinear
time-delayed global feedback signal to be constructed which produces an
interaction function corresponding to the desired behavior of the system. It is
shown theoretically and confirmed in numerical simulations that a polynomial,
delayed feedback is a versatile tool to tune synchronization patterns.
Dynamical states consisting of one to four clusters were engineered to
demonstrate the application of synchronization engineering in an experimental
electrochemical system.
