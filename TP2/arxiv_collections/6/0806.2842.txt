We demonstrate a bright, narrowband, compact, quasi-phase-matched
single-crystal source generating path-polarization-entangled photon pairs at
810 nm and 1550 nm at a maximum rate of 3 Mcounts/(s THz mW) after coupling to
single-mode fiber, and with two-photon interference visibility above 90%. While
the source can already be used to implement quantum communication protocols
such as quantum key distribution, this work is also instrumental for narrowband
applications such as entanglement transfer from photonic to atomic qubits, or
entanglement of photons from independent sources.
