The electromagnetic form factors of light and heavy pseudoscalar mesons are
calculated within two covariant constituent-quark models, a light-front and a
dispersion relation approach. We investigate the details and physical origins
of the model dependence of various hadronic observables: the weak decay
constant, the charge radius and the elastic electromagnetic form factor.
