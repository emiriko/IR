We report on a dynamic photoconductive gain effect in quantum wires which are
lithographically fabricated in an AlGaAs/GaAs quantum well via a shallow-etch
technique. The effect allows resolving the one-dimensional subbands of the
quantum wires as maxima in the photoresponse across the quantum wires. We
interpret the results by optically induced holes in the valence band of the
quantum well which shift the chemical potential of the quantum wire. The
non-linear current-voltage characteristics of the quantum wires also allow
detecting the photoresponse effect of excess charge carriers in the conduction
band of the quantum well. The dynamics of the photoconductive gain are limited
by the recombination time of both electrons and holes.
