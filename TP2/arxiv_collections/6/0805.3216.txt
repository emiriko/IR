The paper discusses the impact of adjoint fields on the conservation laws in
the gravitational field and electromagnetic field, by means of the
characteristics of octonions. When the adjoint field can not be neglected, it
will cause the predictions to departure slightly from the conservation laws,
which include mass continuity equation, charge continuity equation, and
conservation of spin. The adjoint field of electromagnetic field has an effect
on conservation of mass, and that of gravitational field on conservation of
charge. The inferences explain how the adjoint field influences some
conservation laws in the gravitational field and electromagnetic field.
