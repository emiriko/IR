Single crystals of the oxypnictide superconductor SmFeAsO_(0.8)F_(0.2) with
T_c=45(1) K were investigated by torque magnetometry. The crystals of mass~0.1
mug were grown by a high-pressure cubic anvil technique. The use of a
high-sensitive piezoresistive torque sensor made it possible to study the
anisotropic magnetic properties of these tiny crystals. The anisotropy
parameter was found to be field independent, but varies strongly with
temperature ranging from 8 at T=T_c to 23 at T=0.4T_c. This unusual behavior
signals unconventional superconductivity.
