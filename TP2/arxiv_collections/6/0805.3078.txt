Eynard's formulation of Hermitean 1-matrix models in terms of intrinsic
quantities of an associated hyperelliptic Riemann surface is rephrased as a
Lagrangean field theory of a scalar particle propagating on the hyperelliptic
surface with multiple self-interactions and particle-source interactions. Both
types of interaction take place at the branch points of the hyperelliptic
surface.
