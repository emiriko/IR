Objective priors for sequential experiments are considered. Common priors,
such as the Jeffreys prior and the reference prior, will typically depend on
the stopping rule used for the sequential experiment. New expressions for
reference priors are obtained in various contexts, and computational issues
involving such priors are considered.
