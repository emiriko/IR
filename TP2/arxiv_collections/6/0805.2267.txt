Inspired by the success of analytical models for non-perturbative effects,
used to investigate event shape variables at LEP and HERA, we apply them to a
study of jets at hadron colliders such as the Tevatron and the LHC. We find
that simple analytical estimates are able to shed considerable light on issues
that could previously be tackled only through Monte-Carlo simulations, for
example the role of different non-perturbative effects in various jet
algorithms. In this context, we also provide testable numerical results for the
commonly studied inclusive-jet $p_t$ distribution, and we introduce new
observables that could be employed to verify our calculations.
