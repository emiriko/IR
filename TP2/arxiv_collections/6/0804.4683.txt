Two-particle high-$p_T$ triggered correlations in $Cu+Cu$ and $Au+Au$
collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 62 $GeV$ and $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 $GeV$ in
STAR at RHIC are presented. The $N_{part}$, $p_T^{associated}$, and
$p_T^{trigger}$ dependence of the yield per trigger in the \textit{Jet} and
\textit{Ridge} components of the near-side is investigated for h, $K^0_S$,
$\Lambda$, and $\Xi$ trigger and associated particles. The system and energy
dependence of these components is a potentially powerful tool to distinguish
between models used to describe their production.
