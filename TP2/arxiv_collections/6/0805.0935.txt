The present study presents a new micro electromagnetic actuator utilizing a
PDMS membrane with a magnet. The actuator is integrated with micro coils to
electromagnetically actuate the membrane and results in a large deflection. The
micro electromagnetic actuator proposed in this study is easily fabricated and
is readily integrated with existing bio-medical chips due to its planar
structure.
