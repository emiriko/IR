We theoretically investigate the Fano effect in dc Josephson current at the
absolute zero of temperature. The system under consideration is a double-path
Josephson junction in which one path is through an insulating barrier and the
other one is through a quantum dot (QD). Here the Kondo temperature is assumed
to be much smaller than the superconducting gap, and the Coulomb interaction
inside the QD is treated by the Hartree-Fock approximation. It is shown that
the Josephson critical current exhibits an asymmetric resonance against the QD
energy level. This behavior is caused by the interference between the two
tunneling processes between the superconductors; the direct tunneling across
the insulating barrier and the resonant one through the QD. Moreover, we find
that the Josephson critical current changes its sign around the resonance when
the Coulomb interaction is sufficiently strong. Our results suggest that
0-$\pi$ transition is induced by the cooperation of the Fano effect and the
Coulomb interaction inside the QD.
