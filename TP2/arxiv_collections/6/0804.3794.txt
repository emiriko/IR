We investigate the dynamics of two qubits state through the Bloch channel.
  It is found that the degradation and sudden-death of the entanglement depend
on the channel's parameters and the structure of the input state. Starting from
partially entangled states as input state, the output states are more robust
compared with those obtained from initial maximally entangled states. Also the
survivability of entanglement increased as the absolute equilibrium values of
the channel increased or the ratio between the longitudinal and transverse
relaxation times gets smaller. Ability of using the output states as quantum
channels to perform quantum teleportation is investigated. The idea that the
useful output states are used to achieve the original quantum teleportation
protocol is discussed.
