In nuclear reactions induced by hadrons and ions of high energies, nuclei can
disintegrate into many fragments during a short time (~100 fm/c). This
phenomenon known as nuclear multifragmentation was under intensive
investigation last 20 years. It was established that multifragmentation is an
universal process taking place in all reactions when the excitation energy
transferred to nuclei is high enough, more than 3 MeV per nucleon,
independently on the initial dynamical stage of the reactions. Very known
compound nucleus decay processes (sequential evaporation and fission), which
are usual for low energies, disappear and multifragmentation dominates at high
excitation energy. For this reason, calculation of multifragmentation must be
carried on in all cases when production of highly excited nuclei is expected,
including spallation reactions. From the other hand, one can consider
multifragmentation as manifestation of the liquid-gas phase transition in
finite nuclei. This gives way for studying nuclear matter at subnuclear
densities and for applications of properties of nuclear matter extracted from
multifragmentation reactions in astrophysics. In this contribution, the
Statistical Multifragmentation Model (SMM), which combines the compound nucleus
processes at low energies and multifragmentation at high energies, is
described. The most important ingredients of the model are discussed.
