It is pointed out that the previous energy-momentum tensors of Minkowski and
Abraham for the electromagnetic field in continuous media are based on a
covariant formulation which does not reflect a symmetry inherent to the system.
Instead, taking into account the intrinsic invariance under Lorentz
transformations involving the reduced speed of light in such a medium, a
compact and fully consistent theory can be formulated without the old problems.
