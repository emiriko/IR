Angle-resolved photoemission spectra of a monolayer of Yb on W(110) reveal
energy splittings and dispersion of the Yb 4f states that are obviously due to
their hybridization with W-derived valence bands. These effects occur at well
defined points of the surface Brillouin zone although a smearing over
reciprocal space is expected from the structural incoherence of the Yb and W
lattices. We conclude therefore that dispersion is not related to the periodic
arrangement of the $4f$ states but reflects the k-dependent interaction of a
single Yb 4f impurity with W bands.
