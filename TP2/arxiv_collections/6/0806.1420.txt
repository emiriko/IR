By examining the previously known holographic N=2 supersymmetric
renormalization group flow solution in four dimensions, we describe the
mass-deformed Bagger-Lambert theory, that has SU(3)_I x U(1)_R symmetry, by the
addition of mass term for one of the four adjoint chiral superfields as its
dual theory. A further detailed correspondence between fields of AdS_4
supergravity and composite operators of the infrared field theory is obtained.
