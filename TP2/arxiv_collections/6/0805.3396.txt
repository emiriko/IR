The evolution of entanglement in a one-dimensional Ising chain is numerically
studied under various initial conditions. We analyze two problems concerning
the dynamics of the entanglement: (i) generation of the entanglement from the
pseudopure separable state and (ii) transportation of the entanglement from one
end of the chain to the other. The investigated model is a one-dimensional
Ising spin-1/2 chain with nearest-neighbor interactions placed in an external
magnetic field and irradiated by a weak resonant transverse field. The
possibility of selective initialization of partially entangled states is
considered. It was shown that, in spite of the use of a model with the direct
interactions between the nearest neighbors, the entanglement between remote
spins is generated.
