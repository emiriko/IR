We present numerical simulations of the SU(2) Boltzmann-Vlasov equation
including both hard elastic particle collisions and soft interactions mediated
by classical Yang-Mills fields. We provide an estimate of the coupling of jets
to a hot isotropic plasma, which is independent of infrared cutoffs. In
addition, we investigate jet propagation in anisotropic plasmas, as created in
heavy-ion collisions. The broadening of jets is found to be stronger along the
beam line than in azimuth due to the creation of field configurations with
B_t>E_t and E_z>B_z via plasma instabilities.
