Changes dopant ion concentrations in the sides of a symmetric quantum well
are known to create a random Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling. Here we
demonstrate that, as a consequence, a finite size spin-Hall effect is also
present. Our numerical algorithm estimates the result of the Kubo formula for
the spin-Hall conductivity, by using a tight-binding approximation of the
Hamiltonian in the framework of a time-dependent Green's function formalism,
well suited for very large systems.
