This contribution reports on comparative studies on giant magnetoresistance
(GMR) in carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene nanoribbons of similar aspect
ratios (i.e perimeter/length and width/length ratios, for the former and the
latter, respectively). The problem is solved at zero temperature in the
ballistic transport regime, by means of the Green's functions technique within
the tight-binding model and with the so-called wide band approximation for
electrodes. The GMR effect in graphene is comparable to that of CNTs, it
depends strongly on the chirality and only slightly on the aspect ratio. It
turns out that graphene, analogously to CNTs may be quite an interesting
material for spintronic applications.
