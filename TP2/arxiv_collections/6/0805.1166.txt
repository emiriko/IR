One of the most surprising consequences of quantum mechanics is the nonlocal
multi-particle interference observable in joint-detection of distant
particle-detectors. Ghost imaging is one of such phenomena. Two types of ghost
imaging have been experimentally demonstrated since 1995. Type-one ghost
imaging uses entangled photon pairs as the light source. The nonlocal
point-to-point image-forming correlation is the result of a
constructive-destructive superposition among a large number of biphoton
amplitudes, a nonclassical entity corresponding to different yet
indistinguishable alternative ways of producing a joint-detction event between
distant photodetectors. Type-two ghost imaging uses chaotic-thermal light. The
type-two image-forming correlation is the result of interferences between
paired two-photon amplitudes, corresponding to two different yet
indistinguishable alternative ways of triggering a join-detection event by two
independent photons. A great deal of confusion about ghost imaging comes from
"ghost shadow". Similar to x-ray photography, a ghost shadow can be made in
coincidences by "blocking-partial blocking-unblocking" of either co-rotating
laser beams or classically correlated "speckles". "Ghost shadow" is indeed a
classical phenomenon. The physics of ghost imaging, however, is fundamentally
different. This article is aimed at exploring the nonlocal two-photon
interference nature of ghost imaging.
