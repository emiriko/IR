We argue that in the infrared regime of continuum Yang-Mills theory, the
possibility of a mass gap in the charged sector is closely associated with the
center vortex sector.
  The analysis of the possible consequences of the ensembles of defects is done
by showing that the description of center vortices and monopoles is naturally
unified by means of a careful treatment of Cho decomposition.
  If on the one hand confinement is usually associated with monopole
condensation in a compact abelian model, in this scenario, the previous
decoupling of the off-diagonal degrees of freedom, for the abelian model
dominate at large distances, can be understood as induced by a phase where
center vortices become thick objects.
  Other important scenarios for correlated monopoles and center vortices,
observed in lattice simulations, are also accomodated in our general
formulation.
