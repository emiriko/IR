It is well known that the leptogenesis mechanism offers an attractive
possibility to explain the baryon asymmetry of the universe. Its particular
robustness however comes with one major difficulty: it will be very hard if not
impossible to test experimentally in a foreseeable future, as most of the
mechanics typically takes place at high energy or results from suppressed
interactions, without unavoidable low-energy implications. An alternate
approach is taken by asking: can it be at least falsified? We show that
possible discoveries at current and future colliders, most notably that of
right-handed gauge interactions, would indeed forbid at least the "canonical"
leptogenesis mechanisms, namely those based on right-handed neutrino decay.
General lower bounds for successful leptogenesis on the mass of the
right-handed gauge boson W_R are given. Other possibilities to falsify
leptogenesis, including from the observation of a Z', are also considered.
