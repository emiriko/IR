Two decades after the invention of chirped pulse amplification the physical
mechanism of collisionless absorption of intense laser radiation in overdense
matter is still not sufficiently well understood. We show that anharmonic
resonance in the self-generated plasma potential of the single plasma layers
(cold plasma model) or of the individual electrons (warm plasma), respectively,
constitutes the leading physical mechanism of collisionless absorption in an
overdense plasma. Analogously to collisions, resonance provides for the finite
phase shift of the free electron current relative to the driving laser field
which is compulsory for energy transfer from the laser beam to any medium. An
efficient new scenario of wave breaking is also indicated.
