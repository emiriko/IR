We present muon spin lattice relaxation measurements in the V15 spin 1/2
molecular nano-magnet. We find that the relaxation rate in low magnetic fields
(<5 kG) is temperature independent below ~10 K, implying that the molecular
spin is dynamically fluctuating down to 12 mK. These measurements show that the
fluctuation time increases as the temperature is decreased and saturates at a
value of ~6 nsec at low temperatures. The fluctuations are attributed to V15
molecular spin dynamics perpendicular to the applied magnetic field direction,
induced by coupling between the molecular spin and nuclear spin bath in the
system.
