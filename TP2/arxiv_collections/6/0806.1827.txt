We define the syntax and reduction relation of a recursively typed lambda
calculus with a parallel case-function (a parallel conditional). The reduction
is shown to be confluent. We interpret the recursive types as information
systems in a restricted form, which we call prime systems. A denotational
semantics is defined with this interpretation. We define the syntactical normal
form approximations of a term and prove the Approximation Theorem: The
semantics of a term equals the limit of the semantics of its approximations.
The proof uses inclusive predicates (logical relations). The semantics is
adequate with respect to the observation of Boolean values. It is also fully
abstract in the presence of the parallel case-function.
