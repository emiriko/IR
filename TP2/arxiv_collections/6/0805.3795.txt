Linear combinations of translations of a single Gaussian, e^{-x^2}, are shown
to be dense in L^2(R). Two algorithms for determining the coefficients for the
approximations are given, using orthogonal Hermite functions and least squares.
Taking the Fourier transform of this result shows low-frequency trigonometric
series are dense in L^2 with Gaussian weight function.
