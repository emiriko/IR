As systems become ever more complex, verification becomes more main stream.
Event-B and Alloy are two formal specification languages based on fairly
different methodologies. While Event-B uses theorem provers to prove that
invariants hold for a given specification, Alloy uses a SAT-based model finder.
In some settings, Event-B invariants may not be proved automatically, and so
the often difficult step of interactive proof is required. One solution for
this problem is to validate invariants with model checking. This work studies
the encoding of Event-B machines and contexts to Alloy in order to perform
temporal model checking with Alloy's SAT-based engine.
