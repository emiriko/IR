The estimation of the correlation between time series is often hampered by
the asynchronicity of the signals. Cumulating data within a time window
suppresses this source of noise but weakens the statistics. We present a method
to estimate correlations without applying long time windows. We decompose the
correlations of data cumulated over a long window using decay of lagged
correlations as calculated from short window data. This increases the accuracy
of the estimated correlation significantly and decreases the necessary efforts
of calculations both in real and computer experiments.
