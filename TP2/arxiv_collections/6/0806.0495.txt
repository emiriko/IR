We introduce concepts of "recursive polynomial remainder sequence (PRS)" and
"recursive subresultant," along with investigation of their properties. A
recursive PRS is defined as, if there exists the GCD (greatest common divisor)
of initial polynomials, a sequence of PRSs calculated "recursively" for the GCD
and its derivative until a constant is derived, and recursive subresultants are
defined by determinants representing the coefficients in recursive PRS as
functions of coefficients of initial polynomials. We give three different
constructions of subresultant matrices for recursive subresultants; while the
first one is built-up just with previously defined matrices thus the size of
the matrix increases fast as the recursion deepens, the last one reduces the
size of the matrix drastically by the Gaussian elimination on the second one
which has a "nested" expression, i.e. a Sylvester matrix whose elements are
themselves determinants.
