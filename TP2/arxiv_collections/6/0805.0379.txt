In this work we discuss the natural appearance of the Generalized Brackets in
systems with non-involutive (equivalent to second class) constraints in the
Hamilton-Jacobi formalism. We show how a consistent geometric interpretation of
the integrability conditions leads to the reduction of degrees of freedom of
these systems and, as consequence, naturally defines a dynamics in a reduced
phase space.
