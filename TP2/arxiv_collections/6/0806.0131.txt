A model for cooperative sequential adsorption that incorporates
nearest-neighbor exclusion and next-nearest neighbor interaction is presented.
It is analyzed for the case of one-dimensional dimer and two-dimensional
monomer adsorption. Analytic solutions found for certain values of the
interaction strength are used to investigate jamming coverage and temporal
approach to jamming in the one-dimensional case. In two dimensions, the series
expansion of the coverage $\theta(t)$ is presented and employed to provide
estimates for the jamming coverage as a function of interaction strength. These
estimates are supported by Monte Carlo simulation results.
