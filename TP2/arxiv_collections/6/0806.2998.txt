Using Deodhar's decomposition of a double Schubert cell, we study the regular
representations of finite groups of Lie type arising in the cohomology of
Deligne-Lusztig varieties associated to tori. We deduce that the
Deligne-Lusztig restriction of a Gelfand-Graev module is a shifted
Gelfand-Graev module.
