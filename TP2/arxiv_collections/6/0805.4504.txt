We derive generalization of the Balitsky-Kovchegov (BK) equation for a
dipole, which consists of a parton and an antiparton of arbitrary charge. At
first, we develop one method of indexless transformation of color expressions.
The method is based on an evaluation of the Casimir operator on a tensor
product. From the JIMWLK equation we derive the evolution equation for a single
parton and prove gluon Reggeization in an arbitrary color channel. We show that
there is a color duplication of such Regge poles. Higher t-channel color
exchange has its own Regge pole, which residue is proportional to the quadratic
Casimir. Taking a fundamental representation, we derive the usual BK equation
and shed new light on the meaning of linear and nonlinear terms. Finally, we
discuss a linearized version of the generalized BK equation.
