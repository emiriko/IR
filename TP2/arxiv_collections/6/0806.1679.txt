Since its discovery quantum teleportation has often been seen as a
manifestation, indeed the epitome, of the very paradoxical and mysterious
nature of quantum theory itself. It is commonly regarded as genuinely quantum
and essentially paradoxical. Although a common approach to teleportation
amongst physicists nowadays is a somewhat operational one, some researchers are
making an effort to deflate the above views.
  On the one hand, it was recently argued that the paradox of information
transfer taking place in teleportation is dissolved (Timpson, 2006) by
appealing the very notion of information. On the other hand, it was
demonstrated that some classical versions of teleportation retain its important
features, which hitherto were considered genuinely quantum (Cohen, 2003;
Collins&Popescu, 2002; Hardy, 1999; Mor, 2006; Spekkens, 2007).
  I will present a special version of a quantum teleportation protocol which is
in a sense split into classical and quantum steps. This description provides us
with a unified picture of teleportation in both domains. It will be explicitly
shown how classical teleportation is embedded in the quantum protocol.
Moreover, the classical step can be successfully accomplished even if the state
shared by the parties is completely disentangled [this is consistent with the
result obtained in (Wang, 2005)]. Yet, all the (apparent) paradoxical features
usually associated with quantum teleportation are clearly present in this step.
In particular, this demonstrates that entanglement cannot be ultimately
responsible and not necessary for the (paradoxical?) information transfer.
  Thus, even if one considers teleportation as mysterious, all its mysteries
are shifted from quantum domain into purely classical one.
