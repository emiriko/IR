We have measured the critical phase change conditions induced by electrical
pulses in Ge2Sb2Te5 nanopillar phase change memory devices by constructing a
comprehensive resistance map as a function of pulse parameters (width,
amplitude and trailing edge). Our measurements reveal that the cooling scheme
and the details of the contact geometry play the dominant role in determining
the final phase composition of the device. A three-dimensional finite element
model of the electro-thermal physics not only provides good insights into the
underlying physical mechanisms of the switching dynamics but also
quantitatively accounts for the observed scaling behaviour.
