The visibility of graphene sheets on different types of substrates has been
investigated both theoretically and experimentally. Although single layer
graphene is observable on various types of dielectrics under an optical
microscope, it is invisible when it is placed directly on most of the
semiconductor and metallic substrates. We show that coating of a resist layer
with optimum thickness is an effective way to enhance the contrast of graphene
on various types of substrates and makes single layer graphene visible on most
semiconductor and metallic substrates. Experiments have been performed to
verify the results on quartz and NiFe-coated Si substrates. The results
obtained will be useful for fabricating graphene-based devices on various types
of substrates for electronics, spintronics and optoelectronics applications.
