Antiferromagnetically coupled moments on the frustrated triangular lattice
typically order in a coplanar state at low temperature. Here, we demonstrate
that the presence of not-very-large easy axis single ion anisotropy leads to an
interesting orientationally ordered collinear state in triangular lattice
antiferromagnets with moments $S \ge 3/2$. This ordered state breaks the
symmetry of $\pi/3$ rotations about a lattice site, while leaving intact the
translational symmetry of the lattice.
