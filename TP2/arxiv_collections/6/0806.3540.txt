Microwave bandpass filters constructed from materials exhibiting some
nonlinearity, such as superconductors, will generate intermodulation distortion
(IMD) when subjected to signals at more than one frequency. In commercial
applications of superconductive receive filters, it is possible for IMD to be
generated when a weak receive signal mixes with very strong out-of-band
signals, such as those coming from the transmitter. A measurement procedure was
developed and data were taken on several different types of superconducting
bandpass filters, all developed for commercial application. It was found that
in certain interference situations, the 3-tone mixing can produce a spur that
is noticeable by the receiver, but that there are simple preventative design
solutions.
