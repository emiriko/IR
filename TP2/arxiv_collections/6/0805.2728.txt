We have recently developed an innovative detector of photons and charged
particles: a GEM-like gaseous amplification structure with resistive electrodes
instead of commonly used metallic ones. This novel detector combines the best
property of GEMs- the capability to operate in a cascaded mode and in poorly
quenched gases - and of RPC: the protection against sparks. In this paper will
shortly review our latest achievements in this direction, however the main
focus will be given on a new advanced design that allows to build large area
detectors manufactured by a screen printing technology. The proposed detector,
depending on the applications, can operate either in a GEM mode (electron
multiplications through holes only) or as a hybrid RPC with simultaneous
amplifications in the drift region and in the holes. The possible applications
of this new detector will be discussed.
