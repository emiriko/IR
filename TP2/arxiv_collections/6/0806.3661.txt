We propose a complete tomographic reconstruction of any vortex state carrying
orbital angular momentum. The scheme determines the angular probability
distribution of the state at different times under free evolution. To represent
the quantum state we introduce a bona fide Wigner function defined on the
discrete cylinder, which is the natural phase space for the pair angle-angular
momentum. The feasibility of the proposal is addressed.
