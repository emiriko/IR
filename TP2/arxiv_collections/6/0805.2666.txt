Evanescent wave amplification is observed, for the first time to our
knowledge, inside a half-wavelength-thick wire medium slab used for
subwavelength imaging. The wire medium is analyzed using both a spatially
dispersive finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method and a full-wave
commercial electromagnetic simulator CST Microwave Studio. In this work we
demonstrate that subwavelength details of a source placed at a distance of
one-tenth of a wavelength from a wire medium slab can be detected inside the
slab with a resolution of approximately one-tenth of a wavelength in spite of
the fact that they cannot be resolved at the front interface of the device, due
to the rapid decay of evanescent spatial harmonics in free space.
