It is shown that the formula of the isometry generators of the spinor
representation given by Carter and McLenaghan is universal in the sense that
this holds for any representation either in local frames or even in natural
ones. The point-dependent spin matrices in natural frames are introduced for
any tensor representation deriving the covariant form of the isometry
generators in these frames.
