I propose a new measure, the w-index, as a particularly simple and useful way
to assess the integrated impact of a researcher's work, especially his or her
excellent papers. The w-index can be defined as follows: If w of a researcher's
papers have at least 10w citations each and the other papers have fewer than
10(w+1) citations, his/her w-index is w. It is a significant improvement of the
h-index.
