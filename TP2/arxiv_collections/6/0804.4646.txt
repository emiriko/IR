We show that strong non--linear electron transport in the ferromagnetic
insulating (FMI) state of manganites, responsible for phenomena such as
colossal electroresistance and current induced resistance switching, can occur
due to a hot electron effect. In the FMI state, which we show is an insulator
with a Coulomb gap, the temperature of the electron and lattice baths can
decouple at high input power levels, leading to heating of the electron bath.
Parameters of the hot electron effect model were independently determined via
time dependence experiments and are in good agreement with the experimental
values.
