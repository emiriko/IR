We first give hypotheses of the bicharacteristic equations corresponding to
the Enskog equation with an external force. Since the collision operator of the
Enskog equation is more complicated than that of the Boltzmann equation, these
hypotheses are more complicated than those given by Duan et al. for the
Boltzmann equation. The hypotheses are very related to collision of particles
of moderately or highly dense gases along the bicharacteristic curves and they
can be used to make the estimation of the so-called gain and loss integrals of
the Enskog integral equation. Then, by controlling these integrals, we show the
existence and uniqueness of the global mild solution to the Enskog equation in
an infinite vacuum for moderately or highly dense gases. Finally, we make some
remarks on the locally Lipschitz assumption of the collision factors in the
Enskog equation.
