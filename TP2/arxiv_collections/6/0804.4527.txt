An electron moving in a magnetically ordered background feels an effective
magnetic field that can be both stronger and more rapidly varying than typical
externally applied fields. One consequence is that insulating magnetic
materials in three dimensions can have topologically nontrivial properties of
the effective band structure. For the simplest case of two bands, these "Hopf
insulators" are characterized by a topological invariant as in quantum Hall
states and Z_2 topological insulators, but instead of a Chern number or parity,
the underlying invariant is the Hopf invariant that classifies maps from the
3-sphere to the 2-sphere. This paper gives an efficient algorithm to compute
whether a given magnetic band structure has nontrivial Hopf invariant, a
double-exchange-like tight-binding model that realizes the nontrivial case, and
a numerical study of the surface states of this model.
