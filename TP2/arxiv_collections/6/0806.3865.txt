FeAs- single layer is tested as a simple model for LaFeAsO and BaFe2As2 based
on first-principles calculations using generalized gradient approximation (GGA)
and GGA+U. The calculated single- layer geometric and electronic structures are
inconsistent with that of bulk materials. The bulk collinear antiferromagnetic
ground state is failed to be obtained in the FeAs- single layer. The monotonous
behavior of the Fe-As distance in z direction upon electron or hole doping is
also in contrast with bulk materials. Our results indicate that, in LaFeAsO and
BaFe2As2, interactions between FeAs layer and other layers beyond simple charge
doping are important, and a single FeAs layer may not represent a good model
for Fe based superconducting materials.
