In a number of model contexts, evolution across space-time singularities
(reminiscent of the cosmological singularities) involves time-dependent quantum
Hamiltonians developing a singularity as a function of time. In this
contribution to the proceedings of the 3rd RTN workshop in Valencia, I review
some recent investigations of the general properties of such systems.
