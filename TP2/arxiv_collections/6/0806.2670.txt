The purpose of this note is to connect early work on thermal transport in
spin-1/2 Heisenberg chains with uniaxial exchange anisotropy and
nearest-neighbor interactions that was based on a moment analysis of the
Fourier transform of the energy density correlation function with subsequent
studies that make use of thermal current correlation functions.
