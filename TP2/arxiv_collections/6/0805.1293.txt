Iterative Logic Arrays (ILAs) are ideal as VLSI sub-systems because of their
regular structure and its close resemblance with FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate
Arrays). Reversible circuits are of interest in the design of very low power
circuits where energy loss implied by high frequency switching is not of much
consideration. Reversibility is essential for Quantum Computing. This paper
examines the testability of Reversible Iterative Logic Arrays (ILAs) composed
of reversible k-CNOT gates. For certain ILAs it is possible to find a test set
whose size remains constant irrespective of the size of the ILA, while for
others it varies with array size. Former type of ILAs is known as
Constant-Testable, i.e. C-Testable. It has been shown that Reversible Logic
Arrays are C-Testable and size of test set is equal to number of entries in
cells truth table implying that the reversible ILAs are also Optimal-Testable,
i.e. O-Testable. Uniform-Testability, i.e. U-Testability has been defined and
Reversible Heterogeneous ILAs have been characterized as U-Testable. The test
generation problem has been shown to be related to certain properties of cycles
in a set of graphs derived from cell truth table. By careful analysis of these
cycles an efficient test generation technique that can be easily converted to
an ATPG program has been presented for both 1-D and 2D ILAs. The same
algorithms can be easily extended for n-Dimensional Reversible ILAs.
