To explain Gamma Ray Bursts, Ruffini argued that the event horizon of a
charged black hole is surrounded by a special region called, the Dyadosphere
where electric field exceeds the critical value for $e^+$ $e^-$ pair
production. In the present work, we construct a thin shell wormhole by
performing a thought surgery between two dadospheres. Several physical
properties of this thin shell wormhole have been analyzed.
