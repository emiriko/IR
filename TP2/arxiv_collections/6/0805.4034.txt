Significant insights into non-Abelian quantum Hall states were obtained from
studying special multi-particle interaction Hamiltonians, whose unique ground
states are the Moore-Read and Read-Rezayi states for the case of spinless
electrons. We generalize this approach to include the electronic spin-1/2
degree of freedom. We demonstrate that in the absence of Zeeman splitting the
ground states of such Hamiltonians have large degeneracies and very rich spin
structures. The spin structure of the ground states and low-energy excitations
can be understood based on an emergent SU(3) symmetry for the case
corresponding to the Moore-Read state. These states with different spin quantum
numbers represent non-Abelian quantum Hall states with different
magnetizations, whose quasi-hole properties are likely to be similar to those
of their spin polarized counterparts.
