We investigated temperature dependent optical spectra of the one-dimensional
chain compound Sr$_{2}$CuO$_{3}$. The charge transfer transition polarized
along the chain direction shows a strongly asymmetric line shape as expected in
one-dimensional extended Hubbard model. At low temperature the charge transfer
peak shows a large blue shift and reveals additional sharp peaks at the gap.
Even though many spectroscopic studies suggest that this material can not have
a bound exciton based on the one-dimensional extended Hubbard model, we
attribute the additional sharp peaks to excitons, which come to exist due to
the long range Coulomb interaction.
