The Energy-Length Rule implies the following properties for a transversal
isolated system : on one side energy multiplied with zero component of x = both
sign of ch, on the other side the sine of the p perpendicular to x,
representing the helicity of the photon, is positive and negative. It
corresponds to the sign of zero component of x, referring to the two cones
which define respectively system and antisystem. The energy is obviously
positive for both of them. Keeping p orthogonal to x implies right and left
handed circular polarization simultaneously .Then in our interpretation the
isolated real photon hides what we call the two monopoles. They are manifested
in the real polarized photons being independent but united through their root
as system and antisystem.
