The charged-current quasi-elastic scattering of muon neutrino on the oxygen
target is analyzed for neutrino energy up to 2.5 GeV using the Relativistic
Distorted-Wave Impulse Approximation (RDWIA). The inclusive cross sections
$d^2\sigma/dQ^2$, calculated within the RDWIA, are lower than the Relativistic
Fermi Gas Model (RFGM) results in the range of the square of four-momentum
transfer $Q^2\leq$0.2 (GeV/c)$^2$. We have also studied the nuclear-model
dependence of the neutrino energy reconstruction accuracy using the
charged-current quasi-elastic events with no detector effects and background.
We found that for one-track events the accuracy is nuclear-model dependent for
neutrino energy up to 2.5 GeV.
