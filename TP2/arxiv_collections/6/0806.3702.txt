We derive optimal regularity, in both time and space, for solutions of the
Cauchy problem related to a degenerate differential equation in a Banach space
X. Our results exhibit a sort of prevalence for space regularity, in the sense
that the higher is the order of regularity with respect to space, the lower is
the corresponding order of regularity with respect to time.
