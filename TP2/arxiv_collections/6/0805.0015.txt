We present a low-noise, high modulation-bandwidth design for a laser current
driver with excellent long term stability. The driver improves upon the
commonly-used Hall-Libbrecht design. The current driver can be operated
remotely by way of a micro-processing unit, which controls the current set
point digitally. This allows precise repeatability and improved accuracy and
stability. It also allows the driver to be placed near the laser for reduced
noise and for lower phase lag when using the modulation input. We present the
theory of operation for our driver in detail, and give a thorough
characterization of its stability, noise, set point accuracy and repeatability,
temperature dependence, transient response, and modulation bandwidth.
