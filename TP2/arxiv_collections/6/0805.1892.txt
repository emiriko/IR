The instanton representation of Plebanski gravity admits a natural canonical
structure where the (densitized) eigenvalues of the CDJ matrix are the basic
momentum space variables. Canonically conjugate configuration variables exist
for six distinct configurations in the full theory, referred to as quantizable
configurations. The CDJ matrix relates to the Petrov classification and
principal null directions of spacetime, which we directly correlate to these
quantizable degrees of freedom. The implication of this result is the ability
to perform a quantization procedure for spacetimes of Petrov Type I, D, and O,
using the instanton representation.
