It has been known that, keeping the outer boundary coordinates intact before
and after a coordinate transformation is a sufficient condition for obtaining a
reflectionless transformation medium. Here we prove that it is also a necessary
condition for reflectionless transformation media in an isotropic and
homogenous background. Our analytical results show that the outer boundary
coordinates of a reflectionless transformation medium must be the same as the
original coordinates with a combination of rotation and displacement, which is
equivalent to situation that the boundary coordinates are kept intact before
and after transformation.
