We investigate the spectral statistics of chaotic quasi one dimensional
systems such as long wires. To do so we represent the spectral correlation
function $R(\epsilon)$ through derivatives of a generating function and
semiclassically approximate the latter in terms of periodic orbits. In contrast
to previous work we obtain both non-oscillatory and oscillatory contributions
to the correlation function. Both types of contributions are evaluated to
leading order in $1/\epsilon$ for systems with and without time-reversal
invariance. Our results agree with expressions from the theory of disordered
systems.
