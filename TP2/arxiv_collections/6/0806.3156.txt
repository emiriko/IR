The determination of $\alpha_s$ from hadronic $\tau$ decays is revisited,
with a special emphasis on the question of higher-order perturbative
corrections and different possibilities of resumming the perturbative series
with the renormalisation group: fixed-order (FOPT) vs. contour-improved
perturbation theory (CIPT). The difference between these approaches has evolved
into a systematic effect that does not go away as higher orders in the
perturbative expansion are added. We attempt to clarify under which
circumstances one or the other approach provides a better approximation to the
true result. To this end, we propose to describe the Adler function series by a
model that includes the exactly known coefficients and theoretical constraints
on the large-order behaviour originating from the operator product expansion
and the renormalisation group. Within this framework we find that while CIPT is
unable to account for the fully resummed series, FOPT smoothly approaches the
Borel sum, before the expected divergent behaviour sets in at even higher
orders. Employing FOPT up to the fifth order to determine $\alpha_s$ in the
$\MSb$ scheme, we obtain $\alpha_s(M_\tau)=0.320 {}^{+0.012}_{-0.007}$,
corresponding to $\alpha_s(M_Z) = 0.1185 {}^{+0.0014}_{-0.0009}$. Improving
this result by including yet higher orders from our model yields
$\alpha_s(M_\tau)=0.316 \pm 0.006$, which after evolution leads to
$\alpha_s(M_Z) = 0.1180 \pm 0.0008$. Our results are lower than previous values
obtained from $\tau$ decays.
