The recent claim of the '5 sigma' observation of the Greisen and Zatzepin and
Kuzmin cut-off by the HiRes group based on their nine years data is a
significant step toward the eventual solution of the one of the most intriguing
questions which has been present in physics for more than forty years. However
the word 'significance' is used in the mentioned paper in the sense which is
not quite obvious. In the present paper we persuade that this claim is a little
premature.
