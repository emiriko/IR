Superstring theory involves a single unifying superstring current for bosons
and fermions that in the low-energy limit generalizes the Klein-Gordon (not the
Dirac) current. By adopting a relativistic-covariant probabilistic
interpretation of the current, the low-energy limit implies electron
interference patterns that, under certain conditions, differ from those
predicted by the Dirac current.
