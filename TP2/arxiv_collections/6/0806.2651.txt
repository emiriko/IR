We use a graphical representation of stabilizer states to describe, simply
and efficiently, the effect of measurements of Pauli products on stabilizer
states. This work complements our earlier work [Phys. Rev. A 77, 042307
(2008)], which described in graphical terms the action of Clifford operations
on stabilizer states.
