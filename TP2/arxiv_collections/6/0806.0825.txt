Studies of the production of W/Z + jets are important for a variety of
reasons. W/Z + inclusive jets is a valuable high statistics sample that allows
one to probe the validity of predictions from perturbative Quantum
Chromodynamics (pQCD) at both leading and next-to-leading order. W/Z + heavy
flavor jets (those originating from b or c production) is a significant
background to top and Higgs at the Tevatron and will play an important role at
the LHC as well. Herein the latest Tevatron results on these production
mechanisms are reviewed with an emphasis on comparison of data results to the
latest theoretical models.
