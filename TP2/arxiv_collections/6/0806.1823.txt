Prompted by a recent demonstration that the structure of a single
quark-lepton generation may be understood via a Dirac-like linearization of the
form p^2+x^2, we analyze the corresponding Clifford algebra in some detail.
After classifying all elements of this algebra according to their U(1) x SU(3)
and SU(2) transformation properties, we identify the element which might be
associated with the concept of lepton mass. This element is then transformed
into a corresponding element for a single coloured quark. It is shown that -
although none of the three thus obtained individual quark mass elements is
rotationally invariant - the rotational invariance of the quark mass term is
restored when the sum over quark colours is performed.
