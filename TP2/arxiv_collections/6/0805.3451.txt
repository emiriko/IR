Carrier relaxation due to both optical and nonradiative intraband transitions
in silicon quantum dots in SiO$_2$ has been considered. Interaction of confined
holes with optical phonons has been studied. The Huang-Rhys factor is
calculated for such transitions. The probability of intraband transition of a
confined hole emitting several optical phonons is estimated.
