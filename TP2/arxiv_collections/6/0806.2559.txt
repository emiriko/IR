We derive general results on the small deviation behavior for some classes of
iterated processes. This allows us, in particular, to calculate the rate of the
small deviations for $n$-iterated Brownian motions and, more generally, for the
iteration of $n$ fractional Brownian motions. We also give a new and correct
proof of some results in E. Nane, Laws of the iterated logarithm for
$\alpha$-time Brownian motion, Electron. J. Probab. 11 (2006), no. 18,
434--459.
