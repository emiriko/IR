The hyperfine splitting of the ground state of H-, Li-, and B-like ions is
investigated in details within the range of nuclear numbers Z = 7-28. The
rigorous QED approach together with the large-scale configuration-interaction
Dirac-Fock-Sturm method are employed for the evaluation of the
interelectronic-interaction contributions of first and higher orders in 1/Z.
The screened QED corrections are evaluated to all orders in (\alpha Z)
utilizing an effective potential approach. The influence of nuclear
magnetization distribution is taken into account within the single-particle
nuclear model. The specific differences between the hyperfine-structure level
shifts of H- and Li-like ions, where the uncertainties associated with the
nuclear structure corrections are significantly reduced, are also calculated.
