The manipulation of single magnetic molecules may enable new strategies for
high-density information storage and quantum-state control. However, progress
in these areas depends on developing techniques for addressing individual
molecules and controlling their spin. Here we report success in making
electrical contact to individual magnetic N@C60 molecules and measuring spin
excitations in their electron tunneling spectra. We verify that the molecules
remain magnetic by observing a transition as a function of magnetic field which
changes the spin quantum number and also the existence of nonequilibrium
tunneling originating from low-energy excited states. From the tunneling
spectra, we identify the charge and spin states of the molecule. The measured
spectra can be reproduced theoretically by accounting for the exchange
interaction between the nitrogen spin and electron(s) on the C60 cage.
