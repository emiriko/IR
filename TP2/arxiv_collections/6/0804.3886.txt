Study of the fusion reactions between hydrogen isotopes in muonic molecules
is the first example of the accurate accounting of the nucleus charge screening
by a muon in the fusion process. At LUNA installation the measurements of
astrophysical reaction cross sections were extended down to collision energies
of a few keV. The screening by atomic electrons of the target became
substantial. The possibility to look over screening from unbound electrons is
given by metal-hydrides used as targets in dd reaction measurements. The
classical Debye screening in plasma, applied to quasi-free electrons in metal,
provides an explanation of unexpectedly large screening potentials found for
some metals in the research through the Periodic table of elements.
