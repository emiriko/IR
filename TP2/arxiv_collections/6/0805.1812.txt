We consider a pair of bosonic particles in a one-dimensional tight-binding
periodic potential described by the Hubbard model with attractive or repulsive
on-site interaction. We derive explicit analytic expressions for the
two-particle states, which can be classified as (i) scattering states of
asymptotically free particles and (ii) interaction-bound dimer states. Our
results provide a very transparent framework to understand the properties of
interacting pairs of particles in a lattice.
