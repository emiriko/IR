State redistribution allows one party to optimally send part of her state to
another party. Here we show that this can be derived simply from two
applications of coherent state-merging. This provides a protocol whereby a
middle party acts as a relay station to help another party more efficiently
transfer quantum states. This also gives a protocol for state splitting and the
reverse Shannon theorem (assisted or unassisted by side information), and
allows one to use less classical communication for partial state-merging using
a sub-protocol we call ebit repackaging. Thus state-merging generates the other
primitives of quantum communication theory, reducing the hierarchy between
members of the first family of quantum protocols.
