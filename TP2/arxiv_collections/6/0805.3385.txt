At present, it is widely believed that the phenomenon of the gamma-ray burst
redshift is cosmological origin. From a theoretical point of view, this
redshift has either a cosmological or a cause that is related to gravity.
However, the question of whether the gamma-ray burst redshift has a
cosmological origin or not should be answerable in no uncertain terms because
both the spectrum characteristics and the count distribution law arising from
the two distinct settings are completely different. If the redshift of GRB is
generated by gravity, then the afterglow spectrum will certainly contain both
the gravitational redshits (containing emission and absorption feature) and
Doppler absorption redshift, and hold a definite relation between the two
redshifts. In this paper, we present nine direct and decisive evidences to show
that the gamma-ray burst redshift is indeed generated by gravity of neutron
stars in their merging process; in which, 114 GRBs' redshifts showed that the
statistical count distribution law for the two kinds redshift is the same (with
errors less than 1.5%), and 74 spectral line redshifts of two GRBs showed that
the relation between the two kinds redshift is completely correct (with errors
less than 0.0061%).
