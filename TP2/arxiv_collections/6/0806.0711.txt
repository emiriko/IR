In this work, Laser-induced magnetization dynamics of nanostructured nickel
films is investigated. The influence of the nanosize is discussed considering
the time-scale of hundreds of femtoseconds as well as the GHz regime. While no
nanosize effect is observed on the short time-scale, the excited magnetic mode
in the GHz regime can be identified by comparison with micromagnetic
simulations. The thickness dependence reveals insight on the dipole interaction
between single nickel structures. Also, transient reflectivity changes are
discussed.
