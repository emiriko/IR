We examine the nature of electroweak Baryogenesis when the Higgs boson's
properties are modified by the effects of new physics. We utilize the effective
potential to one loop (ring improving the finite temperature perturbative
expansion) while retaining parametrically enhanced dimension six operators of
O(v^2/f^2) in the Higgs sector. These parametrically enhanced operators would
be present if the Higgs is a pseudo-goldstone boson of a new physics sector
with a characteristic mass scale Lambda ~ TeV, a coupling constant (4 pi) > g >
1 and a strong decay constant scale f = Lambda/g. We find that generically the
effect of new physics of this form allows a sufficiently first order
electro-weak phase transition so that the produced Baryon number can avoid
washing out, and has enhanced effects due to new sources CP violation. We also
improve the description of the electroweak phase transition in perturbation
theory by determining the thermal mass eigenstate basis of the standard model
gauge boson fields. This improves the calculation of the finite temperature
effects through incorporating mixing in the determination of the vector boson
thermal masses of the standard model. These effects are essential to
determining the nature of the phase transition in the standard model and are of
interest in our Pseudo-Goldstone Baryogenesis scenario.
