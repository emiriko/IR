The strange quark contribution to the vector and axial form factors of the
nucleon has been determined for momentum transfers in the range $0.45<Q^2<1.0$
GeV$^2$. The results are obtained via a combined analysis of
forward-scattering, parity-violating elastic $\vec{e}p$ asymmetry data from the
G0 and HAPPEx experiments at Jefferson Lab, and elastic $\nu p$ and $\bar{\nu}
p$ scattering data from Experiment 734 at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The
parity-violating asymmetries measured in elastic $\vec{e}p$ scattering at
forward angles establish a relationship between the strange vector form factors
$G_E^s$ and $G_M^s$, with little sensitivity to the strange axial form factor
$G_A^s$. On the other hand, elastic neutrino scattering at low $Q^2$ is
dominated by the axial form factor, with some significant sensitivity to the
vector form factors as well. Combination of the two data sets allows the
simultaneous extraction of $G_E^s$, $G_M^s$, and $G_A^s$ over a significant
range of $Q^2$ for the very first time. The $Q^2$-dependence of the strange
axial form factor suggests that the strange quark contribution to the proton
spin, $\Delta s$, is negative.
