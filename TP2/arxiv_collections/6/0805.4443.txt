We rewrite the Bagger-Lambert action for any Lie 3-algebra as a standard
Chern- Simons action coupled to matter. We use this action to compute
self-energies and vertex corrections at one-loop order. Non-renormalization of
the coupling constant comes out as a direct consequence of the Lie 3-algebra
structure underlying the Lie algebra.
