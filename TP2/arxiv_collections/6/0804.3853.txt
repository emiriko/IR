We introduce a signal processing model for signals in non-white noise, where
the exact noise spectrum is a priori unknown. The model is based on a Student's
t distribution and constitutes a natural generalization of the widely used
normal (Gaussian) model. This way, it allows for uncertainty in the noise
spectrum, or more generally is also able to accommodate outliers (heavy-tailed
noise) in the data. Examples are given pertaining to data from gravitational
wave detectors.
