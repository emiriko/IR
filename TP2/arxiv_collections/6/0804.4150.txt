We study the complexity of computing the projection of an arbitrary
$d$-polytope along $k$ orthogonal vectors for various input and output forms.
We show that if $d$ and $k$ are part of the input (i.e. not a constant) and we
are interested in output-sensitive algorithms, then in most forms the problem
is equivalent to enumerating vertices of polytopes, except in two where it is
NP-hard. In two other forms the problem is trivial. We also review the
complexity of computing projections when the projection directions are in some
sense non-degenerate. For full-dimensional polytopes containing origin in the
interior, projection is an operation dual to intersecting the polytope with a
suitable linear subspace and so the results in this paper can be dualized by
interchanging vertices with facets and projection with intersection. To compare
the complexity of projection and vertex enumeration, we define new complexity
classes based on the complexity of Vertex Enumeration.
