For a multipartite correlation experiment with an arbitrary number of
settings and any spectral type of outcomes at each site, we introduce a single
general representation incorporating in a unique manner all Bell-type
inequalities for either correlation functions or joint probabilities that have
been introduced or will be introduced in the literature. Specifying this
general representation for correlation functions, we prove that the form of any
correlation Bell-type inequality does not depend on a spectral type of observed
outcomes, in particular, on their numbers at different sites, and is determined
only by extremal values of outcomes at each site. We also specify the general
form of bounds in Bell-type inequalities on joint probabilities. Our approach
to the derivation of Bell-type inequalities is universal, concise and can be
applied to a multipartite correlation experiment with outcomes of any spectral
type, discrete or continuous. We, in particular, prove that, for an N-partite
quantum state, possibly, infinite dimensional, admitting the 2x...x2-setting
LHV description, the Mermin-Klyshko inequality holds for any two bounded
quantum observables per site, not necessarily dichotomic.
