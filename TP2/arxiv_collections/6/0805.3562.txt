Finite temperature orbital state in a ferromagnetic Mott insulator with
triply-degenerate $t_{2g}$ orbital is investigated numerically. We employ the
quantum Monte Carlo simulation with the loop algorithm. Indications for
conventional staggered-type orbital order are not remarkable down to the lowest
temperature to which the present simulation can get access. Physical parameters
monitoring the off-diagonal orbital order, which is characterized by a linear
combination of the $(d_{yz}, d_{zx}, d_{xy})$ orbital-wave functions with equal
weights, are not conspicuous. It is found that a orbital gap-like behavior
appears in the uniform orbital susceptibility. This is supported by a threshold
behavior in the staggered correlation function in a calculation with the
additional Ising-type interaction. Some rigorous remarks for the long-range
orbital order are also presented.
