The flux pinning mechanism of NdO0.82F0.18FeAs superconductor made under high
pressure, with a critical temperature, Tc, of 51 K, has been investigated in
detail in this work. The field dependence of the magnetization and the
temperature dependence of the magnetoresistivity were measured in fields up to
13 T. The field dependence of the critical current density, Jc(B), was analyzed
within the collective pinning model. A crossover field, Bsb, from the single
vortex to the small vortex bundle pinning regime was observed. The temperature
dependence of Bsb(T) is in good agreement with the delta-l pinning mechanism,
i.e., pinning associated with fluctuations in the charge-carrier mean free
path, l. Analysis of resistive transition broadening revealed that thermally
activated flux flow is found to be responsible for the resistivity contribution
in the vicinity of Tc. The activation energy U0/kB is 2000 K in low fields and
scales as B (-1/3) over a wide field range. Our results indicate that the
NdO0.82F0.18FeAs has stronger intrinsic pinning than Bi-2212 and also stronger
than MgB2 for H > 8 T.
