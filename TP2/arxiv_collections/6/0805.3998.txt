We investigate the anisotropy of magnetic reversal and current-driven domain
wall motion in annealed Ga_0.95Mn_0.05As thin films and Hall bar devices with
perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. Hall bars with current direction along the
[110] and [1-10] crystallographic axes are studied. The [110] device shows
larger coercive field than the [1-10] device. Strong anisotropy is observed
during magnetic reversal between [110] and [1-10] directions. A power law
dependence is found for both devices between the critical current (JC) and the
magnetization (M), with J_C is proportional to M^2.6. The domain wall motion is
strongly influenced by the presence of local pinning centres.
