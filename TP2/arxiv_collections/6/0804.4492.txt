The Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state is a superconducting state
stabilized by a large Zeeman splitting between up- and down-spin electrons in a
singlet superconductor. In the absence of disorder, the superconducting order
parameter has a periodic spatial structure, with periodicity determined by the
Zeeman splitting. Using the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) approach, we investigate
the spatial profiles of the order parameters of FFLO states in a
two-dimensional s-wave superconductors with nonmagnetic impurities. The FFLO
state is found to survive under moderate disorder strength, and the order
parameter structure remains approximately periodic. The actual structure of the
order parameter depends on not only the Zeeman field, but also the disorder
strength and in particular the specific disorder configuration.
