The scattering cross section for a long-wavelength planar gravitational wave
impinging upon a rotating black hole is calculated, for the special case in
which the direction of incidence is aligned with the rotation axis. We show
that black hole rotation leads to a term in the cross section that is
proportional to $a\omega$. Hence, contrary to some claims, co-rotating and
counter-rotating helicities are scattered differently, and a partial
polarization is induced in an unpolarized incident wave.
  The scattering amplitudes are found via partial wave series. To compute the
series, two ingredients are required: phase shifts and spin-weighted spheroidal
harmonics. We show that the phase shifts may be found from low-frequency
solutions of the radial Teukolsky equation derived by Mano, Suzuki and
Takasugi. The spheroidal harmonics may be expanded in spherical harmonics; we
present expansions accurate to second order in $a \omega$. The two ingredients
are combined to give explicit expressions for the helicity-conserving and
helicity-reversing amplitudes, valid in the long-wavelength limit.
