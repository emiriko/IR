We apply the iterated edge state tracking algorithm to study the boundary
between laminar and turbulent dynamics in plane Couette flow at Re=400.
Perturbations that are not strong enough to become fully turbulent nor weak
enough to relaminarize tend towards a hyperbolic coherent structure in state
space, termed the edge state, which seems to be unique up to obvious continuous
shift symmetries. The results reported here show that in cases where a fixed
point has only one unstable direction, as for the lower branch solution in in
plane Couette flow, the iterated edge tracking algorithm converges to this
state. They also show that choice of initial state is not critical, and that
essentially arbitrary initial conditions can be used to find the edge state.
