The German Federal Ministry for Education and Research funded a major
terminology mapping initiative, which found its conclusion in 2007. The task of
this terminology mapping initiative was to organize, create and manage
'cross-concordances' between controlled vocabularies (thesauri, classification
systems, subject heading lists) centred around the social sciences but quickly
extending to other subject areas. 64 crosswalks with more than 500,000
relations were established. In the final phase of the project, a major
evaluation effort to test and measure the effectiveness of the vocabulary
mappings in an information system environment was conducted. The paper reports
on the cross-concordance work and evaluation results.
