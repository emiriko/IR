We consider the ``second-class current'' decay $\tau^-\to\pi^-\eta\nu_\tau$
from several points of view. We first focus on the decay rate as expected
within standard weak interaction and QCD due to isospin violation. The decay
contributions divide into $P$- and $S$-wave parts. The former can be reliably
estimated using the $\rho\eta\pi$ coupling inferred from the rates and
Dalitz-plot distributions of $\eta\to 3\pi$ decays. The somewhat larger
$S$-wave part, which was previously computed using chiral perturbation theory,
is estimated from a simple $\bar qq$ model. Both estimates of the $S$-wave part
depend on whether the $a_0(980)$ scalar particle is a $\bar qq$ or some other
(4-quark) state. Finally, we discuss genuinely new, non-$V-A$ scalar weak
interactions. The $\tau^-\to\pi^-\eta\nu_\tau$ decay provides information on
this question, which nicely complements that from precision $\beta$ decay
experiments. % In summary, we discuss the possible implications of putative
values of the branching fraction ${\cal B}(\tau^-\to\pi^-\eta\nu_\tau)$. In the
case of larger values, in particular of the $S$-wave part, not only will
detection of the decay be more likely and more reliable, its implications will
be more far-reaching and interesting.
