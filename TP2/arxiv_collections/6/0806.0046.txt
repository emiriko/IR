Quarkonia were predicted to be suppressed in the "hot" deconfined matter
known as the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP), but they were also seen to suffer from
"cold" nuclear matter effects (parton shadowing, nuclear absorption...). Both
at SPS and RHIC, suppression beyond nuclear effects was observed, but the
rapidity dependence of the RHIC result is not easy to interpret. I review here
the current status of these results, their possible interpretations and the new
measurements that could provide insights on quarkonia suppression. Some of them
were presented at this conference.
