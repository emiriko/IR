Research on photonics and metamaterials constantly challenges our intuitive
understanding of the behaviour of light. In recent years we have seen negative
refraction, focusing of light by a flat slab, a ``perfect'' prism, and an
``invisibility cloak'' [1-6]. It is generally understood that the cause of this
unusual behaviour is the strong (anomalous) dispersion, i.e., dependence of the
material properties on the frequency of light. Dispersion can be either due to
a natural microscopic resonance of the material as with surface
plasmons-polaritons, or due to an effective resonance (band-gap) of the
periodic lattice as in photonics [7-9]. Metamaterials take the better of the
two approaches representing a periodic array of designer subwavelength
particles tuned to resonate at a specific frequency-band. At present, however,
we have only a very basic understanding of the effect which a finite size of a
sample of a periodic photonic crystal or metamaterial has on the macroscopic
properties such as refraction. Yet every finite dielectric object is a
moderate-quality resonator whose eigenmodes form a virtual photonic lattice
with its own angular band-gaps and preferred directions of propagation. Here we
show that this virtual lattice produces nontrivial real effects and that even a
homogeneous dielectric resonator may refract negatively without either negative
or periodically modulated permittivity/permeability. We also propose a simple
way to control the period of this virtual photonic lattice by varying the
transverse dimension of the resonator. Our research shows the importance of
three-dimensional resonant phenomena in optics and may result in new optical
devices with unusual properties.
