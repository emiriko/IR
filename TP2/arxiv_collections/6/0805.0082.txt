We give a necessary and sufficient condition for a graph to have a
right-angled Artin group as its braid group for braid index $\ge 5$. In order
to have the necessity part, graphs are organized into small classes so that one
of homological or cohomological characteristics of right-angled Artin groups
can be applied. Finally we show that a given graph is planar iff the first
homology of its 2-braid group is torsion-free and leave the corresponding
statement for $n$-braid groups as a conjecture along with few other conjectures
about graphs whose braid groups of index $\le 4$ are right-angled Artin groups.
