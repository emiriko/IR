The spinel MnV_2O_4 is a two-sublattice ferrimagnet, with site A occupied by
the Mn^{2+} ion and site B by the V^{3+} ion. The magnon of the system, the
transversal fluctuation of the total magnetization, is a complicated mixture of
the sublattice A and B transversal magnetic fluctuations. As a result, the
magnons' fluctuations suppress in a different way the manganese and vanadium
magnetic orders and one obtains two phases. At low temperature (0,T^*) the
magnetic orders of the Mn and V ions contribute to the magnetization of the
system, while at the high temperature (T^*,T_N), the vanadium magnetic order is
suppressed by magnon fluctuations, and only the manganese ions have non-zero
spontaneous magnetization. A modified spin-wave theory is developed to describe
the two phases and to calculate the magnetization as a function of temperature.
The anomalous $M(T)$ curve reproduces the experimentally obtained ZFC
magnetization.
