Quantum computers are predicted to utilize quantum states to perform memory
and to process tasks far faster than those of conventional classical computers.
In this paper we show a new road towards building fault tolerance quantum
computer by tuning quantum tunneling effect of the degenerate quantum states in
topological order, instead of by braiding anyons. Using a designer Hamiltonian
- the Wen-Plaquette model as an example, we study its quantum tunneling effect
of the toric codes and show how to control the toric code to realize
topological quantum computation (TQC). In particular, we give a proposal to the
measurement of TQC. In the end the realization of the Wen-Plaquette model in
cold atoms is discussed.
