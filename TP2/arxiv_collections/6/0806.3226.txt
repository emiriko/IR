A new type of simplified cloaks with matched exterior boundaries is proposed.
The cloak uses non-magnetic material for the TM polarization and can function
with a relatively thin thickness. It is shown that the $zero^{th}$ order
scattering of such cloak is dominant among all cylindrical scattering terms. A
gap is added at the cloak's inner surface to eliminate the zero-th order
scattering, through the mechanism of scattering resonance. The reduction in
scattering is relatively smooth, indicating that the proposed scattering
reduction method has good tolerance to perturbations. Numerical simulations
also confirm that the proposed structure has very low scattering.
