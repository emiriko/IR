Photoemission spectroscopy is used to investigate the electronic structure of
the newly discovered iron-based superconductors LaFeAsO_{1-x}F_x and
LaFePO_{1-x}F_x. Line shapes of the Fe 2p core-level spectra suggest an
itinerant character of Fe 3d electrons. The valence-band spectra are generally
consistent with band-structure calculations except for the shifts of Fe
3d-derived peaks toward the Fermi level. From spectra taken in the Fe 3p -> 3d
core-absorption region, we have obtained the experimental Fe 3d partial density
of states, and explained it in terms of a band-structure calculation with a
phenomenological self-energy correction, yielding a mass renormalization factor
of ~< 2.
