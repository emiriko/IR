Modulational instability in a photorefractive medium is studied in the
presence of two wave mixing. We then propose and derive a model for forward
four wave mixing in the photorefractive medium and investigate the modulational
instability induced by four wave mixing effects. By using the standard linear
stability analysis the instability gain is obtained. In both the cases, the
geometry is such that the effect of self-phase-modulation self-focusing is
suppressed and only the holographic focusing nonlinearity is acting.
