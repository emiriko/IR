The implications of parton rearrangement processes on the dynamics of
ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions have been investigated. A microscopic
transport approach, namely the quark gluon string model (QGSM) which has been
extended for a locally density-dependent partonic rearrangement and fusion
procedure served as the tool for this investigations. The model emulates
effectively the dynamics of a strongly coupled quark plasma and final hadronic
interactions. Main QGSM results on anisotropic flow components v1 and v2 at top
RHIC energy are compiled. Predictions for the pseudorapidity dependence of
directed and elliptic flow in Pb+Pb collisions under LHC conditions are
presented.
