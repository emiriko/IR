We review the detection capabilities in the forward direction of the various
LHC experiments together with the associated physics programme. A selection of
measurements accessible with near-beam instrumentation in various sectors (and
extensions) of the Standard Model (SM) is outlined, including QCD (diffractive
and elastic scattering, low-x parton dynamics, hadronic Monte Carlos for
cosmic-rays), electroweak processes in gamma-gamma interactions, and Higgs
physics (vector-boson-fusion and central exclusive production).
