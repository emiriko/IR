While it is well known which curricular practices can improve student
performance on measures of conceptual understanding, the sustaining of these
practices and the role of faculty members in implementing these practices are
less well understood. We present a study of the hand-off of Tutorials in
Introductory Physics from initial adopters to other instructors at the
University of Colorado, including traditional faculty not involved in physics
education research. The study examines the impact of implementation of
Tutorials on student conceptual learning across eight first-semester, and seven
second-semester courses, for fifteen faculty over twelve semesters, and
includes roughly 4000 students. It is possible to demonstrate consistently
high, and statistically indistinguishable, student learning gains for different
faculty members; however, such results are not the norm, and appear to rely on
a variety of factors. Student performance varies by faculty background -
faculty involved in, or informed by physics education research, consistently
post higher student learning gains than less-informed faculty. Student
performance in these courses also varies by curricula used - all semesters in
which the research-based Tutorials and Learning Assistants are used have higher
student learning gains than those semesters that rely on non-research based
materials and do not employ Learning Assistants.
