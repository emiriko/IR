We investigate the consequences of space-momentum correlations in quark
phase-space distributions for coalescence processes at the hadronization
transition. Thus far it has been proved difficult to reconcile such
correlations with the empirically observed constituent quark number scaling
(CQNS) at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC). To address this problem
we combine our earlier developed quark recombination model with quark
phase-space distributions computed from relativistic Langevin simulations in an
expanding Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). Hadronization is based on resonance
formation within a Boltzmann equation which recovers thermal equilibrium and
obeys energy conservation in the quark-coalescence process, while the fireball
background is adjusted to hydrodynamic simulations of semi-central Au-Au
collisions at RHIC. To facilitate the applicability of the Langevin process, we
focus on strange and charm quarks. Their interactions in the QGP are modeled
using leading-order perturbative QCD augmented by effective Lagrangians with
resonances which smoothly merge into hadronic states formed at T_c. The
interaction strength is adjusted to reproduce the empirical saturation value
for the quark-elliptic flow, v_{2,q}^{sat}~7-8%. The resulting phi and J/\psi
elliptic flow recover CQNS over a large range in transverse momentum (p_T)
within a few percent. As a function of transverse kinetic energy, both the
quark spectra from the Langevin simulations and the meson spectra generated via
resonance recombination recover CQNS from zero to at least 3 GeV.
