Using a continuum model, expressions for the elastic energy, defect energy,
structure entropy, and mixing entropy of carbon nanocones are proposed
analytically. The optimal conformation of carbon nanocones is studied by
imposing minimization of free energy and analyzing the effects that the
buckling of a nanocone's walls have during formation. The model explains the
experimentally observed preference of 19.2 degrees for the cone angle of carbon
nanocone. Furthermore, it predicts the optimal conformation of carbon nanocones
to result in a cone angle of 19.2 degrees, radius of 0.35 nm, and critical
length of 24 nm, all of which agree very well with experimental observations.
