We revisit recent claims about the instability of non-rotating tunnel coupled
annular Bose-Einstein condensates leading to the emergence of angular-momentum
Josephson oscillation [Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 050401 (2007),
arXiv:quant-ph/0609133v2]. It was predicted that all stationary states with
uniform density become unstable in certain parameter regimes. By careful
analysis, we arrive at a different conclusion. We show that there is a stable
non-rotating and uniform ground state for any value of the tunnel coupling and
repulsive interactions. The instability of an excited state with $\pi$ phase
difference between the condensates can be interpreted in terms of the familiar
snake instability. We further discuss the sign of the tunnel coupling through a
separating barrier, which carries significance for the nature of the stationary
states. It is found to always be negative for physical reasons.
