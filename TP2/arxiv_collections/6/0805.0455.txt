This paper describes a new method, HGV2C, for pattern analysis. The HGV2C
method involves the construction of a computer ego (CE) based on an individual
object that can be either a part of the system under analysis or a newly
created object based on a certain hypothesis. The CE provides a capability to
analyze data from a specific standpoint, e.g. from a viewpoint of a certain
object. The CE is constructed from two identical copies of a query object, and
its functioning mechanism involves: a hypothesis-parameter (HP) and
infothyristor (IT). HP is a parameter that is introduced into an existing set
of parameters. The HP value for one of the clones of a query object is set to
equal 1, whereas for another clone it is greater than 1. The IT is based on the
previously described algorithm of iterative averaging and performs three
functions: 1) computation of a similarity matrix for the group of three objects
including two clones of a query object and a target object; 2) division of the
group into two alternative subgroups; and 3) a successive increase of the HP
weight in the totality of all the parameters. Initially, both clones of the
query object appear together in one of the subgroups as all of their parameter
values, except the HP, are identical. At a certain point of the HP
multiplication, one of the clones moves to the group of the target object. A
respective number of the HP multiplications represents the dissimilarity (D)
between the query and target objects. The product of D multiplied by the
difference in HP values of the clones is strictly constant and linearly
increases as the difference in HP values of the clones decreases. This new
approach to knowledge representation is demonstrated on the example of
population pyramids of 220 countries.
