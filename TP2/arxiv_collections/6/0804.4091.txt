We analyse nonperturbatively signal transmission patterns in Green's
functions of interacting quantum fields. Quantum field theory is re-formulated
in terms of the nonlinear quantum-statistical response of the field. This
formulation applies equally to interacting relativistic fields and
nonrelativistic models. Of crucial importance is that all causality properties
to be expected of a response formulation indeed hold. Being by construction
equivalent to Schwinger's closed-time-loop formalism, this formulation is also
shown to be related naturally to both Kubo's linear response and Glauber's
macroscopic photodetection theories, being a unification of the two with
generalisation to the nonlinear quantum-statistical response problem. In this
paper we introduce response formulation of bosons; response reformulation of
fermions will be subject of a separate paper.
