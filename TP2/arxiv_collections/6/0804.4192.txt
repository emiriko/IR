We study a new class of scenarios with the gaugino mass unification at the
weak scale. The general condition is first derived for the unification to
occur. Among the general cases, a particular attention is drawn to the mirage
gauge mediation where the low-energy mass spectrum is governed by the mirage of
unified gauge coupling which is seen by low-energy observers. The gaugino
masses have natural and stable low-scale unification. The mass parameters of
scalar quarks and leptons are given by gauge couplings but exhibit no large
mass hierarchy. They are non-universal even when mediated at the gauge coupling
unification scale. In addition, the gravitino is rather heavy and not the
lightest superparticle. These facts are in contrast to existing gauge and
mirage mediation models. We also present several explicit models for
dynamically realizing the TeV-scale unification.
