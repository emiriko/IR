The effect of mechanical fatigue on structural performances of gold devices
is investigated. The pull-in voltage of special testing micro-systems is
monitored during the cyclical load application. The mechanical collapse is
identified as a dramatic loss of mechanical strength of the specimen. The
fatigue limit is estimated through the stair-case method by means of the
pull-in voltage measurements. Measurements are performed by means of the
optical interferometric technique.
