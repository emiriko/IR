Separately continuous bihomomorphisms on a product of convergence or
topological groups occur with great frequency. Of course, in general, these
need not be jointly continuous. In this paper, we exhibit some results of
Banach-Steinhaus type and use these to derive joint continuity from separate
continuity. The setting of convergence groups offers two advantages. First, the
continuous convergence structure is a powerful tool in many duality arguments.
Second, local compactness and first countability, the usual requirements for
joint continuity, are available in much greater abundance for convergence
groups.
