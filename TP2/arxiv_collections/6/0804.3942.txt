Here we report the photoemission studies of intercalation process of Fe
underneath graphene layer on Ni(111). The process of intercalation was
monitored via XPS of corresponding core levels and UPS of the graphene-derived
$\pi$ states in the valence band. \textit{fcc}-Fe films with thickness of 2-5
monolayers at the interface between graphene and Ni(111) form epitaxial
magnetic layer passivated from the reactive environment, like for example
oxygen gas.
