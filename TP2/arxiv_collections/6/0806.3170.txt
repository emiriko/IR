Using the stationary lightcone perturbation theory, we propose the complete
and careful derivation the JIMWLK equation. We show that the rigorous treatment
requires the knowledge of a boosted wave function with second order accuracy.
Previous wave function approaches are incomplete and implicitly used the time
ordered perturbation theory, which requires a usage of an external target
field.
