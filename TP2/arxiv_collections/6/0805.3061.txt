Neutrino nature and absolute mass scale are major questions in particle
physics which cannot be addressed by the present neutrino oscillation program.
To answer these two questions, several neutrinoless double beta decay
experiments are underway or planed for the near future. These experiments,
mainly use bolometric techniques or gaseous counters coupled with scintillator
detectors. The energy resolution is better in bolometric experiments but
experiments coupling tracking with calorimetry have the advantage of observing
the two electron tracks and remove many background sources. Here, we present a
proposal of using nuclear emulsions to observe double beta decays. This
technique has the advantage of precise tracking and vertexing even for low
energy electrons.
