We performed non-degenerate pump-probe experiments on a GaAs/AlAs photonic
structure. We switched the photonic properties using the optical Kerr effect
and free carriers excited by three photon absorption. From these measurements
we extracted the non-degenerate Kerr coefficients over a broad wavelength range
and we extracted the three photon absorption coefficient for GaAs at three
wavelengths in the near infrared. We show that the optical Kerr effect is large
enough to switch a cavity resonance with a high \emph{Q} ($Q>1000$) photonic
cavity.
