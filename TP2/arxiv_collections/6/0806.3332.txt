A traditional assumption underlying most data converters is that the signal
should be sampled at a rate exceeding twice the highest frequency. This
statement is based on a worst-case scenario in which the signal occupies the
entire available bandwidth. In practice, many signals are sparse so that only
part of the bandwidth is used. In this paper, we develop methods for low-rate
sampling of continuous-time sparse signals in shift-invariant (SI) spaces,
generated by m kernels with period T. We model sparsity by treating the case in
which only k out of the m generators are active, however, we do not know which
k are chosen. We show how to sample such signals at a rate much lower than m/T,
which is the minimal sampling rate without exploiting sparsity. Our approach
combines ideas from analog sampling in a subspace with a recently developed
block diagram that converts an infinite set of sparse equations to a finite
counterpart. Using these two components we formulate our problem within the
framework of finite compressed sensing (CS) and then rely on algorithms
developed in that context. The distinguishing feature of our results is that in
contrast to standard CS, which treats finite-length vectors, we consider
sampling of analog signals for which no underlying finite-dimensional model
exists. The proposed framework allows to extend much of the recent literature
on CS to the analog domain.
