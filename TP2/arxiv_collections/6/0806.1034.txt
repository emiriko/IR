The paper concerns performance analysis of a steganographic method, dedicated
primarily for VoIP, which was recently filed for patenting under the name LACK.
The performance of the method depends on the procedure of inserting covert data
into the stream of audio packets. After a brief presentation of the LACK
method, the paper focuses on analysis of the dependence of the insertion
procedure on the probability distribution of VoIP call duration.
