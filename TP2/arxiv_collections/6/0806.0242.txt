The suppression of hadron p_T spectra in high energy central heavy-ion
collisions compared to proton-proton collisions, referred to as
'jet-quenching', is currently attributed to partonic energy loss in the hot
medium created in the collision. The RHIC experiments show that at large enough
p_T, hadron quenching is strong, and of similar magnitude for light and heavy
flavours. This point is difficult to understand in a parton energy loss
scenario, where the energy loss is believed to be dominantly radiative, and
quantitatively different for light partons and heavy quarks: gluon radiation
off a heavy quark is suppressed at small angles - within the so-called dead
cone - and a heavy quark suffers less radiative energy loss than a light
parton. In this context it is important to reconsider the collisional
contribution to partonic energy loss. Although it seems difficult to see how
collisional losses could substantially increase heavy flavour quenching without
simultaneously increasing light hadron quenching, it is theoretically important
to establish correct results for the heavy quark collisional energy loss.
