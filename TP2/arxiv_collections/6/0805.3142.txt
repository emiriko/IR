Beisert and Koroteev have recently found a bulk S-matrix corresponding to a
q-deformation of the centrally-extended su(2|2) algebra of AdS/CFT. We
formulate the associated Zamolodchikov-Faddeev algebra, using which we derive
factorizable boundary S-matrices that generalize those of Hofman and Maldacena.
