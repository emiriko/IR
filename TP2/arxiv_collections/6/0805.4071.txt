We compute diffractive structure functions for both protons and nuclei in the
framework of Color Glass Condensate models with impact parameter dependence.
These models have previously been shown to provide good agreement with
inclusive F_2 measurements and exclusive vector meson measurements at HERA. For
nuclei, they provide good (parameter free) agreement with the inclusive F_2
data. We demonstrate good agreement of our computations with HERA measurements
on inclusive diffraction. We extend our analysis to nuclei and predict the
pattern of enhancement and suppression of the diffractive structures functions
that can be measured at an Electron Ion Collider. We discuss how the impact
parameter dependence crucially affects our analysis, in particular for large
invariant masses at fixed Q^2.
