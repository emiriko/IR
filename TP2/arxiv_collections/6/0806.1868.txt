I begin by commenting on the most recent experimental compilation of D^0
mixing data, emphasizing the so-called 'strong phase' issue. This is followed
by a review of the theory underlying charm mixing, both Standard Model and New
Physics. The mechanism of R_p-violation is used to illustrate the methodology
for New Physics contributions and the relation of this to rare D^0 decays is
pointed out. Finally, I address the subject of CP-violating asymmetries by
describing some suggestions for future experimental studies and a recent
theoretical analysis of New Physics contributions.
