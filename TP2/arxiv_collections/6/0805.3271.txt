We utilize a 3D hydrodynamic model to provide the medium evolution for a
systematic comparison of jet energy-loss calculations in the BDMPS/ASW, HT and
AMY approaches. We find that the parameters of all three calculations can be
adjusted to provide a good description of inclusive data on $R_{AA}$ versus
transverse momentum. However, we do observe slight differences in their
predictions for the azimuthal angular dependence of $R_{AA}$ vs. $p_T$. We also
note that the value of the transport coefficient $\hat{q}$ needed in the three
approaches to describe the data differs significantly.
