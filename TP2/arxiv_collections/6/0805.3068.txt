We evaluate the $\pi N!N$, $\pi\Sigma\Sigma$, $\pi\Lambda\Sigma$, $K\Lambda
N$ and $K \Sigma N $ coupling constants and the corresponding monopole masses
in lattice QCD with two flavors of dynamical quarks. The parameters
representing the SU(3)-flavor symmetry are computed at the point where the
three quark flavors are degenerate at the physical $s$-quark mass. In
particular, we obtain $\alpha\equiv F/(F+D)=0.395(6)$. The quark-mass
dependences of the coupling constants are obtained by changing the $u$- and the
$d$-quark masses. We find that the SU(3)-flavor parameters have weak quark-mass
dependence and thus the SU(3)-flavor symmetry is broken by only a few percent
at each quark-mass point we consider.
