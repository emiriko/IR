Recently Affleck et al. derived the existence of Friedel oscillations in the
presence of a Kondo impurity. They supported their analytic derivation by
numerical calculations using Wilson's renormalization approach (NRG). In this
paper the size of the Friedel oscillations is calculated with the FAIR method
(Friedel Artificially Inserted Resonance) which has been recently developed.
The results of NRG and FAIR are compared. The development of Friedel
oscillations with a phase shift of pi/2 outside of the Kondo radius is
confirmed.
