We have searched for third generation leptoquarks (LQ3) using 1.05 inverse
femtobarns of data collected with the D0 detector at the Fermilab Tevatron
Collider operating at sqrt(s)=1.96 TeV. We set a 95% C.L. lower limit of 210
GeV on the mass of a scalar LQ3 state decaying solely to a b quark and a tau
lepton.
