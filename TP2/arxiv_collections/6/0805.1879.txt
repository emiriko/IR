Grazing scattering of neutral atoms from insulator surfaces is investigated
in the intermediate velocity range, in which interference effects have been
recently observed. To describe this process we introduce a distorted-wave
method, based on the use of the eikonal wave function, which takes into account
the phase of the scattering state along the classical projectile path. The
eikonal theory is applied to evaluate the angular distribution of few keV
helium atoms after impinging on a LiF(001) surface along low-index
crystallographic directions. The interest focuses on the role played by the
projectile polarization produced by cations and anions of the crystal surface.
For the considered collision system we found a polarization channel,
corresponding to the direction <110>, which is affected by this effect, while
for incidence in the direction <100> the polarization contribution is nearly
negligible. The proposed eikonal approach, including polarization effects,
provides angular projectile spectra in good agreement with the experimental
data.
