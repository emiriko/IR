The complex dynamics of intracellular calcium regulates cellular responses to
information encoded in extracellular signals. Here, we study the encoding of
these external signals in the context of the Li-Rinzel model. We show that by
control of biophysical parameters the information can be encoded in amplitude
modulation, frequency modulation or mixed (AM and FM) modulation. We briefly
discuss the possible implications of this new role of information encoding for
astrocytes.
