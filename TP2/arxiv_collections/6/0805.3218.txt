In this paper, we propose to combine formally noise and shape priors in
region-based active contours. On the one hand, we use the general framework of
exponential family as a prior model for noise. On the other hand, translation
and scale invariant Legendre moments are considered to incorporate the shape
prior (e.g. fidelity to a reference shape). The combination of the two prior
terms in the active contour functional yields the final evolution equation
whose evolution speed is rigorously derived using shape derivative tools.
Experimental results on both synthetic images and real life cardiac echography
data clearly demonstrate the robustness to initialization and noise,
flexibility and large potential applicability of our segmentation algorithm.
