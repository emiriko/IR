We study optimization of superconducting properties of inhomogeneous
nanowires. The main goal of this research is to find an optimized geometry that
allows one to maximize the desired property of superconductors, such as the
maximum value of local superconducting gap or total condensation energy. We
consider axially symmetric design of multi-layered nanowires with possibility
to adjust and change the layers thickness. We use numerical solution of the
Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations to obtain the local superconducting gap for
different arrangements of the inhomogeneous structures. The value of the
optimized properties can be up to 300% greater compared to a non-optimized
geometry. The optimized configuration of multilayers strongly depends on the
desired property one wants to optimize and on the number of layers in the
nanowire.
