We show that in the presence of spinodal instabilities which develop at a
first order phase transition, the fluctuations of conserved charges can be as
strong as those at the critical end point (CEP). In particular, the net baryon
number susceptibility diverges as the system crosses the isothermal spinodal
lines. This indicates that charge density fluctuations can be used not only to
probe the CEP but also the non--equilibrium first order chiral phase transition
in heavy ion collisions.
