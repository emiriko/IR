We develop farther a simple model of cold dark matter consisting of sterile
spin-1/2 fermions (sterinos), whose mass is generated by a nonzero vacuum
expectation value of a field of sterile scalars (sterons). In this model, the
sterile world of sterinos and sterons is conjectured to communicate with the
familiar Standard Model world not only through gravity, but also through a
photonic portal provided by a very weak effective interaction of the
electromagnetic field with sterino and steron fields. Then, an extra, finite
renormalization leading from the primary bare electric charge to a new bare
electric charge appears spontaneously. Due to the photonic portal, the cold
dark matter consisting of sterinos displays a phenomenon of quasi-magnetism,
what means that it can interact effectively with cosmic (and laboratory)
magnetic fields.
