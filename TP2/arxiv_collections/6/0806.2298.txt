The leading twist transverse momentum dependent parton distributions (TMDs)
are studied in a light-cone description of the nucleon where the Fock expansion
is truncated to consider only valence quarks. General analytic expressions are
derived in terms of the six amplitudes needed to describe the three-quark
sector of the nucleon light-cone wave function. Numerical calculations for the
T-even TMDs are presented in a light-cone constituent quark model, and the role
of the so-called pretzelosity is investigated to produce a nonspherical shape
of the nucleon.
