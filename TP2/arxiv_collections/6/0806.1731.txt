Einstein's general theory of relativity is the standard theory of gravity,
especially where the needs of astronomy, astrophysics, cosmology and
fundamental physics are concerned. As such, this theory is used for many
practical purposes involving spacecraft navigation, geodesy, and time transfer.
Here I review the foundations of general relativity, discuss recent progress in
the tests of relativistic gravity in the solar system, and present motivations
for the new generation of high-accuracy gravitational experiments. I discuss
the advances in our understanding of fundamental physics that are anticipated
in the near future and evaluate the discovery potential of the recently
proposed gravitational experiments.
