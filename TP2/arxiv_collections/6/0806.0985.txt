The Dirac wave equation for the electron soon lead to the recognition of the
Zitterbewegung. This was studied both by Schrodinger and Dirac. Later there
were further elegant and sometimes dissenting insights, from different authors.
We briefly review some of these developments. However in more recent times with
dark energy and noncommutative spacetime coming to centre stage, the earlier
studies of Zitterbewegung become questionable.
