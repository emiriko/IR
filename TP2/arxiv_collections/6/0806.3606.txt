We describe a technique that enables a strong, coherent coupling between a
single electronic spin qubit associated with a nitrogen-vacancy impurity in
diamond and the quantized motion of a magnetized nano-mechanical resonator tip.
This coupling is achieved via careful preparation of dressed spin states which
are highly sensitive to the motion of the resonator but insensitive to
perturbations from the nuclear spin bath. In combination with optical pumping
techniques, the coherent exchange between spin and motional excitations enables
ground state cooling and the controlled generation of arbitrary quantum
superpositions of resonator states. Optical spin readout techniques provide a
general measurement toolbox for the resonator with quantum limited precision.
