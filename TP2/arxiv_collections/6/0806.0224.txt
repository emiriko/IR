A dihydrogen Hamiltonian reduces to the Sommerfeld-Kratzer-potential, adapted
for field quantization according to old-quantum theory. Constants omega_e, k_e
and r_e needed for the H_2 vibrational system derive solely from hydrogen mass
m_H. For H_2, a first principles ionic Kratzer oscillator returns the covalent
bond energy within 0,08 % and all levels within 0,02 %, 30 times better than
the Dunham oscillator and as accurate as early ab initio QM.
