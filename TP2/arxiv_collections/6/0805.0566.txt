We consider a heterostructure of a metal and a paramagnetic Mott insulator
using an adaptation of dynamical mean field theory to describe inhomogeneous
systems. The metal can penetrate into the insulator via the Kondo effect. We
investigate the scaling properties of the metal-insulator interface close to
the critical point of the Mott insulator. At criticality, the quasiparticle
weight decays as 1/x^2 with distance x from the metal within our mean field
theory. Our numerical results (using the numerical renormalization group as an
impurity solver) show that the prefactor of this power law is extremely small.
