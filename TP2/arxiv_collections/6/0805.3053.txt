The origin of magnetic frustration was stated and the ions whose shift is
accompanied by emerging magnetic ordering and ferroelectricity in TbMn2O5 and
BiMn2O5 were determined on the basis of calculation of magnetic coupling
parameters by using the structural data. The displacements accompanying the
magnetic ordering are not polar, they just induce changes of bond valence
(charge disordering) of Mn1 and Mn2, thus creating instability of the crystal
structure. To approximate again the bond valence to the initial value (charge
ordering) under magnetic ordering conditions is possible only due to polar
displacement of Mn2 (or O1) and O4 ions along the b axis that is the cause of
ferroelectric transition.
