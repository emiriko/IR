We have successfully grown high quality single crystals of SrFe$_2$As$_2$ and
A$_{0.6}$K$_{0.4}$Fe$_2$As$_2$(A=Sr, Ba) using flux method. The resistivity,
specific heat and Hall coefficient have been measured. For parent compound
SrFe$_2$As$_2$, an anisotropic resistivity with $\rho_c$ / $\rho_{ab}$ as large
as 130 is obtained at low temperatures. A sharp drop in both in-plane and
out-plane resistivity due to the SDW instability is observed below 200 K. The
angular dependence of in-plane magnetoresistance shows 2-fold symmetry with
field rotating within ab plane below SDW transition temperature. This is
consistent with a stripe-type spin ordering in SDW state. In K doped
A$_{0.6}$K$_{0.4}$Fe$_2$As$_2$(A=Sr. Ba), the SDW instability is suppressed and
the superconductivity appears with T$_c$ above 35 K. The rather low anisotropy
in upper critical field between H$\parallel$ab and H$\parallel$c indicates
inter-plane coupling play an important role in hole doped Fe-based
superconductors.
