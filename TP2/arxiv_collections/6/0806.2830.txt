Landau-Zener (LZ) transitions of a two-level system (e. g., electronic spin
in molecular magnets) coupled to one or many environmental spins (e. g.,
nuclear spins) are studied. For rather general interactions the LZ problem is
reduced to that of a Landau-Zener grid. It is shown analytically that
environmental spins initially in their ground state do not influence the
staying probability P. This changes if they are prepared in a statistical
ensemble. For a more specific model with environmental spins in a transverse
field, LZ transitions are studied in the case of well-separated resonances in
the LZ grid. The full evolution of the system is described as a succession of
elemenary transitions at avoided crossings and free evolution between them. If
the environmental spins are strongly coupled to the central spin, their effect
on P is weak. In other cases LZ transitions are strongly suppressed and P is
decreasing very slowly with the sweep-rate parameter epsilon ~ 1/v, v being the
energy sweep rate.
