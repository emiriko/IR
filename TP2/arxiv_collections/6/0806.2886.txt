We describe a relation between the symmetry energy coefficients c_sym(rho) of
nuclear matter and a_sym(A) of finite nuclei that accommodates other
correlations of nuclear properties with the low-density behavior of c_sym(rho).
Here we take advantage of this relation to explore the prospects for
constraining c_sym(rho) of systematic measurements of neutron skin sizes across
the mass table, using as example present data from antiprotonic atoms. The
found constraints from neutron skins are in harmony with the recent
determinations from reactions and giant resonances.
