A new approach based on antisymmetrized molecular dynamics is proposed to
correctly take account of the many-body correlation. We applied it to the
spectra of low-lying, light and strange baryons. The inclusion of the
quark-quark correlation is vital to predict the precise spectra, and the
semi-relativistic kinematics is also important to correct the level ordering.
The baryon spectra calculated by the present method is as precise as the
Faddeev calculation.
