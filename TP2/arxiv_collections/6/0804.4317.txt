The hyperfine structure of the long-lived $5D_{3/2}$ and $5D_{5/2}$ levels of
Ba$^+$ ion is analyzed. A procedure for extracting relatively unexplored
nuclear magnetic moments $\Omega$ is presented. The relevant electronic matrix
elements are computed in the framework of the ab initio relativistic many-body
perturbation theory. Both the first- and the second-order (in the hyperfine
interaction) corrections to the energy levels are analyzed. It is shown that a
simultaneous measurement of the hyperfine structure of the entire $5D_J$
fine-structure manifold allows one to extract $\Omega$ without contamination
from the second-order corrections. Measurements to the required accuracy should
be possible with a single trapped barium ion using sensitive techniques already
demonstrated in Ba$^+$ experiments.
