We develop a simple protocol for a one-shot version of quantum state
redistribution, which is the most general two-terminal source coding problem.
The protocol is simplified from a combination of protocols for the fully
quantum reverse Shannon and fully quantum Slepian-Wolf problems, with its
time-reversal symmetry being apparent. When the protocol is applied to the case
where the redistributed states have a tensor power structure, more natural
resource rates are obtained.
