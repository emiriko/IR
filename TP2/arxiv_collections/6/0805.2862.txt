We investigate the segregation of a dense binary mixture of granular
particles that only differ in their restitution coefficient. The mixture is
vertically vibrated in the presence of gravity. We find a partial segregation
of the species, where most dissipative particles submerge in the less
dissipative ones. The segregation occurs even if one type of the particles is
elastic. In order to have a complete description of the system, we study the
structure of the fluid at microscopic scale (few particle diameters). The
density and temperature pair distribution functions show strong enhancements
respect the equilibrium ones at the same density. In particular, there is an
increase in the probability that the more inelastic particles group together in
pairs (microsegregation). Microscopically the segregation is buoyancy driven,
by the appearance of a dense and cold region around the more inelastic
particles.
