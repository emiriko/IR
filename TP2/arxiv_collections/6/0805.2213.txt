Vacancy-induced magnetism in graphene bilayers is investigated using
spin-polarized density functional theory calculations. One of two graphene
layers has a monovacancy. Two atomic configurations for bilayers are considered
with respect to the position of the monovacancy. We find that spin magnetic
moments localized at the vacancy site decreases by ~10 % for our two
configurations, compared with the graphene monolayer with a monovacancy. The
reduction of the spin magnetic moment in the graphene bilayers is attributed to
the interlayer charge transfer from the adjacent layer to the layer with the
monovacancy, compensating for spin magnetic moments originating from
quasilocalized defect state.
