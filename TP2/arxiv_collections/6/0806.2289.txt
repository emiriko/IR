In this paper we present the molecular theory of viscosity of confined fluids
in small or nano systems. This theory is also applicable to the interfacial
viscosity. The basis of this research work is the Enskog kinetic theory and the
Boussinesq constitutive equation. The Enskog kinetic theory is first
transformed into a two-dimensional form. Then the potential energy collisional
transfer part of the flux vector and the contribution to the surface pressure
tensor due to collisional transfer are derived. Then the kinetic energy part of
the flux vector and consequently the contribution to the surface pressure
tensor due to flow of molecules is obtained. The microscopic expression of
total surface pressure tensor is obtained by adding of the potential energy
collisional transfer part and the kinetic energy contribution. Then the
expression of interfacial shear and dilatational viscosities are concluded by
the comparison of corresponding terms of the two microscopic and macroscopic
surface pressure tensor equations. Finally the dimensionless forms of
interfacial shear viscosity, interfacial dilatational viscosity and the surface
tension equations are derived and they are plotted versus the reduced
superficial number density.
