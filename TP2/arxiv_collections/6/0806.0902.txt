We report the statistical properties of the fluctuations of the energy flux
in an electronic RC circuit driven with a stochastic voltage. The fluctuations
of the power injected in the circuit are measured as a function of the damping
rate and the forcing parameters. We show that its distribution exhibits a cusp
close to zero and two asymmetric exponential tails, the asymmetry being driven
by the mean dissipation. This simple experiment allows to capture the
qualitative features of the energy flux distribution observed in more complex
dissipative systems. We also show that the large fluctuations of injected power
averaged on a time lag do not verify the Fluctuation Theorem even for long
averaging time. This is in contrast with the findings of previous experiments
due to their small range of explored fluctuation amplitude. The injected power
in a system of N components either correlated or not is also studied to mimic
systems with large number of particles, such as in a dilute granular gas.
