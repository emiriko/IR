We explore the use of a top-down approach to analyse the dynamics of
icosahedral virus capsids and complement the information obtained from
bottom-up studies of viral vibrations available in the literature. A normal
mode analysis based on protein association energies is used to study the
frequency spectrum, in which we reveal a universal plateau of low-frequency
modes shared by a large class of Caspar-Klug capsids. These modes break
icosahedral symmetry and are potentially relevant to the genome release
mechanism. We comment on the role of viral tiling theory in such dynamical
considerations.
