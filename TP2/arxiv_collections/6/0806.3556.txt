We introduce a novel class of spatial complex variable function Gaussian
(CVF-Gaussian) beam, which is the product of an arbitrary analytic complex
variable function and a Gaussian function, in strongly nonlocal nonlinear media
(SNNM). The CVF-Gaussian beam rotates generally during propagation. By choosing
the input power of the beam, we can obtain the CVF-Gaussian breather or the
CVF-Gaussian soliton. We reveal that stable CVF-Gaussian beam can exist in SNNM
with different forms, including rotating dipole, and rotating elliptic donut. A
distribution factor which is the parameter for the description of the
transverse distribution of the CVF-Gaussian beam is discussed.
