Using the method of canonical group quantization, we construct the angular
momentum operators associated to configuration spaces with the topology of (i)
a sphere and (ii) a projective plane. In the first case, the obtained angular
momentum operators are the quantum version of Poincare's vector, i.e., the
physically correct angular momentum operators for an electron coupled to the
field of a magnetic monopole. In the second case, the obtained operators
represent the angular momentum operators of a system of two indistinguishable
spin zero quantum particles in three spatial dimensions. We explicitly show how
our formalism relates to the one developed by Berry and Robbins. The relevance
of the proposed formalism for an advance in our understanding of the
spin-statistics connection in non-relativistic quantum mechanics is discussed.
