This paper studies the Casimir effect due to fractional massless Klein-Gordon
field confined to parallel plates. A new kind of boundary condition called
fractional Neumann condition which involves vanishing fractional derivatives of
the field is introduced. The fractional Neumann condition allows the
interpolation of Dirichlet and Neumann conditions imposed on the two plates.
There exists a transition value in the difference between the orders of the
fractional Neumann conditions for which the Casimir force changes from
attractive to repulsive. Low and high temperature limits of Casimir energy and
pressure are obtained. For sufficiently high temperature, these quantities are
dominated by terms independent of the boundary conditions. Finally, validity of
the temperature inversion symmetry for various boundary conditions is
discussed.
