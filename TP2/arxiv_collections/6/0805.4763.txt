Physical spin configurations corresponding to topological excitations
expected to be present in the XY limit of a purely quantum spin 1/2 Heisenberg
ferromagnet, are probed on a two dimensional square lattice. Quantum vortices
(anti-vortices) are constructed in terms of coherent spin field components as
limiting case of meronic (anti-meronic) configurations. The crucial role of the
associated Wess-Zumino term is highlighted in our procedure. It is shown that
this term can identify a large class of vortices (anti-vortices). In particular
the excitations having odd topological charges form this class and also
exihibit a self-similar pattern regarding the internal charge distribution.
This manifestation of different behaviour of the odd and the even topological
sectors is very prominent in the strongly quantum regime but fades away as we
go to higher spins. Our formalism is distinctly different from the conventional
approach for the construction of quantum vortices (anti-vortices).
