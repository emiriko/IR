Measurements play an important role in quantum computing (QC), by either
providing the nonlinearity required for two-qubit gates (linear optics QC), or
by implementing a quantum algorithm using single-qubit measurements on a highly
entangled initial state (cluster state QC). Parity measurements can be used as
building blocks for preparing arbitrary stabilizer states, and, together with
1-qubit gates are universal for quantum computing. Here we generalize parity
gates by using a higher dimensional (qudit) ancilla. This enables us to go
beyond the stabilizer/graph state formalism and prepare other types of
multi-particle entangled states. The generalized parity module introduced here
can prepare in one-shot, heralded by the outcome of the ancilla, a large class
of entangled states, including GHZ_n, W_n, Dicke states D_{n,k}, and, more
generally, certain sums of Dicke states, like G_n states used in secret
sharing. For W_n states it provides an exponential gain compared to linear
optics based methods.
