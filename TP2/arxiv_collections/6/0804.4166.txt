Based on an effective two-band model and using the fluctuation-exchange
(FLEX) approach, we explore spin fluctuations and unconventional
superconducting pairing in Fe-based layer superconductors. It is elaborated
that one type of interband antiferromagnetic (AF) spin fluctuation stems from
the interband Coulomb repulsion, while the other type of intraband AF spin
fluctuation originates from the intraband Coulomb repulsion. Due to the
Fermi-surface topology, a spin-singlet extended s-wave superconducting state is
more favorable than the nodal $d_{XY}$-wave state if the interband AF spin
fluctuation is more significant than the intraband one, otherwise vice versa.
It is also revealed that the effective interband coupling plays an important
role in the intraband pairings, which is a distinct feature of the present
two-band system.
