Direct neutron capture reactions play an important role in nuclear
astrophysics and applied physics. Since for most unstable short-lived nuclei it
is not possible to measure the $(n, \gamma)$ cross sections, $(d,p)$ reactions
have been used as an alternative indirect tool. We analyze simultaneously
$^{48}{\rm Ca}(d,p)^{49}{\rm Ca}$ at deuteron energies $2, 13, 19$ and 56 MeV
and the thermal $(n,\gamma)$ reaction at 25 meV. We include results for the
ground state and the first excited state of $^{49}$Ca. From the low-energy
$(d,p)$ reaction, the neutron asymptotic normalization coefficient (ANC) is
determined. Using this ANC, we extract the spectroscopic factor (SF) from the
higher energy $(d,p)$ data and the $(n, \gamma)$ data. The SF obtained through
the 56 MeV $(d,p)$ data are less accurate but consistent with those from the
thermal capture. We show that to have a similar dependence on the single
particle parameters as in the $(n, \gamma)$, the (d,p) reaction should be
measured at 30 MeV.
