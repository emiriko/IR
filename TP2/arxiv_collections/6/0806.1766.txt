We find that the quantum of gravity, the graviton, has time-varying mass (the
gomidium), and radius (the somium); both vary with the inverse of R; and its
frequency is given by Hubble's parameter. Dark matter can be made of such
gravitons. The number of gravitons varies with R-squared . The Machian radiated
power of the Universe leads us to a "correct" energy density for the gravitons
as dark matter.
