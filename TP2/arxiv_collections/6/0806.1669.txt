Spontaneous CP-violation in the strong interaction is analyzed at theta = pi
within the framework of the two-flavor NJL model. It is found that the
occurrence of spontaneous CP-violation at theta = pi depends on the strength of
the 't Hooft determinant interaction, which describes the effect of instanton
interactions. The dependence of the phase structure, and in particular of the
CP-violating phase, on the quark masses, temperature, baryon and isospin
chemical potential is examined in detail. When available a comparison to
earlier results from chiral perturbation theory is made. From our results we
conclude that spontaneous CP-violation in the strong interaction is an
inherently low-energy phenomenon. In all cases we find agreement with the
Vafa-Witten theorem, also at nonzero density and temperature. Meson masses and
mixing in the CP-violating phase display some unusual features as a function of
instanton interaction strength. A modification of the condition for charged
pion condensation at nonzero isospin chemical potential and a novel phase of
charged a_0 mesons are discussed.
