Motivated by recent experiments [Pashkin et al. Nature, \textbf{421}, 823
(2003)] which showed coherent oscillations of two superconducting qubits
system, we consider a system of two charge qubits coupled to a common stripline
microwave resonator. We discuss the separable and entangled behavior as well as
the quantum and classical information deficits. Numerical computation of these
quantities for several regimes is performed. We find that for less entangled
states the partner can extract much more information by means of classical
communication and local operations
