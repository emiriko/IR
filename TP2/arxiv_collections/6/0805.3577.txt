A new analysis of the precise experimental astrophysical $S$-factors for the
direct capture $^3He(\alpha,\gamma)^7{\rm {Be}}$ reaction [B.S. Nara Singh et
al., Phys.Rev.Lett. {\bf 93} (2004) 262503; D. Bemmerer et al., Phys.Rev.Lett.
{\bf 97} (2006) 122502; F.Confortola et al., Phys.Rev. {\bf C 75} (2007) 065803
and T.A.D.Brown et al., Phys.Rev. {\bf C 76} (2007) 055801] populating to the
ground and first excited states of $^7{\rm Be}$ is carried out based on the
modified two - body potential approach in which the direct astrophysical
$S$-factor, $S_{34}(E)$, is expressed in terms of the asymptotic normalization
constants for $^3{\rm {He}}+\alpha\to ^7{\rm {Be}}$ and two additional
conditions are involved to verify the peripheral character of the reaction
under consideration. The Woods--Saxon potential form is used for the bound
($\alpha+^3{\rm {He}}$)- state and the $^3{\rm {He}}\alpha$- scattering wave
functions. New estimates are obtained for the "indirectly measured", values of
the asymptotic normalization constants (the nuclear vertex constants) for
$^3{\rm {He}}+\alpha\to^7{\rm {Be}}(g.s.)$ and $^3{\rm {He}}+\alpha\to^7{\rm
{Be}}(0.429 MeV)$ as well as the astrophysical $S$-factors $S_{34}(E)$ at
E$\le$ 90 keV, including $E$=0. The values of asymptotic normalization
constants have been used for getting information about the $\alpha$-particle
spectroscopic factors for the mirror ($^7Li^7{\rm {Be}}$)-pair.
