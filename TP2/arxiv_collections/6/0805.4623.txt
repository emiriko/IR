We present a mean field theory of the Pomeranchuk instability in two
dimensions, starting from a generic central interaction potential described in
terms of a few microscopic parameters. For a significant range of parameters,
the instability is found to be pre-empted by a first-order quantum phase
transition. We provide the ground state phase diagram in terms of our generic
parameters.
