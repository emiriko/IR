Based on Monte Carlo calculations, multipolar ordering on the Penrose tiling,
relevant for two-dimensional molecular adsorbates on quasicrystalline surfaces
and for nanomagnetic arrays, has been analyzed. These initial investigations
are restricted to multipolar rotors of rank one through four - described by
spherical harmonics Ylm with l=1...4 and restricted to m=0 - positioned on the
vertices of the rhombic Penrose tiling. At first sight, the ground states of
odd-parity multipoles seem to exhibit long-range multipolar order, indicated by
the appearance of a superstructure in the form of the decagonal
Hexagon-Boat-Star tiling, in agreement with previous investigations of dipolar
systems. Yet careful analysis establishes that long-range multipolar order is
absent in all cases investigated here, and only short-range order exists. This
result should be taken as a warning for any future analysis of order in either
real or simulated arrangements of multipoles on quasiperiodic templates.
