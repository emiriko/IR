We determine the structure of Hopf algebra extensions of a group algebra by
the cyclic group of order 2. We study the corepresentation theory of such Hopf
algebras, which provide a generalization, at the Hopf algebra level, of the so
called Tambara-Yamagami fusion categories. As a byproduct, we show that every
semisimple Hopf algebra of dimension $<36$ is necessarily group-theoretical;
thus 36 is the smallest possible dimension where a non group-theoretical
example occurs.
