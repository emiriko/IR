In recent years there have been a number of proposals to utilize the
specificity of DNA based interactions for potential applications in
nanoscience. One interesting direction is the self-assembly of micro- and
nanoparticle clusters using DNA scaffolds. In this letter we consider a DNA
scaffold method to self-assemble clusters of "colored" particles. Stable
clusters of microspheres have recently been produced by an entirely different
method. Our DNA based approach self-assembles clusters with additional degrees
of freedom associated with particle permutation. We demonstrate that in the
non-equilibrium regime of irreversible binding the self-assembly process is
experimentally feasible. These color degrees of freedom may allow for more
diverse intercluster interactions essential for hierarchical self-assembly of
larger structures.
