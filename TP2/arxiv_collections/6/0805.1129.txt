The relevance of single-W and single-Z production processes at hadron
colliders is well known: in the present paper the status of theoretical
calculations of Drell-Yan processes is summarized and some results on the
combination of electroweak and QCD corrections to a sample of observables of
the process $p p \to W^\pm \to \mu^\pm + X$ at the LHC are discussed. The
phenomenological analysis shows that a high-precision knowledge of QCD and a
careful combination of electroweak and strong contributions is mandatory in
view of the anticipated LHC experimental accuracy. One of the authors (O.N.)
dedicates these notes to Prof. S. Jadach, in honour of his 60th birthday and
grateful for all that Prof. Jadach taught him during their fruitful
collaboration.
