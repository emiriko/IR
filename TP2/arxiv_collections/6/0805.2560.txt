The signature splitting of the $\gamma$-vibrational band of several Ru, Pd,
Xe, Ba, Os and Pt isotopes is analyzed in the framework of the interacting
boson model (IBM). The nuclei studied are close to the $\gamma$-unstable SO(6)
limit of the IBM and have well-known $\gamma$ bands. It is shown that in most
nuclei the signature splitting is better reproduced by the inclusion of a
three-body interaction between the $d$ bosons. In none of the nuclei evidence
for a stable, triaxial ground-state shape is found.
