We study the effect of Coulomb interaction on the full counting statistics of
an Aharonov-Bohm (AB) interferometer with a single-level quantum dot in one arm
in the regime of weak dot-lead and lead-lead tunnel couplings. In the absence
of Coulomb interaction, the interference processes are of nonresonant nature
with an even AB flux dependence and obey bidirectional Poissonian statistics.
For large charging energy, the statistic of these processes changes. In
addition, processes of resonant nature with an odd flux dependence appear. In
the limit of strongly asymmetric tunnel couplings from the dot to the left and
right leads, their statistics is found to be strongly super-Poissonian.
