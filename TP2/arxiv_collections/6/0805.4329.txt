Exotic states in the charmonium family are systematically treated in the
framework of simplest model with an effective coulomb-like interaction of heavy
quark and antiquark in the presence of static excitation of quark-gluon modes
responsible for a nonperturbative term of potential, which provides with the
confinement of quarks, in terms of bag over the threshold in the excitation
spectrum of vacuum fields. Once the spectrum has got quite a wide mass gap, it
allows us to approximate the bag contribution into the potential by a constant
value of bag mass at low distances less than the bag size. The bag mass can be
evaluated in a constituent model. The analysis is given for the bag
contribution into the distribution over the invariant mass of two pions in the
hadronic transition between the S-wave states of bag-quarkonium and heavy
quarkonium, that leads to the anomaly violating the chiral limit in the region
of low invariant masses, which agrees with the observational data. Leptonic
constants of vector states are investigated in the presence of exotic states in
the framework of quasilocal sum rules. The extra states allow us to improve the
consistency of describing the measured widths of leptonic decays for the
complete set of vector states in the charmonium family.
