The induced polarization of a beam of polar clusters or molecules passing
through an electric or magnetic field region differs from the textbook
Langevin-Debye susceptibility. This distinction, which is important for the
interpretation of deflection and focusing experiments, arises because instead
of acquiring thermal equilibrium in the field region, the beam ensemble
typically enters the field adiabatically, i.e., with a previously fixed
distribution of rotational states. We discuss the orientation of rigid
symmetric-top systems with a body-fixed electric or magnetic dipole moment. The
analytical expression for their "adiabatic-entry" orientation is elucidated and
compared with exact numerical results for a range of parameters. The
differences between the polarization of thermodynamic and "adiabatic-entry"
ensembles, of prolate and oblate tops, and of symmetric-top and linear rotators
are illustrated and identified.
