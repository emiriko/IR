The four-dimensional \phi^4 theory is usually considered to be trivial in the
continuum limit. In fact, two definitions of triviality were mixed in the
literature. The first one, introduced by Wilson, is equivalent to positiveness
of the Gell-Mann -- Low function \beta(g) for g\ne 0; it is confirmed by all
available information and can be considered as firmly established. The second
definition, introduced by mathematical community, corresponds to the true
triviality, i.e. principal impossibility to construct continuous theory with
finite interaction at large distances: it needs not only positiveness of
\beta(g) but also its sufficiently quick growth at infinity. Indications of
true triviality are not numerous and allow different interpretation. According
to the recent results, such triviality is surely absent.
