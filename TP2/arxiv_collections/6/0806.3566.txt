The mechanism by which a resonance may be attracted to a sharp threshold is
described with several examples. It involves a threshold cusp interfering
constructively with either or both (i) a resonance produced via confinement,
(ii) attractive t- and u-channel exchanges. More generally, it is suggested
that resonances are eigenstates generated by mixing between confined states and
long-range meson and baryon exchanges.
