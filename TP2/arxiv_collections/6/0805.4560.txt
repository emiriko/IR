This paper describes application of information granulation theory, on the
design of rock engineering flowcharts. Firstly, an overall flowchart, based on
information granulation theory has been highlighted. Information granulation
theory, in crisp (non-fuzzy) or fuzzy format, can take into account engineering
experiences (especially in fuzzy shape-incomplete information or superfluous),
or engineering judgments, in each step of designing procedure, while the
suitable instruments modeling are employed. In this manner and to extension of
soft modeling instruments, using three combinations of Self Organizing Map
(SOM), Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (NFIS), and Rough Set Theory (RST) crisp
and fuzzy granules, from monitored data sets are obtained. The main underlined
core of our algorithms are balancing of crisp(rough or non-fuzzy) granules and
sub fuzzy granules, within non fuzzy information (initial granulation) upon the
open-close iterations. Using different criteria on balancing best granules
(information pockets), are obtained. Validations of our proposed methods, on
the data set of in-situ permeability in rock masses in Shivashan dam, Iran have
been highlighted.
