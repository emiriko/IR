Thermal functional circuits are an interesting and perspectivic group of the
MEMS elements. A practical realization is called Quadratic Transfer
Characteristic (QTC) element which driving principle is the Seebeck-effect. In
this paper we present the analyses of a QTC element from different
perspectives. To check the real behavior of the device, we measured a few,
secondary properties of the structure which correspond to special behavior
because these properties can not be easily derived from the main
characteristics.
