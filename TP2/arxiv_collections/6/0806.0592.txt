A formula for the jumping numbers of a curve unibranch at a singular point is
established. The jumping numbers are expressed in terms of the Enriques diagram
of the log resolution of the singularity, or equivalently in terms of the
canonical set of generators of the semigroup of the curve at the singular
point.
