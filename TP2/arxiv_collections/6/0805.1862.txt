We investigate the possible existence of nonradiating motions of systems of
point charges, according to classical electrodynamics with retarded potentials.
We prove that two point particles of arbitrary electric charges cannot move for
an infinitely long time within a finite region of space without radiating
electromagnetic energy. We show however with an example that nonradiating
accelerated motions of systems of point charges do in general exist.
