We study exclusive chi_c0, chi_c1 and chi_c2 decays to four-hadron final
states involving two charged and two neutral mesons: pi^+pi^-pi^0pi^0,
K^+K^-pi^0pi^0, pppi^0pi^0, K^+K^-etapi^0, and K^+-pi^-+K^0pi^0o. The chi_c
states are produced in radiative decays of 3.08 million psi-prime resonance
decays and observed in the CLEO detector. We also measure the largest
substructure contributions to the modes pi^+pi^-pi^0pi^0 and K^+-pi^-+K^0pi^0.
