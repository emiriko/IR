We propose a novel approach to solve the three-nucleon (3N) Faddeev equation
which avoids the complicated singularity pattern going with the moving
logarithmic singularities of the standard approach. In this new approach the
treatment of the 3N Faddeev equation becomes essentially as simple as the
treatment of the two-body Lippmann-Schwinger equation. Very good agreement of
the new and old approaches in the application to nucleon-deuteron elastic
scattering and the breakup reaction is found.
