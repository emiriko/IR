The Belle experiment collected in 2005-6 a total of 23.6 fb$^{-1}$ of data at
the $\Upsilon(10860)$ resonance, also known as $\Upsilon$(5S). These constitute
nearly all of the world's sample of $e^+e^- \to \Upsilon$(10860) events, which
provide clean $B_s$ pairs. We present here several $B_s$ and $\Upsilon$(10860)
properties recently extracted from these data.
