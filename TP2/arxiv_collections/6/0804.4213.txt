The spin torque oscillator (STO), where the magnetization of the fixed layer
is tilted out of the film plane, is capable of strong microwave signal
generation in zero magnetic field. Through numerical simulations of the
Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski equations, within a macro-spin
approximation, we study the microwave signal generation as a function of drive
current for two realistic tilt angles. The tilt magnetization of the fixed
layer can be achieved by using a material with high out-of-plane
magnetocrystalline anisotropy, such as L10 FePt.
