The Main Injector Neutrino Oscillation Search (MINOS) experiment uses an
accelerator-produced neutrino beam to perform precision measurements of the
neutrino oscillation parameters in the "atmospheric neutrino" sector associated
with muon neutrino disappearance. This long-baseline experiment measures
neutrino interactions in Fermilab's NuMI neutrino beam with a near detector at
Fermilab and again 735 km downstream with a far detector in the Soudan
Underground Laboratory in northern Minnesota. The two detectors are magnetized
steel-scintillator tracking calorimeters. They are designed to be as similar as
possible in order to ensure that differences in detector response have minimal
impact on the comparisons of event rates, energy spectra and topologies that
are essential to MINOS measurements of oscillation parameters. The design,
construction, calibration and performance of the far and near detectors are
described in this paper.
