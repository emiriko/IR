The existence of a pullback attractor is established for the singularly
perturbed FitzHugh-Nagumo system defined on the entire space $R^n$ when
external terms are unbounded in a phase space. The pullback asymptotic
compactness of the system is proved by using uniform a priori estimates for
far-field values of solutions. Although the limiting system has no global
attractor, we show that the pullback attractors for the perturbed system with
bounded external terms are uniformly bounded, and hence do not blow up as a
small parameter approaches zero.
