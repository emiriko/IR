We use neutron scattering to study the structural and magnetic phase
transitions in the iron pnictides CeFeAsO1-xFx as the system is tuned from a
semimetal to a high-transition-temperature (high-Tc) superconductor through
Fluorine (F) doping x. In the undoped state, CeFeAsO develops a structural
lattice distortion followed by a stripe like commensurate antiferromagnetic
order with decreasing temperature. With increasing Fluorine doping, the
structural phase transition decreases gradually while the antiferromagnetic
order is suppressed before the appearance of superconductivity, resulting an
electronic phase diagram remarkably similar to that of the high-Tc copper
oxides. Comparison of the structural evolution of CeFeAsO1-xFx with other
Fe-based superconductors reveals that the effective electronic band width
decreases systematically for materials with higher Tc. The results suggest that
electron correlation effects are important for the mechanism of high-Tc
superconductivity in these Fe pnictides.
