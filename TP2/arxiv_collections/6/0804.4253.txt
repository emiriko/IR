We prove that, when linearized, the governing equations of an incompressible
elastic continuum yield Maxwell's equations as corollaries. Through judicious
distinction between the referential and local descriptions, the principle of
material invariance is established and shown to be a true covariance principle,
unlike the Lorentz covariance, which is valid only for non-deforming frames in
rectilinear relative motion. Thus, this paper establishes that electrodynamics
can be fully explained if one assumes that it is the manifestation of the
internal forces of an underlying elastic material which we term the
metacontinuum.
  The new frame-indifferent formulation of electrodynamics is shown to
incorporate the Lorentz force as an integral part of Faraday's law, rather than
as an additional empirical variable. Respectively, if the upper-convected
derivative is added in Maxwell's displacement current it can explain
Biot-Savart's and Oersted-Ampere's laws. An immediate corollary of the material
invariance is the Galilean invariance of the model.
  The possible detection of the absolute continuum is also discussed. First,
the famous experiment of Ives and Stilwell is reexamined with a modified
Bohr-Rydberg formula for the emitted frequencies from a moving atom, and it is
shown that the results are fully compatible with the presence of an absolute
medium. Second, a new interferometry experiment is proposed in which the
first-order Doppler effect can be measured, and thus the presence of a medium
at rest can be unequivocally established.
