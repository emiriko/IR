We study electric field driven deracemization in an achiral liquid crystal
through the formation and coarsening of chiral domains. It is proposed that
deracemization in this system is a curvature-driven process. We test this
prediction using the exact result for the distribution of hull-enclosed areas
in two-dimensional coarsening in non-conserved scalar order parameter dynamics
recently obtained [J.J. Arenzon et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 061116 (2007)].
The experimental data are in very good agreement with the theory. We thus
demonstrate that deracemization in such bent-core liquid crystals belongs to
the Allen-Cahn universality class, and that the exact formula, which gives us
the statistics of domain sizes during coarsening, can also be used as a strict
test for this dynamic universality class.
