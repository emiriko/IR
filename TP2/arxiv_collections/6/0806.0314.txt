The computer programs most users interact with daily are driven by a
graphical user interface (GUI). However, many scientific applications are used
with a command line interface (CLI) for the ease of development and increased
flexibility this mode provides. Scientific application developers would benefit
from being able to provide a GUI easily for their CLI programs, thus retaining
the advantages of both modes of interaction. GuiLiner is a generic, extensible
and flexible front-end designed to ``host'' a wide variety of data analysis or
simulation programs. Scientific application developers who produce a correctly
formatted XML file describing their program's options and some of its
documentation can immediately use GuiLiner to produce a carefully implemented
GUI for their analysis or simulation programs.
