We discuss memory effects in the conductance of hopping insulators due to
slow rearrangements of many-electron clusters leading to formation of polarons
close to the electron hopping sites. An abrupt change in the gate voltage and
corresponding shift of the chemical potential change populations of the hopping
sites, which then slowly relax due to rearrangements of the clusters. As a
result, the density of hopping states becomes time dependent on a scale
relevant to rearrangement of the structural defects leading to the excess time
dependent conductivity.
