We show that the size effects radically affect the electric field-current
($E-I$) relation of superconducting films. We calculate $E(J)$ due to
thermally-activated hopping of single vortices driven by current $I$ across the
film in a magnetic field $H$, taking into account interaction of free vortices
with their antivortex images and peaks in the Meissner currents at the film
edges. Unbinding of virtual vortex-antivortex pairs not only mimics the
transport uniform BKT behavior, it can dominate the observed $E(J)$ and result
in the field-dependent ohmic resistance at small $I$. We show that $E(I)$ can
be tuned by changing the film geometry and propose experimental tests of this
theory.
