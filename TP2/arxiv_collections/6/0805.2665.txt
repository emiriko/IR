Recent astronomical observations strongly indicate that the current Universe
is undergoing an accelerated phase of expansion. The discovery of this fact was
unexpected and resulted in the comeback of cosmological constant. The
conception of standard cosmological model has its roots in this context. The
paper relates to the methodological status of effective theories in the context
of cosmological investigations. We argue that the standard cosmological model
(LCDM model) as well as the CDM have a status of effective theories only,
similarly to the standard model of particle physics. The LCDM model is studied
from the point of view of the methodological debate on reductionism and
epistemological emergence in the science. It is shown in the paper that
bifurcation as well as structural instability notion can be useful in the
detection of emergence the LCDM model from the CDM model. We demonstrate that
the structural stability of the LCDM model can explain the flexibility of the
model to accommodation of the observational data. We show that LCDM model can
be derived from CDM as the bifurcation. It is an example of acausal derivation
of Lambda term. The case study of emergence of LCDM model suggests that it can
be understood in terms of bifurcation and structural stability issue. The
reduction from the upper models represented in terms of dynamical system to
low-level ones can be realized in any case by application of a mathematical
limit (boundary crossing) with respect to the model parameter. It is a simple
consequence of mathematical theorem about smooth dependence solutions with
respect to time, initial condition and the parameters.
