Based on first-principles FLAPW-GGA calculation, we have investigated
electronic structure of newly discovered oxygen-free 38K superconductor
Ba1-xKxFe2As2 in comparison with parent phase - tetragonal ternary iron
arsenide BaFe2As2. The density of states, magnetic properties, near-Fermi bands
compositions, together with Sommerfeld coefficients and molar Pauli
paramagnetic susceptibility are evaluated. The results allow us to classify
these systems as quasi-two-dimensional ionic metals, where the conduction is
strongly anisotropic, only happening on the (Fe-As) layers. According to our
calculations, at the hole doping of BaFe2As2 the density of states at the Fermi
level grows, and this can be a possible factor of occurrence of
superconductivity for Ba1-xKxFe2As2. On the other hand, Ba1-xKxFe2As2 lays at
the border of magnetic instability and the pairing interactions might involve
magnetic or orbital fluctuations.
