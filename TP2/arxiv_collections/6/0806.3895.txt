We examine the role of neutron capture on 130Sn during r-process freeze-out
in the neutrino-driven wind environment of the core-collapse supernova. We find
that the global r-process abundance pattern is sensitive to the magnitude of
the neutron capture cross section of 130Sn. The changes to the abundance
pattern include not only a relative decrease in the abundance of 130Sn and an
increase in the abundance of 131Sn, but also a shift in the distribution of
material in the rare earth and third peak regions.
