A Macro-state consisting of N= 3.5 x 10^4 photons in a quantum superposition
and entangled with a far apart single-photon state (Micro-state) is generated.
Precisely, an entangled photon pair is created by a nonlinear optical process,
then one photon of the pair is injected into an optical parametric amplifier
(OPA) operating for any input polarization state, i.e. into a phase-covariant
cloning machine. Such transformation establishes a connection between the
single photon and the multi particle fields. We then demonstrate the
non-separability of the bipartite system by adopting a local filtering
technique within a positive operator valued measurement.
