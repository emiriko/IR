The holographic QCD prediction for the pion distribution amplitude (DA)
$\phi_{hol}(u)$ is used to compute the pion spacelike electromagnetic form
factor $F_{\pi}(Q^2)$ within the QCD light-cone sum rule method. In
calculations the pion's renormalon-based model twist-4 DA, as well as the
asymptotic twist-4 DA are employed. Obtained theoretical predictions are
compared with experimental data and with results of the holographic QCD.
