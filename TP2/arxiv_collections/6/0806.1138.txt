The transport of an infinitely thin, hard rod in a random, dense array of
point obstacles is investigated by molecular dynamics simulations. Our model
mimics the sterically hindered dynamics in dense needle liquids. The
center-of-mass diffusion exhibits a minimum, and transport becomes increasingly
fast at higher densities. The diffusion coefficient diverges according to a
power law in the density with an approximate exponent of 0.8. This observation
is connected with a new divergent time scale, reflected in a zig-zag motion of
the needle, a two-step decay of the velocity-autocorrelation function, and a
negative plateau in the non-Gaussian parameter.
