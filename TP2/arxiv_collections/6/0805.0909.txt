The Attacks done by Viruses, Worms, Hackers, etc. are a Network
Security-Problem in many Organisations. Current Intrusion Detection Systems
have significant Disadvantages, e.g. the need of plenty of Computational Power
or the Local Installation. Therefore, we introduce a novel Framework for
Network Security which is called SANA. SANA contains an artificial Immune
System with artificial Cells which perform certain Tasks in order to to support
existing systems to better secure the Network against Intrusions. The
Advantages of SANA are that it is efficient, adaptive, autonomous, and
massively-distributed. In this Article, we describe the Architecture of the
artificial Immune System and the Functionality of the Components. We explain
briefly the Implementation and discuss Results.
