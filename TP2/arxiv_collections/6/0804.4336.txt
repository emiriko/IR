The F.A.S.T. (Floor field and Agent based Simulation Tool) model is a
microscopic model of pedestrian dynamics, which is discrete in space and time.
It was developed in a number of more or less consecutive steps from a simple CA
model. This contribution is a summary of a study on an extension of the
F.A.S.T-model for counterflow situations. The extensions will be explained and
it will be shown that the extended F.A.S.T.-model is capable of handling
various counterflow situations and to reproduce the well known lane formation
effect.
