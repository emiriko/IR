We discuss the effect of an adiabatic rotation on the phase separation
between the superfluid and normal component of a trapped polarized Fermi gas at
unitarity and zero temperature, under the assumption that quantized vortices
are not formed. We show that the Chandrasekhar-Clogston limit
$n_{\downarrow}/\n_{\uparrow}$ characterizing the local polarization in the
normal phase at the interface is enhanced by the rotation as a consequence of
the centrifugal effect. The density profiles (local and column integral) of the
two spin species are calculated as a function of the angular velocity for
different values of the polarization. The critical value of the angular
velocity at which the superfluid exhibits a spontaneous quadrupole deformation
is also calculated for the unpolarized case.
