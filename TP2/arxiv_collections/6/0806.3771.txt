This article is a survey article on geometric group theory from the point of
view of a non-expert who likes geometric group theory and uses it in his own
research. The sections are: classical examples, basics about
quasiisometry,properties and invariants of groups invariant under
quasiisometry, rigidity, hyperbolic spaces and CAT(k)-spaces, the boundary of a
hyperbolic space, hyperbolic groups, CAT(0)-groups, classifying spaces for
proper actions, measurable group theory, some open problems.
