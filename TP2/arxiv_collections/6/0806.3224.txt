We develop techniques to determine the mass scale of invisible particles
pair-produced at hadron colliders. We employ the constrained mass variable
m_2C, which provides an event-by-event lower-bound to the mass scale given a
mass difference. We complement this variable with a new variable m_2C,UB which
provides an additional upper bound to the mass scale, and demonstrate its
utility with a realistic case study of a supersymmetry model. These variables
together effectively quantify the `kink' in the function Max m_T2 which has
been proposed as a mass-determination technique for collider-produced dark
matter. An important advantage of the m_2C method is that it does not rely
simply on the position at the endpoint, but it uses the additional information
contained in events which lie far from the endpoint. We found the mass by
comparing the HERWIG generated m_2C distribution to ideal distributions for
different masses. We find that for the case studied, with 100 fb^-1 of
integrated luminosity (about 400 signal events), the invisible particle's mass
can be measured to a precision of 4.1 GeV. We conclude that this technique's
precision and accuracy is as good as, if not better than, the best known
techniques for invisible-particle mass-determination at hadron colliders.
