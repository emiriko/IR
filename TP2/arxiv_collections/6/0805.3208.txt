Motion of massive and massless test particle in equilibrium and
non-equilibrium case is discussed in a dyadosphere geometry through
Hamilton-Jacobi method. Geodesics of particles are discussed through Lagrangian
method too. Scalar wave equation for massless particle is analyzed to show the
absence of superradiance.
