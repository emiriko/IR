In this paper, it is presented the well known aspect of non linearity of
internal human body structures. Similarity on the basis of the Fractional
Brownian Motion from the static ones, as the geometrical fractals like the
Intestine and placenta linings, Airways in lungs, Arterial system in kidneys
and so on. To the kinematics ones, as the temporal fractals like Heart beat
sequences, Electroencephalograms, Respiratory tidal volumes, DNA sequences
mapping and so on. But this internal well known knowledge is astonishing
extendible from the internal, through the Brownian basis of the muscular
contraction, to the macroscopic external human movements, like the orthostatic
equilibrium, gait, running training, judo contest and soccer, basketball,
football or water polo games, by means of the ubiquitous continuous presence;
the Brownian Dynamics.
