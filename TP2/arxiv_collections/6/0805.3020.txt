We study unparticle effects on $b\to s \gamma$. The unparticle contributions
can contribute significantly to both left- and right-handed chirality
amplitudes. Using available experimental data and SM calculation for $B\to X_s
\gamma$, we obtain constraints on various vector and scalar unparticle
couplings. We find that the constraints sensitively depend on the unparticle
dimension $d_\U$. For $d_\U$ close to one, the constraints can be very
stringent. The constraints become weak when $d_\U$ is increased. In general the
constraints on scalar unparticle couplings are weaker than those for vector
unparticle couplings. Sizeable coupling strength for unparticles with quarks is
still allowed. We also show that polarization measurement in $\Lambda_b \to
\Lambda \gamma$ can further constrain the couplings.
