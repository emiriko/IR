We find a strong evidence for the survival of $J/\Psi$ and $\eta_c$ as
spatially-localized $c\bar c$ (quasi-)bound states above the QCD critical
temperature $T_c$, by investigating the boundary-condition dependence of their
energies and spectral functions. In a finite-volume box, there arises a
boundary-condition dependence for spatially spread states, while no such
dependence appears for spatially compact states. In lattice QCD, we find almost
{\it no} spatial boundary-condition dependence for the energy of the $c\bar c$
system in $J/\Psi$ and $\eta_c$ channels for $T\simeq(1.11-2.07)T_c$. We also
investigate the spectral function of charmonia above $T_c$ in lattice QCD using
the maximum entropy method (MEM) in terms of the boundary-condition dependence.
There is {\it no} spatial boundary-condition dependence for the low-lying peaks
corresponding to $J/\Psi$ and $\eta_c$ around 3GeV at $1.62T_c$. These facts
indicate the survival of $J/\Psi$ and $\eta_c$ as compact $c\bar c$
(quasi-)bound states for $T_c < T < 2T_c$.
