One-way quantum computing allows any quantum algorithm to be implemented
easily using just measurements. The difficult part is creating the universal
resource, a cluster state, on which the measurements are made. We propose a
radically new approach: a scalable method that uses a single, multimode optical
parametric oscillator (OPO). The method is very efficient and generates a
continuous-variable cluster state, universal for quantum computation, with
quantum information encoded in the quadratures of the optical frequency comb of
the OPO.
