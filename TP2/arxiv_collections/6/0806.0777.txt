We classify all the embeddings of $\mathbb{P}_n$ in a Grassmannian $Gr(1,N)$
such that the composition with Pl\"{u}cker embedding is given by a linear
system of cubics on $\mathbb{P}_n$. As a corollary in the direction of the
Hartshorne conjecture, we prove that every vector bundle giving such an
embedding, splits if $n\geq 3$.
