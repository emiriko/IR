We present systematic magnetoelectronic measurements of magnetic nanopillars
with different structures of polarizing magnetic layers. The magnetic reversal
at small magnetic field, the onset of magnetic dynamics at larger field, and
the magnetoresistance exhibit a significant dependence on the type of the
polarizing layer. We performed detailed quantitative modeling showing that the
differences can be explained by the effects of spin-dependent electron
diffusion.
