The Raman spectrum of microscopic droplets of lipid material on the lumen of
the aorta of an apolipoprotein E knock-out mouse were reported in the
proceedings of an SPIE conference. Based on the absence of the carbonyl band in
the spectrum, at that time it was determined that the spectrum represents free
fatty acids rather than triglycerides. More recent examination of the spectrum
indicates that these droplets contain dissolved cholesterol, and thus can be
used as an early indicator of the atherosclerosis process in animal models
during drug development.
