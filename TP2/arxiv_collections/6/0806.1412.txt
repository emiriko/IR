We report ^{59}Co NMR studies in single crystals of cobalt oxide
superconductor Na_{0.42}CoO_{2}\cdot1.3H_{2}O (T_c=4.25K) and its parent
compound Na_{0.42}CoO_{2}. We find that both the magnitude and the temperature
(T) dependence of the Knight shifts are identical in the two compounds above
T_c. The spin-lattice relaxation rate (1/T_1) is also identical above T_0
\sim60 K for both compounds. Below T_0, the unhydrated sample is found to be a
non-correlated metal that well conforms to Fermi liquid theory, while spin
fluctuations develop in the superconductor. These results indicate that water
intercalation does not change the density of states but its primary role is to
bring about spin fluctuations. Our result shows that, in the hydrated
superconducting compound, the in-plane spin fluctuation around finite wave
vector is much stronger than that along the c-axis, which indicates that the
spin correlation is quasi-two-dimensional.
