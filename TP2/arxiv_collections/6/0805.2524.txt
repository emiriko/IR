In SUSY models with Gauge Mediated Supersymmetry Breaking (GMSB) a gravitino
is the lightest SUSY particle (LSP), while a neutralino or a slepton is the
next-to-lightest (NLSP). For the pair-production of SUSY particles at the LHC
large missing transverse energy (from the gravitinos) and two photons or
leptons in the final state are expected, if the NLSP decays inside the
detector. In the case of stable NLSPs, interesting signatures consist of
non-pointing photons or heavy stable charged particles. In this presentation
methods developed by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations and the expected
performance derived from simulations are summarized.
