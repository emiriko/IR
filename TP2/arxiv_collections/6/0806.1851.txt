We study the spin Hall effect (SHE) in graphene using a realistic
multi-orbital tight-binding model that includes the atomic spin-orbit
interaction. The SHE is found to be induced by the spin-dependent Aharonov-Bohm
phase. In the metallic case, the calculated values for the spin Hall
conductivity (SHC) are much smaller than the quantized Hall conductivity for
realistic parameter values of metallic graphene. In the insulating case,
quantization of the SHC is violated due to the multi-orbital effect. The
present study suggests that the SHE in a honeycomb lattice is enhanced by
chemical doping, such as the substitution of carbon atoms with boron atoms.
