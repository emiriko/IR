Working with a presumed asymptotic series for lambda_d developed in previous
work, we make some intelligent guesses for lambda_d with d=3, 4, 5; and
estimates for the corresponding errors. We present arguments in favor of these
guesses, we earnestly believe they will turn out to be correct. Such
approximate values may help stimulate people working on rigorous bounds. In
addition to suggesting bounds to prove, there will be the strong motivation to
prove me wrong.
