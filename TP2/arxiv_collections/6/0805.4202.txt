Several supersymmetric models with extended gauge structures, motivated by
either grand unification or by neutrino mass generation, predict light
doubly-charged Higgsinos. In this work we study productions and decays of
doubly-charged Higgsinos present in left-right supersymmetric models, and show
that they invariably lead to novel collider signals not found in the minimal
supersymmetric model (MSSM) or in any of its extensions motivated by the \mu
problem or even in extra dimensional theories. We investigate their distinctive
signatures at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in both pair-- and
single--production modes, and show that they are powerful tools in determining
the underlying model via the measurements at the LHC experiments.
