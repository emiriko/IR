The reasons which restrict opportunities of classical mechanics at the
description of nonequilibrium systems are discussed. The way of overcoming of
the key restrictions is offered. This way is based on an opportunity of
representation of nonequilibrium system as a set of equilibrium subsystems. The
equation of motion and the general Lagrange, Hamilton and Liouville equations
for subsystems have been obtained. The way of a substantiation of
thermodynamics is offered.
