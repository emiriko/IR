Let K be a connected compact semisimple Lie group and Kc its
complexification. The generalized Segal-Bargmann space for Kc, is a space of
square-integrable holomorphic functions on Kc, with respect to a K-invariant
heat kernel measure. This space is connected to the "Schrodinger" Hilbert space
L^2(K) by a unitary map, the generalized Segal-Bargmann transform. This paper
considers certain natural operators on L^2(K), namely multiplication operators
and differential operators, conjugated by the generalized Segal-Bargmann
transform. The main results show that the resulting operators on the
generalized Segal-Bargmann space can be represented as Toeplitz operators. The
symbols of these Toeplitz operators are expressed in terms of a certain
subelliptic heat kernel on Kc. I also examine some of the results from an
infinite-dimensional point of view based on the work of L. Gross and P.
Malliavin.
