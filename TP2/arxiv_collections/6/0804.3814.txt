Majority of the applications used in defense are voice, video and data
oriented and has strict QoS requirements. One of the technologies that enabled
this is Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) networking. Traditional ATM networks
are wired networks. But Tactical networks are meant to be mobile and this
necessitates the use of radio relays for Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) and
Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communications. ATM networks assume a physical link
layer BER of 10^-9 or better because of the availability of reliable media like
optical fiber links. But this assumption is no longer valid when ATM switches
are connected through radio relay where error rates are in the rage of 10^-3.
This paper presents the architecture of a Link Enhancer meant to improve the
Bit Error Rate of the Wireless links used for V2I and V2V communications from 1
in 10^4 to 1 in 10^8
