The paper deals with the description of particle deposition on walls from a
turbulent flow over a large range of particle diameter, using a Langevin PDF
model. The first aim of the work is to test how the present Langevin model is
able to describe this phenomenon and to outline the physical as- pects which
play a major role in particle deposition. The general features and
characteristics of the present stochastic model are first recalled. Then,
results obtained with the standard form of the model are presented along with
an analysis which has been carried out to check the sensitivity of the
predictions on different mean fluid quantities. These results show that the
physical repre- sentation of the near-wall physics has to be improved and that,
in particular, one possible route is to introduce specific features related to
the near-wall coherent structures. In the following, we propose a simple
phenomenological model that introduces some of the effects due to the presence
of turbulent coherent structures on particles in a thin layer close to the
wall. The results obtained with this phenomenological model are in good
agreement with experimental evidence and this suggests to pursue in that
direction, towards the development of more general and rigorous stochastic
models that provide a link between a geometrical description of turbulent flow
and a statistical one.
