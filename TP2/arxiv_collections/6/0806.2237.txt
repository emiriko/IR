This letter reports new results from the MINOS experiment based on a two-year
exposure to muon neutrinos from the Fermilab NuMI beam. Our data are consistent
with quantum mechanical oscillations of neutrino flavor with mass splitting
$|\Delta m^2|=(2.43\pm 0.13)\times10^{-3}$ eV$^2$ (68% confidence level) and
mixing angle $\sin^2(2\theta)>0.90$ (90% confidence level). Our data disfavor
two alternative explanations for the disappearance of neutrinos in flight,
namely neutrino decays into lighter particles and quantum decoherence of
neutrinos, at the 3.7 and 5.7 standard deviation levels, respectively.
