Coherent population trapping (CPT) refers to the steady-state trapping of
population in a coherent superposition of two ground states which are coupled
by coherent optical fields to an intermediate state in a three-level atomic
system. Recently, CPT has been observed in an ensemble of donor bound spins in
GaAs and in single nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond by using a fluorescence
technique. Here we report the demonstration of CPT of an electron spin in a
single quantum dot (QD) charged with one electron.
