This report is a review of the present status of GUT, especially
renormalizable minimal SO(10) GUT, and its future prospect.
  It consists of two parts. In part I, I review how the minimal renormalizable
supersymmetric SO(10) GUT, an SO(10) framework with only one ${\bf 10}$ and one
$\bar{\bf 126}$ Higgs multiplets in the Yukawa sector, is attractive because of
its high predictivity. Indeed it not only gave a consistent predictions on
neutrino oscillation data but also did reasonable and interesting values for
Leptogenesis, LFV, muon g-2, neutrinoless double beta decay etc. However, this
model suffers from problems, apart from the small deviations from the observed
values, related to running of gauge couplings and proton decay. The gauge
coupling unification may be spoiled due to the presence of intermediate scales
much lighter than the grand unification (GUT) scale. In addition, the gauge
couplings blow up around the GUT scale because of the presence of Higgs
multiplets of large representations. In order to remedy these pathologies, in
part II, we extend GUT into 5D. We propose two approaches: one is to consider
the warped extra dimension, using the bulk Higgs profile to explain the
intermediate energy scales. Another is to use the orbifold GUT. Both approaches
are complementary to each other.
