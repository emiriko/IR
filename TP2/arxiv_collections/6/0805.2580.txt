We observe nonlinear pulse reshaping of femtosecond pulses in a waveguide
array due to coupling between waveguides. Amplified pulses from a mode-locked
fiber laser are coupled to an AlGaAs core waveguide array structure. The
observed power-dependent pulse reshaping agrees with theory, including
shortening of the pulse in the central waveguide.
