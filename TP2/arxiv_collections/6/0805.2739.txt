Having always been at the forefront of information management and open
access, High-Energy Physics (HEP) proves to be an ideal test-bed for
innovations in scholarly communication including new information and
communication technologies. Three selected topics of scholarly communication in
High-Energy Physics are presented here: A new open access business model,
SCOAP3, a world-wide sponsoring consortium for peer-reviewed HEP literature;
the design, development and deployment of an e-infrastructure for information
management; and the emerging debate on long-term preservation, re-use and
(open) access to HEP data.
