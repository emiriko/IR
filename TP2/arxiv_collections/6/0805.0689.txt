Using valence band photoemission we have demonstrated the presence of a
pseudogap in the near Fermi level electronic spectrum of some of the mixed
phase compositions of Sm$_{1-x}$Ca$_x$MnO$_3$ system. The pseudogap was found
to grow in size over a large region of the phase diagram of this system,
finally leading to a metal-insulator transition. We have made a study comparing
the near Fermi level behaviors of this system to those of a canonical double
exchange system, namely, La$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$MnO$_3$. This study intends to
highlight one of the important differences between the phase separated and
double exchange colossal magnetoresistance systems in the nature of their
energy gaps across the metal-insulator transitions. These differences could be
ascribed to the distortions in the MnO$_6$ octahedra of their structures that
regulate the localization of charge carriers. We have discussed our results
from the point of view of models based on the idea of phase separation.
