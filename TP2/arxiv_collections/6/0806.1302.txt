The extreme ultraviolet (XUV) emission from dense plasmas generated with
sub-10-fs laser pulses with varying peak intensities up to 3*10^16 W/cm^2 is
investigated for different target materials. K shell spectra are obtained from
low Z targets (carbon and boron nitride). In the spectra a series limit for the
hydrogen and helium like resonance lines is observed indicating that the plasma
is at high density and pressure ionization has removed the higher levels. In
addition, L shell spectra from titanium targets were obtained. Basic features
of the K and L shell spectra are reproduced with computer simulations. The
calculations include hydrodynamic simulation of the plasma expansion and
collisional radiative calculations of the XUV emission.
