In cosmological perturbation theory a first major step consists in the
decomposition of the various perturbation amplitudes into scalar, vector and
tensor perturbations, which mutually decouple. In performing this decomposition
one uses -- beside the Hodge decomposition for one-forms -- an analogous
decomposition of symmetric tensor fields of second rank on Riemannian manifolds
with constant curvature. While the uniqueness of such a decomposition follows
from Gauss' theorem, a rigorous existence proof is not obvious. In this note we
establish this for smooth tensor fields, by making use of some important
results for linear elliptic differential equations.
