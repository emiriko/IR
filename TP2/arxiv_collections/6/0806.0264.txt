In this paper we investigate a multi-parameter deformation
$\mathfrak{B}_{r,s}^n(a,\lambda,\delta)$ of the walled Brauer algebra which was
previously introduced by Leduc (\cite{leduc}). We construct an integral basis
of $\mathfrak{B}_{r,s}^n(a,\lambda,\delta)$ consisting of oriented tangles
which is in bijection with walled Brauer diagrams. Moreover, we study a natural
action of $\mathfrak{B}_{r,s}^n(q)= \mathfrak{B}_{r,s}^n(q^{-1}-q,q^n,[n]_q)$
on mixed tensor space and prove that the kernel is free over the ground ring
$R$ of rank independent of $R$. As an application, we prove one side of
Schur--Weyl duality for mixed tensor space: the image of
$\mathfrak{B}_{r,s}^n(q)$ in the $R$-endomorphism ring of mixed tensor space
is, for all choices of $R$ and the parameter $q$, the endomorphism algebra of
the action of the (specialized via the Lusztig integral form) quantized
enveloping algebra $\mathbf{U}$ of the general linear Lie algebra
$\mathfrak{gl}_n$ on mixed tensor space. Thus, the $\mathbf{U}$-invariants in
the ring of $R$-linear endomorphisms of mixed tensor space are generated by the
action of $\mathfrak{B}_{r,s}^n(q)$.
