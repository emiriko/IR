In principle particle spins can be measured from their production cross
sections once their mass is approximately known. The method works in practice
because spins are quantized and cross sections depend strongly on spins. It can
be used to determine, for example, the spin of the top quark. Direct
application of this method to supersymmetric theories will have to overcome the
challenge of measuring mass at the LHC, which could require high statistics. In
this article, we propose a method of measuring the spins of the colored
superpatners by combining rate information for several channels and a set of
kinematical variables, without directly measuring their masses. We argue that
such a method could lead to an early determination of the spin of gluino and
squarks. This method can be applied to the measurement of spin of other new
physics particles and more general scenarios.
