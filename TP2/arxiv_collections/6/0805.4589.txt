Generalized vector form factors of the pion, related to the moments of the
generalized parton distribution functions, are evaluated in the
Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model with the Pauli-Villars regularization. The lowest
moments (the electromagnetic and the gravitational form factors) are compared
to recent lattice data, with fair agreement. Predictions for higher-order
moments are also made. Relevant features of the generalized form factors in the
chiral quark models are highlighted and the role of the QCD evolution for the
higher-order GFFs is stressed.
