We have studied spin structures of fluctuation-driven fractionalized vortices
and topological spin order in 2D nematic superfluids of cold sodium atoms. Our
Monte Carlo simulations suggest a softened pi-spin disclination structure in a
half-quantum vortex when spin correlations are short ranged; in addition,
calculations indicate that a unique non-local topological spin order emerges
simultaneously as cold atoms become a superfluid below a critical temperature.
We have also estimated fluctuation-dependent critical frequencies for
half-quantum vortex nucleation in rotating optical traps and discussed probing
these excitations in experiments.
