We discuss the role of electron-electron and electron-phonon correlations in
current flow in the Coulomb Blockade regime, focusing specifically on
nontrivial signatures arising from the break-down of mean-field theory. By
solving transport equations directly in Fock space, we show that
electron-electron interactions manifest as gateable excitations experimentally
observed in the current-voltage characteristic. While these excitations might
merge into an incoherent sum that allows occasional simplifications, a clear
separation of excitations into slow `traps' and fast `channels' can lead to
further novelties such as negative differential resistance, hysteresis and
random telegraph signals. Analogous novelties for electron-phonon correlation
include the breakdown of commonly anticipated Stokes-antiStokes intensities,
and an anomalous decrease in phonon population upon heating due to reabsorption
of emitted phonons.
