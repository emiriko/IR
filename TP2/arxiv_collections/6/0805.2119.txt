We calculate the magnetic-field and temperature dependence of all quantum
corrections to the ensemble-averaged conductance of a network of quantum dots.
We consider the limit that the dimensionless conductance of the network is
large, so that the quantum corrections are small in comparison to the leading,
classical contribution to the conductance. For a quantum dot network the
conductance and its quantum corrections can be expressed solely in terms of the
conductances and form factors of the contacts and the capacitances of the
quantum dots. In particular, we calculate the temperature dependence of the
weak localization correction and show that it is described by an effective
dephasing rate proportional to temperature.
