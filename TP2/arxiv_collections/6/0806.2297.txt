The magnetization orientation of a nanoscale ferromagnet can be manipulated
using an electric current via the spin transfer effect. Time domain
measurements of nanopillar devices at low temperatures have directly shown that
magnetization dynamics and reversal occur coherently over a timescale of
nanoseconds. By adjusting the shape of a spin torque waveform over a timescale
comparable to the free precession period (100-400 ps), control of the
magnetization dynamics in nanopillar devices should be possible. Here we report
coherent control of the free layer magnetization in nanopillar devices using a
pair of current pulses as narrow as 30 ps with adjustable amplitudes and delay.
We show that the switching probability can be tuned over a broad range by
timing the current pulses with the underlying free-precession orbits, and that
the magnetization evolution remains coherent for more than 1 ns even at room
temperature. Furthermore, we can selectively induce transitions along
free-precession orbits and thereby manipulate the free magnetic moment motion.
We expect this technique will be adopted for further elucidating the dynamics
and dissipation processes in nanomagnets, and will provide an alternative for
spin torque driven spintronic devices, such as resonantly pumping microwave
oscillators, and ultimately, for efficient reversal of memory bits in magnetic
random access memory (MRAM).
