We present measurements of the absolute phase velocity of transverse and
longitudinal sound in superfluid 3He-B at low temperature, extending from the
imaginary squashing mode to near pair-breaking. Changes in the transverse phase
velocity near pair-breaking have been explained in terms of an order parameter
collective mode that arises from f-wave pairing interactions, the so-called
J=4- mode. Using these measurements, we establish lower bounds on the energy
gap in the B-phase. Measurement of attenuation of longitudinal sound at low
temperature and energies far above the pair-breaking threshold, are in
agreement with the lower bounds set on pair-breaking. Finally, we discuss our
estimations for the strength of the f-wave pairing interactions and the Fermi
liquid parameter, F4s.
