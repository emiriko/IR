The magnitude and phase of the transmission amplitude of a multi-level
quantum dot is calculated for the mesoscopic regime of level spacing large
compared to level width. The interplay between Kondo correlations and the
influence by neighboring levels is discussed. As in the single-level case, the
Kondo plateaus of magnitude and phase disappear with increasing temperature. At
certain gate voltages, ``stationary'' points are found at which the
transmission phase is independent of temperature. Depending on the mesoscopic
parameters of the adjacent levels (like relative sign and magnitude of
tunneling matrix elements), the stationary points are shifted to or repelled by
the neighboring level.
