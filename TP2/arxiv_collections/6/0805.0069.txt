The multiparticle entanglement in the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model has been
discussed extensively in this paper. Measured by the global entanglement and
its generalization, our calculation shows that the multiparticle entanglement
can faithfully detect quantum phase transitions. For an antiferromagnetic case
the multiparticle entanglement reaches the maximum at the transition point,
whereas for ferromagnetic coupling, two different behaviors of multiparticle
entanglement can be identified, dependent on the anisotropic parameter in the
coupling.
