Does massless (lambda Phi^4)_4 theory exhibit spontaneous symmetry breaking
(SSB)? The raw 1-loop result implies that it does, but the "RG-improved" result
implies the opposite. I argue that the appropriate "low-energy effective
theory" is a nonlocal field theory involving an attractive, long-range
interaction Phi^2(x) Phi^2(y)/z^4, where z=|x-y|. RG improvement then requires
running couplings for both this interaction and the original pointlike
interaction. A crude calculation in this framework yields SSB even after "RG
improvement" and closely agrees with the raw 1-loop result.
