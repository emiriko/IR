This article presents certain recent methodologies and some new results for
the statistical analysis of probability distributions on manifolds. An
important example considered in some detail here is the 2-D shape space of
k-ads, comprising all configurations of $k$ planar landmarks ($k>2$)-modulo
translation, scaling and rotation.
