In this article, the stability of a general class of spherically symmetric
thin-shell wormholes is studied under perturbations preserving the symmetry.
For this purpose, the equation of state at the throat is linearized around the
static solutions. The formalism presented here is applied to dilaton wormholes
and it is found that there is a smaller range of possible stable configurations
for them than in the case of Reissner-Nordstrom wormholes with the same charge.
