We propose a quantum-enhanced protocol to authenticate classical messages,
with improved security with respect to the classical scheme introduced by
Brassard in 1983. In that protocol, the shared key is the seed of a
pseudo-random generator (PRG) and a hash function is used to create the
authentication tag of a public message. We show that a quantum encoding of
secret bits offers more security than the classical XOR function introduced by
Brassard. Furthermore, we establish the relationship between the bias of a PRG
and the amount of information about the key that the attacker can retrieve from
a block of authenticated messages. Finally, we prove that quantum resources can
improve both the secrecy of the key generated by the PRG and the secrecy of the
tag obtained with a hidden hash function.
