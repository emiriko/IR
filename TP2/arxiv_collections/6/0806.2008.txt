In this chapter, we present two applications in information fusion in order
to evaluate the generalized proportional conflict redistribution rule presented
in the chapter \cite{Martin06a}. Most of the time the combination rules are
evaluated only on simple examples. We study here different combination rules
and compare them in terms of decision on real data. Indeed, in real
applications, we need a reliable decision and it is the final results that
matter. Two applications are presented here: a fusion of human experts opinions
on the kind of underwater sediments depict on sonar image and a classifier
fusion for radar targets recognition.
