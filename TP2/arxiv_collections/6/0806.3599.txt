We propose a photon-arrival detector (PAD), which detects the arrival of a
signal photon and simultaneously projects the signal input state to a single
photon state, with an atom-cavity system. In this proposal, use of a V-type
system as the intracavity atom is discussed for implementing the PAD, since
V-type systems have been widely studied in the field of solid state, enabling
us to miniaturize and integrate that implementation. The performance of the
proposed PAD is evaluated for a specific method of the detection process. The
proposed PAD is capable of repeating the procedure for detecting the arrival of
input photons and it has improves the detection probability so that it has a
higher quantum efficiency than those of conventional photodetectors.
