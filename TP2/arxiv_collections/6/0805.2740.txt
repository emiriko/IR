We establish recurrences formulas of the order of the classical groups that
allow us to find a generalization of Euler's angles for classical groups and
the invariant measures of these groups. We find the generating function for the
SU(2) subset of SU(3) basis in the Fock-Bargmann space and a new basis of
SU(3). This new basis is eigenfunction of the square of kinetic moment in
product spaces of spherical harmonics. We generalize the generating function of
SU (2) and we find invariant polynomials of SU (3) which are elements of the
basis of SU (6). Using the above results we deduce the method of calculation
isoscalar factors. We expose this method and we give the generating function
for a particular case. Finally we determine the generating function of the
elements of the representation matrix of SU(3) and we derive the analytical
expression of these elements.
