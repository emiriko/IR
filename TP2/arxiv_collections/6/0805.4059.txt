For an acyclic directed graph with multiple sources and multiple sinks, we
prove that one can choose the Merger's paths between the sources and the sinks
such that the number of mergings between these paths is upper bounded by a
constant depending only on the min-cuts between the sources and the sinks,
regardless of the size and topology of the graph. We also give bounds on the
minimum number of mergings between these paths, and discuss how it depends on
the min-cuts.
