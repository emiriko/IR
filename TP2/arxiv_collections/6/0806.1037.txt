We present the first comparison between numerical relativity (NR) simulations
of an eccentric binary black hole system with corresponding post-Newtonian (PN)
results. We evolve an equal-mass, non-spinning configuration with an initial
eccentricity e ~ 0.1 for 21 gravitational wave cycles before merger, and find
agreement in the gravitational wave phase with an adiabatic eccentric PN model
with 2 PN radiation reaction within 0.1 radians for 10 cycles. The NR and PN
phase difference grows to 0.7 radians by 5 cycles before merger. We find that
these results can be obtained by expanding the eccentric PN expressions in
terms of the frequency-related variable x = (omega M)^{2/3} with M the total
mass of the binary. When using instead the mean motion n = 2 \pi /P, where P is
the orbital period, the comparison leads to significant disagreements with NR.
