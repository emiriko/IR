I review recent developments in finite temperature lattice QCD which are
useful for the study of heavy-ion collisions. I pay particular attention to
studies of the equation of state and the light they throw on conformal symmetry
and the large N_c limit, and to the structure of the phase diagram for N_f=2+1.
