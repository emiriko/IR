We examine avalanche statistics of rain- and vibration-driven granular slides
in miniature sand mounds. A crossover from power-law to non power-law
avalanche-size statistics is demonstrated as a generic driving rate $\nu$ is
increased. For slowly-driven mounds, the tail of the avalanche-size
distribution is a power-law with exponent $-1.97\pm 0.31$, reasonably close to
the value previously reported for landslide volumes. The interevent occurrence
times are also analyzed for slowly-driven mounds; its distribution exhibits a
power-law with exponent $-2.670\pm 0.001$.
