Generalizing Cusick's theorem on the closedness of the classical Lagrange
spectrum for the approximation of real numbers by rational ones, we prove that
various approximation spectra are closed, using penetration properties of the
geodesic flow in cusp neighbourhoods in negatively curved manifolds and a
result of Maucourant.
