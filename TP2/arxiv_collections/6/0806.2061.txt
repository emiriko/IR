In the stringy cosmology, we investigate singularities in geodesic surface
congruences for the time-like and null strings to yield the Raychaudhuri type
equations possessing correction terms associated with the novel features owing
to the strings. Assuming the stringy strong energy condition, we have a
Hawking-Penrose type inequality equation. If the initial expansion is negative
so that the congruence is converging, we show that the expansion must pass
through the singularity within a proper time. We observe that the stringy
strong energy conditions of both the time-like and null string congruences
produce the same inequality equation.
