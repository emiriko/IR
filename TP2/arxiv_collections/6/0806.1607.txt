The origin of both the Ising chain magnetism and ferroelectricity in
Ca$_3$CoMnO$_6$ is studied by $ab$ $initio$ electronic structure calculations
and x-ray absorption spectroscopy. We find that Ca$_3$CoMnO$_6$ has the
alternate trigonal prismatic Co$^{2+}$ and octahedral Mn$^{4+}$ sites in the
spin chain. Both the Co$^{2+}$ and Mn$^{4+}$ are in the high spin state. In
addition, the Co$^{2+}$ has a huge orbital moment of 1.7 $\mu_B$ which is
responsible for the significant Ising magnetism. The centrosymmetric crystal
structure known so far is calculated to be unstable with respect to exchange
striction in the experimentally observed $\uparrow\uparrow\downarrow\downarrow$
antiferromagnetic structure for the Ising chain. The calculated inequivalence
of the Co-Mn distances accounts for the ferroelectricity.
