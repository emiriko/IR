We propose a distance between two realizations of a random process where for
each realization only sparse and irregularly spaced measurements with
additional measurement errors are available. Such data occur commonly in
longitudinal studies and online trading data. A distance measure then makes it
possible to apply distance-based analysis such as classification, clustering
and multidimensional scaling for irregularly sampled longitudinal data. Once a
suitable distance measure for sparsely sampled longitudinal trajectories has
been found, we apply distance-based clustering methods to eBay online auction
data. We identify six distinct clusters of bidding patterns. Each of these
bidding patterns is found to be associated with a specific chance to obtain the
auctioned item at a reasonable price.
