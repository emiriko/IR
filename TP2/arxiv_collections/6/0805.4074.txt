Stimulated by recent observations of the excited bottom-strange mesons
$B_{s1}$ and $B_{s2}^*$, we calculate the semileptonic decays $B_{s0},
B_{s1}^{\prime}, B_{s1}, B_{s2}^*\to [D_s(1968), D_{s}^*(2112), D_{sJ}(2317),
D_{sJ}(2460)]\ell\bar{\nu}$, which is relevant for the exploration of the
potential of searching these semileptonic decays in experiment.
