The low-temperature ferroelectric polarization of multiferroic $YMn_2O_5$ is
completely reversed at a critical pressure of 10 kbar and the phase transition
from the incommensurate to the commensurate magnetic phase is induced by
pressures above 14 kbar. The high-pressure data correlate with thermal
expansion measurements indicating a significant lattice strain at the
low-temperature transition into the incommensurate phase. The results support
the exchange striction model for the ferroelectricity in multiferroic
$RMn_2O_5$ compounds and they show the importance of magnetic frustration as
well as the spin-lattice coupling.
