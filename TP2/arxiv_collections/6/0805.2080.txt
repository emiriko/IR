Significant enhancement of evanescent spatial harmonics inside the slabs of
media with extreme optical anisotropy is revealed. This phenomenon results from
the pumping of standing waves and has the feature of being weakly sensitive to
the material losses. Such characteristics may enable subwavelength imaging at
considerable distances away from the objects.
