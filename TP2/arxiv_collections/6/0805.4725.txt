The two-body Dirac equation with general local potential is reduced to the
pair of ordinary second-order differential equations for radial components of a
wave function. The class of linear + Coulomb potentials with complicated
spin-angular structure is found, for which the equation is exactly solvable. On
this ground a relativistic potential model of light mesons is constructed and
the mass spectrum is calculated. It is compared with experimental data.
