Let S be a Damek-Ricci space and L be a distinguished left invariant
Laplacian on S. We prove pointwise estimates for the convolution kernels of
spectrally localized wave operators associated with L. This generalizes
previous results proved by D. Mueller and C. Thiele on ax+b-groups. We also
prove pointwise estimates of the gradient of these convolution kernels. As a
corollary we reprove basic multiplier estimates from previous papers of W.
Hebisch and T. Steger and M. Vallarino by different methods. Finally we derive
Sobolev estimates for the solution to the wave equation associated with L.
