This article presents the compatibility of experimental data from neutrino
oscillation experiments with a high-$\dmsq$ two-neutrino oscillation
hypothesis. Data is provided by the Bugey, Karlsruhe Rutherford Medium Energy
Neutrino Experiment 2 (KARMEN2), Los Alamos Liquid Scintillator Neutrino
Detector (LSND), and MiniBooNE experiments. The LSND, KARMEN2, and MiniBooNE
results are 25.36% compatible within a two-neutrino oscillation hypothesis.
However, the point of maximal compatibility is found in a region that is
excluded by the Bugey data. A joint analysis of all four experiments, performed
in the $\sinsqtheta \mathrm{vs} \dmsq$ region common to all data, finds a
maximal compatibility of 3.94%. This result does not account for additions to
the neutrino oscillation model from sources such as CP violation or sterile
neutrinos.
