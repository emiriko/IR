We report the measurements of $p_T$ spectra of $K^*$ up to intermediate $p_T$
region in mid-rapidity through its hadronic decay channel using the STAR
detector in Au+Au and Cu+Cu collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}$= 62.4 GeV
and 200 GeV. Particle ratios such as $K^{*}/K$ and $K^{*}/\phi$ is used to
understand the rescattering and regeneration effect on $K^{*}$ production in
the hadronic medium. The $K^*$ $v_{2}$ measurement using a high statistics
Au+Au 200 GeV dataset and nuclear modification factor measurement supports the
quark coalescence model of particle production in the intermediate $p_T$ range.
