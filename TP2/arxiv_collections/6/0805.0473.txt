Microtribological properties of vertically-aligned carbon-nanotube (VACNT)
films have been studied. Adhesion forces were obtained by measuring
force-displacement curves. Friction experiments were conducted in reciprocating
sliding configurations. Effects of tip radius, applied force, scan speed, and
relative humidity were investigated. A model of the friction of VACNT film is
discussed on the basis of in-situ tribological experiments inside a scanning
electron microscope (SEM).
