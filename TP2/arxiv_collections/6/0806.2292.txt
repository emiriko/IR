A simple algebraic method to obtain exact solutions to the scalar field
equations in spatially flat FRW cosmology is derived. The field potential
fuction is reduced to two terms which can be used to determine some
characteristic inflationary variables. To demonstrate the method, exact
solutions resembling typical potentials of general interest are worked out.
Finally, it is shown that this method of solution is also applicable to a
perfect fluid in the same metric, for a curvature k>=0 and fixed gamma.
