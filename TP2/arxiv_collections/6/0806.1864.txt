In this paper, starting from the basic description of the equation that
governs the bunch motion and looking at the advances of the technology, three
examples of feedback designs versus technology trend are presented and
discussed. In particular the author compares three digital systems implemented
or proposed for DAFNE and other e+/e- accelerators. Descriptions of some
relevant features are also done. Conclusions on the digital feedback design
trend are reported.
