Vertically aligned ZnO nanotube arrays fabricated on an ITO substrate are
found to exhibit strong persistent photoconductivity (PPC) effect and
electrically driven conductance switching behavior, though the latter shows a
gradual decay from high conductance state to a low conductance state. Unlike
the electrical switching, the PPC cannot be reset or reversed by an electrical
pulse. Excitation wavelength dependent conductance measurement indicates the
presence of the defect localized states (DLS) ~ 240meV above the valence band
edge, in support of the hypothesis that the doubly ionization of these DLS are
responsible for the PPC effect.
