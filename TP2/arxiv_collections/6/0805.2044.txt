In this brief note, we highlight some difficulties that can arise when
fitting a continuous, symmetric, unimodal distribution to a set of expert's
judgements. A simple analysis shows it is possible to fit a Cauchy distribution
to an expert's beliefs when their beliefs actually follow a normal
distribution. This example stresses the need for careful distribution fitting
and for feedback to the expert about what the fitted distribution implies about
their beliefs.
