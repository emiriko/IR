The statement of the authors of the article Phys. Rev. C 77, 065211 (2008)
that spurious singularities occur in the dispersion relation approach, where
imaginary parts of the amplitudes of the process \gamma\gamma->\pi\pi are
saturated by the contributions of meson resonances by using Breit-Wigner
expressions, is analyzed. It is shown that there are no any additional
singularities in this approach and the disagreement between the predictions of
the dispersion relations and the chiral perturbation theory for
(\alpha_1-\beta_1)_\pi^{\pm} remains.
