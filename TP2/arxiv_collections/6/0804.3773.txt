A Lorentz invariant positive definite expression for photon number density is
derived as the absolute square of the invariant scalar product of a
polarization sensitive position eigenvector and the photon wave function. It is
found that this scalar product is independent of the form chosen for the wave
function and that the normalized positive frequency vector potential-electric
field pair is a convenient choice of wave function in the presence of matter.
The number amplitude describing a localized state is a delta-function at the
instant at which localization and detection are seen as simultaneous.
