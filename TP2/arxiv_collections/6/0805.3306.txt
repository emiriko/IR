The dynamics of magnetization in the presence of spin-transfer torque was
studied. We derived the equation for the motion of magnetization in the
presence of a spin current by using the local equilibrium assumption in
non-equilibrium thermodynamics. We show that, in the resultant equation, the
ratio of the Gilbert damping constant, $\alpha$, and the coefficient, $\beta$,
of the current-induced torque, called non-adiabatic torque, depends on the
relaxation time of the fluctuating field $\tau_{c}$. The equality
$\alpha=\beta$ holds when $\tau_c$ is very short compared to the time scale of
magnetization dynamics. We apply our theory to current-induced magnetization
reversal in magnetic multilayers and show that the switching time is a
decreasing function of $\tau_{c}$.
