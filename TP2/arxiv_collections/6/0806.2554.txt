Explicit counterterm construction is presented in a symmetry breaking
background for the 2PI effective action of the self-interacting one-component
scalar field including skeleton diagrams to O(\lambda^2). The applied strategy
is an extension of our treatment of the 2PI-Hartree approximation [G. Fejos, A.
Patkos and Zs. Szep, Nucl. Phys. A803 (2008) 135]. The procedure is also
applied to the O(N) model.
