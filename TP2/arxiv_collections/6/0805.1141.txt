The particular properties of dynamics are discussed for the dissipatively
coupled van der Pol oscillators, non-identical in values of parameters
controlling the Hopf bifurcation. Possibility of a special synchronization
regime in an infinitively long band between oscillation death and quasiperiodic
areas is shown for such system. Features of the bifurcation picture are
discussed for different values of the control parameters and for the case of
additional Duffing-type nonlinearity. Analysis of the abridged equations is
presented.
