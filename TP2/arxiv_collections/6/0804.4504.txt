The study of quarkonium production in relativistic heavy ion collisions
provides insight into the properties of the produced medium. The lattice
studies show a sequential suppression of quarkonia states when compared to
normal nuclear matter; which further affirms that a full spectroscopy including
bottomonium can provide us a better thermometer for the matter produced under
extreme conditions in relativistic heavy ion collisions. With the completion of
the STAR Electromagnetic Calorimeter and with the increased luminosity provided
by RHIC in Run 6 and 7, the study of $\Upsilon$ production via the di-electron
channel becomes possible. We present the results on $\Upsilon$ measurements in
p+p collisions (from Run 6) along with the first results from Au+Au collisions
(in Run 7) at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}} = 200$ GeV from the STAR experiment.
