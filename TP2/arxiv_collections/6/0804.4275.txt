Group theoretical arguments combined with normal mode analysis techniques are
applied to a coarse-grained approximation of icosahedral viral capsids which
incorporates areas of variable flexibility. This highlights a remarkable
structure of the low-frequency spectrum in this approximation, namely the
existence of a plateau of 24 near zero-modes with universal group theory
content.
