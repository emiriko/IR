In this paper, we study shocks and related transitions in asymmetric simple
exclusion processes of particles with nearest neighbor interactions. We
consider two kinds of inter-particle interactions. In one case, the
particle-hole symmetry is broken due to the interaction. In the other case,
particles have an effective repulsion due to which the particle-current-density
drops down near the half filling. These interacting particles move on a one
dimensional lattice which is open at both the ends with injection of particles
at one end and withdrawal of particles at the other. In addition to this, there
are possibilities of attachments or detachments of particles to or from the
lattice with certain rates. The hydrodynamic equation that involves the exact
particle current-density of the particle conserving system and additional terms
taking care of the attachment-detachment kinetics is studied using the
techniques of boundary layer analysis.
