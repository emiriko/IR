We construct the effective chiral Lagrangian involving the
  D--mesons and Goldstone bosons at next-to-leading order taking into account
strong as well as electromagnetic interactions. This allows us to disentangle
-- to leading order in isospin violation -- the electromagnetic and the strong
contribution to the D--meson mass differences. In addition, we also apply the
interaction to the decay D_{s0}^*(2317)-> D_s pi0 under the assumption that the
D_{s0}^*(2317) is a hadronic molecule. We find (180+-110) keV for the decay
width $\Gamma (D_{s0}^*(2317)-> D_s pi0) -- consistent with currently existing
experimental constraints as well as previous theoretical investigations. The
result provides further evidence that this decay width can serve as a criterion
for testing the nature of the D_{s0}^*(2317).
