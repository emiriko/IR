We investigate the cold fission/fusion paths of superheavy nuclei within the
two center shell model, in order to find the best projectile-target
combinations of their production. The fission/fusion yields are estimated by
using the semiclassical approach. We predict several asymmetric combinations of
relative long living fragments, which can be used in fusion experiments of
superheavy nuclei with Z>118.
