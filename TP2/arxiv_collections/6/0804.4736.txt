We study the bias-dependent spin-transfer torque in magnetic tunnel junctions
in the Stoner model by scattering theory. We show that the in-plane
(Slonczewski type) torque vanishes and subsequently reverses its direction when
the bias voltage becomes larger or the barrier wider than material and
device-dependent critical values. We are able to reproduce the magnitude and
the bias dependence of measured in-plane and out-of-plane torques using
realistic parameters. The condition for the vanishing torque is summarized by a
phase diagram depending on the applied bias and barrier width, which is
explained in terms of an interface spin polarization and the electron focusing
by the barrier. Quantum size effects in the spin-transfer torque are predicted
as a function of the thickness of a normal metal layer inserted between the
ferromagnet and tunnel barrier.
