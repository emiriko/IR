It is demonstrated that all observed fractions at moderate Landau level
fillings for the quantum Hall effect can be obtained without recourse to the
phenomenological concept of composite fermions. The possibility to have the
special topologically nontrivial many-electron wave functions is considered.
Their group classification indicates the special values of of electron density
in the ground states separated by a gap from excited states.
