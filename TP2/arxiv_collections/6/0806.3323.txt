Spin liquid states for spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on a
hyperkagome lattice are studied. We classify and study flux states according to
symmetries. Applying this model to Na4Ir3O8, we propose that the high
temperature state may be described by a spinon Fermi surface, which forms a
paired state with line nodes below 20 K. The possible mixed spin singlet and
spin triplet pairing states are discussed according to the lattice symmetry
which breaks inversion.
