We report bulk magnetization, and elastic and inelastic neutron scattering
measurements under an external magnetic field, $H$, on the weakly coupled
distorted kagome system, Cu_{2}(OD)_3Cl. Our results show that the ordered
state below 6.7 K is a canted antiferromagnet and consists of large
antiferromagnetic $ac$-components and smaller ferromagnetic $b$-components. By
first-principle calculations and linear spin wave analysis, we present a simple
spin hamiltonian with non-uniform nearest neighbor exchange interactions
resulting in a system of coupled spin trimers with a single-ion anisotropy that
can qualitatively reproduce the spin dynamics of Cu_{2}(OD)_3Cl.
