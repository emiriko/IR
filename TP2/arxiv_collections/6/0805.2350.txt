The top quark was discovered in 1995. The top quark mass is now well measured
at the Tevatron, with uncertainty getting below 1% of the top mass. The world
average from last year was 170.9 $\pm$ 1.8 GeV/$c^2$. The new CDF measurement
is 172 $\pm$ 1.2 (stat) $\pm$ 1.5 (sys) GeV/$c^2$, and D0 will soon present a
new measurement. The top quark mass is an important parameter in the Standard
Model, and should be measured as precisely as possible. To learn more about the
top quark observed and study possible new physics, other properties also should
be measured. At the Tevatron, the charge of the top quark can be measured
directly. Examples of other properties studied and reported in this
presentation are W helicity, top decay branching ratio to b ($R_b$), searches
for $t \to H b$ and for flavor changing neutral current (FCNC). The results are
all consistent with the Standard Model within current statistics. With
significantly more data being collected at the Tevatron, precision measurements
of the top properties are just starting.
