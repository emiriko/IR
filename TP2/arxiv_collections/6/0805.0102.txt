Gravitational-wave detectors have been well developed and operated with high
sensitivity. However, they still suffer from mirror displacement noise. In this
paper, we propose a resonant speed meter, as a displacement noise-canceled
configuration based on a ring-shaped synchronous recycling interferometer. The
remarkable feature of this interferometer is that, at certain frequencies,
gravitational-wave signals are amplified, while displacement noises are not.
