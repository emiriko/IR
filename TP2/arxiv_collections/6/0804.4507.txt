Recently, a gauged linear sigma model was proposed by Berkovits and Vafa
which can be used to describe the AdS_5xS^5 superstring at finite and zero
radius. In this paper we show that the model is classically integrable by
constructing its first non-local conserved charge and a superspace Lax
"quartet". Quantum conservation of the non-local charge follows easily from
superspace rules.
