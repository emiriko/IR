Using numerical results from ideal and viscous relativistic hydrodynamic
simulations with three different equations of state, for Au+Au and Cu+Cu
collisions at different centralities and initial energy densities, we explore
the dependence of the eccentricity-scaled elliptic flow, v_2/epsilon, and the
produced entropy fraction, Delta S/S_0, on the final charged hadron
multiplicity density dN_ch/dy per unit transverse overlap area S,
(1/S)(dN_ch/dy). The viscous hydrodynamic simulations are performed with two
different versions of the Israel-Stewart kinetic evolution equations, and in
each case we investigate the dependence of the physical observables on the
kinetic relaxation time. We find approximate scaling of v_2/epsilon and Delta
S/S_0 with (1/S)(dN_ch/dy), with scaling functions that depend on the EOS and,
in particular, on the value of the specific shear viscosity eta/s. Small
scaling violations are seen even in ideal hydrodynamics, caused by a breaking
of the scale invariance of ideal fluid dynamics by the freeze-out condition.
Viscous hydrodynamics shows somewhat larger scale-breaking effects that
increase with increasing eta/s and decreasing system size and initial energy
density. We propose to use precision studies of these scaling violations to
help constrain the shear viscosity eta/s of the quark-gluon plasma created in
relativistic heavy ion collisions.
