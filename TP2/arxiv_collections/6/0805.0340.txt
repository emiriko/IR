We propose that the existence of Metastable Innershell Molecular State (MIMS)
was experimentally discovered by Bae et al. in hypervelocity (v>100km/s) impact
of nanoparticles. The decay of MIMS resulted in the observed intense soft
x-rays in the range of 75 - 100 eV in agreement with Winterberg's recent
prediction.
