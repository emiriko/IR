The spin network quantum simulator relies on the su(2) representation ring
(or its q-deformed counterpart at q= root of unity) and its basic features
naturally include (multipartite) entanglement and braiding. In particular,
q-deformed spin network automata are able to perform efficiently approximate
calculations of topological invarians of knots and 3-manifolds. The same
algebraic background is shared by 2D lattice models supporting topological
phases of matter that have recently gained much interest in condensed matter
physics. These developments are motivated by the possibility to store quantum
information fault-tolerantly in a physical system supporting fractional
statistics since a part of the associated Hilbert space is insensitive to local
perturbations. Most of currently addressed approaches are framed within a
'double' quantum Chern-Simons field theory, whose quantum amplitudes represent
evolution histories of local lattice degrees of freedom.
  We propose here a novel combinatorial approach based on `state sum' models of
the Turaev-Viro type associated with SU(2)_q-colored triangulations of the
ambient 3-manifolds. We argue that boundary 2D lattice models (as well as
observables in the form of colored graphs satisfying braiding relations) could
be consistently addressed. This is supported by the proof that the Hamiltonian
of the Levin-Wen condensed string net model in a surface Sigma coincides with
the corresponding Turaev-Viro amplitude on Sigma x [0,1] presented in the last
section.
