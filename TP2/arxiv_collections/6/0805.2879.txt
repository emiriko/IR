This paper presents exploratory techniques for multivariate data, many of
them well known to French statisticians and ecologists, but few well understood
in North American culture. We present the general framework of duality diagrams
which encompasses discriminant analysis, correspondence analysis and principal
components, and we show how this framework can be generalized to the regression
of graphs on covariates.
