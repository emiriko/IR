We show that the sets of weighted badly approximable vectors in $\Bbb R^n$
are winning sets of certain games, which are modifications of
$(\alpha,\beta)$-games introduced by W. Schmidt in 1966. The latter winning
property is stable with respect to countable intersections, and is shown to
imply full Hausdorff dimension.
