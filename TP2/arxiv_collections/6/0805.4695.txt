We analyze the charmless two-body $B\to VP$ decays in the
soft-collinear-effective-theory (SCET), where $V(P)$ denotes a light vector
(pseudoscalar) meson. Using the current experimental data, we find two
solutions in $\chi^2$ fit for the 16 non-perturbative inputs responsible for
the 87 $B\to PP$ and $B\to VP$ decay channels in SU(3) symmetry. Chirally
enhanced penguins can only change several charming penguins sizably, since they
share the same topology. The (S-P)(S+P) annihilation penguins in the
perturbative QCD approach have the same topology with charming penguins in
SCET, which play an important role in direct CP asymmetries.
