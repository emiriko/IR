In a previous article we developed an approach to the optimal (minimum
variance, unbiased) statistical estimation technique for the equilibrium
displacement of a damped, harmonic oscillator in the presence of thermal noise.
Here, we expand that work to include the optimal estimation of several linear
parameters from a continuous time series. We show that working in the basis of
the thermal driving force both simplifies the calculations and provides
additional insight to why various approximate (not optimal) estimation
techniques perform as they do. To illustrate this point, we compare the
variance in the optimal estimator that we derive for thermal noise with those
of two approximate methods which, like the optimal estimator, suppress the
contribution to the variance that would come from the irrelevant, resonant
motion of the oscillator. We discuss how these methods fare when the dominant
noise process is either white displacement noise or noise with power spectral
density that is inversely proportional to the frequency ($1/f$ noise). We also
construct, in the basis of the driving force, an estimator that performs well
for a mixture of white noise and thermal noise. To find the optimal
multi-parameter estimators for thermal noise, we derive and illustrate a
generalization of traditional matrix methods for parameter estimation that can
accommodate continuous data. We discuss how this approach may help refine the
design of experiments as they allow an exact, quantitative comparison of the
precision of estimated parameters under various data acquisition and data
analysis strategies.
