We present results for the matrix elements relevant for proton decay in Grand
Unified Theories (GUTs). The calculation is performed at a fixed lattice
spacing a^{-1}=1.73(3) GeV using 2+1 flavors of domain wall fermions on
lattices of size 16^3\times32 and 24^3\times64 with a fifth dimension of length
16. We use the indirect method which relies on an effective field theory
description of proton decay, where we need to estimate the low energy
constants, \alpha = -0.0112(25) GeV^3 and \beta = 0.0120(26) GeV^3. We relate
these low energy constants to the proton decay matrix elements using leading
order chiral perturbation theory. These can then be combined with experimental
bounds on the proton lifetime to bound parameters of individual GUTs.
