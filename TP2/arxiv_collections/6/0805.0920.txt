This paper presents the study of an original closed-loop conditioning
approach for fully-integrated convective inertial sensors. The method is
applied to an accelerometer manufactured on a standard CMOS technology using an
auto-aligned bulk etching step. Using the thermal behavior of the sensor as a
summing function, a first order sigma-delta modulator is built. This
"electro-physical" modulator realizes an analog-to-digital conversion of the
signal. Besides the feedback scheme should improve the sensor performance.
