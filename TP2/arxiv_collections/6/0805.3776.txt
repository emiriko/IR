We report measurements of the Casimir force between a gold sphere and a
silicon surface with an array of nanoscale, rectangular corrugations using a
micromechanical torsional oscillator. At distance between 150 nm and 500 nm,
the measured force shows significant deviations from the pairwise additive
formulism, demonstrating the strong dependence of the Casimir force on the
shape of the interacting bodies. The observed deviation, however, is smaller
than the calculated values for perfectly conducting surfaces, possibly due to
the interplay between finite conductivity and geometry effects.
