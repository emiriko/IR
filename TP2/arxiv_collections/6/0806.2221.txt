We have studied the structure and properties of potassium clusters containing
even number of atoms ranging from 2 to 20 at the ab initio level. The geometry
optimization calculations are performed using all-electron density functional
theory with gradient corrected exchange-correlation functional. Using these
optimized geometries we investigate the evolution of binding energy, ionization
potential, and static polarizability with the increasing size of the clusters.
The polarizabilities are calculated by employing Moller-Plesset perturbation
theory and time dependent density functional theory. The polarizabilities of
dimer and tetramer are also calculated by employing large basis set coupled
cluster theory with single and double excitations and perturbative triple
excitations. The time dependent density functional theory calculations of
polarizabilities are carried out with two different exchange-correlation
potentials: (i) an asymptotically correct model potential and (ii) within the
local density approximation. A systematic comparison with the other available
theoretical and experimental data for various properties of small potassium
clusters mentioned above has been performed. These comparisons reveal that both
the binding energy and the ionization potential obtained with gradient
corrected potential match quite well with the already published data.
Similarly, the polarizabilities obtained with Moller-Plesset perturbation
theory and with model potential are quite close to each other and also close to
experimental data.
