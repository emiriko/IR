We prove pairwise disjointness of representations T_{z,w} of the
infinite-dimensional unitary group. These representations provide a natural
generalization of the regular representation for the case of "big" group
U(\infty). They were introduced and studied by G.Olshanski and A.Borodin.
  Disjointness of the representations can be reduced to disjointness of certain
probability measures on the space of paths in the Gelfand-Tsetlin graph. We
prove the latter disjointness using probabilistic and combinatorial methods.
