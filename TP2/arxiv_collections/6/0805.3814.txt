A two-dimensional nonlinear Schrodinger lattice with nonlinear coupling,
modelling a square array of weakly coupled linear optical waveguides embedded
in a nonlinear Kerr material, is studied. We find that despite a vanishing
energy difference (Peierls-Nabarro barrier) of fundamental stationary modes the
mobility of localized excitations is very poor. This is attributed to a large
separation in parameter space of the bifurcation points of the involved
stationary modes. At these points the stability of the fundamental modes is
changed and an asymmetric intermediate solution appears that connects the
points. The control of the power flow across the array when excited with plane
waves is also addressed and shown to exhibit great flexibility that may lead to
applications for power-coupling devices. In certain parameter regimes, the
direction of a stable propagating plane-wave current is shown to be
continuously tunable by amplitude variation (with fixed phase gradient). More
exotic effects of the nonlinear coupling terms like compact discrete breathers
and vortices, and stationary complex modes with non-trivial phase relations are
also briefly discussed. Regimes of dynamical linear stability are found for all
these types of solutions.
