We present a new leptogenesis scenario, where the lepton asymmetry is
generated by CP violating decays of heavy electroweak singlet neutrinos via
electromagnetic dipole moment couplings to the ordinary light neutrinos. Akin
to the usual scenario where the decays are mediated through Yukawa
interactions, we have shown, by explicit calculations, that the desired
asymmetry can be produced through the interference of the corresponding
tree-level and one-loop decay amplitudes involving the effective dipole moment
operators. We also find that the relationship of the leptogenesis scale to the
light neutrino masses is similar to that for the standard Yukawa-mediated
mechanism.
