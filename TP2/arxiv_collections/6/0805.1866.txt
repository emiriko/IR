By using some techniques such as spectral distribution and stratification
associated with the graphs, employed in [1,2] for the purpose of Perfect state
transfer (PST) of a single qubit over antipodes of distance-regular spin
networks and PST of a $d$-level quantum state over antipodes of pseudo-distance
regular networks, PST of an m-qubit GHZ state is investigated. To do so, we
employ the particular distance-regular networks (called Johnson networks)
J(2m,m) to transfer an m-qubit GHZ state initially prepared in an arbitrary
node of the network (called the reference node) to the corresponding antipode,
perfectly.
