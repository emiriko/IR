We present a general method for predicting bond percolation thresholds and
critical surfaces for a broad class of two-dimensional periodic lattices,
reproducing many known exact results and providing excellent approximations for
several unsolved lattices. For the checkerboard and inhomogeneous bow-tie
lattices, the method yields predictions that agree with numerical measurements
to more than six figures, and are possibly exact.
