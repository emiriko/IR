Type IIB string theory on spacetimes that are asymptotically
AdS$_5\times$S$^5$ can be defined using four dimensional ${\cal N}=4$ super
Yang-Mills theory. Six of the dimensions of the string theory are
holographically reconstructed in the Yang-Mills theory. In this article we
study how these dimensions and local physics in these dimensions emerge. We
reorganize the dynamics of the ${1\over 2}$ BPS sector of the field theory by
rewriting it in terms of Schur polynomials. The Young diagram labeling of these
polynomials can be viewed as a book keeping device which summarizes how the
operator is constructed. We show that aspects of the geometry of the extra
holographic dimensions are captured very naturally by the Young diagram.
Gravitons which are localized at a specific position in the bulk correspond to
boxes added at a specific location on the Young diagram.
