We are concerned with surjectivity of perturbations of maximal monotone
operators in non-reflexive Banach spaces. While in a reflexive setting, a
classical surjectivity result due to Rockafellar gives a necessary and
sufficient condition to maximal monotonicity, in a non-reflexive space we
characterize maximality using a ``enlarged'' version of the duality mapping,
introduced previously by Gossez.
