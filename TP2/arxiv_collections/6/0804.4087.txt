We present a theoretical study of Weiss oscillations in magnetoconductivity
of bilayer graphene. Bilayer graphene in the presence of a perpendicular
magnetic field and a unidirectional weak electric modulation is considered.We
determine the $\sigma_{yy}$ component of the magnetoconductivity tensor for
this system which is shown to exhibit Weiss oscillations. We show that Weiss
oscillations in the magnetoconductivity of bilayer graphene are enhanced and
more robust with temperature compared to those in conventional two-dimensional
electron gas systems whereas they are less robust with temperature compared to
monolayer graphene. In addition, we also find phase differences of $\pi$ and
$2\pi$ in the magnetoconductivity oscillations compared to monolayer graphene
and conventional 2DEG system which arises due to the chiral nature of
quasiparticles in graphene.
