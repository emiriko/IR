"Plat_Forms" is a competition in which top-class teams of three programmers
compete to implement the same requirements for a web-based system within 30
hours, each team using a different technology platform (Java EE, .NET, PHP,
Perl, Python, or Ruby on Rails). The results will provide new insights into the
real (rather than purported) pros, cons, and emergent properties of each
platform. The evaluation will analyze many aspects of each solution, both
external (usability, functionality, reliability, performance, etc.) and
internal (structure, understandability, flexibility, etc.).
