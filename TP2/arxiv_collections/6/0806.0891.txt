We develop a quantum noise approach to study quantum transport through
nanostructures. The nanostructures, such as quantum dots, are regarded as
artificial atoms, subject to quasi-equilibrium fermionic reservoirs of
electrons in biased leads. Noise operators characterizing the quantum
fluctuation in the reservoirs are related to the damping and fluctuation of the
artificial atoms through the quantum Langevin equation. The average current and
current noise are derived in terms of the reservoir noise correlations. In the
white-noise limit, we show that the current and current noise can be exactly
calculated by the quantum noise approach, even in the presence of interaction
such as Coulomb blockade. As a typical application, the average current and
current noise through a single quantum dot are studied.
