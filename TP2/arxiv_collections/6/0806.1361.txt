This paper describes a distributed collaborative wiki-based platform that has
been designed to facilitate the development of Semantic Web applications. The
applications designed using this platform are able to build semantic data
through the cooperation of different developers and to exploit that semantic
data. The paper shows a practical case study on the application VPOET, and how
an application based on Google Gadgets has been designed to test VPOET and let
human users exploit the semantic data created. This practical example can be
used to show how different Semantic Web technologies can be integrated into a
particular Web application, and how the knowledge can be cooperatively
improved.
