Two new phases YbCu4.4 and YbCu4.25 are found as a result of careful phase
diagram investigations. Between the congruent and peritectic formation of
YbCu4.5 and YbCu3.5, respectively, the phases YbCu4.4 and YbCu4.25 are formed
peritectically at 934(2)degC and 931(3)degC. Crystal growth was realised using
a Bridgman technique and single crystalline grains of about 50-100 10^{-6}m
were analyzed by electron diffraction and single crystal X-ray diffraction. Due
to the only slight differences in both compositions and formation temperatures
the growth of larger single crystals of a defined superstructure is
challenging. The compounds YbCu4.4 and YbCu4.25 fit in Cerny`s (J. Solid State
Chem. 174 (2003) 125) building principle {(RECu5)n(RECu2)} where RE = Yb with n
= 4 and 3. YbCu4.4 and YbCu4.25 base on AuBe5/MgCu2-type substructures and
contain approximately 4570 and 2780 atoms per unit cell. The new phases close
the gap in the series of known copper-rich rare earth compounds for n = 1, 2
(DyCu3.5, DyCu4.0) and n = 5 (YbCu4.5, DyCu4.5).
