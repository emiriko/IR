We calculate correction to the nuclear fission barrier produced by the atomic
electrons. The result presented in analytical form is convenient to use in
future nuclear calculations. The atomic electrons have a small stabilizing
effect on nuclei, increasing lifetime in nuclear fission channel. This effect
gives a new instrument to study the fission process.
