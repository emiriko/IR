We theoretically propose and numerically realize spin echo in a spinor
Bose--Einstein condensate (BEC). We investigate the influence on the spin echo
of phase separation of the condensate. The equation of motion of the spin
density exhibits two relaxation times. We use two methods to separate the
relaxation times and hence demonstrate a technique to reveal magnetic
dipole--dipole interactions in spinor BECs.
