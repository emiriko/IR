Permutations of particle labels are usually used to illustrate the
relationship between classical and quantum statistics. We use permutations of
attributes/properties of particles to express properties of waves. We express
events of the well-known two-double-slit experiment (in regimes that are
appropriate to quantum interference and classical interference) in terms of
symmetries of permutations of particle labels and attributes. We also obtain a
new system called residual interference, and suggest an experiment to detect
it.
