Jet tomography, the study of differential energy loss of hard scattered
partons to infer the density profile of the medium, is greatly improved by
precise knowledge of the initial energy of the hard probe. As photons are not
strongly interacting, the momentum of the recoil jet from a direct photon
trigger is balanced, to a good approximation, by the momentum of the photon.
The energy loss of the away-side jet may be viewed as an effective modification
of the fragmentation function. Direct photon-hadron correlations in A+A
collisions should be sensitive to modified jet fragmentation as well as to
medium response effects. Complementary measurements from p+p collisions are
necessary to benchmark jet fragmentation expectations at \sqrt{s_NN} = 200 GeV
as well as to constrain perturbative calculations in the \gamma+jet channel.
Here we present new results from p+p and Au+Au collisions which use a
statistical method to subtract the background from decay photons.
