We present time-resolved spontaneous emission measurements of single quantum
dots embedded in photonic crystal waveguides. Quantum dots that couple to the
photonic crystal waveguide are found to decay up to 27 times faster than
uncoupled quantum dots. From these measurements $\beta$-factors of up to 0.89
are derived, and an unprecedented large bandwidth of 20 nm is demonstrated.
This shows the promising potential of photonic crystal waveguides for efficient
single-photon sources. The scaled frequency where the enhancement is observed
is in excellent agreement with theory taking into account that the light-matter
coupling is strongly enhanced due to the significant slow-down of light in the
photonic crystal waveguide.
