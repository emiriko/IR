Data recorded by the D0 experiment at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider are
analyzed to search for neutral Higgs bosons produced in association with $b$
quarks. This production mode can be enhanced in the minimal supersymmetric
standard model (MSSM). The search is performed in the three $b$ quark channel
using multijet triggered events corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $1
\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$. No statistically significant excess of events with respect
to the predicted background is observed and limits are set in the MSSM
parameter space.
