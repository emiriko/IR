In a non-equilibrium system, a Constant Flux Relation (CFR) expresses the
fact that a constant flux of a conserved quantity exactly determines the
scaling of the particular correlation function linked to the flux of that
conserved quantity. This is true regardless of whether mean--field theory is
applicable or not. We focus on cluster--cluster aggregation and discuss the
consequences of mass conservation for the steady state of aggregation models
with a monomer source in the diffusion-limited regime. We derive the CFR for
the flux-carrying correlation function for binary aggregation with a general
scale-invariant kernel and show that this exponent is unique. It is independent
of both the dimension and of the details of the spatial transport mechanism, a
property which is very atypical in the diffusion-limited regime. We then
discuss in detail the ``locality criterion'' which must be satisfied in order
for the CFR scaling to be realisable. Locality may be checked explicitly for
the mean-field Smoluchowski equation. We show that if it is satisfied at the
mean-field level, it remains true over some finite range as one perturbatively
decreases the dimension of the system below the critical dimension, $d_c=2$,
entering the fluctuation-dominated regime. We turn to numerical simulations to
verify locality for a range of systems in one dimension which are, presumably,
beyond the perturbative regime. Finally, we illustrate how the CFR scaling may
break down as a result of a violation of locality or as a result of finite size
effects and discuss the extent to which the results apply to higher order
aggregation processes.
