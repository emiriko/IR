The Large Hadron Collider will provide hadronic collisions at energies in the
multi-TeV range, never explored before. The parton fractional momenta probed at
such energies can be as low as x~2p_T/\sqrt(s) e^(-y)~10^-5 at large rapidities
y, opening up attractive opportunities for low-x QCD studies. The combination
of the CMS HF (3$<|\eta|<$5) and CASTOR (5.1<|\eta|<6.6) calorimeters allows
one, in particular, to reconstruct very forward jets. We present
generator-level studies of the CMS capabilities to measure the single inclusive
forward jet spectrum and forward-backward (Mueller-Navelet) dijets in p-p
collisions at 14 TeV. Both observables are sensitive to low-x gluon densities
and non-linear QCD evolution.
