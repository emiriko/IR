We demonstrate that Majorana neutrinos can form Cooper pairs due to
long-range attractive forces and show BCS superfluidity in a class of mass
varying neutrino dark energy models. We describe the condensates for Majorana
neutrinos and estimate the value of the gap, critical temperature and Pippard
coherence length for a simple neutrino dark energy model. In the strong
coupling regime bosonic degree of freedom can become important and
Bose-Einstein condensate may govern the dynamics for the mass varying neutrino
models. Formation of the condensates can significantly alter the instability
scenario in the mass varying neutrino models.
