In contrast to electrodynamics, Einstein's gravitation equations are not
invariant with respect to a wide class of the mapping of field variables which
leave equations of motion of test particles in a given coordinate system
invariant. It seems obvious enough that just these mappings should play a role
of gauge transformations of the variables in differential equations of
gravitational field. We consider here in short a gauge-invariant bimetric
generalisation of the Einstein equations which does not contradict availabel
observation data. Physical interpretation of the bimetricity based on
relativity of space-time with respect to used reference frame, following
conceptually from old Poincar\'{e} fundamental ideas, is proposed..
