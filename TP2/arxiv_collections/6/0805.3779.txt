Transverse-field muon spin rotation measurements of overdoped La2-xSrxCuO4
reveal a large broadening of the local magnetic field distribution in response
to applied field, persisting to high temperatures. The field-response is
approximately Curie-Weiss like in temperature and is largest for the highest
doping investigated. Such behaviour is contrary to the canonical Fermi-liquid
picture commonly associated with the overdoped cuprates and implies extensive
heterogeneity in this region of the phase diagram. A possible explanation for
the result lies in regions of staggered magnetization about dopant cations,
analogous to what is argued to exist in underdoped systems.
