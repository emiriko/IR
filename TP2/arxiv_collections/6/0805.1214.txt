We present elementary mappings between classical lattice models and quantum
circuits. These mappings provide a general framework to obtain efficiently
simulable quantum gate sets from exactly solvable classical models. For
example, we recover and generalize the simulability of Valiant's match-gates by
invoking the solvability of the free-fermion eight-vertex model. Our mappings
furthermore provide a systematic formalism to obtain simple quantum algorithms
to approximate partition functions of lattice models in certain
complex-parameter regimes. For example, we present an efficient quantum
algorithm for the six-vertex model as well as a 2D Ising-type model. We finally
show that simulating our quantum algorithms on a classical computer is as hard
as simulating universal quantum computation (i.e. BQP-complete).
