We present a method of Zariski-van Kampen type for the calculation of the
transcendental lattice of a complex projective surface. As an application, we
calculate the transcendental lattices of complex singular K3 surfaces
associated with an arithmetic Zariski pair of maximizing sextics of type
$A_{10}+A_{9}$ that are defined over a real quadratic field and are conjugate
to each other over the field of rational numbers.
