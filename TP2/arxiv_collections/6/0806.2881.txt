A fundamental question of high-temperature superconductors is the nature of
the pseudogap phase which lies between the Mott insulator at zero doping and
the Fermi liquid at high doping p. Here we report on the behaviour of charge
carriers near the zero-temperature onset of that phase, namely at the critical
doping p* where the pseudogap temperature T* goes to zero, accessed by
investigating a material in which superconductivity can be fully suppressed by
a steady magnetic field. Just below p*, the normal-state resistivity and Hall
coefficient of La1.6-xNd0.4SrxCuO4 are found to rise simultaneously as the
temperature drops below T*, revealing a change in the Fermi surface with a
large associated drop in conductivity. At p*, the resistivity shows a linear
temperature dependence as T goes to zero, a typical signature of a quantum
critical point. These findings impose new constraints on the mechanisms
responsible for inelastic scattering and Fermi surface transformation in
theories of the pseudogap phase.
