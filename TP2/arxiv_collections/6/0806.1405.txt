We can write the polynomial solution of the second order linear differential
equation of hypergeometric-type $$ \phi(x)y''+\psi(x)y'+\lambda y=0, $$ where
$\phi$ and $\psi$ are polynomials, $\deg \phi\le 2$, $\deg \psi=1$ and
$\lambda$ is a constant, among others, by using the Rodrigues operator
$R_k(\phi,{\bf u})$ (see \cite{coma2}) where $\bf u$ is certain linear operator
which satisfies the distributional equation \begin{equation} \label{1}
\frac{d}{dx}[\phi {\bf u}]=\psi {\bf u}, \end{equation} as $$ P_n(x)=B_n
R_n(\phi,{\bf u})[1], \qquad B_n\ne 0,\quad n=0, 1, 2, ... $$ Taking this into
account we construct the complementary polynomials. Among the key results is a
generating functional function in closed form leading to derivations of
recursion relations and addition theorem. The complementary polynomials satisfy
a hypergeometric-type differential equation themselves, have a three-term
recursion among others and Rodrigues formulas.
