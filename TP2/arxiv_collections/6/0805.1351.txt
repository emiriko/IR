Anisotropic flow measurements play a crucial role in understanding the
physics and bulk properties of the system created in heavy ion collisions. In
this talk I briefly review the most important results obtained so far, recent
developments in the analysis techniques and the interpretation of the results,
and what should we expect next, both at RHIC and LHC. I also discuss event
anisotropies sensitive to the strong parity violation effects.
