This paper deals with the numerical analysis of two one-way systems derived
from the general complete modeling proposed by M.V. De Hoop. The main goal of
this work is to compare two different formulations in which a correcting term
allows to improve the amplitude of the numerical solution. It comes out that
even if the two systems are equivalent from a theoretical point of view,
nothing of the kind is as far as the numerical simulation is concerned. Herein
a numerical analysis is performed to show that as long as the propagation
medium is smooth, both the models are equivalent but it is no more the case
when the medium is associated to a quite strongly discontinuous velocity.
