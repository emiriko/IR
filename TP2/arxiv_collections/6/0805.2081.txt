We formulate the problem of finding the probability that the determinant of a
matrix undergoes the least change upon perturbation of one of its elements,
provided that most or all of the elements of the matrix are chosen at random
and that the randomly chosen elements have a fixed probability of being
non-zero. Also, we show that the procedure for finding the probability that the
determinant undergoes the least change depends on whether the random variables
for the matrix elements are continuous or discrete.
