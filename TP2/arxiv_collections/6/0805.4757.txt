Because of the technical difficulties of solving spin transport equations in
inhomogeneous systems, different resistor networks are widely applied for
modeling spin transport. By comparing an analytical solution for spin injection
across a ferromagnet - paramagnet junction with a resistor model approach, its
essential limitations stemming from inhomogeneous spin populations are
clarified.
