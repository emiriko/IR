I present an overview of predictions for the heavy ion program at the Large
Hadron Collider. It is mainly based on the material presented during the
workshop 'Heavy Ion Collisions at the LHC - Last Call for Predictions', held in
the frame of the CERN Theory Institute from May 14th to June 10th 2007.
Predictions on both bulk properties and hard probes are reviewed.
