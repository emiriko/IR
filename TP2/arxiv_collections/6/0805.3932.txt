We calculate the AC conductance and the finite-frequency non-symmetrized
noise in interacting quantum wires and single-wall carbon nanotubes in the
presence of an impurity. We observe a strong asymmetry in the frequency
spectrum of the non-symmetrized excess noise, even in the presence of the
metallic leads. We find that this asymmetry is proportional to the differential
excess AC conductance of the system, defined as the difference between the AC
differential conductances at finite and zero voltage, and thus disappears for a
linear system. In the quantum regime, for temperatures much smaller than the
frequency and the applied voltage, we find that the emission noise is exactly
equal to the impurity partition noise. For the case of a weak impurity we
expand our results for the AC conductance and the noise perturbatively. In
particular, if the impurity is located in the middle of the wire or at one of
the contacts, our calculations show that the noise exhibits oscillations with
respect to frequency, whose period is directly related to the value of the
interaction parameter $g$.
