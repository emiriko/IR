The 1+1 layer folded graphene sheets that deviate from AB stacking are
successfully fabricated and their electronic structures are investigated by
Raman spectroscopy. Significant blue shift of the 2D band of folded graphene
compared to that of single layer graphene (SLG) is observed. This is attributed
to SLG-like electronic structure of folded graphene but with slowing down of
Fermi velocity (as much as ~5.6%). Different amount of blue shift of 2D band is
observed for different folded graphenes, which may correspond to the different
twist angle and/or separation between the two layers, resulting in different
Fermi velocity of folded graphenes. Electronic structure of 1+1 folded graphene
samples with different stacking order (twist and separation between the two
layers, and in-plane shift of the two layers) can be investigated by Raman
spectroscopy.
