The influence of quadrupolar interactions on the structure of small clusters
is investigated by adding a point quadrupole of variable strength to the
Lennard-Jones potential. Competition arises between sheet-like arrangements of
the particles, favoured by the quadrupoles, and compact structures, favoured by
the isotropic Lennard-Jones attraction. Putative global potential energy minima
are obtained for clusters of up to 25 particles using the basin-hopping
algorithm. A number of structural motifs and growth sequences emerge, including
star-like structures, tubes, shells and sheets. The results are discussed in
the context of colloidal self-assembly.
