We study the group of automorphisms of Shimura curves $X_0(D, N)$ attached to
an Eichler order of square-free level $N$ in an indefinite rational quaternion
algebra of discriminant $D>1$. We prove that, when the genus $g$ of the curve
is greater than or equal to 2, $\Aut (X_0(D, N))$ is a 2-elementary abelian
group which contains the group of Atkin-Lehner involutions $W_0(D, N)$ as a
subgroup of index 1 or 2. It is conjectured that $\Aut (X_0(D, N)) = W_0(D, N)$
except for finitely many values of $(D, N)$ and we provide criteria that allow
us to show that this is indeed often the case. Our methods are based on the
theory of complex multiplication of Shimura curves and the Cerednik-Drinfeld
theory on their rigid analytic uniformization at primes $p\mid D$.
