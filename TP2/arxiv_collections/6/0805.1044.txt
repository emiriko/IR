We consider entanglement swapping for certain mixed states. We assume that
the initial states have the same singlet fraction and show that the final state
can have singlet fraction greater than the initial states. We also consider two
quantum teleportations and show that entanglement swapping can increase
teleportation fidelity. Finally, we show how this effect can be demonstrated
with linear optics.
