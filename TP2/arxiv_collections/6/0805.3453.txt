The experimental data available up to date in literature corresponding to the
paramagnetic - spin density wave transition in nonsuperconducting LaOFeAs are
discussed. In particular, we pay attention that upon spin density wave
transition there is a relative decrease of the density of states on the Fermi
level and a pseudogap formation. The values of these quantities are not
properly described in frames of the density functional theory. The agreement of
them with experimental estimations becomes more accurate with the use of fixed
spin moment procedure when iron spin moment is set to experimental value.
Strong electron correlations which are not included into the present
calculation scheme may lead both to the decrease of spin moment and
renormalization of energy spectrum in the vicinity of the Fermi level for
correct description of discussed characteristics.
