The scope of this paper is two-fold. First, to present to the researchers in
combinatorics an interesting implementation of permutations avoiding
generalized patterns in the framework of discrete-time dynamical systems.
Indeed, the orbits generated by piecewise monotone maps on one-dimensional
intervals have forbidden order patterns, i.e., order patterns that do not occur
in any orbit. The allowed patterns are then those patterns avoiding the
so-called forbidden root patterns and their shifted patterns. The second scope
is to study forbidden patterns in shift systems, which are universal models in
information theory, dynamical systems and stochastic processes. Due to its
simple structure, shift systems are accessible to a more detailed analysis and,
at the same time, exhibit all important properties of low-dimensional chaotic
dynamical systems (e.g., sensitivity to initial conditions, strong mixing and a
dense set of periodic points), allowing to export the results to other
dynamical systems via order-isomorphisms.
