The masses of charmonium s and p-states, pseudoscalar and vector decay
constants, leptonic, hadronic as well as radiative decay widths for charmonia
have been computed in the framework of extended harmonic confinement model
without any additional parameters. The outcome in comparison with other
contemporary theoretical and experimental results is presented.
