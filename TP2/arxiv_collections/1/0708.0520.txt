We show that the Euler system is not exactly controllable by a
finite-dimensional external force. The proof is based on the comparison of the
Kolmogorov epsilon-entropy for Holder spaces and for the class of functions
that can be obtained by solving the 2D Euler equations with various right-hand
sides.
