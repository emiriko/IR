We establish the interrelation between the QCD scalar response of the nuclear
medium and its response to a scalar probe coupled to nucleons, such as the
scalar meson responsible for the nuclear binding. The relation that we derive
applies at the nucleonic as well as at the nuclear levels. Non trivial
consequences follow. In particular it opens the possibility of relating medium
effects in the scalar meson exchange or three-body forces of nuclear physics to
QCD lattice studies of the nucleon mass
