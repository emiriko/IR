We consider the random-anisotropy model on the square and on the cubic
lattice in the strong-anisotropy limit. We compute exact ground-state
configurations, and we use them to determine the stiffness exponent at zero
temperature; we find $\theta = -0.275(5)$ and $\theta \approx 0.2$ respectively
in two and three dimensions. These results show that the low-temperature phase
of the model is the same as that of the usual Ising spin-glass model. We also
show that no magnetic order occurs in two dimensions, since the expectation
value of the magnetization is zero and spatial correlation functions decay
exponentially. In three dimensions our data strongly support the absence of
spontaneous magnetization in the infinite-volume limit.
