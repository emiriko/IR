A physical introduction to the basics of chiral dynamics is presented.
Emphasis is placed on experimental tests which have generally demonstrated a
strong confirmation of the predictions of chiral perturbation theory, a low
energy effective field theory of QCD. Special attention is paid to a few cases
where discrepancies exist, requiring further work. Some desirable future tests
are also recommended.
