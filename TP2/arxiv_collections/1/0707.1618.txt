Space time cube representation is an information visualization technique
where spatiotemporal data points are mapped into a cube. Fast and correct
analysis of such information is important in for instance geospatial and social
visualization applications. Information visualization researchers have
previously argued that space time cube representation is beneficial in
revealing complex spatiotemporal patterns in a dataset to users. The argument
is based on the fact that both time and spatial information are displayed
simultaneously to users, an effect difficult to achieve in other
representations. However, to our knowledge the actual usefulness of space time
cube representation in conveying complex spatiotemporal patterns to users has
not been empirically validated. To fill this gap we report on a
between-subjects experiment comparing novice users error rates and response
times when answering a set of questions using either space time cube or a
baseline 2D representation. For some simple questions the error rates were
lower when using the baseline representation. For complex questions where the
participants needed an overall understanding of the spatiotemporal structure of
the dataset, the space time cube representation resulted in on average twice as
fast response times with no difference in error rates compared to the baseline.
These results provide an empirical foundation for the hypothesis that space
time cube representation benefits users when analyzing complex spatiotemporal
patterns.
