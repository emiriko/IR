Following the Good-and-Walker picture, hard diffraction in the
high-energy/small-x limit of QCD can be described in terms of eigenstates of
the scattering matrix off a Color Glass Condensate. From the CGC non-linear
evolution equations, it is then possible to derive the behavior of diffractive
cross-sections at small $x.$ I discuss recent results, in particular the
consequences of the inclusion of Pomeron loops in the evolution.
