We consider the XXZ spin chain with diagonal boundary conditions in the
framework of algebraic Bethe Ansatz. Using the explicit computation of the
scalar products of Bethe states and a revisited version of the bulk inverse
problem, we calculate the elementary building blocks for the correlation
functions. In the limit of half-infinite chain, they are obtained as multiple
integrals of usual functions, similar to the case of periodic boundary
conditions.
