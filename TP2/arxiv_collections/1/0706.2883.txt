We demonstrate fully tunable single and double quantum dots in a
one-dimensional hole system based on undoped Ge/Si core-shell nanowire
heterostructures. The local hole density along the nanowire is controlled by
applying voltages to five top gate electrodes with a periodicity of 80 nm,
insulated from the wire by a 20 nm-thick HfO_2 dielectric film. Low-temperature
transport measurements were used to investigate the magnetic field dependence
of Coulomb blockade peaks in a single quantum dot and indicate a strongly
anisotropic g-factor with |g_para| = 0.60 +/- 0.03 and |g_perp| < 0.12.
