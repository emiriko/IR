We comment on a recent article of M.W.Evans, Acta Physica Polonica B38 (2007)
2211. We point out that the equations underlying Evans' theory are highly
problematic. Moreover, we demonstrate that the so-called ``spin connection
resonance'', predicted by Evans, cannot be derived from the equation he used.
We provide an exact solution of Evans' corresponding equation and show that is
has definitely no resonance solutions.
