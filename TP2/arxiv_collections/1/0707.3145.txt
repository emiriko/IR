Recently, muon production in electron-proton scattering has been suggested as
a possible candidate reaction for the identification of lepton-flavor violation
due to physics beyond the Standard Model. Here we point out that the
Standard-Model processes $e^- p \to \mu^- p \bar{\nu}_\mu \nu_e$ and $e^- p \to
e^- n \mu^+ \nu_\mu$ can cloud potential beyond-the-Standard-Model signals in
electron-proton collisions. We find that Standard-Model $e p \to \mu X$ cross
sections exceed those from lepton-flavor-violating operators by several orders
of magnitude. We also discuss the possibility of using a nuclear target to
enhance the $e p \to \mu X$ signal.
