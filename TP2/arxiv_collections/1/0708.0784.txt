Experimental observation of Doppler-free signals for weak transitions can be
greatly facilitated by an estimate for their expected amplitudes. We derive an
analytical model which allows the Doppler-free amplitude to be estimated for
small Doppler-free signals. Application of this model to formaldehyde allows
the amplitude of experimentally observed Doppler-free signals to be reproduced
to within the experimental error.
