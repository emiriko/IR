In this article we review our work on the dynamics and decoherence of
electron and hole spins in single and double quantum dots. The first part, on
electron spins, focuses on decoherence induced via the hyperfine interaction
while the second part covers decoherence and relaxation of heavy-hole spins due
to spin-orbit interaction as well as the manipulation of heavy-hole spin using
electric dipole spin resonance.
