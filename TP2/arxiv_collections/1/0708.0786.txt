We consider relativistic collisions of heavy hydrogen-like ions with hydrogen
and helium atoms in which the ion-atom interaction causes both colliding
particles to undergo transitions between their internal states. Using an
approach enabling one, for the first time, to give a detailed description of
this important case of the relativistic quantum few-body problem we concentrate
on the study of the longitudinal momentum spectrum of the atomic recoil ions.
We discuss the role of relativistic and higher order effects, predict a
surprisingly strong influence of the projectile's electron on the momentum
transfer, draw the general picture of the recoil ion formation and show that
the important information about the doubly inelastic collisions could be
obtained in experiment merely by measuring the recoil momentum spectrum.
