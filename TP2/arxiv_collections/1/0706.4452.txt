We survey indications from different branches of Physics that the fine scale
structure of spacetime is not adequately described by a manifold. Based on the
hints we accumulate, we propose a new structure, which we call a quantum topos.
In the process of constructing a quantum topos for quantum gravity, we propose
a new, operational approach to the problem of the obervables in quantum
gravity, which leads to a new mathematical point of view on the state sum
models.
