The determination of the pattern of hadronic resonances as predicted by
Quantum Chromodynamics requires the use of non-perturbative techniques. Lattice
QCD has emerged as the dominant tool for such calculations, and has produced
many QCD predictions which can be directly compared to experiment. The concepts
underlying lattice QCD are outlined, methods for calculating excited states are
discussed, and results from an exploratory Nucleon and Delta baryon spectrum
study are presented.
