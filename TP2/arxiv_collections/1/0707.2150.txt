The solvable Lie algebra parametrization of the symmetric spaces is
discussed. Based on the solvable Lie algebra gauge two equivalent formulations
of the symmetric space sigma model are studied. Their correspondence is
established by inspecting the normalization conditions and deriving the field
transformation laws.
