Building on a recently introduced model for non-volatile resistive switching,
we propose a mechanism for unipolar resistance switching in
metal-insulator-metal sandwich structures. The commutation from the high to low
resistance state and back can be achieved with successive voltage sweeps of the
same polarity. Electronic correlation effects at the metal-insulator interface
are found to play a key role to produce a resistive commutation effect in
qualitative agreement with recent experimental reports on binary transition
metal oxide based sandwich structures.
