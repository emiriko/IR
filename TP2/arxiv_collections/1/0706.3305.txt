This is a study of the MOR cryptosystem using the special linear group over
finite fields. The automorphism group of the special linear group is analyzed
for this purpose. At our current state of knowledge, I show that the MOR
cryptosystem has better security than the ElGamal cryptosystem over finite
fields.
