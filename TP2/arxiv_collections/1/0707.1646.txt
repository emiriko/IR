We consider the problem of fuzzy community detection in networks, which
complements and expands the concept of overlapping community structure. Our
approach allows each vertex of the graph to belong to multiple communities at
the same time, determined by exact numerical membership degrees, even in the
presence of uncertainty in the data being analyzed. We created an algorithm for
determining the optimal membership degrees with respect to a given goal
function. Based on the membership degrees, we introduce a new measure that is
able to identify outlier vertices that do not belong to any of the communities,
bridge vertices that belong significantly to more than one single community,
and regular vertices that fundamentally restrict their interactions within
their own community, while also being able to quantify the centrality of a
vertex with respect to its dominant community. The method can also be used for
prediction in case of uncertainty in the dataset analyzed. The number of
communities can be given in advance, or determined by the algorithm itself
using a fuzzified variant of the modularity function. The technique is able to
discover the fuzzy community structure of different real world networks
including, but not limited to social networks, scientific collaboration
networks and cortical networks with high confidence.
