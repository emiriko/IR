The human lung and its functions are extremely sensitive to orientation and
posture, and debate continues as to the role of gravity and the surrounding
anatomy in determining lung function and heterogeneity of perfusion and
ventilation. However, study of these effects is difficult. The conventional
high-field magnets used for most hyperpolarized 3He MRI of the human lung, and
most other common radiological imaging modalities including PET and CT,
restrict subjects to lying horizontally, minimizing most gravitational effects.
In this paper, we briefly review the motivation for posture-dependent studies
of human lung function, and present initial imaging results of human lungs in
the supine and vertical body orientations using inhaled hyperpolarized 3He gas
and an open-access MRI instrument. The open geometry of this MRI system
features a "walk-in" capability that permits subjects to be imaged in vertical
and horizontal positions, and potentially allows for complete rotation of the
orientation of the imaging subject in a two-dimensional plane. Initial results
include two-dimensional lung images acquired with ~ 4 mm in-plane resolution
and three-dimensional images with ~ 1.5 cm slice thickness. Effects of posture
variation are observed.
