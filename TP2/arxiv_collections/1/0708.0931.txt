We report on high resolution Fourier-transform spectroscopy of fluorescence
to the a^3\Sigma_u^+ state excited by two-photon or two-step excitation from
the X^1\Sigma_g^+ state to the 2^3\Pi_g state in the molecule K_2. These
spectroscopic data are combined with recent results of Feshbach resonances and
two-color photoassociation spectra for deriving the potential curves of
X^1\Sigma_g^+ and a^3\Sigma_u^+ up to the asymptote. The precise relative
position of the triplet levels with respect of the singlet levels was achieved
by including the excitation energies from the X^1\Sigma_g^+ state to the
2^3\Pi_g state and down to the a^3\Sigma_u^+ state in the simultaneous fit of
both potentials. The derived precise potential curves allow for reliable
modeling of cold collisions of pairs of potassium atoms in their ^2S ground
state.
