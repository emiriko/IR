I discuss recent developments on non-leptonic and radiative kaon decays
mainly related to direct CP-violation within the combined ChPT and 1/N_c
expansion approaches. In particular, I review the status of K -> pi pi,
epsilon_K', direct CP-violating K+ -> 3 pi Dalitz plot slope g and decay rate
asymmetries, and the Standard Model prediction for Br(K_L -> pi0 e+ e-).
