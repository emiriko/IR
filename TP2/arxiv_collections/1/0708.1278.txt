We present a systematic study of the current-voltage characteristics and
electroluminescence of gallium nitride (GaN) nanowire on silicon (Si) substrate
heterostructures where both semiconductors are n-type. A novel feature of this
device is that by reversing the polarity of the applied voltage the
luminescence can be selectively obtained from either the nanowire or the
substrate. For one polarity of the applied voltage, ultraviolet (and visible)
light is generated in the GaN nanowire, while for the opposite polarity
infrared light is emitted from the Si substrate. We propose a model, which
explains the key features of the data, based on electron tunnelling from the
valence band of one semiconductor into the conduction band of the other
semiconductor. For example, for one polarity of the applied voltage, given a
sufficient potential energy difference between the two semiconductors,
electrons can tunnel from the valence band of GaN into the Si conduction band.
This process results in the creation of holes in GaN, which can recombine with
conduction band electrons generating GaN band-to-band luminescence. A similar
process applies under the opposite polarity for Si light emission. This device
structure affords an additional experimental handle to the study of
electroluminescence in single nanowires and, furthermore, could be used as a
novel approach to two-colour light-emitting devices.
