We consider the N=1 super Yang-Mills theory with gauge group U(N), adjoint
chiral multiplet X and tree-level superpotential Tr W(X). We compute the
quantum effective superpotential W_mic as a function of arbitrary off-shell
boundary conditions at infinity for the scalar field X. This effective
superpotential has a remarkable property: its critical points are in one-to-one
correspondence with the full set of quantum vacua of the theory, providing in
particular a unified picture of solutions with different ranks for the low
energy gauge group. In this sense, W_mic is a good microscopic effective
quantum superpotential for the theory. This property is not shared by other
quantum effective superpotentials commonly used in the literature, like in the
strong coupling approach or the glueball superpotentials. The result of this
paper is a first step in extending Nekrasov's microscopic derivation of the
Seiberg-Witten solution of N=2 super Yang-Mills theories to the realm of N=1
gauge theories.
