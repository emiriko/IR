The magnetic fluxbrane solution with a strongly warped throat is studied in
the Type IIA supergravity theory with co-dimension one local source which
surves as $Z_{2}$-symmetric UV boundary of the throat. Overall volume of extra
space is stabilized since introduction of the local source breaks the no-scale
structure of the theory and evades the no-go theorem. Radion field is defined
as the position of UV boundary "moved" from its stable value fixed by the
anisotropic Israel junction conditions. Analytical expression for the radion
effective potential is received. Potential decreases exponentially (exponent is
equal to 0,21 in Planck units) in the slow-roll region and apparently meets
other demands of the early inflation. Reissner-Nordstrom type deformation of
the elementary fluxbrane solution permits to construct the IR end of the throat
and results in tiny positive non-zero value of the radion potential in its
extremal point seen today as Dark Energy $\rho_{D.E.}$. Expressions for the
mass scale hierarchy and for the "acceleration hierarchy" received in the paper
give the physically interesting relation between two hierarchies: $\rho_{D.E.}
\sim G_{N}^{2}m^{8}$.
