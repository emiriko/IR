Relativistic simulations in 3+1 dimensions typically monitor the Hamiltonian
and momentum constraints during evolution, with significant violations of these
constraints indicating the presence of instabilities. In this paper we rewrite
the momentum constraints as first-order evolution equations, and show that the
popular BSSN formulation of the Einstein equations explicitly uses the momentum
constraints as evolution equations. We conjecture that this feature is a key
reason for the relative success of the BSSN formulation in numerical
relativity.
