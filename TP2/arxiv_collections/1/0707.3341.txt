We present basics of conceptually new-type way for explaining of the origin,
evolution and current physical properties of our Universe from the
graviton-matter gas viewpoint. Quantization method for the Friedmann-Lemaitre
Universe based on the canonical Hamilton equations of motion is proposed and
quantum information theory way to physics of the Universe is showed. The
current contribution from the graviton-matter gas temperature in quintessence
approximation is discussed.
