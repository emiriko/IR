The conservation of translation as a symmetry in two-dimensional systems with
interaction is a classical subject of statistical mechanics. Here we establish
such a result for Gibbsian particle systems with two-body interaction, where
the interesting cases of singular, hard-core and discontinuous interaction are
included. We start with the special case of pure hard core repulsion in order
to show how to treat hard cores in general.
