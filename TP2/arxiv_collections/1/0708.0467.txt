The ZEUS experiment has measured charm production in diffractive DIS and in
photoproduction. The data are in agreement with perturbative QCD calculations
based on various parameterisations of diffractive parton distribution
functions. The results are consistent with QCD factorisation in diffractive DIS
and direct photoproduction.
