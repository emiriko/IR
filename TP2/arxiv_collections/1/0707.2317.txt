We illustrate the scope of Time Dependent Density Functional Theory (TDDFT)
for strongly correlated (lattice) models out of equilibrium. Using the exact
many body time evolution, we reverse engineer the exact exchange correlation
(xc) potential $v_{xc}$ for small Hubbard chains exposed to time-dependent
fields. We introduce an adiabatic local density approximation (ALDA) to
$v_{xc}$ for the 1D Hubbard model and compare it to exact results, to gain
insight about approximate xc potentials. Finally, we provide some remarks on
the v-representability for the 1D Hubbard model.
