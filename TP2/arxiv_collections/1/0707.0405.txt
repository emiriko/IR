Generalized uncertainty relations are known to provide a minimal length
$\hbar\sqrt{\beta}$. The effect of such minimal length in the Casimir-Polder
interactions between neutral atoms (molecules) is studied. The first order
correction term in the minimal uncertainty parameter is derived and found to
describe an attractive potential scaling as $r^{-9}$ as opposed to the well
known $r^{-7}$ long range retarded potential.
