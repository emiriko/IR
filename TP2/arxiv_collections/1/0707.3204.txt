We trace the emergence of the ``New Minimal'' supersymmetric SO(10) GUT
(NMSGUT) out of the debris created by our demonstration that the MSGUT is
falsified by the data. The NMSGUT is based on ${\bf{210\oplus 10\oplus
120\oplus 126\oplus {\bar {126}}}}$ Higgs system. It has only spontaneous CP
violation and Type I seesaw. With only 24 real superpotential parameters it is
the simplest model capable of accommodating the known 18 parameter fermion mass
data set and yet has enough freedom to accommodate the still unknown Leptonic
CP violation and neutrino mass scale parameters. Our focus is on the two most
salient features uncovered by our analysis: the domination of the
${\bf{\bar{126}}}$ Yukawa couplings by those of the ${\bf{10,120}}$ (required
for evasion of the no-go that trapped the MSGUT) and the inescapable raising of
the Baryon violation scales(and thus suppression of proton decay) decreed by a
proper inclusion of the threshold effects associated with the calculated
superheavy spectra. These two structural features are shown to be
complementary.
