Recent work on a lepton mass matrix model based on an SU(3) flavor symmetry
which is broken into S_4 is reviewed. The flavor structures of the masses and
mixing are caused by VEVs of SU(2)_L-singlet scalars \phi which are nonets
({\bf 8}+{\bf 1}) of the SU(3) flavor symmetry, and which are broken into {\bf
2}+{\bf 3}+{\bf 3}' and {\bf 1} of S_4. If we require the invariance under the
transformation (\phi^{(8)},\phi^{(1)}) \to (-\phi^{(8)},+\phi^{(1)}) for the
superpotential of the nonet field \phi^{(8+1)}, the model leads to a beautiful
relation for the charged lepton masses. The observed tribimaximal neutrino
mixing is understood by assuming two SU(3) singlet right-handed neutrinos
\nu_R^{(\pm)} and an SU(3) triplet scalar \chi.
