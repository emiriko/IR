We show that, for any language in NP, there is an entanglement-resistant
constant-bit two-prover interactive proof system with a constant completeness
vs. soundness gap. The previously proposed classical two-prover constant-bit
interactive proof systems are known not to be entanglement-resistant. This is
currently the strongest expressive power of any known constant-bit answer
multi-prover interactive proof system that achieves a constant gap. Our result
is based on an "oracularizing" property of certain private information
retrieval systems, which may be of independent interest.
