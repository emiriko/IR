Highly crystallized undoped hydrogenated microcrystalline silicon films
prepared using SiF4-H2 mixture plasma were investigated at various stages of
growth employing different microstructural probes. Our self-consistent results
elucidate various aspects of the evolution of film microstructure,
compositional changes and variations in crystallite size distributions with
film growth. Inclusion of a bimodal crystallite size distribution in
microstructural data analysis leads to results that are corroborative with
those obtained from other microstructural tools, and yields a more physically
accurate and coherent description of microcrystalline silicon film
microstructure.
