We study the three-dimensional structure formation when atoms are deposited
onto a substrate with a decagonal quasicrystalline order.
Molecular-dynamicscalculations show that the adsorbate layer consists of
ordered nano-scale domains with orientations determined by the underlying
substrate symmetry. Depending on the relative strength of the interactions of
adsorbate atoms with each other and with the substrate atoms, different
morphologies are observed ranging from layer-by-layer growth to cluster
formation. We also find that the film thickness likewise affects the overall
structure of the growing film: Depending on the relative strength of the
interaction between adsorbate atoms, a structural transition of the
configuration of the adsorbate layers closest to the substrate can occur as the
number of deposited layers increases.
