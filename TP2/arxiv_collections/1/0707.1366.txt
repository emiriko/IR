Inelastic neutron scattering and neutron powder diffraction experiments were
carried out to investigate a localized mode, proposed from various bulk
measurements, in the beta-pyrochlore AOs2O6 (A=K, Rb, Cs). The localized mode
was identified in all the three compounds as well as another beta-pyrochlore
CsW2O6. The anharmonicity of the mode is weak in RbOs2O6 and CsOs2O6 but
substantial in KOs2O6.
