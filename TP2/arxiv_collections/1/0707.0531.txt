We construct equilibrium networks by introducing an energy function depending
on the degree of each node as well as the product of neighboring degrees. With
this topological energy function, networks constitute a canonical ensemble,
which follows the Boltzmann distribution for given temperature. It is observed
that the system undergoes a topological phase transition from a random network
to a star or a fully-connected network as the temperature is lowered. Both
mean-field analysis and numerical simulations reveal strong first-order phase
transitions at temperatures which decrease logarithmically with the system
size. Quantitative discrepancies of the simulation results from the mean-field
prediction are discussed in view of the strong first-order nature.
