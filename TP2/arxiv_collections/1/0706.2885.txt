The first and most compelling evidence of the universe's expansion was, and
continues to be, the observed redshift of spectra from distant objects. This
paper plays "devil's advocate" by providing an alternative explanation with
elementary physics. I assume a steady-state universe that is infinite in both
expanse and age, with the observed redshifts caused by particle interactions
creating an overall index of refraction of the universe. The cumulative effects
of these interactions over long distances cause not only the shifts that we
observe, but also the monotonically increasing redshifts as more distant
objects are observed. This is a novel explanation for the phenomenon known as
"tired light" which has been discussed for decades.
