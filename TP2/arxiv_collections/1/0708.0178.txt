An overview is given on those theoretical gravitational lensing results that
can be formulated in a spacetime setting, without assuming that the
gravitational fields are weak and that the bending angles are small. The first
part is devoted to analytical methods considering spacetimes in which the
equations for light rays (lightlike geodesics) is completely integrable. This
includes spherically symmetric static spacetimes, the Kerr spacetime and plane
gravitational waves. The second part is devoted to qualitative methods which
give some information on lensing properties without actually solving the
equation for lightlike geodesics. This includes Morse theory, methods from
differential topology and bifurcation theory.
