Evidence for strong electron-phonon coupling in high-Tc cuprates is reviewed,
with emphasis on the electron and phonon spectral functions. Effects due to the
interplay between the Coulomb and electron-phonon interactions are studied. For
weakly doped cuprates, the phonon self-energy is strongly reduced due to
correlation effects, while there is no corresponding strong reduction for the
electron self-energy. Polaron formation is studied, focusing on effects of
Coulomb interaction and antiferromagnetic correlations. It is argued that
experimental indications of polaron formation in undoped cuprates are due to a
strong electron-phonon interaction for these systems.
