Gravity gradiometry research and development has intensified in recent years
to the extent that technologies providing a resolution of about 1 Eotvos per 1
sec average shall likely soon be available for multiple critical applications
such as natural resources exploration, oil reservoir monitoring and defence
establishment. Much of the content of this paper was composed a decade ago, and
only minor modifications were required for the conclusions to be just as
applicable today. In this paper we demonstrate how gravity gradient data can be
modeled, and show some examples of how gravity gradient data can be combined in
order to extract valuable information. In particular, this study demonstrates
the importance of two gravity gradient components, Txz and Tyz which, when
processed together, can provide more information on subsurface density
contrasts than that derived solely from the vertical gravity gradient (Tzz).
