A femtosecond frequency comb provides a vast number of equidistantly spaced
narrow band laser modes that can be simultaneously tuned and frequency
calibrated with 15 digits accuracy. Our Vernier spectrometer utilizes all of
theses modes in a massively parallel manner to rapidly record both absorption
and dispersion spectra with a sensitivity that is provided by a high finesse
broad band optical resonator and a resolution that is only limited by the
frequency comb line width while keeping the required setup simple.
