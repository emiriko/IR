We consider the equations, arising as the conformal invariance conditions of
the perturbed curved beta-gamma system. These equations have the physical
meaning of Einstein equations with a B-field and a dilaton on a hermitian
manifold, where the B-field 2-form is imaginary and proportional to the
canonical form associated with hermitian metric. We show that they decompose
into linear and bilinear equations and lead to the vanishing of the first Chern
class of the manifold where the system is defined. We discuss the relation of
these equations to the generalized Maurer-Cartan structures related to BRST
operator. Finally we describe the relations of the generalized Maurer-Cartan
bilinear operation and the Courant/Dorfman brackets.
