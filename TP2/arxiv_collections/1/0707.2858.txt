Radial velocity dispersion in spheroidal and elliptical galaxies, as a
function of radial distance from the center of the galaxy, has been derived
from Cosmological Special Relativity. For velocity dispersions in the outer
regions of spherical galaxies, the dynamical mass calculated for a galaxy using
Carmelian theory may be 10 to 100 times less than that calculated from standard
Newtonian physics. This means there is no need to include halo dark matter. The
velocity dispersion is found to be approximately constant across the galaxy
after falling from an initial high value at the center.
