This paper analyses the parabolic geometries generated by a free
$n$-distribution in the tangent space of a manifold. It shows that certain
holonomy reductions of the associated normal Tractor connections, imply
preferred connections with special properties, along with Riemannian or
sub-Riemannian structures on the manifold. It constructs examples of these
holonomy reductions in the simplest cases. The main results, however, lie in
the free 3-distributions. In these cases, there are normal Fefferman
constructions over CR and Lagrangian contact structures corresponding to
holonomy reductions to SO(4,2) and SO(3,3), respectively. There is also a
fascinating construction of a `dual' distribution when the holonomy reduces to
$G_2'$.
