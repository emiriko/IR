We consider some classical fibre bundles furnished with almost complex
structures of twistor type, deduce their integrability in some cases and study
\textit{self-holomorphic} sections of a \textit{symplectic} twistor space. With
these we define a moduli space of $\omega$-compatible complex structures. We
recall the theory of flag manifolds in order to study the Siegel domain and
other domains alike, which is the fibre of the referred twistor space. Finally
the structure equations for the twistor of a Riemann surface with the canonical
symplectic-metric connection are deduced, based on a given conformal coordinate
on the surface. We then relate with the moduli space defined previously.
