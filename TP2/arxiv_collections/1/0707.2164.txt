In a well-dispersed nanofluid with strong cluster-fluid attraction, thermal
conduction paths can arise through percolating amorphous-like interfacial
structures. This results in a thermal conductivity enhancement beyond the
Maxwell limit of 3*phi, with phi being the nanoparticle volume fraction. Our
findings from non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations, which are
amenable to experimental verification, can provide a theoretical basis for the
development of future nanofluids.
