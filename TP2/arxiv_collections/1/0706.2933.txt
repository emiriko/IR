By using the sixth order WKB approximation we calculate for an
electromagnetic field propagating in D-dimensional Schwarzschild and
Schwarzschild de Sitter black holes its quasinormal frequencies for the
fundamental mode and first overtones. We study the dependence of these QN
frequencies on the value of the cosmological constant and the spacetime
dimension. We also compare with the known results for the gravitational
perturbations propagating in the same background. Moreover we exactly compute
the QN frequencies of the electromagnetic field propagating in D-dimensional
massless topological black hole and for charged D-dimensional Nariai spacetime
we exactly calculate the QN frequencies of the coupled electromagnetic and
gravitational perturbations.
