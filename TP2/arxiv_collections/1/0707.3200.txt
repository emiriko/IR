We report an optical technique that yields an enhancement of single-molecule
photostability, by greatly suppressing photobleaching pathways which involve
photoexcitation from the triplet state. This is accomplished by dynamically
switching off the excitation laser when a quantum-jump of the molecule to the
triplet state is optically detected. This procedure leads to a lengthened
single-molecule observation time and an increased total number of detected
photons. The resulting improvement in photostability unambiguously confirms the
importance of photoexcitation from the triplet state in photobleaching
dynamics, and may allow the investigation of new phenomena at the
single-molecule level.
