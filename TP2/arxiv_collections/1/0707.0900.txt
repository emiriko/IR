Wormholes have been always an interesting object in gravity theories. In this
paper we make a little review of the principal properties of these objects and
the exotic matter they need to exist. Then, we obtain two specific solutions in
the formalism of (2+1)-dimensional gravity with negative cosmological constant.
The obtained geometries correspond to traversable wormholes with an exterior
geometry correspondient to the well known BTZ black hole solution. We also
discuss the distribution of exotic matter that these wormholes need.
