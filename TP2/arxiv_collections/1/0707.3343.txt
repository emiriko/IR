We report a theoretical study of the $pp\to p K^+\Lambda(1405)$ reaction,
which was recently investigated at COSY-J\"{u}lich by using a 3.65 GeV/c
circulating proton beam incident on an internal hydrogen target. The reaction
is driven by single kaon exchange, single pion exchange, and single rho
exchange terms which have very different shapes due to the two pole structure
of the $\Lambda(1405)$ and the presence of background terms. The shape for the
sum of the three contributions, as well as the total cross section, are
consistent with present data within experimental and theoretical uncertainties,
using reasonable form factors for the meson-baryon vertices.
