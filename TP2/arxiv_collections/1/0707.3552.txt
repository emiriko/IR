A family of 3R orthogonal manipulators without offset on the third body can
be divided into exactly nine workspace topologies. The workspace is
characterized in a half-cross section by the singular curves. The workspace
topology is defined by the number of cusps and nodes that appear on these
singular curves. Based on this classification, we evaluate theses manipulators
by the condition number related to the joint space and the proportion of the
region with four inverse kinematic solutions compared to a sphere containing
all the workspace. This second performance number is in relation with the
workspace. We determine finally le topology of workspace to which belong
manipulators having the best performance number values.
