We use optical-pump terahertz-probe spectroscopy to investigate the
near-threshold behavior of the photoinduced insulator-to-metal (IM) transition
in vanadium dioxide thin films. Upon approaching Tc a reduction in the fluence
required to drive the IM transition is observed, consistent with a softening of
the insulating state due to an increasing metallic volume fraction (below the
percolation limit). This phase coexistence facilitates the growth of a
homogeneous metallic conducting phase following superheating via
photoexcitation. A simple dynamic model using Bruggeman effective medium theory
describes the observed initial condition sensitivity.
