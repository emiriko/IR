We present an accurate numerical algorithm, called quantum belief propagation
(QBP), for simulation of one-dimensional quantum systems at non-zero
temperature. The algorithm exploits the fact that quantum effects are
short-range in these systems at non-zero temperature, decaying on a length
scale inversely proportional to the temperature. We compare to exact results on
a spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain. Even a very modest calculation, requiring
diagonalizing only 10-by-10 matrices, reproduces the peak susceptibility with a
relative error of less than $10^{-5}$, while more elaborate calculations
further reduce the error.
