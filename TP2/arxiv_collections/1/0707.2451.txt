We investigate unparticle physics with supersymmetry (SUSY). The SUSY
breaking effects due to the gravity mediation induce soft masses for the SUSY
unparticles and hence break the conformal invariance. The unparticle physics
observable in near future experiments is only consistent if the SUSY breaking
effects from the hidden sector to the standard model sector are dominated by
the gauge mediation, or if the SUSY breaking effects to the unparticle sector
is sufficiently sequestered. We argue that the natural realization of the
latter possibility is the conformal sequestering scenario.
