The Schmidt decomposition is an important tool in the study of quantum
systems especially for the quantification of the entanglement of pure states.
However, the Schmidt decomposition is only unique for bipartite pure states,
and some multipartite pure states. Here a generalized Schmidt decomposition is
given for states which are equivalent to depolarized pure states. Experimental
methods for the identification of this class of mixed states are provided and
some examples are discussed which show the utility of this description. A
particularly interesting example provides, for the first time, an
interpretation of the number of negative eigenvalues of the density matrix.
