The general form of the electrostatic potential around an arbitrarily charged
colloid at an interface between a dielectric and a screening phase (such as air
and water, respectively) is analyzed in terms of a multipole expansion. The
leading term is isotropic in the interfacial plane and varies with $d^{-3}$
where $d$ is the in--plane distance from the colloid. The electrostatic
interaction potential between two arbitrarily charged colloids is likewise
isotropic and $\propto d^{-3}$, corresponding to the dipole--dipole interaction
first found for point charges at water interfaces. Anisotropic interaction
terms arise only for higher powers $d^{-n}$ with $n \ge 4$.
