We study the effect of antiferromagnetic interactions on the single spin-flip
Glauber dynamics of two different one-dimensional (1D) Ising models with spin
$\pm 1$. The first model is an Ising chain with antiferromagnetic exchange
interaction limited to nearest neighbors and subject to an oscillating magnetic
field. The system of master equations describing the time evolution of
sublattice magnetizations can easily be solved within a linear field
approximation and a long time limit. Resonant behavior of the magnetization as
a function of temperature (stochastic resonance) is found, at low frequency,
only when spins on opposite sublattices are uncompensated owing to different
gyromagnetic factors (i.e., in the presence of a ferrimagnetic short range
order). The second model is the axial next-nearest neighbor Ising (ANNNI)
chain, where an antiferromagnetic exchange between next-nearest neighbors (nnn)
is assumed to compete with a nearest-neighbor (nn) exchange interaction of
either sign. The long time response of the model to a weak, oscillating
magnetic field is investigated in the framework of a decoupling approximation
for three-spin correlation functions, which is required to close the system of
master equations. The calculation, within such an approximate theoretical
scheme, of the dynamic critical exponent z, defined as ${1/\tau} \approx ({1/
{\xi}})^z$ (where \tau is the longest relaxation time and \xi is the
correlation length of the chain), suggests that the T=0 single spin-flip
Glauber dynamics of the ANNNI chain is in a different universality class than
that of the unfrustrated Ising chain.
