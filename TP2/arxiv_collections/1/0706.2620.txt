In the previous report, we have demonstrated cascade branching channels of
the multipolar E3 transition of rhodium Mossbauer gamma via the time- and
energy-resolved spectroscopy. Moreover, superradiance in the Borrmann channel
from inverted nuclei gives gamma entanglement. In this letter, we report
further four observations of superradiance and its associated gamma
entanglement at the liquid-nitrogen temperature, i.e. (i) speed-up decay, (ii)
immediate recovery of the speed-up decay after quenching, (iii) simultaneous
suppression of gamma and K lines, and (iv) enhanced multiple ionizations.
Anisotropic superradiant channels open by quenching and recover back
immediately after quenching. Enhanced K satellites and K hypersatellites
induced by cooling are attributed to the inelastic scattering of more than
three entangled gammas.
