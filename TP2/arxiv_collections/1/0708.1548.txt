Recently J.N. Munday and F. Capasso [Phys. Rev. A {\bf 75}, 060102(R) (2007);
arXiv:0705.3793] claimed that they have performed a precision measurement of
the Casimir force between a sphere and a plate coated with Au, both immersed in
ethanol. The measurement results were claimed to be consistent with the
Lifshitz theory. We demonstrate that the calculation of the Casimir force
between the smooth bodies following the authors prescription has a discrepancy
up to 25% with respect to authors result. We show also that the attractive
electrostatic force only due to the surface potential differences was
underestimated by a factor of 590 and the charge double layer interaction was
not taken into account. All this leads to the conclusion that the results of
this experiment are in fact uncertain.
