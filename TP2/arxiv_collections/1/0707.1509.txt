Results on Bs properties obtained by the CDF and D0 collaborations using the
data samples collected at the Tevatron Collider in the period 2002-2006 were
presented at the Hadron Collider Physics Symposium 2006 (Duke University,
Durham). The measurements of Bs mass and width differences are discussed in
details.
  Prospects on measurements of CP violation in Bs system are given.
