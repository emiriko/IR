We survey our research on modeling the mechanisms of control of uniformity in
growth of nanosize and colloid particles. The former are produced as
nanocrystals, by burst-nucleation from solution. The latter, colloid-size
particles, are formed by self-assembly (aggregation) of the nanocrystals. In
the colloid particle synthesis, the two dynamical processes are coupled, and
both are governed by diffusional transport of the respective building blocks
(monomers). The interrelation of the two processes allows for synthesis of
narrow size distribution colloid dispersions which are of importance in many
applications.
  We first review a mathematical model of diffusive cluster growth by capture
of monomer "singlets." Burst nucleation of nanoparticles in solution is then
analyzed. Finally, we couple it to the secondary process of aggregation of
nanoparticles to form colloids, and we discuss various aspects of the modeling
of particle size distribution, as well as other features of the processes
considered.
