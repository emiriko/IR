The paper discusses the kinematics of manipulators builts of planar closed
kinematic chains. A special kinematic scheme is extracted from the array of
these mechanisms that looks the most promising for the creation of different
types of robotic manipulators. The structural features of this manipulator
determine a number of its original properties that essentially simplify its
control. These features allow the main control problems to be effectively
overcome by application of the simple kinematic problems. The workspace and
singular configurations of a basic planar manipulator are studied. By using a
graphic simulation method, motions of the designed mechanism are examined. A
prototype of this mechanism was implemented to verify the proposed approach.
