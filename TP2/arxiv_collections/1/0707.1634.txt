We study the optimal generation of entanglement between two qubits subject to
local unitary control. With the only assumptions of linear control and unitary
dynamics, by means of a numerical protocol based on the variational approach
(Pontryagin's Minimum Principle), we evaluate the optimal control strategy
leading to the maximal achievable entanglement in an arbitrary interaction
time, taking into account the energy cost associated to the controls. In our
model we can arbitrarily choose the relative weight between a large
entanglement and a small energy cost.
