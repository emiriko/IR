Differential cross sections for transitions of known weak strength were
measured with the (3He,t) reaction at 420 MeV on targets of 12C, 13C, 18O,
26Mg, 58Ni, 60Ni, 90Zr, 118Sn, 120Sn and 208Pb. Using this data, it is shown
the proportionalities between strengths and cross sections for this probe
follow simple trends as a function of mass number. These trends can be used to
confidently determine Gamow-Teller strength distributions in nuclei for which
the proportionality cannot be calibrated via beta-decay strengths. Although
theoretical calculations in distorted-wave Born approximation overestimate the
data, they allow one to understand the main experimental features and to
predict deviations from the simple trends observed in some of the transitions.
