Bounds on cross section measurements of chargino pair production at LEP yield
a bound on the chargino mass. If the GUT relation is assumed, the lightest
neutralino must be heavier than $\approx 45 -50\GeV$. If no GUT relation is
assumed, no lower bound on the neutralino mass exists. I derive mass bounds on
the lightest neutralino from relic density measurements for relativistic and
non-relativistic neutralinos and I derive bounds on the selectron mass from the
observed limits on the cross section of the neutralino pair production process
$e^+e^-\to \x{1}\x{2}$ at LEP, if the lightest neutralino is massless. I
further discuss radiative neutralino production and its background at the
future ILC. Finally, I present a method to determine the neutralino couplings
to right and left handed selectrons and Z bosons from cross section
measurements of radiative neutralino production and neutralino pair production
at the ILC.
