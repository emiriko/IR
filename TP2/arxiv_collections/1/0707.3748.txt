The article consist of two main parts: an analog of the Leray Theory for
Singular Varieties and its application to the Theory of Parshin's Residues. The
first part is independent from the second. It uses the theory of Whitney
stratifications. The second part is an application of the first. In particular,
a geometric and very transparent proof of the Parshin's Reciprocity Law for
residues is given.
