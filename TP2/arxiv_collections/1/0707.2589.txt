Using recent CLEO III results for the cross section for $e^+e^- \to {\rm
hadrons}$ at seven centre-of-mass energies between 6.964 and 10.538 GeV, we
derive a value for the strong coupling constant
$\alpha_s(M_Z^2)=0.110_{-0.012}^{-0.010}{}_{-0.011}^{+0.010}$ where the
uncertainties are uncorrelated and correlated, respectively. Our result differs
significantly from the one derived by CLEO III, as a consequence of inclusion
of quark mass effects and the proper matching between the effective theories
with four and five flavours. Combining this new result with an analysis based
on earlier cross section measurements in the energy region between 2 and 10.6
GeV, we obtain $\alpha_s(M_Z^2)=0.119^{+0.009}_{-0.011}$, well consistent with
the current world average.
