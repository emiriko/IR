We give a simple derivation of all $n$-point densities for the eigenvalues of
the real Ginibre ensemble with even dimension $N$ as quaternion determinants. A
very simple symplectic kernel governs both, the real and complex correlations.
1-and-2-point correlations are discussed in more detail. Scaling forms for
large dimension $N$ are derived.
