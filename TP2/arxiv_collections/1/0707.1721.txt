We find that a liquid jet can bounce off a bath of the same liquid if the
bath is moving horizontally with respect to the jet. Previous observations of
jets rebounding off a bath (e.g. Kaye effect) have been reported only for
non-Newtonian fluids, while we observe bouncing jets in a variety of Newtonian
fluids, including mineral oil poured by hand. A thin layer of air separates the
bouncing jet from the bath, and the relative motion replenishes the film of
air. Jets with one or two bounces are stable for a range of viscosity, jet flow
rate and velocity, and bath velocity. The bouncing phenomenon exhibits
hysteresis and multiple steady states.
