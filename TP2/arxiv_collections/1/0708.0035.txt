We discuss the information that can be deduced from a measurement of particle
(hyperon or vector meson) polarization in ultrarelativistic nuclear collisions.
We describe the sensitivity of polarization to initial conditions, hydrodynamic
evolution and mean free path, and find that the polarization observable is
sensitive to all details and stages of the system's evolution. We suggest that
an experimental investigation covering production plane and reaction plane
polarizations, as well as the polarization of jet-associated particles in the
plane defined by the jet and particle direction, can help in disentangling the
factors contributing to this observable. Scans of polarization in energy and
rapidity might also point to a change in the system's properties.
