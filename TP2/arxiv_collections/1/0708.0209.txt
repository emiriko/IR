We consider models of financial markets in which all parties involved find
incentives to participate. Strategies are evaluated directly by their virtual
wealths. By tuning the price sensitivity and market impact, a phase diagram
with several attractor behaviors resembling those of real markets emerge,
reflecting the roles played by the arbitrageurs and trendsetters, and including
a phase with irregular price trends and positive sums. The positive-sumness of
the players' wealths provides participation incentives for them. Evolution and
the bid-ask spread provide mechanisms for the gain in wealth of both the
players and market-makers. New players survive in the market if the
evolutionary rate is sufficiently slow. We test the applicability of the model
on real Hang Seng Index data over 20 years. Comparisons with other models show
that our model has a superior average performance when applied to real
financial data.
