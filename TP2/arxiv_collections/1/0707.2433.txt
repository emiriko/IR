A new setup for doping helium nanodroplets by means of laser ablation at
kilohertz repetition rate is presented. The doping process is characterized and
two distinct regimes of laser ablation are identified. The setup is shown to be
efficient and stable enough to be used for spectroscopy, as demonstrated on
beam-depletion spectra of lithium atoms attached to helium nanodroplets. For
the first time, helium droplets are doped with high temperature refractory
materials such as titanium and tantalum. Doping with the non-volatile DNA basis
Guanine is found to be efficient and a number of oligomers are detected.
