Azimuthal single-spin asymmetries (SSA) in semi-inclusive electroproduction
of pi-mesons and charged K-mesons in deep-inelastic scattering of positrons and
electrons on a transversely polarised hydrogen target were observed.
Significant SSA amplitudes for both the Collins and the Sivers mechanism are
presented for the full data set recorded with transverse target polarisation at
the HERMES experiment.
