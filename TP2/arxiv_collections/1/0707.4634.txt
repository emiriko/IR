We present the measurement of the ratio R =
\frac{\Gamma(\keg;\Estar>30\mev,\qstar>20^\circ)}{\Gamma(\kegf)} and a first
measurement of the direct emission contribution for the same process. We use
328 pb^{-1} of data collected at \kloe in 2001 and 2002, corresponding to about
3 million of \kegf events and about 9 thousand \keg radiative events. Our
result is R= (924 \pm 23_{stat} \pm 16_{syst})10^{-5} for the branching ratio
and X =-2.3\pm 1.3_{stat}\pm 1.4_{syst} for the parameter describing direct
emission.
