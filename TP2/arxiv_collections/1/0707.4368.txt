We present a detailed study of the spectral properties of a locally
correlated site embedded in a BCS superconducting medium. To this end the
Anderson impurity model with superconducting bath is analysed by numerical
renormalisation group (NRG) calculations. We calculate one and two-particle
dynamic response function to elucidate the spectral excitation and the nature
of the ground state for different parameter regimes with and without
particle-hole symmetry. The position and weight of the Andreev bound states is
given for all relevant parameters. We also present phase diagrams for the
different ground state parameter regimes. This work is also relevant for
dynamical mean field theory extensions with superconducting symmetry breaking.
