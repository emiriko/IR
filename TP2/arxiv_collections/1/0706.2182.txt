There are two main methods of nulcear fusion: inertial confinement fusion
(ICF) and magnetic confinement fusion (MCF). Existing thermonuclear reactors
are very complex, expensive, large, and heavy. They cannot achieve the Lawson
creterion.
  The author offers an innovation. ICF has on the inside surface of the
shell-shaped combustion chamber a covering of small Prism Reflectors (PR) and
plasma reflector. These prism reflectors have a noteworthy advantage, in
comparison with conventional mirror and especially with conventional shell:
they multi-reflect the heat and laser radiation exactly back into collision
with the fuel target capsule (pellet). The plasma reflector reflects the
Bremsstrahlung radiation.
  The offered innovation decreases radiation losses, creates significant
radiation pressure and increases the reaction time. The Lawson criterion
increases by hundreds of times. The size, cost, and weight of a typical
installation will decrease by tens of times.
  The author is researching the efficiency of these innovations. Keywords:
Thermonuclear reactor, Multi-reflex AB-thermonuclear reactor, aerospace
thermonuclear engine.
