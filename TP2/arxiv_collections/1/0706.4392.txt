The amplitude for the forward electroproduction of two light vector mesons
can be written completely within perturbative QCD in the Regge limit with
next-to-leading accuracy, thus providing the first example of a physical
application of the BFKL approach at the next-to-leading order. We study in the
case of equal photon virtualities the main systematic effects, by considering a
different representation of the amplitude and different optimization methods of
the perturbative series.
