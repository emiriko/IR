It is shown that the charged particles are refracted and reflected on the
boundary of field free and laser field regions in vacuum. Simple and
transparent estimates are given which show the possibility of channeling of
charged and neutral particles having polarizability by strong electromagnetic
field of certain laser bunches just as by the field of orientated crystalline
planes and axes. These processes can be applied for production of femtosecond
sliced electron bunches, for measurement their length and particle distribution
as well as for production of femtosecond X-ray and terahertz pulses using
transition, channeling and other types of radiation.
