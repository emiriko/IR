We report a search for the charmless vector-vector decay B0->omega K*0 with
520x10^6 BBbar pairs collected with the Belle detector at the KEKB e+e-
collider. We measure the branching fraction in units of 10^-6: Br = 1.2
+0.9-0.8 +-0.2 (<2.7), where the first error is statistical, the second
systematic, and the upper limit is at the 90% confidence level.
