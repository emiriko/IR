We propose how to generate genuine multipartite entanglement of electron spin
qubits in a chain of quantum dots using the naturally available single-qubit
rotations and two-qubit Heisenberg exchange interaction in the system. We show
that the minimum number of required operations to generate entangled states of
the GHZ-, cluster and W-type scales linearly with the number of qubits and
estimate the fidelities of the generated entangled cluster states. As the
required single and two-qubit operations have recently been realized, our
proposed scheme opens the way for experimental investigation of multipartite
entanglement with electron spin qubits.
