The balances of particles and charges in the volume of parallel-plane
ionization chamber are considered. Differential equations describing the
distribution of current densities in the chamber volume are obtained. As a
result of the differential equations solution an analytical form of the
current-voltage characteristic of parallel-plane ionization chamber with
inhomogeneous ionization in the volume is got.
