Based on criteria of mathematical simplicity and consistency with empirical
market data, a model with volatility driven by fractional noise has been
constructed which provides a fairly accurate mathematical parametrization of
the data. Here, some features of the model are discussed and, using agent-based
models, one tries to find which agent strategies and (or) properties of the
financial institutions might be responsible for the features of the fractional
volatility model.
