By means of a technique, which does not employ partial wave (PW)
decompositions, the nucleon-deuteron break-up process is evaluated in the
Faddeev scheme, where only the leading order term of the amplitude is
considered. This technique is then applied to calculate the semi-exclusive
proton-deuteron break-up reaction d(p,n)pp for proton laboratory energies Elab
of a few hundred MeV. A comparison with PW calculations is performed at 197 MeV
projectile energy. At the same energy rescattering processes, which are not
included in the 3D calculations yet, are shown to be still important in the
full Faddeev PW calculations, especially for the cross section and the
analyzing power Ay. Next, kinematical relativistic effects are investigated for
projectile energies up to about 500 MeV. At the higher energies, those
relativistic effects start not to be negligible, especially in the peak of the
cross section.
