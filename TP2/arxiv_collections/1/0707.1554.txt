We expand on our earlier work (cond-mat/0612130, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 99},
46404 (2007)) in which we constructed the exact low-energy theory of a doped
Mott insulator by explicitly integrating (rather than projecting) out the
degrees of freedom far away from the chemical potential. The exact low-energy
theory contains degrees of freedom that cannot be obtained from projective
schemes. In particular a new charge $\pm 2e$ bosonic field emerges at low
energies that is not made out of elemental excitations. Such a field accounts
for dynamical spectral weight transfer across the Mott gap. At half-filling, we
show that two such excitations emerge which play a crucial role in preserving
the Luttinger surface along which the single-particle Green function vanishes.
In addition, the interactions with the bosonic fields defeat the artificial
local SU(2) symmetry that is present in the Heisenberg model. We also apply
this method to the Anderson-U impurity and show that in addition to the Kondo
interaction, bosonic degrees of freedom appear as well. Finally, we show that
as a result of the bosonic degree of freedom, the electron at low energies is
in a linear superposition of two excitations--one arising from the standard
projection into the low-energy sector and the other from the binding of a hole
and the boson.
