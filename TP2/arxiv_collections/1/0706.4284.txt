Total precession (geodetic precession and frame dragging) depends on the
velocity of each source of gravitation, which means that it depends on the
choice of the coordinate system. We consider the latter as an anomaly
specifically in the Gravity Probe B experiment, we investigated it and solved
this anomaly. Thus, we proved that if our present expression for the geodetic
precession is correct, then the frame dragging should be 25% less than its
predicted value.
