This paper describes how automatically generated detailed kinetic mechanisms
are obtained for the oxidation of alkanes and how these models could lead to a
better understanding of autoignition and cool flame risks at elevated
conditions. Examples of prediction of the occurrence of different autoignition
phenomena, such as cool flames or two-stage ignitions are presented depending
on the condition of pressure, temperature and mixture composition. Three
compounds are treated, a light alkane, propane, and two heavier ones, n-heptane
and n-decane.
