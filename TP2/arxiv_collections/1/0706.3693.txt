A distinguishing feature of a multicellular living system is that it operates
at various scales, from the intracellular to organismal. Very little is known
at present on how tissue level properties are related to cell and subcellular
properties. Modern measurement techniques provide quantitative results at both
the intracellular and tissue level, but not on the connection between these. In
the present work we outline a framework to address this connection. We
specifically concentrate on the morphogenetic process of tissue fusion, by
following the coalescence of two contiguous multicellular aggregates. The time
evolution of this process can accurately be described by the theory of viscous
liquids. We also study fusion by Monte Carlo simulations and a novel Cellular
Particle Dynamics (CPD) model, which is similar to the earlier introduced
Subcellular Element Model (Newman, 2005). Using the combination of experiments,
theory and modeling we are able to relate the measured tissue level biophysical
quantities to subcellular parameters. Our approach has validity beyond the
particular morphogenetic process considered here and provides a general way to
relate biophysical properties across scales.
