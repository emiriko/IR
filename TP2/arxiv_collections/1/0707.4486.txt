The double zeta function is a function of two arguments defined by a double
Dirichlet series, and was first studied by Euler in response to a letter from
Goldbach in 1742. By calculating many examples, Euler inferred a closed form
evaluation of the double zeta function in terms of values of the Riemann zeta
function, in the case when the two arguments are positive integers with
opposite parity. Here, we consider a signed analog of Euler's evaluation:
namely a reduction formula for the signed double zeta function that reduces to
Euler's evaluation when the signs are specialized to 1. This formula was first
stated in a 1997 paper by Borwein, Bradley and Broadhurst and was subsequently
proved by Flajolet and Salvy using contour integration. The purpose here is to
give an elementary proof based on a partial fraction identity.
