In this paper, we develop a method based on the analysis of the Kovalewski
exponents to study the integrability of anisotropic and homogeneous Universes.
The formalism is developed in scalar-tensor gravity, the general relativistic
case appearing as a special case of this larger framework. Then, depending on
the rationality of the Kovalewski exponents, the different models, both in the
vacuum and in presence of a barotropic matter fluid, are classified, and their
integrability is discussed.
