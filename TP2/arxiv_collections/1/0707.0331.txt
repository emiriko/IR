The Nachtmann moment is employed to study the contribution of twist-3
operator to the nucleon spin structure functions. Target mass corrections to
the Cornwall-Norton moments of the spin structure functions $g_{1,2}$ are
discussed. It is found that the corrections play a sizeable role to the
contribution of the twist-3 $\tilde d_2$ extracted from the Cornwall-Norton
moments.
