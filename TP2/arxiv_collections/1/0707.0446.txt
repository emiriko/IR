Flavour Changing Neutral Current decays of the $B$-meson are a very useful
tool for studying possible physics scenarios beyond the Standard Model (SM),
where of the many FCNC modes radiative, purely leptonic and semi-leptonic
decays of the $B$-meson are relatively clean tests. Within this context the
BELLE collaboration has searched for the $B \to K_1(1270) \gamma$ process and
provided an upper bound on this decay. In this work we have used this upper
bound in studying the angular coorelations for the related semi-leptonic decay
mode $B \to K_1(1270) (\to \rho K) \ell^+ \ell^-$, where we have used the form
factors that have already been estimated for the $B \to K_1(1270) \gamma$ mode.
Note that the additional form factors that are required were calculated using
the Large Energy Effective Theory (LEET).
