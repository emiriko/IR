We present full generalisations of entropic security and entropic
indistinguishability to the quantum world where no assumption but a limit on
the knowledge of the adversary is made. This limit is quantified using the
quantum conditional min-entropy as introduced by Renato Renner. A proof of the
equivalence between the two security definitions is presented. We also provide
proofs of security for two different cyphers in this model and a proof for a
lower bound on the key length required by any such cypher. These cyphers
generalise existing schemes for approximate quantum encryption to the entropic
security model.
