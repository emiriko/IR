We adopt the vector-meson-dominance approach to investigate Q^2-evolution of
N-R transition form factors (N denotes nucleon and R an excited resonance) in
the first and second resonance regions. The developed model is based upon
conventional NR\gamma-interaction Lagrangians, introducing three form factors
for spin-3/2 resonances and two form factors for spin-1/2 nucleon excitations.
Lagrangian form factors are expressed as dispersionlike expansions with four or
five poles corresponding to the lowest excitations of the mesons \rho(770) and
\omega(782). Correct high-Q^2 form factor behavior predicted by perturbative
QCD is due to phenomenological logarithmic renormalization of electromagnetic
coupling constants and linear superconvergence relations between the parameters
of the meson spectrum. The model is found to be in good agreement with all the
experimental data on Q^2-dependence of the transitions N-\Delta(1232),
N-N(1440), N-N(1520), N-N(1535). We present fit results and model predictions
for high-energy experiments proposed by JLab. Besides, we make special emphasis
on the transition to perturbative domain of N-\Delta(1232) form factors.
