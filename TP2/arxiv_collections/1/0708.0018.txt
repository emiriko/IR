Our paper originated from a generalization of the Volume Conjecture to
multisums of $q$-hypergeometric terms. This generalization was sketched by
Kontsevich in a problem list in Aarhus University in 2006; \cite{Ko}. We
introduce the notion of a $q$-hypergeometric term (in short, $q$-term). The
latter is a product of ratios of $q$-factorials in linear forms in several
variables. In the first part of the paper, we show how to construct elements of
the Bloch group (and its extended version) given a \qterm. Their image under
the Bloch-Wigner map or the Rogers dilogarithm is a finite set of periods of
weight 2, in the sense of Kontsevich-Zagier. In the second part of the paper we
introduce the notion of a special $q$-term, its corresponding sequence of
polynomials, and its generating series. Examples of special $q$-terms come
naturally from Quantum Topology, and in particular from planar projections of
knots. The two parts are tied together by a conjecture that relates the
singularities of the generating series of a special $q$-term with the periods
of the corresponding elements of the extended Bloch group. In some cases (such
as the $4_1$ knot), the conjecture is known.
