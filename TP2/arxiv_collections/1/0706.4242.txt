The properties and behaviour of the solutions of the recently obtained
$k_t$-dependent evolution equations are investigated. When used to reproduce
transverse momentum spectra of hadrons in Semi-Inclusive DIS, an encouraging
agreement with data is found. The present analysis also supports at the
phenomenological level the factorization properties of the Semi-Inclusive DIS
cross-sections in terms of $k_t$-dependent distributions. Further improvements
and possible developments of the proposed evolution equations are envisaged.
