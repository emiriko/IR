In non-supersymmetric grand unified models a ``radiative fermion mass
hierarchy" can be achieved in which the spectrum of quark and lepton masses is
determined entirely by physics at the unification scale, with many relations
following from the unified gauge symmetry, and with the masses of the lightest
family arising from loops. A simple, realistic, and predictive model of this
kind is presented. A "doubly lopsided" structure, known to lead to bilarge
neutrino mixing, plays a crucial role in the radiative hierarchy.
