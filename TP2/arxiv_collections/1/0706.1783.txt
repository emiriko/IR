We consider the finite temperature scaling properties of a Kondo-destroying
quantum critical point in the Ising-anisotropic Bose-Fermi Kondo model (BFKM).
A cluster-updating Monte Carlo approach is used, in order to reliably access a
wide temperature range. The scaling function for the two-point spin correlator
is found to have the form dictated by a boundary conformal field theory, even
though the underlying Hamiltonian lacks conformal invariance. Similar
conclusions are reached for all multi-point correlators of the spin-isotropic
BFKM in a dynamical large-N limit. Our results suggest that the quantum
critical local properties of the sub-ohmic BFKM are those of an underlying
boundary conformal field theory.
