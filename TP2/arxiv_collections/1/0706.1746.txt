We study AC Josephson effect in a superconductor-ferromagnet heterostructure
with a variable magnetic configuration. The system supports triplet proximity
correlations whose dynamics is coupled to the magnetic dynamics. This feedback
dramatically modifies the behavior of the junction. The current-phase relation
becomes double-periodic at both very low and high Josephson frequencies
$\omega_J$. At intermediate frequencies, the periodicity in $\omega_J t$ may be
lost.
