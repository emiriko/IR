We give a stratification of the GIT quotient of the Grassmannian $G_{2,n}$
modulo the normaliser of a maximal torus of $SL_{n}(k)$ with respect to the
ample generator of the Picard group of $G_{2,n}$. We also prove that the flag
variety $GL_{n}(k)/B_{n}$ can be obtained as a GIT quotient of
$GL_{n+1}(k)/B_{n+1}$ modulo a maximal torus of $SL_{n+1}(k)$ for a suitable
choice of an ample line bundle on $GL_{n+1}(k)/B_{n+1}$.
