Recent results by BELLE and BaBar point to the existence of a second X
particle decaying in D^0 D^0bar pi^0, a few MeV above the X(3872). We identify
the two X states with the neutral particles predicted by the 4-quark model and
show that production and decays are consistent with this assignement. We
consider the yet-to-be-observed charged partners and give new hints on how to
look for them.
