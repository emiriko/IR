We consider the problem of constructing Lyapunov functions for linear
differential equations with delays. For such systems it is known that
exponential stability implies the existence of a positive Lyapunov function
which is quadratic on the space of continuous functions. We give an explicit
parametrization of a sequence of finite-dimensional subsets of the cone of
positive Lyapunov functions using positive semidefinite matrices. This allows
stability analysis of linear time-delay systems to be formulated as a
semidefinite program.
