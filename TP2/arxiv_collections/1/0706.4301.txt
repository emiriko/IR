We present recent results from searches by the LIGO Science Collaboration for
bursts of gravitational-wave radiation, as well as the status of other ongoing
searches. These include directed searches for bursts associated with observed
sources (gamma-ray bursts, soft gamma repeaters) and untriggered searches for
bursts from unknown sources. We also present the status of some newer
investigations, such as coherent network methods. We show methods for
interpreting our search results in terms of astrophysical source distributions
that improve their accessibility to the wider community.
