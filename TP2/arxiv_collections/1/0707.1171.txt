We investigate various aspects of the Kondo singlet in a quantum dot (QD)
electrostatically coupled to a mesoscopic detector. The two subsystems are
represented by an entangled state between the Kondo singlet and the
charge-dependent detector state. We show that the phase-coherence of the Kondo
singlet is destroyed in a way that is sensitive to the charge-state information
restored both in the magnitude and in the phase of the scattering coefficients
of the detector. We also introduce the notion of the `conditional evolution' of
the Kondo singlet under projective measurement on the detector. Our study
reveals that the state of the composite system is disentangled upon this
measurement. The Kondo singlet evolves into a particular state with a fixed
number of electrons in the quantum dot. Its relaxation time is shown to be
sensitive only to the QD-charge dependence of the transmission probability in
the detector, which implies that the phase information is erased in this
conditional evolution process. We discuss implications of our observations in
view of the possible experimental realization.
