Several models of a strongly interacting Bose gas in an optical lattice are
studied within the functional-integral approach. The one-dimensional Bose gas
is briefly discussed. Then the Bose-Einstein condensate and the Mott insulator
of a three-dimensional Bose gas are described in mean-field approximation, and
the corresponding phase diagrams are evaluated. Other characteristic
quantities, like the spectrum of quasiparticle excitations and the static
structure factor, are obtained from Gaussian fluctuations around the mean-field
solutions. We discuss the role of quantum and thermal fluctuations, and
determine the behavior of physical quantities in terms of density and
temperature of the Bose gas. In particular, we study the dilute limit, where
the mean-field equation becomes the Gross-Pitaevskii equation. This allows us
to extend the Gross-Pitaevskii equation to the dense regime by introducing
renormalized parameters in the latter.
