The variational cluster approximation is applied to the calculation of the
single particle spectral function of NiO. Trial self energies and the numerical
value of the Luttinger-Ward functional are obtained by exact diagonalization of
NiO6-clusters and the single particle parameters of the clusters serve as
variational parameters to obtain a stationary point of the grand potential of
the lattice system. Good agreement with experiment is obtained.
