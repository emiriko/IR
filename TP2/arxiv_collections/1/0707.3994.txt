A general quantitative measure of the tendency towards phase separation is
introduced for systems exhibiting phase transitions or crossovers controlled by
charge carrier concentration. This measure is devised for the situations when
the quantitative knowledge of various contributions to free energy is
incomplete, and is applied to evaluate the chances of electronic phase
separation associated with the onset of antiferromagnetic correlations in
high-temperature cuprate superconductors. The experimental phenomenology of
lanthanum- and yittrium-based cuprates was used as input to this analysis. It
is also pointed out that Coulomb repulsion between charge carriers separated by
the distances of 1-3 lattice periods strengthens the tendency towards phase
separation by accelerating the decay of antiferromagnetic correlations with
doping. Overall, the present analysis indicates that cuprates are realistically
close to the threshold of phase separation -- nanoscale limited or even
macroscopic with charge density varying between adjacent crystal planes.
