This note discusses the problem of the effective termination of Kohn's
algorithm for subelliptic multipliers for bounded smooth weakly pseudoconvex
domains of finite type. We give a complete proof for the case of special
domains of finite type and indicate briefly how this method is to be extended
to the case of general bounded smooth weakly pseudoconvex domains of finite
type.
