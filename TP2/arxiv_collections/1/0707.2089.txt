A method for deriving Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) solutions developed in
Int. J. Mod. Phys. D{\bf 5}(1996)71-84, is generalized to account for models
with non-minimal coupling between the dark energy and the dark matter. New
quintessence and phantom (flat) FRW solutions are found. Their physical
significance is discussed. Additionally, the aforementioned method is modified
so that, "coincidence free" solutions can be readily derived. Besides, we
review some aspects of the phantom barrier crossing. In this regard we present
a model which is free from the coincidence problem and, at the same time, does
the crossing of the phantom barrier $\omega=-1$ at late time. Finally, we give
additional comments on the non predictive properties of scalar field
cosmological models with or without energy transfer.
