The long-time behavior of the current auto-correlation functions for the
velocity, the shear stress and the heat flux is investigated in freely cooling
granular gases. It is found that the correlation functions for the velocity and
the shear stress have the long-time tails obeying $\tau^{-d/2}$, while the
correlation function of heat flux decays as $\tau^{-(d+2)/2} \exp(-\zeta^*
\tau)$ with the dimensionless cooling rate $\zeta^*$, the spatial dimension $d$
and the scaled time $\tau$ in terms of the collision frequency. The result of
our numerical simulation of the freely cooling granular gases is consistent
with the theoretical prediction.
