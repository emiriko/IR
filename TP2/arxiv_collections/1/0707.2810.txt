It is known that perturbation theory converges in fermionic field theory at
weak coupling if the interaction and the covariance are summable and if certain
determinants arising in the expansion can be bounded efficiently, e.g. if the
covariance admits a Gram representation with a finite Gram constant. The
covariances of the standard many--fermion systems do not fall into this class
due to the slow decay of the covariance at large Matsubara frequency, giving
rise to a UV problem in the integration over degrees of freedom with Matsubara
frequencies larger than some Omega (usually the first step in a multiscale
analysis). We show that these covariances do not have Gram representations on
any separable Hilbert space. We then prove a general bound for determinants
associated to chronological products which is stronger than the usual Gram
bound and which applies to the many--fermion case. This allows us to prove
convergence of the first integration step in a rather easy way, for a
short--range interaction which can be arbitrarily strong, provided Omega is
chosen large enough. Moreover, we give - for the first time - nonperturbative
bounds on all scales for the case of scale decompositions of the propagator
which do not impose cutoffs on the Matsubara frequency.
