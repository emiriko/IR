Several hard exclusive scattering processes admit a description in terms of
generalized parton distributions and perturbative hard-scattering kernels. Both
the physical amplitude and the hard-scattering kernels fulfill dispersion
relations. We give a detailed investigation of their consistency at all orders
in perturbation theory. The results shed light on the information about
generalized parton distributions that can be extracted from the real and
imaginary parts of exclusive amplitudes. They also provide a practical
consistency check for models of these distributions in which Lorentz invariance
is not exactly satisfied.
