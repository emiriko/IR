Measuring and modeling human behavior is a very complex task. In this paper
we present our initial thoughts on modeling and automatic recognition of some
human activities in an office. We argue that to successfully model human
activities, we need to consider both individual behavior and group dynamics. To
demonstrate these theoretical approaches, we introduce an experimental system
for analyzing everyday activity in our office.
