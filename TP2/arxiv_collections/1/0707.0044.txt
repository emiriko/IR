Geometric phase that manifests itself in number of optic and nuclear
experiments is shown to be a useful tool for realization of quantum
computations in so called holonomic quantum computer model (HQCM). This model
is considered as an externally driven quantum system with adiabatic evolution
law and finite number of the energy levels. The corresponding evolution
operators represent quantum gates of HQCM. The explicit expression for the
gates is derived both for one-qubit and for multi-qubit quantum gates as
Abelian and non-Abelian geometric phases provided the energy levels to be
time-independent or in other words for rotational adiabatic evolution of the
system. Application of non-adiabatic geometric-like phases in quantum
computations is also discussed for a Caldeira-Legett-type model (one-qubit
gates) and for the spin 3/2 quadrupole NMR model (two-qubit gates). Generic
quantum gates for these two models are derived. The possibility of construction
of the universal quantum gates in both cases is shown.
