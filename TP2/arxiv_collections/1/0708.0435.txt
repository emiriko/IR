First, some superluminal phenomena and experiments are introduced briefly.
Next, based on the basic principles of the special relativity, the Lorentz
transformation (LT) with smaller velocity and the general Lorentz
transformation (GLT) with larger velocity should be derived simultaneously by
the classification of the timelike and the spacelike intervals. In deriving LT,
an additional independent hypothesis has been used, thus the values of velocity
are restricted absolutely, and the spacelike interval is excluded. LT and GLT
are connected by the de Broglie relation. The fundamental properties of any
four-vector and the strange characteristic which these tachyons should possess
are described. The various superluminal transformations are discussed. Further,
we think that LT is unsuitable for photon and neutrino, the photon
transformation (PT) is unified for space and time. It may reasonably overcome
some existing difficulties, and cannot restrict that the rest mass of photon
and neutrino must be zero. LT, GLT and PT together form a complete structure of
the Lorentz group. Finally, we discuss that new experiments on the quantum
entangled state shown some characters, for example, coherency, nonlocality,
quantum teleportation and superluminal. Further, it should be a new fifth
interaction, and may probably apply GLT.
