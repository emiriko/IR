Doppler cooling of calcium ions has been experimentally demonstrated using
the S1/2 to D5/2 dipole-forbidden transition. Scattering forces and
fluorescence levels a factor of 5 smaller than for usual Doppler cooling on the
dipole allowed S1/2 to P1/2 transition have been achieved. Since the light
scattered from the ions can be monitored at (violet) wavelengths that are very
different from the excitation wavelengths, single ions can be detected with an
essentially zero background level. This, as well as other features of the
cooling scheme, can be extremely valuable for ion trap based quantum
information processing.
