We present recent CDF results based on approximately 1 fb$^{-1}$ of $p\bar p$
collisions at $\sqrt s = 1.96$ TeV delivered at Fermilab Tevatron. Results
shown include the observation of the $B_s$ oscillation frequency, the first
observation of bottom baryon $\Sigma_b^{(*)\pm}$ states, updates on $B$ hadrons
lifetimes, and searches for rare decays in the $b\to s\mu^+\mu^-$ transition
and in charmless two-body B decays.
