Recently, it has been shown that, when the dimension of a graph turns out to
be infinite dimensional in a broad sense, the upper critical surface and the
corresponding critical behavior of an arbitrary Ising spin glass model defined
over such a graph, can be exactly mapped on the critical surface and behavior
of a non random Ising model. A graph can be infinite dimensional in a strict
sense, like the fully connected graph, or in a broad sense, as happens on a
Bethe lattice and in many random graphs. In this paper, we firstly introduce
our definition of dimensionality which is compared to the standard definition
and readily applied to test the infinite dimensionality of a large class of
graphs which, remarkably enough, includes even graphs where the tree-like
approximation (or, in other words, the Bethe-Peierls approach), in general, may
be wrong. Then, we derive a detailed proof of the mapping for all the graphs
satisfying this condition. As a byproduct, the mapping provides immediately a
very general Nishimori law.
