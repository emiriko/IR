We present the collective excitations spectrum (magnetoplasmon spectrum) of
  Dirac electrons in a weakly modulated single graphene layer in the presence
of a uniform magnetic field. We consider electric modulation in one-dimension
and the magnetic field applied perpendicular to graphene.We derive analytical
results for the intra-Landau band plasmon spectrum within the
self-consistent-field approach. We find Weiss oscillations in the
magnetoplasmon spectrum which is the primary focus of this work. Results are
presented for the intra-Landau band magnetoplasmon spectrum as a function of
inverse magnetic field. These results are also compared with those of
conventional 2DEG. We have found that the Weiss oscillations in the
magnetoplasmon spectrum are larger in amplitude compared to those in
conventional 2DEG for the same modulation strength, period of modulation and
electron density.
