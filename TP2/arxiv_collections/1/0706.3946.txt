The stability of superfluid currents in a system of ultracold bosons was
studied using a moving optical lattice. Superfluid currents in a very weak
lattice become unstable when their momentum exceeds 0.5 recoil momentum.
Superfluidity vanishes already for zero momentum as the lattice deep reaches
the Mott insulator(MI) phase transition. We study the phase diagram for the
disappearance of superfluidity as a function of momentum and lattice depth
between these two limits. Our phase boundary extrapolates to the critical
lattice depth for the superfluid-to-MI transition with 2% precision. When a
one-dimensional gas was loaded into a moving optical lattice a sudden
broadening of the transition between stable and unstable phases was observed.
