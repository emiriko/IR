We discuss the diffractive photo- and electroproduction of a single neutral
pion at high energies where it can occur due to odderon exchange. We show that
this process is dynamically suppressed as a consequence of chiral symmetry. Our
result reconciles earlier theoretical expectations with the non-observation of
this reaction at HERA.
