By use of conformal field theory, we discover several exact factorizations of
higher-order density correlation functions in critical two-dimensional
percolation. Our formulas are valid in the upper half-plane, or any conformally
equivalent region. We find excellent agreement of our results with
high-precision computer simulations. There are indications that our formulas
hold more generally.
