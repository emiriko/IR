This research hypothesized that a practical approach in the form of a
solution framework known as Natural Language Understanding and Reasoning for
Intelligence (NaLURI), which combines full-discourse natural language
understanding, powerful representation formalism capable of exploiting
ontological information and reasoning approach with advanced features, will
solve the following problems without compromising practicality factors: 1)
restriction on the nature of question and response, and 2) limitation to scale
across domains and to real-life natural language text.
