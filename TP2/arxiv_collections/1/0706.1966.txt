The information-theoretic arguments presented in a recent publication on
"Quantum discord and Maxwell's demons" are discussed, and found not to address
the problem specified by Maxwell. Two interrelated and definitive exorcisms of
the demon, one purely thermodynamic, and the other quantum-thermodynamic are
briefly discussed. For each of the two exorcisms, the demon is shown to be
incapable to accomplish his assignment neither because of limitations arising
from information-theoretic tools at his disposal, nor because of the value of
his IQ. The limitations are due to the physics of the state of the system on
which he is asked to perform his demonic acts.
