We study numerically a monodisperse model of interacting classical particles
predicted to exhibit a static liquid-glass transition. Using a dynamical Monte
Carlo method we show that the model does not freeze into a glassy phase at low
temperatures. Instead, depending on the choice of the hard-core radius for the
particles the system either collapses trivially or a polycrystalline hexagonal
structure emerges.
