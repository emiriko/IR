We present a theory of the dynamical two-particle response function in the
Hubbard model based on the time-dependent Gutzwiller approximation. The results
are in excellent agreement with exact diagonalization on small clusters and
give reliable results even for high densities, where the usual ladder
approximation breaks down. We apply the theory to the computation of antibound
states relevant for Auger spectroscopy and cold atom physics. A special bonus
of the theory is its computational simplicity.
