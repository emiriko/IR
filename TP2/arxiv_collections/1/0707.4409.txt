By means of a quantitative shadowgraphic method, we performed a space-time
characterization of the refractive index variation and transient absorption
induced by a light-plasma filament generated by a 100 fs laser pulse in water.
The formation and evolution of the plasma channel in the proximity of the
nonlinear focus were observed with a 23 fs time resolution.
