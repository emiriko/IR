We search for direct pair production of supersymmetric top quarks and
supersymmetric bottom quarks in proton-antiproton collisions at sqrt(s)=1.96
TeV, using 295 pb^-1 of data recorded by the Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF
II) experiment. The supersymmetric top (supersymmetric bottom) quarks are
selected by reconstructing their decay into a charm (bottom) quark and a
neutralino, which is assumed to be the lightest supersymmetric particle. The
signature of such processes is two energetic heavy-flavor jets and missing
transverse energy. The number of events that pass our selection for each search
process is consistent with the expected standard model background. By comparing
our results to the theoretical production cross sections of the supersymmetric
top and supersymmetric bottom quarks in the minimal supersymmetric standard
model, we exclude, at a 95% confidence level in the frame of that model, a
supersymmetric top quark mass up to 132 GeV/c^2 for a neutralino mass of 48
GeV/c^2, and a supersymmetric bottom quark mass up to 193 GeV/c^2 for a
neutralino mass of 40 GeV/c^2.
