Let w(i) be a period of rotation of the i-th planet around the Sun (or w(j;i)
be a period of rotation of j-th satellite around the i-th planet). From
empirical observations it is known that the sum of n(i)w(i)=0 (or the sum of
n(j)w(j;i)=0) for some integers n(i) (or n(j)), different for different
satellite systems. These conditions, known as resonance conditions, make uses
of theories such as KAM difficult to implement. The resonances in Solar System
are similar to those encountered in old quantum mechanics where applications of
methods of celestial mechanics to atomic and molecular physics were highly
sucsessful. With such a success, the birth of new quantum mechanics is
difficult to understand. In short, the rationale for its birth lies in
simplicity with which the same type of calculations are done using new methods
capable of taking care of resonances. The solution of quantization puzzle was
found by Heisenberg. In this paper new uses of Heisenberg's ideas are found.
When superimposed with the equivalence principle of general relativity, they
lead to quantum mechanical tratment of observed resonances in Solar System. To
test correctness of our theoretical predictions the number of allowed stable
orbits for planets and for equatorial stable orbits of satellites of heavy
planets is calculated resulting in good agreement with observational data. In
addition, the paper briefly discusses quantum mechanical nature of rings of
heavy planets and potential usefulness of the obtained results for cosmology.
