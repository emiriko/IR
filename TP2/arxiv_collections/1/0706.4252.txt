MACE, a model for the propagation of mach cones in the velocity field of
heavy ion collisions (as created by hydrodynamical models) is explained. It is
tested on an analytical test case (static medium) and applied to velocity
fields created by the Particle-in-Cell model from LHC and RHIC initial
conditions.
