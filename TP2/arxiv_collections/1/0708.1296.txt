We present a new generation of nano-electromechanical systems (NEMS), which
are realized by doping the semiconductor base material. In contrast to the
traditional approach these doped NEMS (D-NEMS) do not require a metallization
layer. This makes them far lighter and hence increases resonance frequency and
quality factor. Additionally, D-NEMS can be tuned from the conductive state
into an insulating one. This will enable a host of new device designs, like
mechanically tunable pin-junctions and nanomechanical single electron switches.
We demonstrate D-NEMS fabrication and operation from the intrinsic, to the
light, and to the heavy regime of doping.
