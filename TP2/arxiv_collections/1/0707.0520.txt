The Nariai black hole, whose two horizons are lying close to each other, is
an extreme and important case in the research of black hole. In this paper we
study the evolution of a massless scalar field scattered around in 5D
Schwarzschild-de Sitter black string space. Using the method shown by Brevik
and Simonsen (2001) we solve the scalar field equation as a boundary value
problem, where real boundary condition is employed. Then with convenient
replacement of the 5D continuous potential by square barrier, the reflection
and transmission coefficients ($R, T$) are obtained. At last, we also compare
the coefficients with usual 4D counterpart.
