Magneto-fluctuations of the normal resistance RN have been reproducibly
observed in YBa2Cu3O7-d biepitaxial grain boundary junctions at low
temperatures. We attribute them to mesoscopic transport in narrow channels
across the grain boundary line, occurring in an unusual energy regime. The
Thouless energy appears to be the relevant energy scale. Possible implications
on the understanding of coherent transport of quasiparticles in HTS and of the
dissipation mechanisms are discussed.
