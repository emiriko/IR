In order to illustrate the capabilities of COMPASS using a hadronic beam, I
review some of the azimuthal asymmetries in hadronic collisions, that allow for
the extraction of transversity, Sivers and Boer-Mulders functions, necessary to
explore the partonic spin structure of the nucleon. I also report on some Monte
Carlo simulations of such asymmetries for the production of Drell-Yan lepton
pairs from the collision of high-energy pions on a transversely polarized
proton target.
