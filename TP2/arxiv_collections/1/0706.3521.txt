A distinction in reasons and motives for choosing a particular political
leader establishes the key difference between older and young democracy. The
former is based on electoral history, while the latter is based on feelings and
personal attitude. Besides, a comparatively abundant number of political
figures (persons or parties and associations) is specific for young
democracies. The problem of a reference votes' distribution is analyzed.
Lefevbre's theory of a reflexive control is supposed to make the basis for
indifferent choice of political figures. This theory yields a golden section
split of votes (or the series of Fibonacci numbers, for the case of multiple
choice). A typology of political campaigns based on this theory is proposed. A
proximity of ratings of competing persons means the highest electoral tension,
a leadership of a person means a high level of mobilization; a neutral
situation corresponds to Fibonacci numbers distribution of votes.
