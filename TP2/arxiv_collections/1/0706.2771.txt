This talk will review the status of art of nuclear and Coulomb breakup
theories and their relation to optical models of elastic scattering of exotic
projectiles. The effect of the final state interactions between the breakup
particle and the core and target nuclei will be clarified and some typical
numerical calculations for the relevant observables will be presented and
compared to experimental data. Finally new results will be shown to demonstrate
the feasibility of a novel type of experiment involving heavy projectiles far
from stability on heavy targets.
