For smooth test configurations, there always exist C^{1,1} geodesic rays in
Kahler metric space parallel to the algebraic ray. The $\yen$ invariant agrees
with Futaki invariant, at least under nice assumptions. Explicit examples in
Toric cases are calculated. On simple test configurations, Donaldson's
correspondence between HCMA solution and holomorphic disc family is extended.
