We introduce a new kinematic event variable MTGEN which can provide
information relating to the mass scales of particles pair-produced at hadronic
and leptonic colliders. The variable is of particular use in events with a
large number of particles in the final state when some of those particles are
massive and not detected, such as may arise in R-parity-conserving
supersymmetry.
