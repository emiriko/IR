A comodule algebra P over a Hopf algebra H with bijective antipode is called
principal if the coaction of H is Galois and P is H-equivariantly projective
(faithfully flat) over the coaction-invariant subalgebra B. We prove that
principality is a piecewise property: given N comodule-algebra surjections
P->Pi whose kernels intersect to zero, P is principal if and only if all Pi's
are principal. Furthermore, assuming the principality of P, we show that the
lattice these kernels generate is distributive if and only if so is the lattice
obtained by intersection with B. Finally, assuming the above distributivity
property, we obtain a flabby sheaf of principal comodule algebras over a
certain space that is universal for all such N-families of surjections P->Pi
and such that the comodule algebra of global sections is P.
