We obtain analytic formulas for the frequency-dependent spin-Hall
conductivity of a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in the presence of
impurities, linear spin-orbit Rashba interaction, and external magnetic field
perpendicular to the 2DEG. We show how different mechanisms (skew-scattering,
side-jump, and spin precession) can be brought in or out of focus by changing
controllable parameters such as frequency, magnetic field, and temperature. We
find, in particular, that the d.c. spin Hall conductivity vanishes in the
absence of a magnetic field, while a magnetic field restores the
skew-scattering and side-jump contributions proportionally to the ratio of
magnetic and Rashba fields.
