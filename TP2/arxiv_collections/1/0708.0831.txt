The monochromatic Dirac and polychromatic Titulaer-Glauber quantized field
theories (QFTs) of electromagnetism are derived from a photon-energy wave
function in much the same way that one derives QFT for electrons, that is, by
quantization of a single-particle wave function. The photon wave function and
its equation of motion are established from the Einstein energy-momentum-mass
relation, assuming a local energy density. This yields a theory of photon wave
mechanics (PWM). The proper Lorentz-invariant single-photon scalar product is
found to be non-local in coordinate space, and is shown to correspond to
orthogonalization of the Titulaer-Glauber wave-packet modes. The wave functions
of PWM and mode functions of QFT are shown to be equivalent, evolving via
identical equations of motion, and completely describe photonic states. We
generalize PWM to two or more photons, and show how to switch between the PWM
and QFT viewpoints. The second-order coherence tensors of classical coherence
theory and the two-photon wave functions are shown to propagate equivalently.
We give examples of beam-like states, which can be used as photon wave
functions in PWM, or modes in QFT. We propose a practical mode converter based
on spectral filtering to convert between wave packets and their corresponding
biorthogonal dual wave packets.
