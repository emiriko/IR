The one-loop contribution to the superpotential, in particular the
Veneziano-Yankielowicz potential in N=1 supersymmetric Yang-Mills model is
discussed from an elementary field theory method and the matrix model point of
view. Both approaches are based on the Renormalization Group variation of the
superconformal N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills model.
