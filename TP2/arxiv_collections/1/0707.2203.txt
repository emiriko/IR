An analytical relationship between the statistical significance of an
observed signal and the signal width in case of a large background was
obtained. It can help to explain why high-energy experiments may have different
conclusions on the existence of new particles. We illustrate our approach using
the experimental data on searches for the Theta+(1530) pentaquark state. The
obtained relationship is also useful for planning of future experiments
designed to search for signals of new particles in invariant-mass
distributions.
