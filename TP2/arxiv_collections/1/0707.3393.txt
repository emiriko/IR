We examine the performance of a recently developed nonlocal density
functional in predicting a model noncovalent interaction, the weak bond between
an aromatic $\pi$ system and an aliphatic C-H group. The new functional is a
significant improvement over traditional density functionals, providing results
which compare favorably to high-level quantum-chemistry techniques but at
considerably lower computational cost. Interaction energies in several model
C-H/$\pi$ systems are in generally good agreement with coupled-cluster
calculations, though equilibrium distances are consistently overpredicted when
using the revPBE functional for exchange. The new functional correctly predicts
changes in energy upon addition of halogen substituents.
