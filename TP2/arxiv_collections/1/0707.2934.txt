According to socio-constructivism approach, collective situations are
promoted to favor learning in classroom, at a distance or in a blended
educational context. So, many Information and Communication Technologies (ICT)
are provided to teachers but there are no clear studies about the way they are
used and perceived. Our research is based on the hypothesis that practices of
educational actors (instructional designers and tutors) are far away from
theoretical results of research in education technologies. In this paper, we
consider a precise kind of situation: Instrumented Collective Learning
Situations (ICLS). By a survey on 13 fields in higher education in France,
Switzerland and Canada, we present how ICLS are designed and how teachers used
them. Conclusions give an indication on the gap between the way information
technologies are prescribed and the way they are actually used and perceived by
teachers.
