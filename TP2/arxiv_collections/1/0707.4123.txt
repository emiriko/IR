We study systematic errors of the ground-state parameters obtained by
Shifman-Vainshtein-Zakharov (SVZ) sum rules, making use of the
harmonic-oscillator potential model as an example. In this case, one knows the
exact solution for the polarization operator, which allows one to obtain both
the OPE to any order and the parameters (masses and decay constants) of the
bound states. We determine the parameters of the ground state making use of the
standard procedures of the method of sum rules, and compare the obtained
results with the known exact values. We show that in the situation when the
continuum contribution to the polarization operator is not known and is
modelled by an effective continuum, the method of sum rules does not allow to
control the systematic uncertainties of the extracted ground-state parameters.
