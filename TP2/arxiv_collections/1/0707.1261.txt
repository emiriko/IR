Recently, several papers discussed the existence of a low mass leptonic
structure. It was suggested that the $\Sigma^{+}$ disintegration:
$\Sigma^{+}\to$pP$^{0}$, P$^{0}\to\mu^{-}\mu^{+}$ proceeds through an
intermediate particle P$^{0}$ having a mass close to M$\approx$~214.3 MeV. The
present work intends to look at other available data, in order to observe the
eventual existence of a small peak or shoulder, at a mass close to M=214.3 MeV,
which can strengthen the existence of a state produced by two leptons of
opposite electric charge.
