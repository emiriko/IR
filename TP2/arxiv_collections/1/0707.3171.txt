The {}^{17}O NMR spectra of Bi_2Sr_2CaCu_2O$_{8+\delta}$ (Bi-2212) single
crystals were measured in the temperature range from 4 K to 200 K and magnetic
fields from 3 to 29 T, reported here principally at 8 T. The NMR linewidth of
the oxygen in the CuO_{2} plane was found to be magnetically broadened with the
temperature dependence of a Curie law where the Curie coefficient decreases
with increased doping. This inhomogeneous magnetism is an impurity effect
intrinsic to oxygen doping and persists unmodified into the superconducting
state.
