The prediction of auto-ignition delay times in HCCI engines has risen
interest on detailed chemical models. This paper described a validated kinetic
mechanism for the oxidation of a model Diesel fuel (n-decane and
&#945;-methylnaphthalene). The 3D model for the description of low and high
temperature auto-ignition in engines is presented. The behavior of the model
fuel is compared with that of n-heptane. Simulations show that the 3D model
coupled with the kinetic mechanism can reproduce experimental HCCI and Diesel
engine results and that the correct modeling of auto-ignition in the cool flame
region is essential in HCCI conditions.
