We study the long time behavior of the subcritical (subcubic) defocussing
nonlinear wave equation on the three dimensional ball, for random data of low
regularity. We prove that for a large set of radial initial data in
$\cap_{s<1/2} H^s(B(0,1))$ the equation is (globally in time) well posed and we
construct an invariant measure.
