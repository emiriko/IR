Many have argued that research on grand unification or local realistic
physics will not be truly relevant until it makes predictions verified by
experiment, different from the prediction of prior theory (the standard model).
This paper proposes a new strategy (and candidate Lagrangians) for such models;
that strategy in turn calls for reconsideration of Schwinger's magnetic model
of matter. High priority should be given to experiments which fully confirm or
deny recent scattering calculations which suggest the presence of van der Waals
effects in low energy p-p and pi-pi scattering, consistent with Schwinger's
model and inconsistent with QCD as we know it (with a mass gap). I briefly
discuss other evidence, which does not yet rule out Schwinger's theory. A
recent analysis of hadron masses also seems more consistent with the Schwinger
model than with QCD.
