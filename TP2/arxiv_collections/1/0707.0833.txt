For an ideal D-dimensional Fermi gas under generic external confinement we
derive the correcting coefficient $(D-2)/3D$ of the von Weizsacker term in the
kinetic energy density. To obtain this coefficient we use the Kirzhnits
semiclassical expansion of the number operator up to the second order in the
Planck constant $\hbar$. Within this simple and direct approach we determine
the differential equation of the density profile and the density functional of
the Fermi gas. In the case D=2 we find that the Kirzhnits gradient corrections
vanish to all order in $\hbar$.
