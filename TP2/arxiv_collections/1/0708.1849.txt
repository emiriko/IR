Ox-LDL uptakes by macrophage play a critical role in the happening of
atherosclerosis. Because of its low damage on observed cells and better
signal-to- background ratio, two-photon excitation fluorescence microscopy is
used to observe NAD(P)H autofluorescence of macrophage under difference
cultured conditions- bare cover glass, coated with fibronectin or
poly-D-lysine. The results show that the optimal condition is fibronectin
coated surface, on which, macrophages profile can be clearly identified on
NAD(P)H autofluorescence images collected by two-photon microscopy. Moreover,
different morphology and intensities of autofluorescence under different
conditions were observed as well. In the future, effects of ox-LDL on
macrophages will be investigated by purposed system to research etiology of
atherosclerosis.
