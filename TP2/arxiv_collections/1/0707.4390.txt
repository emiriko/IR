The experimental demonstration of the modification of the Casimir force
between a gold coated sphere and a single-crystal Si membrane by light pulses
is performed. The specially designed and fabricated Si membrane was irradiated
with 514 nm laser pulses of 5 ms width in high vacuum leading to a change of
the charge-carrier density. The difference in the Casimir force in the presence
and in the absence of laser radiation was measured by means of an atomic force
microscope as a function of separation at different powers of the absorbed
light. The total experimental error of the measured force differences at a
separation of 100 nm varies from 10 to 20% in different measurements. The
experimental results are compared with theoretical computations using the
Lifshitz theory at both zero and laboratory temperatures. The total theoretical
error determined mostly by the uncertainty in the concentration of charge
carriers when the light is incident is found to be about 14% at separations
less than 140 nm. The experimental data are consistent with the Lifshitz theory
at laboratory temperature, if the static dielectric permittivity of
high-resistivity Si in the absence of light is assumed to be finite. If the dc
conductivity of high-resistivity Si in the absence of light is included into
the model of dielectric response, the Lifshitz theory at nonzero temperature is
shown to be experimentally inconsistent at 95% confidence. The demonstrated
phenomenon of the modification of the Casimir force through a change of the
charge-carrier density is topical for applications of the Lifshitz theory to
real materials in fields ranging from nanotechnology and condensed matter
physics to the theory of fundamental interactions.
