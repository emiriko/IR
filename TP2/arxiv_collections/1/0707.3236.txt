This article demonstrates how to develop a Microchip PIC16F84 based device
that supports RS-232 interface with PC. Circuit (LED Board) design and software
development will be discussed. PicBasic Pro Compiler from microEngineering
Labs, Inc. is used for PIC programming. Development of LED Board Control
Console using C/C++ is also briefly discussed. The project requires basic work
experience with Microchip PICs, serial communication and programming.
