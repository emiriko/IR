The renormalized mean value of the quantum Lagrangian and the corresponding
components of the Energy-Momentum tensor for massive spinor fields coupled to
an arbitrary gravitational field configuration having cylindrical symmetry are
analytically evaluated using the Schwinger-DeWitt approximation, up to second
order in the inverse mass value. The general results are employed to explicitly
derive compact analytical expressions for the quantum mean Lagrangian and
Energy- Momentum tensor in the particular background of the Black-String
space-time.
