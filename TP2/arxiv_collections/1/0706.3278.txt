Based on the hadron transport frames, detailed simulations are carried out to
discuss $\phi$, $\Omega$ productions and the significant enhancements in the
very low $p_T$ region for some of the soft spectra in RHIC. Elastic
interactions are introduced in the simulations. The elastic cross sections vary
from different hadrons and energy scales, which can qualitatively explain the
different collective motions of various hadrons.
