We present recent measurements of the longitudinal double-spin asymmetry A_LL
for the inclusive production of jets at midrapidity in polarized proton-proton
collisions at sqrt(s)=200GeV. The data amount to an integrated luminosity of
3pb-1 and were collected with the STAR detector at the Relativistic Heavy Ion
Collider during the year 2005 with average beam polarizations of about 50%. The
ALL measurements cover jet transverse momenta 5 < pT < 30 GeV/c expanding the
pT coverage over previously published data. The results will be compared with
perturbative QCD evaluations and shown to provide sensitive constraints on the
gluon spin contribution to the nucleon spin.
