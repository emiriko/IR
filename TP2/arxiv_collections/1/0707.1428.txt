Energy resolution, alpha/beta ratio, pulse-shape discrimination for gamma
rays and alpha particles, temperature dependence of scintillation properties,
and radioactive contamination were studied with CaMoO4 crystal scintillators. A
high sensitivity experiment to search for neutrinoless double beta decay of
100-Mo by using CaMoO4 scintillators is discussed.
