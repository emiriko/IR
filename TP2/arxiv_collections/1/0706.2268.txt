It was shown recently that the space isomorphic with an Gelfand Shilov space
is well adapted for the use in quantum field theory with a fundamental length.
It is our believe that all Gelfand Shilov spaces, especially those with
quasianalytic test function spaces, are good domains for the quantum field
theory. The theory requires technical results from the theory of generalized
functions and not merely differential calculus and well defined Fourier
transform, but also the kernel theorem and the structural theorem. In the paper
we give the structural (regularity) theorem and kernel theorem for
Gelfand-Shilov spaces, of Roumieu and Beurling type.
