The notions of entanglement witnesses, separable and entangled states for two
qubits system can be visualized in three dimensions using the SLOCC equivalence
classes. This visualization preserves the duality relations between the various
sets and allows us to give ``proof by inspection'' of a non-elementary result
of the Horodeckies that for two qubits, Peres separability test is iff. We then
show that the CHSH Bell inequalities can be visualized as circles and cylinders
in the same diagram. This allows us to give a geometric proof of yet another
result of the Horodeckies, which optimizes the violation of the CHSH Bell
inequality. Finally, we give numerical evidence that, remarkably, allowing
Alice and Bob to use three rather than two measurements each, does not help
them to distinguish any new entangled SLOCC equivalence class beyond the CHSH
class.
