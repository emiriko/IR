We investigate the effects of a time-correlated noise on an extended chaotic
system. The chosen model is the Lorenz'96, a kind of toy model used for climate
studies. The system is subjected to both temporal and spatiotemporal
perturbations. Through the analysis of the system's time evolution and its time
correlations, we have obtained numerical evidence for two stochastic
resonance-like behaviors. Such behavior is seen when a generalized
signal-to-noise ratio function are depicted as a function of the external noise
intensity or as function of the system size. The underlying mechanism seems to
be associated to a noise-induced chaos reduction. The possible relevance of
those findings for an optimal climate prediction are discussed, using an
analysis of the noise effects on the evolution of finite perturbations and
errors.
