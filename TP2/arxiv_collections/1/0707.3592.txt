Decays of baryon resonances in the second and the third resonance region into
N pi0 pi0 are studied by photoproduction of two neutral pions off protons.
Partial decay widths of N* and Delta* resonances decaying into Delta(1232) pi,
N(\pi\pi)_{S}, N(1440)P_{11} pi, and N(1520)D_{13} pi are determined in a
partial wave analysis of this data, and data from other reactions. Several
partial decay widths were not known before. Interesting decay patterns are
observed which are not even qualitatively reproduced by quark model
calculations. In the second resonance region, decays into Delta(1232) pi
dominate clearly. The N(\pi\pi)_{S}-wave provides a significant contribution to
the cross section, especially in the third resonance region. The P_{13}(1720)
properties found here are at clear variance to PDG values.
