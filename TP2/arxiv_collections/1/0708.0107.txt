Cylindrically symmetric inhomogeneous magnetized string cosmological model is
investigated with cosmological term $\Lambda$ varying with time. To get the
deterministic solution, it has been assumed that the expansion ($\theta$) in
the model is proportional to the eigenvalue $\sigma^{1}_{1}$ of the shear
tensor $\sigma^{i}_{j}$. The value of cosmological constant for the model is
found to be small and positive which is supported by the results from recent
supernovae Ia observations. The physical and geometric properties of the model
are also discussed in presence and absence of magnetic field.
