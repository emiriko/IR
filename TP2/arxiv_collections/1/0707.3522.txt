I consider a supersymmetric Bogomolny-type model in 2+1 dimensions
originating from topological string theory. By a gauge fixing this model is
reduced to a supersymmetric U(n) chiral model with a Wess-Zumino-Witten-type
term in 2+1 dimensions. After a noncommutative extension of the model, I employ
the dressing method to construct explicit multi-soliton configurations on
noncommutative R^{2,1|2N}.
