We describe the intersecting brane configurations, consisting of NS-branes,
D4-branes(and anti-D4-branes), in type IIA string theory corresponding to the
meta-stable nonsupersymmetric vacua of N=1 SU(N_c) x SU(N_c') x SU(N_c'') gauge
theory with bifundamentals. By adding the orientifold 4-plane to these brane
configurations, we also discuss the meta-stable brane configurations for other
gauge theory with bifundamentals. Furthermore, we study the intersecting brane
configurations corresponding to the nonsupersymmetric meta-stable vacua of
other gauge theory with bifundamentals, by adding the orientifold 6-plane.
