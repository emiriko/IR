In some baryogenesis scenarios, the universe acquires a non-vanishing average
baryonic charge, but the baryon to photon ratio is not spatially constant and
can be even negative in some space regions. This allows for existence of lumps
of antimatter in our neighborhood and the possibility that very compact
antimatter objects make a part of cosmological dark matter. Here I discuss the
peculiar signatures which may be observed in a near future.
