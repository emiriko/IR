The optimization of measurements for the state distinction problem has
recently been applied to the theory of quantum algorithms with considerable
successes, including efficient new quantum algorithms for the non-abelian
hidden subgroup problem. Previous work has identified the optimal single copy
measurement for the hidden subgroup problem over abelian groups as well as for
the non-abelian problem in the setting where the subgroups are restricted to be
all conjugate to each other. Here we describe the optimal single copy
measurement for the hidden subgroup problem when all of the subgroups of the
group are given with equal a priori probability. The optimal measurement is
seen to be a hybrid of the two previously discovered single copy optimal
measurements for the hidden subgroup problem.
