Open FRW model in Loop Quantum Cosmology is under consideration. The left and
right invariant vector fields and holonomies along them are studied. It is
shown that in the hyperbolic geometry of $k=-1$ it is possible to construct a
suitable loop which provides us with quantum scalar constraint originally
introduced by Vandersloot. The quantum scalar constraint operator with negative
cosmological constant is proved to be essentially self-adjoint.
