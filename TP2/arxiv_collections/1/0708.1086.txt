Given a finite number of copies of an unknown qubit state that have already
been measured optimally, can one still extract any information about the
original unknown state? We give a positive answer to this question and quantify
the information obtainable by a given observer as a function of the number of
copies in the ensemble, and of the number of independent observers that, one
after the other, have independently measured the same ensemble of qubits before
him. The optimality of the protocol is proven and extensions to other states
and encodings are also studied. According to the general lore, the state after
a measurement has no information about the state before the measurement. Our
results manifestly show that this statement has to be taken with a grain of
salt, specially in situations where the quantum states encode confidential
information.
