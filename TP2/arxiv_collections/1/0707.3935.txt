The volume coherent deflection of high-energy positive and negative particles
in uniformly bent crystals is studied. The general analysis of potential
scattering shows that the standard screening potential for a large class of
collisions can cause the volume refraction for negative particles (antiprotons,
electrons) instead of the volume reflection for positive particles (proton,
positrons).
