We consider the distribution of an electric field in YBCO-coated conductors
for a situation in which the DC transport current is forced into the copper
stabilizer due to a weak link -- a section of the superconducting film with a
critical current less than the transport current. The electric field in the
metal substrate is also discussed. The results are compared with recent
experiments on normal zone propagation in coated conductors for which the
substrate and stabilizer are insulated from each other. The potential
difference between the substrate and stabilizer, and the electric field in the
substrate outside the normal zone can be accounted for by a large screening
length in the substrate, comparable to the length of the sample. During a
quench, the electric field inside the interface between YBCO and stabilizer, as
well as in the buffer layer, can be several orders of magnitude greater than
the longitudinal macroscopic electric field inside the normal zone. We
speculate on the possibility of using possible microscopic electric discharges
caused by this large ($\sim $kV/cm) electric field as a means to detect a
quench.
