We present a derivation of the orbital and spin sum rules for magnetic
circular dichroic spectra measured by electron energy loss spectroscopy in a
transmission electron microscope. These sum rules are obtained from the
differential cross section calculated for symmetric positions in the
diffraction pattern. Orbital and spin magnetic moments are expressed explicitly
in terms of experimental spectra and dynamical diffraction coefficients. We
estimate the ratio of spin to orbital magnetic moments and discuss first
experimental results for the Fe L_{2,3} edge.
