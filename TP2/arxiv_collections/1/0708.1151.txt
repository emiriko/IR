In this paper, we introduce the condition of theta-locality which can be used
as a substitute for microcausality in quantum field theory on noncommutative
spacetime. This condition is closely related to the asymptotic commutativity
which was previously used in nonlocal QFT. Heuristically, it means that the
commutator of observables behaves at large spacelike separation like
$\exp(-|x-y|^2/\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the noncommutativity parameter. The
rigorous formulation given in the paper implies averaging fields with suitable
test functions. We define a test function space which most closely corresponds
to the Moyal star product and prove that this space is a topological algebra
under the star product. As an example, we consider the simplest normal ordered
monomial $:\phi\star\phi:$ and show that it obeys the theta-locality condition.
