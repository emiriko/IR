We present an original method to magnetically pattern thin layers of
(Ga,Mn)As. It relies on local hydrogen passivation to significantly lower the
hole density, and thereby locally suppress the carrier-mediated ferromagnetic
phase. The sample surface is thus maintained continuous, and the minimal
structure size is of about 200 nm. In micron-sized ferromagnetic dots
fabricated by hydrogen passivation on perpendicularly magnetized layers, the
switching fields can be maintained closer to the continuous film coercivity,
compared to dots made by usual dry etch techniques.
