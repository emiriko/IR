The aim of this paper is to reveal the deep relationship between matter and
vacuum, and to seek for the same physical basis of the relativity and the
quantum mechanics. In doing this, three postulates of vacuum fluctuation are
proposed first, the basic premises of the relativity and the quantum mechanics
including the velocity limit, the energy-frequency relation and the de Broglie
wavelength expression of any matter particles are deduced then. As
applications, the idea is used to analyze the Compton effect and the
electron-positron annihilation. It is found that the calculation becomes
simple, and the physical meaning gets clear. The simplicity comes from the
power of the three postulates. To illustrate this, the basic conclusions of the
special theory of relativity such as the relations of mass-velocity,
mass-energy, energy-momentum, time dilation and length contraction are further
deduced. In addition, the significance of the investigation of vacuum
fluctuation in the unification of the physical theories is pointed out.
