Many 2D lattice models of physical phenomena are conjectured to have
conformally invariant scaling limits: percolation, Ising model, self-avoiding
polymers, ... This has led to numerous exact (but non-rigorous) predictions of
their scaling exponents and dimensions. We will discuss how to prove the
conformal invariance conjectures, especially in relation to Schramm-Loewner
Evolution.
