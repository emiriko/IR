Special relativity is no longer a new revolutionary theory but a firmly
established cornerstone of modern physics. The teaching of special relativity,
however, still follows its presentation as it unfolded historically, trying to
convince the audience of this teaching that Newtonian physics is natural but
incorrect and special relativity is its paradoxical but correct amendment. I
argue in this article in favor of logical instead of historical trend in
teaching of relativity and that special relativity is neither paradoxical nor
correct (in the absolute sense of the nineteenth century) but the most natural
and expected description of the real space-time around us valid for all
practical purposes. This last circumstance constitutes a profound mystery of
modern physics better known as the cosmological constant problem.
