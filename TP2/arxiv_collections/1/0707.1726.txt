High-resolution spectral hole burning (SHB) in coherent nondegenerate
differential transmission spectroscopy discloses spin-trion dynamics in an
ensemble of negatively charged quantum dots. In the Voigt geometry, stimulated
Raman spin coherence gives rise to Stokes and anti-Stokes sidebands on top of
the trion spectral hole. The prominent feature of an extremely narrow spike at
zero detuning arises from spin population pulsation dynamics. These SHB
features confirm coherent electron spin dynamics in charged dots, and the
linewidths reveal spin spectral diffusion processes.
