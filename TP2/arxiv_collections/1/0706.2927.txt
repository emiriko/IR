We investigate transport properties of gate-all-around Si nanowires using
non-equilibrium Green's function technique. By taking into account of the
ionized impurity scattering we calculate Green's functions self-consistently
and examine the effects of ionized impurity scattering on electron densities
and currents. For nano-scale Si wires, it is found that, due to the impurity
scattering, the local density of state profiles loose it's interference
oscillations as well as is broaden and shifted. In addition, the impurity
scattering gives rise to a different transconductance as functions of
temperature and impurity scattering strength when compared with the
transconductance without impurity scattering.
