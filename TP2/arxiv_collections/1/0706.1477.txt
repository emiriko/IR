We extend the transfer theorem of [KP2007] to the complex field. That is, we
investigate the links between the class VPSPACE of families of polynomials and
the Blum-Shub-Smale model of computation over C. Roughly speaking, a family of
polynomials is in VPSPACE if its coefficients can be computed in polynomial
space. Our main result is that if (uniform, constant-free) VPSPACE families can
be evaluated efficiently then the class PAR of decision problems that can be
solved in parallel polynomial time over the complex field collapses to P. As a
result, one must first be able to show that there are VPSPACE families which
are hard to evaluate in order to separate P from NP over C, or even from PAR.
