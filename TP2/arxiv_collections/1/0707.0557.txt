An all-electrical spin resonance effect in a GaAs few-electron double quantum
dot is investigated experimentally and theoretically. The magnetic field
dependence and absence of associated Rabi oscillations are consistent with a
novel hyperfine mechanism. The resonant frequency is sensitive to the
instantaneous hyperfine effective field, and the effect can be used to detect
and create sizable nuclear polarizations. A device incorporating a micromagnet
exhibits a magnetic field difference between dots, allowing electrons in either
dot to be addressed selectively.
