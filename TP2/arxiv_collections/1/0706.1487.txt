In ballistic conductors, there is a low-time threshold for the appearance of
quantum effects in transport coefficients. This low-time threshold is the
Ehrenfest time. Most previous studies of the Ehrenfest-time dependence of
quantum transport assumed ergodic electron dynamics, so that they could be
applied to ballistic quantum dots only. In this article we present a theory of
the Ehrenfest-time dependence of three signatures of quantum transport - the
Fano factor for the shot noise power, the weak localization correction to the
conductance, and the conductance fluctuations - for arbitrary ballistic
conductors.
