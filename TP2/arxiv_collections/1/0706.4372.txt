We propose a mechanism to explain the nature of the damping of Rabi
oscillations with increasing driving-pulse area in localized semiconductor
systems, and have suggested a general approach which describes a coherently
driven two-level system interacting with a dephasing reservoir. Present
calculations show that the non-Markovian character of the reservoir leads to
the dependence of the dephasing rate on the driving-field intensity, as
observed experimentally. Moreover, we have shown that the damping of Rabi
oscillations might occur as a result of different dephasing mechanisms for both
stationary and non-stationary effects due to coupling to the environment.
Present calculated results are found in quite good agreement with available
experimental measurements.
