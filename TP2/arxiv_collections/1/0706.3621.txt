The sun's role in the earth's recent warming remains controversial even
though there is a good deal of evidence to support the thesis that solar
variations are a very significant factor in driving climate change both
currently and in the past. This precis lays out the background and data needed
to understand the basic scientific argument behind the contention that
variations in solar output have a significant impact on current changes in
climate. It also offers a simple, phenomenological approach for estimating the
actual-as opposed to model dependent-magnitude of the sun's influence on
climate.
