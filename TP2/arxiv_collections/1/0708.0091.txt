Both ecological systems and convective fluid systems are examples of open
systems which operate far-from-equilibrium. This article demonstrates that
there is a correspondence between a resource-consumer chemostat ecosystem and
the Rayleigh-Benard (RB) convective fluid system. The Lorenz dynamics of the RB
system can be translated into an ecosystem dynamics. Not only is there a
correspondence between the dynamical equations, also the physical
interpretations show interesting analogies. By using this fluid-ecosystem
analogy, we are able to derive the correct value of the size of convection
rolls by competitive fitness arguments borrowed from ecology. We finally
conjecture that the Lorenz dynamics can be extended to describe more complex
convection patterns that resemble ecological predation.
