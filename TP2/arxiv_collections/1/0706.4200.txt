The inelastic neutral reaction of neutrino on 4He is calculated using two
modern nucleon--nucleon potentials. Full final state interaction among the four
nucleons is considered, via the Lorentz integral transform (LIT) method. The
effective interaction hyperspherical-harmonic (EIHH) approach is used to solve
the resulting Schrodinger like equations. A detailed energy dependent
calculation is given in the impulse approximation.
