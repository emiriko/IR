We provide a new characterization of convex geometries via a multivariate
version of an identity that was originally proved by Maneva, Mossel and
Wainwright for certain combinatorial objects arising in the context of the
k-SAT problem. We thus highlight the connection between various
characterizations of convex geometries and a family of removal processes
studied in the literature on random structures.
