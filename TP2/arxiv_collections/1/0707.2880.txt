Quantum information carriers with higher dimension than the canonical qubit
offer significant advantages. However, manipulating such systems is extremely
difficult. We show how measurement induced non-linearities can be employed to
dramatically extend the range of possible transforms on biphotonic qutrits; the
three level quantum systems formed by the polarisation of two photons in the
same spatio-temporal mode. We fully characterise the biphoton-photon
entanglement that underpins our technique, thereby realising the first instance
of qubit-qutrit entanglement. We discuss an extension of our technique to
generate qutrit-qutrit entanglement and to manipulate any bosonic encoding of
quantum information.
