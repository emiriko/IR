In this paper we compute the tree-level four-point scattering amplitude of
two dilatini and two axion-dilaton fields in type IIB supergravity in AdS5 x
S5. A special feature of this process is that there is an "exotic" channel in
which there are no singleparticle poles. Another novelty is that this process
involves the exchange of a bulk gravitino. The amplitude is interpreted in
terms of N = 4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory at large 't Hooft coupling.
Properties of the Operator Product Expansion are used to analyze the various
contributions from single- and double-trace operators in the weak and strongly
coupled regimes, and to determine the anomalous dimensions of semi-short
operators. The analysis is particularly clear in the exotic channel, given the
absence of BPS states.
