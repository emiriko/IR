Completely unexplored regimes of QCD, dominated by high-density/temperature
effects, are available in heavy ion experiments at collider energies. The
successful RHIC program shows how relevant the high transverse momentum part of
the spectrum is for the characterization of the properties of the created
medium. It points, as well, to interesting properties of the nuclear wave
function at small fraction of momentum x, probably dominated by saturated color
fields. In both domains, the imminent LHC program will provide a phase space
enlarged by orders of magnitude with respect to those studied at RHIC. I will
review the present status of hard probes in heavy ion collisions as well as the
expectations for the LHC.
