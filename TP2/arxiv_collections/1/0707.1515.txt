In [5], Srijuntongsiri and Vavasis propose the "Kantorovich-Test Subdivision
algorithm", or KTS, which is an algorithm for finding all zeros of a polynomial
system in a bounded region of the plane. This algorithm can be used to find the
intersections between a line and a surface. The main features of KTS are that
it can operate on polynomials represented in any basis that satisfies certain
conditions and that its efficiency has an upper bound that depends only on the
conditioning of the problem and the choice of the basis representing the
polynomial system.
  This article explores in detail the dependence of the efficiency of the KTS
algorithm on the choice of basis. Three bases are considered: the power, the
Bernstein, and the Chebyshev bases. These three bases satisfy the basis
properties required by KTS. Theoretically, Chebyshev case has the smallest
upper bound on its running time. The computational results, however, do not
show that Chebyshev case performs better than the other two.
