Kaon electroproduction from light nuclei and hydrogen, using 1H, 2H, 3He,
4He, and Carbon targets has been measured at Jefferson Laboratory. The
quasifree angular distributions of Lambda and Sigma hyperons were determined at
Q^2= 0.35(GeV/c)^2 and W= 1.91GeV. Electroproduction on hydrogen was measured
at the same kinematics for reference.
