Formulae of Berezin and Karpelevic for the radial parts of invariant
differential operators and the spherical function on a complex Grassmann
manifold are generalized to the hypergeometric functions associated with root
system of type $BC_n$ under condition that the multiplicity of the middle roots
is zero or one.
