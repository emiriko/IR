We present Wannier90, a program for calculating maximally-localised Wannier
functions (MLWF) from a set of Bloch energy bands that may or may not be
attached to or mixed with other bands. The formalism works by minimising the
total spread of the MLWF in real space. This done in the space of unitary
matrices that describe rotations of the Bloch bands at each k-point. As a
result, Wannier90 is independent of the basis set used in the underlying
calculation to obtain the Bloch states. Therefore, it may be interfaced
straightforwardly to any electronic structure code. The locality of MLWF can be
exploited to compute band-structure, density of states and Fermi surfaces at
modest computational cost. Furthermore, Wannier90 is able to output MLWF for
visualisation and other post-processing purposes. Wannier functions are already
used in a wide variety of applications. These include analysis of chemical
bonding in real space; calculation of dielectric properties via the modern
theory of polarisation; and as an accurate and minimal basis set in the
construction of model Hamiltonians for large-scale systems, in linear-scaling
quantum Monte Carlo calculations, and for efficient computation of material
properties, such as the anomalous Hall coefficient. Wannier90 is freely
