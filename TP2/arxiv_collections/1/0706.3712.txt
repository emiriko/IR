We report evaluations of a resonant kinetic equation that suggest the slow
time evolution of the Garrett and Munk spectrum is {\em not}, in fact, slow.
Instead nonlinear transfers lead to evolution time scales that are smaller than
one wave period at high vertical wavenumber. Such values of the transfer rates
are inconsistent with conventional wisdom that regards the Garrett and Munk
spectrum as an approximate stationary state and puts the self-consistency of a
resonant kinetic equation at a serious risk. We explore possible reasons for
and resolutions of this paradox. Inclusion of near-resonant interactions
decreases the rate at which the spectrum evolves. This leads to improved
self-consistency of the kinetic equation.
