For pure gravity in AdS_3, Witten has given a recipe for the construction of
holomorphically factorizable partition functions of pure gravity theories with
central charge c=24k. The partition function was found to be a polynomial in
the modular invariant j-function. We show that the partition function can be
obtained instead as a modular sum which has a more physical interpretation as a
sum over geometries. We express both the j-function and its derivative in terms
of such a sum.
