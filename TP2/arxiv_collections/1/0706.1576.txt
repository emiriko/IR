We show that the time frequency analysis of the autocorrelation function is,
in many ways, a more appropriate tool to resolve fractional revivals of a wave
packet than the usual time domain analysis. This advantage is crucial in
reconstructing the initial state of the wave packet when its coherent structure
is short-lived and decays before it is fully revived. Our calculations are
based on the model example of fractional revivals in a Rydberg wave packet of
circular states. We end by providing an analytical investigation which fully
agrees with our numerical observations on the utility of time-frequency
analysis in the study of wave packet fractional revivals.
