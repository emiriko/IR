Using a high speed camera, we study the peeling dynamics of an adhesive tape
under a constant load with a special focus on the so-called stick-slip regime
of the peeling. It is the first time that the very fast motion of the peeling
point is imaged. The speed of the camera, up to 16000 fps, allows us to observe
and quantify the details of the peeling point motion during the stick and slip
phases: stick and slip velocities, durations and amplitudes. First, in contrast
with previous observations, the stick-slip regime appears to be only transient
in the force controlled peeling. Additionally, we discover that the stick and
slip phases have similar durations and that at high mean peeling velocity, the
slip phase actually lasts longer than the stick phase. Depending on the mean
peeling velocity, we also observe that the velocity change between stick and
slip phase ranges from a rather sudden to a smooth transition. These new
observations can help to discriminate between the various assumptions used in
theoretical models for describing the complex peeling of an adhesive tape. The
present imaging technique opens the door for an extensive study of the velocity
controlled stick-slip peeling of an adhesive tape that will allow to understand
the statistical complexity of the stick-slip in a stationary case.
