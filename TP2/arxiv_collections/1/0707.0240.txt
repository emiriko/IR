In algebraic quantum field theory the spacetime manifold is replaced by a
suitable base for its topology ordered under inclusion. We explain how certain
topological invariants of the manifold can be computed in terms of the base
poset. We develop a theory of connections and curvature for bundles over posets
in search of a formulation of gauge theories in algebraic quantum field theory.
