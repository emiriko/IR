The paper considers the effect of the defects on the electronic transmission
properties in binomially tailored waveguide quantum wires, in which each Dirac
delta function potential strength have been weight on the binomial distribution
law. We have assumed that a single free-electron channel is incident on the
structure and the scattering of electrons is solely from the geometric nature
of the problem. We have used the transfer matrix method to study the electron
transmission. We found this novel structure has a good defect tolerance. We
found the structure tolerate up to in strength defect and in position defect
for the central Dirac delta function in the binomial distribution. Also, we
found this structure can tolerate both defect up to in strength and in position
dislocation
