We have developed a monitoring and control system for LIPI's Public Cluster.
The system consists of microcontrollers and full web-based user interfaces for
daily operation. It is argued that, due to its special natures, the cluster
requires fully dedicated and self developed control and monitoring system. We
discuss the implementation of using parallel port and dedicated
micro-controller for this purpose. We also show that integrating such systems
enables an autonomous control system based on the real time monitoring, for
instance an autonomous power supply control based on the actual temperature,
etc.
