Higgs boson production in association with a high pT photon at the CERN Large
Hadron Collider is analyzed, in the framework of the MSSM model, for the
heavier neutral Higgs bosons. The request of an additional photon in the
exclusive Higgs boson final state selects b-quark pairs among the possible
initial partonic states, since gluon-gluon initial states are not allowed by
C-parity conservation. Hence, the measurement of cross sections for neutral
Higgs boson plus photon production can provide a clean probe of the b-quark
density in the proton as well as of the b-quark Yukawa coupling. The
suppression of the production rates by the b-quark electromagnetic coupling can
be compensated by the enhanced Higgs boson Yukawa coupling to b's in the large
tan(beta) regime. The Higgs boson decay into a tau-lepton pair is considered,
and irreducible backgrounds with corresponding signal significances are
evaluated.
