The variational method, within the Hamiltonian formalism of reformulated QED
is used to determine relativistic wave equations for a system of three fermions
of arbitrary mass interacting electromagnetically. The interaction kernels of
the equations are, in essence, the invariant $\mathcal{M}$ matrices in lowest
order. The equations are used to obtain relativistic $O(\alpha^2)$ corrections
to the non-relativistic ground state energy levels of the Muonium negative ion
($\mu^+ e^- e^-$) as well as of $\mathrm{Ps}^-$ and $\mathrm{H}^-$, using
approximate variational three-body wave functions. The results are compared
with other calculations, where available. The relativistic correction for
Mu$^-$ is found to be $-1.0773 \times 10^{-4}$ eV.
