Nonholonomic distributions and adapted fame structures on (pseudo) Riemannian
manifolds of even dimension are employed to build structures equivalent to
almost Kahler geometry and which allows to perform a Fedosov-like quantization
of gravity. The nonlinear connection formalism that was formally elaborated for
Lagrange and Finsler geometry is implemented in classical and quantum Einstein
gravity.
