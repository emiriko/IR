We consider the shear viscosity of a system of quarks and its ratio to the
entropy density above the critical temperature for deconfinement. Both
quantities are derived and computed for different modeling of the quark
self-energy, also allowing for a temperature dependence of the effective mass
and width. The behaviour of the viscosity and the entropy density is argued in
terms of the strength of the coupling and of the main characteristics of the
quark self-energy. A comparison with existing results is also discussed.
