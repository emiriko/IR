Boson-fermion pairing is considered in a discrete environment of bosons and
fully spin-polarized fermions, coupled via an attractive Bose-Fermi Hubbard
Hamiltonian in one dimension. The results of the T-matrix approximation for
particles of equal mass and at double half filling are compared with the
results of exact diagonalization and with Quantum Monte Carlo results.
Satisfactory agreement for most quantities is found. The appearance of a
stable, weak-coupling pairing mode is also confirmed.
