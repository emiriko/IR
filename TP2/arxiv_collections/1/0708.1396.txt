Homogeneous and isotropic models are studied in the Jordan frame of the
second order gravity theory. The late time evolution of the models is analysed
with the methods of the dynamical systems. The normal form of the dynamical
system has periodic solutions for a large set of initial conditions. This
implies that an initially expanding closed isotropic universe may exhibit
oscillatory behaviour.
