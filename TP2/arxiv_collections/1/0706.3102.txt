The analysis of the Helmholtz equation is shown to lead to an exact
Hamiltonian system of equations describing in terms of ray trajectories a very
wide family of wave-like phenomena (including diffraction and interference)
going much beyond the limits of the ordinary geometrical optics approximation,
which is contained as a simple limiting case. Due to the fact that the time
independent Schroedinger equation is itself a Helmoltz-like equation, the same
mathematical solutions holding for a classical optical beam turn out to apply
to a quantum particle beam, leading to a complete system of Hamiltonian
equations which provide a set of particle trajectories and motion laws
containing as a limiting case the ones encountered in classical Mechanics.
