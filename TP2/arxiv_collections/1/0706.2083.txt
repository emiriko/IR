Experimental results showing huge negative differential conductance in
gold-hydrogen molecular nanojunctions are presented. The results are analyzed
in terms of two-level system (TLS) models: it is shown that a simple TLS model
cannot produce peaklike structures in the differential conductance curves,
whereas an asymmetrically coupled TLS model gives perfect fit to the data. Our
analysis implies that the excitation of a bound molecule to a large number of
energetically similar loosely bound states is responsible for the peaklike
structures. Recent experimental studies showing related features are discussed
within the framework of our model.
