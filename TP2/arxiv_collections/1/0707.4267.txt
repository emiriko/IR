Demazure characters of type A, which are equivalent to key polynomials, have
been decomposed by Lascoux and Sch\"{u}tzenberger into standard bases. We prove
that the resulting polynomials, which we call Demazure atoms, can be obtained
from a certain specialization of nonsymmetric Macdonald polynomials. This
combinatorial interpretation for Demazure atoms accelerates the computation of
the right key associated to a semi-standard Young tableau. Utilizing a related
construction, we provide a new combinatorial description for the key
polynomials.
