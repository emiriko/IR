According to the mean-field theory of Zittartz, when subject to a
symmetry-breaking disorder, the order parameter and the energy gap of an
excitonic insulator are gradually suppressed up to a critical disorder
strength. Recently, Marchetti, Simons, and Littlewood have used a replica trick
to investigate the effects of disorder on the condensation of cavity
polaritons. Within their nonlinear sigma model, it was found that the
saddle-point equations assume the form reported previously by Zittartz in the
contest of the symmetry broken excitonic insulator, but with an order
parameter, to which both photons and excitons contribute. In this paper, we
apply a closed-path time Green's function approach as an alternative to the
replica technique to formulate a nonperturbative description of cavity
polaritons in the presence of a symmetry-breaking disorder. A field theoretical
method is used to derive the Schwinger-Dyson equations for the average photon
field and the average single-particle Green's function. In contrast with the
nonlinear sigma model and the corresponding saddle-point equations, we obtain
that the exact Schwinger-Dyson equations cannot be mapped to the corresponding
equations derived by Zittartz. This result not only shows that the theory of
Zittartz cannot be applied to the excitons in a disordered quantum well coupled
to the cavity photons with only minor modifications, but arises a question
about the validity of the replica trick as well.
