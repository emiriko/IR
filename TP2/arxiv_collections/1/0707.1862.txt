We develop an exact method for computing the Casimir energy between arbitrary
compact objects, either dielectrics or perfect conductors. The energy is
obtained as an interaction between multipoles, generated by quantum current
fluctuations. The objects' shape and composition enter only through their
scattering matrices. The result is exact when all multipoles are included, and
converges rapidly. A low frequency expansion yields the energy as a series in
the ratio of the objects' size to their separation. As an example, we obtain
this series for two dielectric spheres and the full interaction at all
separations for perfectly conducting spheres.
