The mathematical properties associated with the widely accepted concept of
the extensivity of many of the common thermodynamic variables are examined and
some of their consequences considered. The possible conflict between some of
these and currently accepted results of special relativistic thermodynamics is
highlighted. Although several questions are raised, answers are not advanced as
this seems an area demanding calm, widespread reflection which could
conceivably lead to radical revision of part, or parts, of theoretical physics.
