In a recent table-top experiment we demonstrated the compatibility of three
advanced interferometer techniques for gravitational wave detection, namely
power-recycling, detuned signal-recycling and squeezed field injection. The
interferometer's signal to noise ratio was improved by up to 2.8 dB beyond the
coherent state's shot-noise. This value was mainly limited by optical losses on
the squeezed field. We present a detailed analysis of the optical losses of in
our experiment and provide an estimation of the possible nonclassical
performance of a future squeezed field enhanced GEO600 detector.
