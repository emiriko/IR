We use symmetry considerations in order to predict new magnetoelectric
fluorides. In addition to these magnetoelectric properties, we discuss among
these fluorides the ones susceptible to present multiferroic properties. We
emphasize that several materials present ferromagnetic properties. This
ferromagnetism should enhance the interplay between magnetic and dielectric
properties in these materials.
