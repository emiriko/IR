When a quantum many-particle system exists on a randomly diluted lattice, its
intrinsic thermal and quantum fluctuations coexist with geometric fluctuations
due to percolation. In this paper, we explore how the interplay of these
fluctuations influences the phase transition at the percolation threshold.
While it is well known that thermal fluctuations generically destroy long-range
order on the critical percolation cluster, the effects of quantum fluctuations
are more subtle. In diluted quantum magnets with and without dissipation, this
leads to novel universality classes for the zero-temperature percolation
quantum phase transition. Observables involving dynamical correlations display
nonclassical scaling behavior that can nonetheless be determined exactly in two
dimensions.
