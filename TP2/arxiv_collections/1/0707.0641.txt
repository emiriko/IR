Usually the offspring-parent fitness correlation is used to visualize and
analyze some caracteristics of fitness landscapes such as evolvability. In this
paper, we introduce a more general representation of this correlation, the
Fitness Cloud (FC). We use the bottleneck metaphor to emphasise fitness levels
in landscape that cause local search process to slow down. For a local search
heuristic such as hill-climbing or simulated annealing, FC allows to visualize
bottleneck and neutrality of landscapes. To confirm the relevance of the FC
representation we show where the bottlenecks are in the well-know NK fitness
landscape and also how to use neutrality information from the FC to combine
some neutral operator with local search heuristic.
