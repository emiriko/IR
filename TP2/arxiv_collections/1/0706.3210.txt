We describe the behavior of the Perdew-Zunger self-interaction-corrected
local density approximation (SIC-LDA) functional when implemented in a
plane-wave pseudopotential formalism with Wannier functions. Prototypical
semiconductors and wide-bandgap oxides show a large overcorrection of the LDA
bandgap. Application to transition-metal oxides and elements with d electrons
is hindered by a serious breaking of the spherical symmetry, which appears even
in a closed shell free atom. Our results indicate that, when all spherical
approximations are lifted, the general applicability of orbital-dependent
potentials is very limited and should be reconsidered in favor of rotationally
invariant functionals.
