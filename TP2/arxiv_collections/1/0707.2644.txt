Spin-charge coupling is studied for a strongly confined two-dimensional hole
gas subject to a perpendicular magnetic field. The study is based on
spin-charge coupled drift-diffusion equations derived from quantum-kinetic
equations in an exact manner. The spin-orbit interaction induces an extra
out-of-plane spin polarization. This contribution exhibits a persistent
oscillatory pattern in the strong-coupling regime.
