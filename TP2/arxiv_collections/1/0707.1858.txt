A general continuum theory is developed for ion intercalation dynamics in a
single crystal of a rechargeable battery cathode. It is based on an existing
phase-field formulation of the bulk free energy and incorporates two crucial
effects: (i) anisotropic ionic mobility in the crystal and (ii) surface
reactions governing the flux of ions across the electrode/electrolyte
interface, depending on the local free energy difference. Although the phase
boundary can form a classical diffusive "shrinking core" when the dynamics is
bulk-transport-limited, the theory also predicts a new regime of
surface-reaction-limited (SRL) dynamics, where the phase boundary extends from
surface to surface along planes of fast ionic diffusion, consistent with recent
experiments on LiFePO4. In the SRL regime, the theory produces a fundamentally
new equation for phase transformation dynamics, which admits traveling-wave
solutions. Rather than forming a shrinking core of untransformed material, the
phase boundary advances by filling (or emptying) successive channels of fast
diffusion in the crystal. By considering the random nucleation of SRL
phase-transformation waves, the theory predicts a very different picture of
charge/discharge dynamics from the classical diffusion-limited model, which
could affect the interpretation of experimental data for LiFePO4.
