We consider the moment operators of the observable (i.e. a semispectral
measure or POM) associated with the balanced homodyne detection statistics,
with paying attention to the correct domains of these unbounded operators. We
show that the high amplitude limit, when performed on the moment operators,
actually determines uniquely the entire statistics of a rotated quadrature
amplitude of the signal field, thereby verifying the usual assumption that the
homodyne detection achieves a measurement of that observable. We also consider,
in a general setting, the possibility of constructing a measurement of a single
quantum observable from a sequence of observables by taking the limit on the
level of moment operators of these observables. In this context, we show that
under some natural conditions (each of which is satisfied by the homodyne
detector example), the existence of the moment limits ensures that the
underlying probability measures converge weakly to the probability measure of
the limiting observable. The moment approach naturally requires that the
observables be determined by their moment operator sequences (which does not
automatically happen), and it turns out, in particular, that this is the case
for the balanced homodyne detector.
