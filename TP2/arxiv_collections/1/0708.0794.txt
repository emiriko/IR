Spin blockade occurs when an electron is unable to access an energetically
favorable path through a quantum dot due to spin conservation, resulting in a
blockade of the current through the dot. Spin blockade is the basis of a number
of recent advances in spintronics, including the measurement and the
manipulation of individual electron spins. We report measurements of the spin
blockade regime in a silicon double quantum dot, revealing a complementary
phenomenon: lifetime-enhanced transport. We argue that our observations arise
because the decay times for electron spins in silicon are long, enabling the
electron to maintain its spin throughout its transit across the quantum dot and
access fast paths that exist in some spin channels but not in others. Such long
spin lifetimes are important for applications such as quantum computation and,
more generally, spintronics.
