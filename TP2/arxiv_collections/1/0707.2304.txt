We consider gauge theories with scalar matter with and without supersymmetry
at nonzero chemical potential. It is argued that a chemical potential plays a
role similar to the FI term. We analyze theory at weak coupling regime at large
chemical potential and argue that it supports nonabelian non-BPS strings.
Worldsheet theory on the nonabelian string in a dense matter is briefly
discussed.
