The whole circuit is obtained from the sun through a molecule called
"Rhodopsin and bacteriorhodopsin". These molecules have the capability of
trapping and storing energy from the sun light. These molecules are placed on
the outer surface of the calculator to trap the energy and store it themselves
for latter usage. The thickness of the whole circuit measures less than
300nm.The top layer is made up of layer which will show the different keys and
a display unit. "Molecules are not only meant for compounding But also for
computing".
