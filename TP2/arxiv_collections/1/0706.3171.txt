The author of article discusses the possible systematic effects in our
experiment using reference and picture from allegedly our publication. First of
all this publication does not exist. The assumption of author about the
probability of lower energy upscattering is in a rough contradiction (300
times) with our experimental limit which is extremely lower, about 6x10-9 per
neutron collision. The second assumption of author concerning quasi-stable
orbits of UCN with higher energy due to specular neutron reflection from trap
wall is also in a rough contradiction with our experimental data clear
demonstrated in our previous articles as well in the last very detailed article
recently presented in the arXiv.
  We are very surprised that author discusses well known questions studied in
our experiment in details.
