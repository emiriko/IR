We study the effect of an internal rotor on the classical and quantum
intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution (IVR) dynamics of a model
system with three degrees of freedom. The system is based on a Hamiltonian
proposed by Martens and Reinhardt (J. Chem. Phys. {\bf 93}, 5621 (1990).) to
study IVR in the excited electronic state of para-fluorotoluene. We explicitly
construct the state space and show, confirming the mechanism proposed by
Martens and Reinhardt, that an excited high frequency mode relaxes via
diffusion along a thick layer of chaos created by the low frequency-rotor
interactions. However, the corresponding quantum dynamics exhibits no
appreciable relaxation of the high frequency mode. We attribute the quantum
suppression of the classical thick-layer diffusion to the rotor selection rules
and, possibly, dynamical localization effects.
