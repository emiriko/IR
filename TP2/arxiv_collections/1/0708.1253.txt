We consider several ways of how one could classify the various types of
soliton solutions related to nonlinear evolution equations which are solvable
by the inverse scattering method. In doing so we make use of the fundamental
analytic solutions, the dressing procedure, the reduction technique and other
tools characteristic for that method.
