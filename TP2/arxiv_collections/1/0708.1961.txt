We numerically study the jamming transition in particulate systems with
attraction by investigating their mechanical response at zero temperature. We
find three regimes of mechanical behavior separated by two critical
transitions--connectivity and rigidity percolation. The transitions belong to
different universality classes than their lattice counterparts, due to force
balance constraints. We also find that these transitions are unchanged at low
temperatures and resemble gelation transitions in experiments on colloidal and
silica gels.
