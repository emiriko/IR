Self-assembled arrays of atomic chains on Si(111) represent a fascinating
family of nanostructures with quasi-one-dimensional electronic properties.
These surface reconstructions are stabilized by a variety of adsorbates ranging
from alkali and alkaline earth metals to noble and rare earth metals. Combining
the complementary strength of dynamical low-energy electron diffraction,
scanning tunneling microscopy and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we
recently showed that besides monovalent and divalent adsorbates, trivalent
adsorbates are also able to stabilize silicon honeycomb chains. Consequently
silicon honeycomb chains emerge as a most stable, universal building block
shared by many atomic chain structures. We here present the systematics behind
the self-assembly mechanism of these chain systems and relate the valence state
of the adsorbate to the accessible symmetries of the chains.
