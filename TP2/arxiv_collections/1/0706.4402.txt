The low frequency sensitivity of space-borne gravitational wave observatories
will depend critically on the geodetic purity of the trajectories of orbiting
test masses. Fluctuations in the temperature difference across the enclosure
surrounding the free-falling test mass can produce noisy forces through several
processes, including the radiometric effect, radiation pressure, and
outgassing. We present here a detailed experimental investigation of thermal
gradient-induced forces for the LISA gravitational wave mission and the LISA
Pathfinder, employing high resolution torsion pendulum measurements of the
torque on a LISA-like test mass suspended inside a prototype of the LISA
gravitational reference sensor that will surround the test mass in orbit. The
measurement campaign, accompanied by numerical simulations of the radiometric
and radiation pressure effects, allows a more accurate and representative
characterization of thermal-gradient forces in the specific geometry and
environment relevant to LISA free-fall. The pressure dependence of the measured
torques allows clear identification of the radiometric effect, in quantitative
agreement with the model developed. In the limit of zero gas pressure, the
measurements are most likely dominated by outgassing, but at a low level that
does not threaten the LISA sensitivity goals.
