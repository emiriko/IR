The exponential increase in publication rate of new articles is limiting
access of researchers to relevant literature. This has prompted the use of text
mining tools to extract key biological information. Previous studies have
reported extensive modification of existing generic text processors to process
biological text. However, this requirement for modification had not been
examined. In this study, we have constructed Muscorian, using MontyLingua, a
generic text processor. It uses a two-layered generalization-specialization
paradigm previously proposed where text was generically processed to a suitable
intermediate format before domain-specific data extraction techniques are
applied at the specialization layer. Evaluation using a corpus and experts
indicated 86-90% precision and approximately 30% recall in extracting
protein-protein interactions, which was comparable to previous studies using
either specialized biological text processing tools or modified existing tools.
Our study had also demonstrated the flexibility of the two-layered
generalization-specialization paradigm by using the same generalization layer
for two specialized information extraction tasks.
