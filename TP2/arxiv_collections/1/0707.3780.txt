The results are reported of molecular dynamics simulations of the static
longitudinal dielectric and response functions for molten AgI at 923 K using
two ionic models. The first one is a rigid ion model, while in the second the
induced dipole moments of the anions are added to the effective pair potentials
of the first. It is derived theoretically that the dielectric functions for the
polarizable ion model are determined by spatial correlations of charge and
dipole moment densities. The charge structure factor at long wavelengths is
also studied.
