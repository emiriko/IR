We bridge the properties of the regular square and honeycomb Voronoi
tessellations of the plane to those of the Poisson-Voronoi case, thus analyzing
in a common framework symmetry-break processes and the approach to uniformly
random distributions of tessellation-generating points. We consider ensemble
simulations of tessellations generated by points whose regular positions are
perturbed through a Gaussian noise controlled by the parameter alpha. We study
the number of sides, the area, and the perimeter of the Voronoi cells. For
alpha>0, hexagons are the most common class of cells, and 2-parameter gamma
distributions describe well the statistics of the geometrical characteristics.
The symmetry break due to noise destroys the square tessellation, whereas the
honeycomb hexagonal tessellation is very stable and all Voronoi cells are
hexagon for small but finite noise with alpha<0.1. For a moderate amount of
Gaussian noise, memory of the specific unperturbed tessellation is lost,
because the statistics of the two perturbed tessellations is indistinguishable.
When alpha>2, results converge to those of Poisson-Voronoi tessellations. The
properties of n-sided cells change with alpha until the Poisson-Voronoi limit
is reached for alpha>2. The Desch law for perimeters is confirmed to be not
valid and a square root dependence on n is established. The ensemble mean of
the cells area and perimeter restricted to the hexagonal cells coincides with
the full ensemble mean; this might imply that the number of sides acts as a
thermodynamic state variable fluctuating about n=6; this reinforces the idea
that hexagons, beyond their ubiquitous numerical prominence, can be taken as
generic polygons in 2D Voronoi tessellations.
