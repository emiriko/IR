With the aid of the Keldysh technique we develop a microscopic theory of
non-local electron transport in three-terminal NSN structures consisting of a
chaotic superconducting quantum dot attached to one superconducting and two
normal electrodes. Our theory fully accounts for non-equilibrium effects and
disorder in a superconducting terminal. We go beyond perturbation theory in
tunneling and derive a general expression for the system conductance matrix
which remains valid in both weak and strong tunneling limits. We demonstrate
that the proximity effect yields a decrease of crossed Andreev reflection
(CAR). Beyond weak tunneling limit the contribution of CAR to the non-local
conductance does not cancel that of direct electron transfer between two normal
terminals. We argue that temperature dependence of the non-local resistance of
NSN devices is determined by the two competing processes -- Andreev reflection
and charge imbalance -- and it has a pronounced peak occurring at the crossover
between these two processes. This behavior is in a good agreement with recent
experimental observations.
