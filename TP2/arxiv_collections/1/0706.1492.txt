The influence of three well-known disaccharides, namely trehalose, maltose
and sucrose, on some structural and dynamical properties of lysozyme has been
investigated by means of molecular dynamics computer simulations in the 37-60
wt % concentration range. The effects of sugars on the protein conformation are
found relatively weak, in agreement with the preferential hydration of
lysozyme. Conversely, sugars seem to increase significantly the relaxation
times of the protein. These effects are shown to be correlated to the
fractional solvent accessibilities of lysozyme residues and further support the
slaving of protein dynamics. Moreover, a significant increase in the relaxation
times of lysozyme, sugars and water molecules is observed within the studied
concentration range and may result from the percolation of the hydrogen-bond
network of sugar molecules. This percolation appears to be of primary
importance to explain the influence of sugars on the dynamical properties of
lysozyme and water.
