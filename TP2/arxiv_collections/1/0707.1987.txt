A numerical technique is proposed for an efficient numerical determination of
the average phase factor of the fermionic determinant continued to imaginary
values of the chemical potential. The method is tested in QCD with eight
flavors of dynamical staggered fermions. A direct check of the validity of
analytic continuation is made on small lattices and a study of the scaling with
the lattice volume is performed.
