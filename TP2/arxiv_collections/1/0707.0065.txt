In this paper a new approach to obtain the interface propagation speed in
superconductors by means of a variationalme thod is introduced. The results of
the approach proposed coincide with the numerical simulations. The hyperbolic
differential equations are introduced as an extension of the modelin order to
take into account delay effects in the front propagation due to the pinning.
