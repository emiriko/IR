A simplified model of the bird skeleton along with elongation parameters for
the flight feathers is used to explore the diversity of bird shapes. Varying a
small number of parameters simulates a wide range of observed bird silhouettes.
The model may serve to examine developmental factors involved, help museum
curators develop computational approaches to bird morphometry and has
applications in computer generated illustration.
