Recent works have discussed the violation of factorization and universality
in hadronic hard scattering processes aimed at measurements of T-odd
distributions. We use simple arguments to show that it is possible to restore
an approximate factorization involving T-odd contributions if the factorization
breaking interactions present a frequency spectrum dominated by by a narrow and
regular peak whose maximum value corresponds to a respected factorization.
