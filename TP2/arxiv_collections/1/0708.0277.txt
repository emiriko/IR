Drastic change in dynamics and statistics in a chemical reaction system,
induced by smallness in the molecule number, is reported. Through stochastic
simulations for random catalytic reaction networks, transition to a novel state
is observed with the decrease in the total molecule number N, characterized by:
i) large fluctuations in chemical concentrations as a result of intermittent
switching over several states with extinction of some molecule species and ii)
strong deviation of time averaged distribution of chemical concentrations from
that expected in the continuum limit, i.e., $N \to \infty$. The origin of
transition is explained by the deficiency of molecule leading to termination of
some reactions. The critical number of molecules for the transition is obtained
as a function of the number of molecules species M and that of reaction paths
K, while total reaction rates, scaled properly, are shown to follow a universal
form as a function of NK/M.
