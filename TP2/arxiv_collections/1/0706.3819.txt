We investigate the Bose-Einstein condensation of fermionic pairs in a
two-dimensional uniform two-component Fermi superfluid obtaining an explicit
formula for the condensate density as a function of the chemical potential and
the energy gap. By using the mean-field extended BCS theory, we analyze, as a
function of the bound-state energy, the off-diagonal long-range order in the
crossover from the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) state of weakly-bound Cooper
pairs to the Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) of strongly-bound molecular dimers.
