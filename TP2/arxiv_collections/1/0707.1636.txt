We consider the gravastar model where the vacuum phase transition between the
de Sitter interior and the Schwarzschild or Schwarzschild-de Sitter exterior
geometries takes place at a single spherical delta-shell. We derive sharp
analytic bounds on the surface compactness (2m/r) that follow from the
requirement that the dominant energy condition (DEC) holds at the shell. In the
case of Schwarzschild exterior, the highest surface compactness is achieved
with the stiff shell in the limit of vanishing (dark) energy density in the
interior. In the case of Schwarzschild-de Sitter exterior, in addition to the
gravastar configurations with the shell under surface pressure, gravastar
configurations with vanishing shell pressure (dust shells), as well as
configurations with the shell under surface tension, are allowed by the DEC.
Respective bounds on the surface compactness are derived for all cases. We also
consider the speed of sound on the shell as derived from the requirement that
the shell is stable against the radial perturbations. The causality requirement
(sound speed not exceeding that of light) further restricts the space of
allowed gravastar configurations.
