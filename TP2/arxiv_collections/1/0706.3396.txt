We study geometries produced by brane intersections preserving eight
supercharges. Typical examples of such configurations are given by fundamental
strings ending on Dp branes and we construct gravity solutions describing such
intersections. The geometry is specified in terms of two functions obeying
coupled differential equations and the boundary conditions are determined by
distributions of D branes. We show that a consistency of type IIB supergravity
constrains the allowed positions of the branes. The shapes of branes derived
from gravity are found to be in a perfect agreement with profiles predicted by
the DBI analysis. We also discuss related 1/4-BPS systems in M theory.
