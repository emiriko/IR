We study the process e+e- -->nu nubar gamma to search for its sensitivity to
the extra gauge bosons Z_2, Z_3 and W_2 which are suggested by the little Higgs
models. We find that the ILC with sqrt(s)=0.5 TeV and CLIC with sqrt(s)=3 TeV
cover different regions of the LHM parameters. We show that this channel can
provide accurate determination of the parameters, complementary to measurements
of the extra gauge bosons at the coming LHC experiments.
