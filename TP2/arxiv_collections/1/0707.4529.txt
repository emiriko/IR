Topology of the spatial coherence function is considered in details. The
phase singularity (coherence vortices) structures of coherence function are
classified by Hopf index and Brouwer degree in topology. The coherence flux
quantization and the linking of the closed coherence vortices are also studied
from the topological properties of the spatial coherence function.
