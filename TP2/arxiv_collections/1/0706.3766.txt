We consider the photoproduction of two hadrons in polarized lepton-nucleon
collisions in the framework of perturbative QCD at the next-to-leading order
accuracy. After illustrating how to obtain the experimentally relevant
observables, a phenomenological study of the photoproduction of hadron pairs at
high transverse momenta is presented. We show theoretical predictions for the
relevant cross sections at COMPASS and HERMES kinematics as well as theoretical
uncertainties.
