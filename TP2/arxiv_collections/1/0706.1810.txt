A study of the set N_p of positive integers which occur as orders of
nonsingular derivations of finite-dimensional non-nilpotent Lie algebras of
characteristic p>0 was initiated by Shalev and continued by the present author.
The main goal of this paper is to show the abundance of elements of N_p. Our
main result shows that any divisor n of q-1, where q is a power of p, such that
$n\ge (p-1)^{1/p} (q-1)^{1-1/(2p)}$, belongs to N_p. This extends its special
case for p=2 which was proved in a previous paper by a different method.
