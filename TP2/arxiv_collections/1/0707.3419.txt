There are no upper limits on the possible number of massive, singlet
(right--handed) neutrinos that may participate in the seesaw mechanism, and
some string constructions motivate seesaw models with up to O(100)
right--handed neutrinos. In this case, the seesaw mass scale can be
significantly higher than that in the traditional scheme with just 3
right--handed neutrinos. We consider the possible phenomenological implications
of such models, in particular, for lepton-flavour violation and electric dipole
moments. Since the neutrino masses depend on the Majorana mass scale linearly,
while supersymmetric loop corrections depend on it logarithmically, the
magnitude of lepton-flavour- and CP-violating transitions may increase with the
multiplicity of the right--handed neutrinos and may be enhanced by orders of
magnitude. We also point out that, in the context of leptogensis, the bounds on
the reheating temperature and the lightest neutrino mass get relaxed compared
to those in the case of 3 right--handed neutrinos.
