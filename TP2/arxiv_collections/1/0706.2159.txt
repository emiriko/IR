We present a family of nonlocal games in which the inputs the players receive
are continuous. We study three representative members of the family. For the
first two a team sharing quantum correlations (entanglement) has an advantage
over any team restricted to classical correlations. We conjecture that this is
true for the third member of the family as well.
