Exploiting the similarity between adiabatic quantum algorithms and quantum
phase transitions, we argue that second-order transitions -- typically
associated with broken or restored symmetries -- should be advantageous in
comparison to first-order transitions. Guided by simple examples we construct
an alternative adiabatic algorithm for the NP-complete problem {\em Exact Cover
3}. We show numerically that its average performance (for the considered cases
up to ${\cal O}\{20\}$ qubits) is better than that of the conventional scheme.
The run-time of adiabatic algorithms is not just determined by the minimum
value of the fundamental energy gap (between the ground state and the exited
states), but also by its curvature at the critical point. The proposed
symmetry-restoring adiabatic quantum algorithm only contains contributions
linear and quadratic in the Pauli matrices and can be generalized to other
problem Hamiltonians which are decomposed of terms involving one and two
qubits. We show how the factoring problem can be cast into such a quadratic
form. These findings suggest that adiabatic quantum algorithms can solve a
large class of NP problems much faster than the Grover search routine (which
corresponds to a first-order transition and yields a quadratic enhancement
only).
