One of the keys to the high-temperature superconductivity puzzle is the
identification of the energy scales associated with the emergence of a coherent
condensate of superconducting electron pairs. These might provide a measure of
the pairing strength and of the coherence of the superfluid, and ultimately
reveal the nature of the elusive pairing mechanism in the superconducting
cuprates. To this end, a great deal of effort has been devoted to investigating
the connection between the superconducting transition temperature Tc and the
normal-state pseudogap crossover temperature T*. Here we present a review of a
large body of experimental data that suggests a coexisting two-gap scenario,
i.e. superconducting gap and pseudogap, over the whole superconducting dome.
