We have obtained a new limit on the electron neutrino effective charge radius
from a new evaluation of the weak mixing angle by a combined fit of all
electron-(anti)neutrino electron elastic scattering measurements. Weak mixing
angle is found to be sin^2 theta_W=0.259 \pm 0.025 in the low energy regime
below 100 MeV. The electron neutrino charge radius squared is bounded to be in
the range -0.13 10^-32 cm^2 < r^2 < 3.32 10^-32 cm^2 at 90 % C.L. Both results
improve previously published analyses. We also discuss perspectives of future
experiments to improve these constraints.
