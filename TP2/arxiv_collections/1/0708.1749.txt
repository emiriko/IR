Since the inception of the dynamical mean-field theory, numerous numerical
studies have relied on the Hirsch-Fye quantum Monte Carlo (HF-QMC) method for
solving the associated impurity problem. Recently developed continuous-time
algorithms (CT-QMC) avoid the Trotter discretization error and allow for faster
configuration updates, which makes them candidates for replacing HF-QMC. We
demonstrate, however, that a state-of-the-art implementation of HF-QMC (with
extrapolation of discretization delta_tau -> 0) is competitive with CT-QMC. A
quantitative analysis of Trotter errors in HF-QMC estimates and of appropriate
delta_tau values is included.
