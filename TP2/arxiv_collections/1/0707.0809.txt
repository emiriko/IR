Ab initio computed interaction forces are employed in order to describe the
microsolvation of the A$_2^+(^2\Sigma)$ (A=Li,Na,K) molecular ion in $^4$He
clusters of small variable size. The minimum energy structures are obtained by
performing energy minimization based on a genetic algorithm approach. The
symmetry features of the collocation of solvent adatoms around the dimeric
cation are analyzed in detail, showing that the selective growth of small
clusters around the two sides of the ion during the solvation process is a
feature common to all three dopants.
