Some tunneling phenomena are described, in the semiclassical approximation,
by unstable complex trajectories. We develop a systematic procedure to
stabilize the trajectories and to calculate the tunneling probability,
including both the suppression exponent and prefactor. We find that the
instability of tunneling solutions modifies the power-law dependence of the
prefactor on h as compared to the case of stable solutions.
