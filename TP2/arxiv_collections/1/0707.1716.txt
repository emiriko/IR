The vast use of computers on scientific numerical computation makes the
awareness of the limited precision that these machines are able to provide us
an essential matter. A limited and insufficient precision allied to the
truncation and rounding errors may induce the user to incorrect interpretation
of his/hers answer. In this work, we have developed a computational package to
minimize this kind of error by offering arbitrary precision numbers and
calculation. This is very important in Physics where we can work with numbers
too small and too big simultaneously.
