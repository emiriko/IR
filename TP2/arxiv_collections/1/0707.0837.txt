In this paper, we derive an explicit formula for constructing the confidence
interval of binomial parameter with guaranteed coverage probability. The
formula overcomes the limitation of normal approximation which is asymptotic in
nature and thus inevitably introduce unknown errors in applications. Moreover,
the formula is very tight in comparison with classic Clopper-Pearson's approach
from the perspective of interval width. Based on the rigorous formula, we also
obtain approximate formulas with excellent performance of coverage probability.
