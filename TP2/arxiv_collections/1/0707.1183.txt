The modified Chaplygin gas (MCG) is a strong candidate for the unified model
of dark matter and dark energy. The equation of state of this modified model is
valid from the radiation era to the $\Lambda$CDM model. In early epoch (when
$\rho$ was large), dark matter had the dominant role while at later stages
(when $\rho$ is small), the MCG model behaves as dark energy. In this work, we
have found exact solution of static spherically symmetric Einstein equations
describing a wormhole for an inhomogeneous distribution of modified Chaplygin
gas. For existence of wormhole solution, there are some restrictions relating
the parameters in the equation of state for MCG and the throat radius of the
wormhole. Physical properties and characteristics of these modified Chaplygin
wormholes are analyzed in details.
