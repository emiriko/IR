We present the first systematic calculations based on the angular-momentum
projection of cranked Slater determinants. We propose the Iy --> I scheme, by
which one projects the angular momentum I from the 1D cranked state constrained
to the average spin projection of <I_y>=I. Calculations performed for the
rotational band in 46Ti show that the AMP Iy --> I scheme offers a natural
mechanism for correcting the cranking moment of inertia at low-spins and
shifting the terminating state up by ~2 MeV, in accordance with data. We also
apply this scheme to high-spin states near the band termination in A~44 nuclei,
and compare results thereof with experimental data, shell-model calculations,
and results of the approximate analytical symmetry-restoration method proposed
previously.
