We have studied the magnetic configuration in ultrathin antiferromagnetic Mn
films grown around monoatomic steps on an Fe(001) surface by spin-polarized
scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy and ab-initio-parametrized
self-consistent real-space tight binding calculations in which the spin
quantization axis is independent for each site thus allowing noncollinear
magnetism. Mn grown on Fe(001) presents a layered antiferromagnetic structure.
In the regions where the Mn films overgrows Fe steps the magnetization of the
surface layer is reversed across the steps. Around these defects a frustration
of the antiferromagnetic order occurs. Due to the weakened magnetic coupling at
the central Mn layers, the amount of frustration is smaller than in Cr and the
width of the wall induced by the step does not change with the thickness, at
least for coverages up to seven monolayers.
