We present a detailed numerical simulation study of the effects caused by the
magnetodipolar interaction between ferromagnetic (FM) layers of a trilayer
magnetic nanoelement on its magnetization dynamics. As an example we use a
Co/Cu/Ni80Fe20 element with a square lateral shape where the magnetization of
FM layers forms a closed Landau-like domain pattern. First we show that when
the thickness of the non-magnetic (NM) spacer is in the technology relevant
region h ~ 10 nm, magnetodipolar interaction between 90o Neel domain walls in
FM layers qualitatively changes the equilibrium magnetization state of these
layers. In the main of the paper we compare the magnetization dynamics induced
by a sub-nsec field pulse in a single-layer Ni80Fe20 (Py) element and in the
Co/Cu/Py trilayer element. Here we show that (i) due to the spontaneous
symmetry breaking of the Landau state in the FM/NM/FM trilayer its domains and
domain walls oscillate with different frequencies and have different spatial
oscillation patterns; (ii) magnetization oscillations of the trilayer domains
are strongly suppressed due to different oscillation frequencies of domains in
Co and Py; (iii) magnetization dynamics qualitatively depends on the relative
rotation sense of magnetization states in Co and Py layers and on the
magnetocrystalline anisotropy kind of Co crystallites. Finally we discuss the
relation of our findings with experimental observations of magnetization
dynamics in magnetic trilayers, performed using the element-specific
time-resolved X-ray microscopy.
