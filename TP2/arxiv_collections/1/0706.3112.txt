We will present a new extension of the standard model of particle physics in
its almostcommutative formulation. This extension has as its basis the algebra
of the standard model with four summands [11], and enlarges only the particle
content by an arbitrary number of generations of left-right symmetric doublets
which couple vectorially to the U(1)_YxSU(2)_w subgroup of the standard model.
As in the model presented in [8], which introduced particles with a new colour,
grand unification is no longer required by the spectral action. The new model
may also possess a candidate for dark matter in the hundred TeV mass range with
neutrino-like cross section.
