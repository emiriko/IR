Cohesive laws are stress-strain curves used in finite element calculations to
describe the debonding of interfaces such as grain boundaries. It would be
convenient to describe grain boundary cohesive laws as a function of the
parameters needed to describe the grain boundary geometry; two parameters in 2D
and 5 parameters in 3D. However, we find that the cohesive law is not a smooth
function of these parameters. In fact, it is discontinuous at geometries for
which the two grains have repeat distances that are rational with respect to
one another. Using atomistic simulations, we extract grain boundary energies
and cohesive laws of grain boundary fracture in 2D with a Lennard-Jones
potential for all possible geometries which can be simulated within periodic
boundary conditions with a maximum box size. We introduce a model where grain
boundaries are represented as high symmetry boundaries decorated by extra
dislocations. Using it, we develop a functional form for the symmetric grain
boundary energies, which have cusps at all high symmetry angles. We also find
the asymptotic form of the fracture toughness near the discontinuities at high
symmetry grain boundaries using our dislocation decoration model.
