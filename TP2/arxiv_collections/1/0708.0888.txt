We show that Chan-Paton factors can be derived from a classical action
describing the dynamics of a new group-valued degree of freedom attached to the
boundary of an open bosonic string. We discuss the free and the interacting
string in the oriented and unoriented cases, as well as the coupling of the
string to an external Yang-Mills gauge field, and recover by this approach
well-known results.
