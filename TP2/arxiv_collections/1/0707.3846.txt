We describe a scheme, operating in a manner analogous to a reversed Raman
output coupler, for measuring the phase-sensitive quadrature statistics of an
atom laser beam. This scheme allows for the transferral of the atomic field
statistics to an optical field, for which the quantum statistics may then be
measured using the well-developed technology of optical homodyne measurement.
