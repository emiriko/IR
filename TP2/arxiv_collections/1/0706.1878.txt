This paper reports main results of the phase noise comparison that has been
performed between october 2005 and december 2006, using two oscillators at 5
and 100 MHz and un DRO at 3.5 GHz. The problem is not to compare the
performances of several oscillators, but to compare and to make an evaluation
of the uncertainties, and of course the resolution and the reproducibility of
the measurements. This comparison allow us to determine the ability to get
various systems traceable together in order to increase the trust that one can
have in phase noise measurements.
