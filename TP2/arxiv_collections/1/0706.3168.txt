We present our results on multiplicity and $p_T$ fluctuations at LHC energies
in the framework of the clustering of color sources. In this approach,
elementary color sources -strings- overlap forming clusters, so the number of
effective sources is modified. We find that the fluctuations are proportional
to the number of those clusters.
