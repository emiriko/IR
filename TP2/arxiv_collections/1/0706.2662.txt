The classical theory of ion beam sputtering predicts the instability of a
flat surface to uniform ion irradiation at any incidence angle. We relax the
assumption of the classical theory that the average surface erosion rate is
determined by a Gaussian response function representing the effect of the
collision cascade and consider the surface dynamics for other
physically-motivated response functions. We show that although instability of
flat surfaces at any beam angle results from all Gaussian and a wide class of
non-Gaussian erosive response functions, there exist classes of modifications
to the response that can have a dramatic effect. In contrast to the classical
theory, these types of response render the flat surface linearly stable, while
imperceptibly modifying the predicted sputter yield vs. incidence angle. We
discuss the possibility that such corrections underlie recent reports of a
``window of stability'' of ion-bombarded surfaces at a range of beam angles for
certain ion and surface types, and describe some characteristic aspects of
pattern evolution near the transition from unstable to stable dynamics. We
point out that careful analysis of the transition regime may provide valuable
tests for the consistency of any theory of pattern formation on ion sputtered
surfaces.
