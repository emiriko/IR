We present a simple measurement and analysis technique to determine the
fraction of optical loss due to both radiation (scattering) and linear
absorption in microphotonic components. The method is generally applicable to
optical materials in which both nonlinear and linear absorption are present,
and requires only limited knowledge of absolute optical power levels, material
parameters, and the structure geometry. The technique is applied to high
quality factor (Q=1-5 X 10^6) silicon-on-insulator microdisk resonators. It is
determined that linear absorption can account for more than half the total
optical loss in the high-Q regime of these devices.
