A search for superconductivity has been carried out on the hexagonal
polymorph of Laves-phase CaLi2, a compound for which Feng, Ashcroft, and
Hoffmann predict highly anomalous behavior under pressure. No superconductivity
is observed above 1.10 K at ambient pressure. However, high-pressure ac
susceptibility and electrical resistivity studies to 81 GPa reveal bulk
superconductivity in CaLi2 at temperatures as high as 13 K. The normal-state
resistivity shows a dramatic increase with pressure.
