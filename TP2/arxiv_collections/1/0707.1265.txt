Competition between interactions on different length scales leads to
self-organized textures in classical as well as quantum systems. This pattern
formation phenomenon has been invoked to explain some intriguing properties of
a large variety of strongly correlated electronic systems that includes for
example high temperature superconductors and colossal magnetoresistance
manganites. We classify the more common situations in which Coulomb frustrated
phase separation can occur and review their properties.
