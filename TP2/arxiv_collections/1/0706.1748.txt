In 1968, Sorin Comorosan first reported a phenomenon wherein irradiation of
the substrate of an enzyme reaction, in the crystalline state, for a specific
number of seconds could lead to an enhanced aqueous solution reaction rate for
the enzyme(up to 30%). Dependence on crystal irradiation time was found to be
oscillatory with a fixed period. The basis for this unusual phenomenon has
remained a mystery. Previously unreported experimental results are presented
which demonstrate, for the LDH / pyruvate reaction, that the identity of the
crystalline material irradiated is, largely, inconsequential. It is proposed
here that the irradiation procedure drives oscillatory reactions involving
atmospheric gases adsorbed on the crystals and that these photoproducts, or
related dark-reaction species, when dissolved, function as enzyme cofactors.
