The control of quantum dynamics via specially tailored laser pulses is a
long-standing goal in physics and chemistry. Partly, this dream has come true,
as sophisticated pulse shaping experiments allow to coherently control product
ratios of chemical reactions. The theoretical design of the laser pulse to
transfer an initial state to a given final state can be achieved with the help
of quantum optimal control theory (QOCT). This tutorial provides an
introduction to QOCT. It shows how the control equations defining such an
optimal pulse follow from the variation of a properly defined functional. We
explain the most successful schemes to solve these control equations and show
how to incorporate additional constraints in the pulse design. The algorithms
are then applied to simple quantum systems and the obtained pulses are
analyzed. Besides the traditional final-time control methods, the tutorial also
presents an algorithm and an example to handle time-dependent control targets.
