We report the first demonstration of a quantum game on an all-optical one-way
quantum computer. Following a recent theoretical proposal we implement a
quantum version of Prisoner's Dilemma, where the quantum circuit is realized by
a 4-qubit box-cluster configuration and the player's local strategies by
measurements performed on the physical qubits of the cluster. This
demonstration underlines the strength and versatility of the one-way model and
we expect that this will trigger further interest in designing quantum
protocols and algorithms to be tested in state-of-the-art cluster resources.
