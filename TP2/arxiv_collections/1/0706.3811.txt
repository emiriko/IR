We consider a D7-brane probe of $AdS_{5}\times S^5$ in the presence of pure
gauge $B$-field. The dual gauge theory is flavored Yang-Mills theory in
external magnetic field. We explore the dependence of the fermionic condensate
on the bare quark mass $m_{q}$ and study the discrete self-similar behavior of
the theory near the origin of the parametric space. We calculate the critical
exponents of the bare quark mass and the fermionic condensate. A study of the
meson spectrum supports the expectation based on thermodynamic considerations
that at zero bare quark mass the stable phase of the theory is a chiral
symmetry breaking one. Our study reveals the self-similar structure of the
spectrum near the critical phase of the theory, characterized by zero fermionic
condensate and we calculate the corresponding critical exponent of the meson
spectrum.
