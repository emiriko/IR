We report on the demonstration of broadband squeezed laser beams that show a
frequency dependent orientation of the squeezing ellipse. Carrier frequency as
well as quadrature angle were stably locked to a reference laser beam at
1064nm. This frequency dependent squeezing was characterized in terms of noise
power spectra and contour plots of Wigner functions. The later were measured by
quantum state tomography. Our tomograph allowed a stable lock to a local
oscillator beam for arbitrary quadrature angles with one degree precision.
Frequency dependent orientations of the squeezing ellipse are necessary for
squeezed states of light to provide a broadband sensitivity improvement in
third generation gravitational wave interferometers. We consider the
application of our system to long baseline interferometers such as a future
squeezed light upgraded GEO600 detector.
