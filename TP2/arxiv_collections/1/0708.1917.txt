This article surveys some of the highlights in the development of string
theory through the first superstring revolution in 1984. The emphasis is on
topics in which the author was involved, especially the observation that
critical string theories provide consistent quantum theories of gravity and the
proposal to use string theory to construct a unified theory of all fundamental
particles and forces.
