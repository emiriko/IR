Metabolism of arachidonic acid by cyclooxygenase is one of the primary
sources of reactive oxygen species in the ischemic brain. Neuronal
overexpression of cyclooxygenase-2 has recently been shown to contribute to
neurodegeneration following ischemic injury. In the present study, we examined
the possibility that the neuroprotective effects of the cyclooxygenase-2
inhibitor nimesulide would depend upon reduction of oxidative stress following
cerebral ischemia. Gerbils were subjected to 5 min of transient global cerebral
ischemia followed by 48 h of reperfusion and markers of oxidative stress were
measured in hippocampus of gerbils receiving vehicle or nimesulide treatment at
three different clinically relevant doses (3, 6 or 12 mg/kg). Compared with
vehicle, nimesulide significantly (P<0.05) reduced hippocampal glutathione
depletion and lipid peroxidation, as assessed by the levels of malondialdehyde
(MDA), 4-hydroxy-alkenals (4-HDA) and lipid hydroperoxides levels, even when
the treatment was delayed until 6 h after ischemia. Biochemical evidences of
nimesulide neuroprotection were supported by histofluorescence findings using
the novel marker of neuronal degeneration Fluoro-Jade B. Few Fluoro-Jade B
positive cells were seen in CA1 region of hippocampus in ischemic animals
treated with nimesulide compared with vehicle. These results suggest that
nimesulide may protect neurons by attenuating oxidative stress and reperfusion
injury following the ischemic insult with a wide therapeutic window of
protection.
