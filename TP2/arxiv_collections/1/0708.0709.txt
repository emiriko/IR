We derive a bound for the security of QKD with finite resources under one-way
post-processing, based on a definition of security that is composable and has
an operational meaning. While our proof relies on the assumption of collective
attacks, unconditional security follows immediately for standard protocols like
Bennett-Brassard 1984 and six-states. For single-qubit implementations of such
protocols, we find that the secret key rate becomes positive when at least
N\sim 10^5 signals are exchanged and processed. For any other discrete-variable
protocol, unconditional security can be obtained using the exponential de
Finetti theorem, but the additional overhead leads to very pessimistic
estimates.
