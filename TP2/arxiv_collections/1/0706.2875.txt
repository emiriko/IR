We are commenting on an earlier hypothesis of polaron states bound to F
centers in alkali halides. These states increasing the effective size of the
color centers, they play an active role in concentration-dependent phenomena,
such as the observed quenching of F center luminescence. Our record shows only
one related study on NaBr and NaI which has also been aimed at checking the
bound polaron hypothesis. Further studies of the concentration quenching in
other alkali halide hosts whould eventually shine more light on the problem.
