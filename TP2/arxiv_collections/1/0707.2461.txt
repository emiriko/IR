Starting from considerations of Bosons at the real life Compton scale we go
on to a description of Fermions, specifically the Dirac equation in terms of an
underlying noncommutative geometry described by the Dirac $\gamma$ matrices and
generalize this to branes in an underlying C-space (with Clifford Algebra).
