We present an alternative frequencists' proof of the quantum probability rule
which does not make use of the frequency operator, with expectation that this
can circumvent the recent criticism against the previous proofs which use it.
We also argue that avoiding the frequency operator is not only for technical
merits for doing so but is closely related to what quantum mechanics is all
about from the viewpoint of many-world interpretation.
