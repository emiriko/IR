We use both Quantum Hall and Shubnikov de Haas experiments at high magnetic
field and low temperature to analyse broadening processes of Landau levels in a
delta-doped 2D quantum well superlattice and a 1D quantum wire superlattice
generated from the first one by controlled dislocation slips. We deduce first
the origin of the broadening from the damping factor in the Shubnikov de Haas
curves in various configurations of the magnetic field and the measured current
for both kinds of superlattice. Then, we write a general formula for the
resistivity in the Quantum Hall effect introducing a dephasing factor we link
to the process of localization.
