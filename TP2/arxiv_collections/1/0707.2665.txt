The Hamiltonian formulation of superfluids based on noncanonical Poisson
brackets is studied in detail. The assumption that the momentum density is
proportional to the flow of the conserved energy is shown to lead to the
covariant relativistic theory previously suggested by Khalatnikov, Lebedev and
Carter, and some potentials in this theory are given explicitly. We discuss
hydrodynamic fluctuations in the presence of dissipative effects and we derive
the corresponding set of hydrodynamic correlation functions. Kubo relations for
the transport coefficients are obtained.
