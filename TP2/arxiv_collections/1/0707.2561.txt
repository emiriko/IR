The c(6x2) is a reconstruction of the SrTiO3(001) surface that is formed
between 1050-1100oC in oxidizing annealing conditions. This work proposes a
model for the atomic structure for the c(6x2) obtained through a combination of
results from transmission electron diffraction, surface x-ray diffraction,
direct methods analysis, computational combinational screening, and density
functional theory. As it is formed at high temperatures, the surface is complex
and can be described as a short-range ordered phase featuring microscopic
domains composed of four main structural motifs. Additionally, non-periodic
TiO2 units are present on the surface. Simulated scanning tunneling microscopy
images based on the electronic structure calculations are consistent with
experimental images.
