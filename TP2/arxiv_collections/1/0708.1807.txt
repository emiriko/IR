We study the ground state phase diagram of the hard-core extended boson
Hubbard model on the square lattice with both nearest- (nn) and
next-nearest-neighbor (nnn) hopping and repulsion, using Gutzwiller mean field
theory and quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We observe the formation of
supersolid states with checkerboard, striped, and quarter-filled crystal
structures, when the system is doped away from commensurate fillings. In the
striped supersolid phase, a strong anisotropy in the superfluid density is
obtained from the simulations; however, the transverse component remains
finite, indicating a true two-dimensional superflow. We find that upon doping,
the striped supersolid transitions directly into the supersolid with
quarter-filled crystal structure, via a first-order stripe melting transition.
