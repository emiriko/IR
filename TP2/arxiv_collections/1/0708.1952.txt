Kinematical and dynamical mechanisms leading to the spontaneous breaking of
space-time symmetries are described. The symmetries affected are space and time
translations, space rotations, scale and conformal transformations.
Applications are made to solidification, string theory compactifications, the
analysis of stable theories with no ground states, supersymmetry breaking and
the determination of the value of the vacuum energy.
