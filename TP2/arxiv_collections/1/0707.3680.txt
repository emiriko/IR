Population of a phononic mode coupled to a single-electron transistor in the
sequential tunneling regime is discussed for the experimentally realistic case
of intermediate electron-phonon coupling. Features like a sub-Poissonian
bosonic distribution are found in regimes where electron transport drives the
oscillator strongly out of equilibrium with only few phonon states selectively
populated. The electron Fano factor is compared to fluctuations in the phonon
distribution, showing that all possible combinations of sub- and
super-Poissonian character can be realized.
