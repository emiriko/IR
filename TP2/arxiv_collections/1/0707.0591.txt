We study possible influence of not necessarily sincere arbiter on the course
of classical and quantum 2x2 games and we show that this influence in the
quantum case is much bigger than in the classical case. Extreme sensitivity of
quantum games on initial states of quantum objects used as carriers of
information in a game shows that a quantum game, contrary to a classical game,
is not defined by a payoff matrix alone but also by an initial state of objects
used to play a game. Therefore, two quantum games that have the same payoff
matrices but begin with different initial states should be considered as
different games.
