A model-independent search for deviations from the Standard Model prediction
is performed in $e^+ p$ and $e^- p$ collisions at HERA II using all high energy
data recorded by the H1 experiment. This corresponds to a total integrated
luminosity of 337 pb$^{-1}$. All event topologies involving isolated electrons,
photons, muons, neutrinos and jets with high transverse momenta are
investigated in a single analysis. Events are assigned to exclusive classes
according to their final state. A statistical algorithm is used to search for
deviations from the Standard Model in distributions of the scalar sum of
transverse momenta or invariant mass of final state particles and to quantify
their significance. A good agreement with the Standard Model prediction is
observed in most of the event classes. The most siginificant deviation is found
in the \mujnp channel in $e^+p$ collisions.
