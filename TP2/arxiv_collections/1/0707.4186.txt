We extend the use of derivative dispersion relations to the study of slopes
of the real and imaginary amplitudes in pp and p-pbar elastic scattering. The
new relations are tested against the solutions for the amplitudes obtained in
the analysis of the high energy data. Extensions beyond the forward direction
are investigated.
