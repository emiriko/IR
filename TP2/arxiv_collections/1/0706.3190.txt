A generalised Wulf-Kaishew theorem is given describing the equilibrium shape
(ES) of an isolated 3D crystal A deposited coherently onto a lattice mismatched
planar substrate. For this purpose a free polyhedral crystal is formed then
homogeneously strained to be accommodated onto the lattice mismatched
substrate. During its elastic inhomogeneous relaxation the epitaxial contact
remains coherent so that the 3D crystal drags the atoms of the contact area and
produces a strain field in the substrate. The ES of the deposit is obtained by
minimising at constant volume the total energy (bulk and surface energies)
taking into account the bulk elastic relaxation. Our main results are: (1)
Epitaxial strain acts against wetting (adhesion) so that globally it leads to a
thickening of the ES. (2) Owing to strain the ES changes with size. More
precisely the various facets extension changes, some facets decreasing, some
others increasing. (3) Each dislocation entrance, necessary for relaxing
plastically too large crystals abruptly modifies the ES and thus the different
facets extension in a jerky way. (4) In all cases the usual self-similarity
with size is lost when misfit is considered. We illustrate these points in case
of box shaped and truncated pyramidal crystals. Some experimental evidences are
discussed.
