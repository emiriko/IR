The spectral correlation of a chaotic system with spin 1/2 is universally
described by the GSE (Gaussian Symplectic Ensemble) of random matrices in the
semiclassical limit. In semiclassical theory, the spectral form factor is
expressed in terms of the periodic orbits and the spin state is simulated by
the uniform distribution on a sphere. In this paper, instead of the uniform
distribution, we introduce Brownian motion on a sphere to yield the parametric
motion of the energy levels. As a result, the small time expansion of the form
factor is obtained and found to be in agreement with the prediction of
parametric random matrices in the transition within the GSE universality class.
Moreover, by starting the Brownian motion from a point distribution on the
sphere, we gradually increase the effect of the spin and calculate the form
factor describing the transition from the GOE (Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble)
class to the GSE class.
