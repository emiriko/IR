We prove regularity properties of the self-energy, to all orders in
perturbation theory, for systems with singular Fermi surfaces which contain Van
Hove points where the gradient of the dispersion relation vanishes. In this
paper, we show for spatial dimensions $d \ge 3$ that despite the Van Hove
singularity, the overlapping loop bounds we proved together with E. Trubowitz
for regular non--nested Fermi surfaces [J. Stat. Phys. 84 (1996) 1209] still
hold, provided that the Fermi surface satisfies a no-nesting condition. This
implies that for a fixed interacting Fermi surface, the self-energy is a
continuously differentiable function of frequency and momentum, so that the
quasiparticle weight and the Fermi velocity remain close to their values in the
noninteracting system to all orders in perturbation theory. In a companion
paper, we treat the more singular two-dimensional case.
