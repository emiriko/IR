E. Coli. dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) undergoes conformational transitions
between the closed (CS) and occluded (OS) states which, respectively, describe
whether the active site is closed or occluded by the Met20 loop. A
sequence-based approach is used to identify a network of residues that
represents the allostery wiring diagram. We also use a self-organized polymer
model to monitor the kinetics of the CS->OS and the reverse transitions. a
sliding motion of Met20 loop is observed. The residues that facilitate the
Met20 loop motion are part of the network of residues that transmit allosteric
signals during the CS->OS transition.
