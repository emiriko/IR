Relational particle dynamics include the dynamics of pure shape and cases in
which absolute scale or absolute rotation are additionally meaningful. These
are interesting as regards the absolute versus relative motion debate as well
as discussion of conceptual issues connected with the problem of time in
quantum gravity. In spatial dimension 1 and 2 the relative configuration spaces
of shapes are n-spheres and complex projective spaces, from which knowledge I
construct natural mechanics on these spaces. I also show that these coincide
with Barbour's indirectly-constructed relational dynamics by performing a full
reduction on the latter. Then the identification of the configuration spaces as
n-spheres and complex projective spaces, for which spaces much mathematics is
available, significantly advances the understanding of Barbour's relational
theory in spatial dimensions 1 and 2. I also provide the parallel study of a
new theory for which positon and scale are purely relative but orientation is
absolute. The configuration space for this is an n-sphere regardless of the
spatial dimension, which renders this theory a more tractable arena for
investigation of implications of scale invariance than Barbour's theory itself.
