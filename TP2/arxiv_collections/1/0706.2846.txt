We update our recent calculation of quarkonium Euclidean correlators at
finite temperatures in a potential model by including the effect of zero modes
in the lattice spectral functions. These contributions cure most of the
previously observed discrepancies with lattice calculations, supporting the use
of potential models at finite temperature as an important tool to complement
lattice studies.
