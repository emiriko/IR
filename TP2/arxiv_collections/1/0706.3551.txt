Since the dawn of the new millennium, there has been a revived interest in
the concept of extra dimensions.In this scenario all the standard model matter
and gauge fields are confined to the 4 dimensions and only gravity can escape
to higher dimensions of the universe.This idea can be tested using table-top
experiments, collider experiments, astrophysical or cosmological observations.
The main astrophysical constraints come from the cooling rate of supernovae,
neutron stars, red giants and the sun. In this article, we consider the energy
loss mechanism of SN1987A and study the constraints it places on the number and
size of extra dimensions and the higher dimensional Planck scale.
