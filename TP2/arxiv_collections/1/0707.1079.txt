We study the Hawking radiation as charged particles' tunneling across the
horizons of the Hot-NUT-Kerr-Newman-Kasuya spacetime by considering the
spacetime background as dynamical and incorporating the self-gravitation effect
of the emitted particles when the energy conservation, the angular momentum
conservation, and the electric charge conservation are taken into account. Our
result shows that the tunneling rate is related to the change of
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy and the radiant spectrum is not pure thermal, but is
consistent with an underlying unitary theory. The emission process is a
reversible one, and the information is preserved as a natural result of the
first law of black hole thermodynamics.
