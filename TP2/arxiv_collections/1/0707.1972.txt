The extremal and partly marginally trapped surfaces in Minkowski 4-space,
which are invariant under the group of boost isometries, are classified.
Moreover, it is shown that there do not exist extremal surfaces of this kind
with constant Gaussian curvature. A procedure is given in order to construct a
partly marginally trapped surface by gluing two marginally trapped surfaces
which are invariant under the group of boost isometries. As an application, a
proper star-surface is constructed.
