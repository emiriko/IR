The $sp(8, R)$ invariant formulation of free field equations of massless
fields of all spins in $AdS_4$ available previously in terms of gauge invariant
field strengths is extended to gauge potentials. As a by-product, free field
equations for a massless gauge field are shown to possess both $su(2,2)\sim
o(4,2)$ and $sl(4,R)\sim o(3,3)$ symmetry. The proposed formulation is
well-defined in the $AdS_4$ background but experiences certain degeneracy in
the flat limit that does not allow conformal invariant field equations for spin
$s>1$ gauge fields in Minkowski space. The basis model involves the doubled set
of fields of all spins. It is manifestly invariant under U(1) electric-magnetic
duality extended to higher spins. Reduction to a single massless field contains
the equations that relate its electric and magnetic potentials which are mixed
by the conformal transformations for s>1. We use the unfolded formulation
approach recalled in the paper with some emphasis on the role of
Chevalley-Eilenberg cohomology of a Lie algebra $g$ in $g$-invariant field
equations. This method makes it easy to guess a form of the 4d $sp(8, R)$
invariant massless field equations and then to extend them to the ten
dimensional $sp(8,R)$ invariant space-time. Dynamical content of the field
equations is analyzed in terms of $\sigma_-$ cohomology.
