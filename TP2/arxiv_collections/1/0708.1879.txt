A random access memory (RAM) uses n bits to randomly address N=2^n distinct
memory cells. A quantum random access memory (qRAM) uses n qubits to address
any quantum superposition of N memory cells. We present an architecture that
exponentially reduces the requirements for a memory call: O(log N) switches
need be thrown instead of the N used in conventional (classical or quantum) RAM
designs. This yields a more robust qRAM algorithm, as it in general requires
entanglement among exponentially less gates, and leads to an exponential
decrease in the power needed for addressing. A quantum optical implementation
is presented.
