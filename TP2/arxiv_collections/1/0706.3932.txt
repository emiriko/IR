Using a generalized procedure for obtaining the equation of motion of a
propagating fermionic particle, we examine previous claims for a lightlike
preferred axis embedded in the framework of Lorentz-invariance violation with
preserved algebra. In a high energy scale, the corresponding equation of motion
is reduced to a conserving lepton number chiral (VSR) equation, and in a low
energy scale, the Dirac equation for a free is recovered. The new dynamics
introduces some novel ingredients (modified cross section) to the phenomenology
of the tritium beta decay end-point.
