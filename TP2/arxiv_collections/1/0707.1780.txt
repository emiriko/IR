We present a classification of three-qubit states based in their three-qubit
and reduced two-qubit entanglements. For pure states these criteria can be
easily implemented, and the different types can be related with sets of
equivalence classes under Local Unitary operations. For mixed states
characterization of full tripartite entanglement is not yet solved in general;
some partial results will be presented here.
