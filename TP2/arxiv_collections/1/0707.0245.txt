We demonstrate that two key theoretical objects used widely in Computational
Neuroscience, the phase-resetting curve (PRC) from dynamics and the spike
triggered average (STA) from statistical analysis, are closely related under a
wide range of stimulus conditions. We prove that the STA is proportional to the
derivative of the PRC. We compare these analytic results to numerical
calculations for the Hodgkin-Huxley neuron and we apply the method to neurons
in the olfactory bulb of mice. This observation allows us to relate the
stimulus-response properties of a neuron to its dynamics, bridging the gap
between dynamical and information theoretic approaches to understanding brain
computations and facilitating the interpretation of changes in channels and
other cellular properties as influencing the representation of stimuli.
