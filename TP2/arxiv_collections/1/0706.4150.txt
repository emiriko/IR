Within the context of superconducting gap engineering, Al-\alox-Al tunnel
junctions have been used to study the variation in superconducting gap,
$\Delta$, with film thickness. Films of thickness 5, 7, 10 and 30 nm were used
to form the small area superconductor-insulator-superconductor (SIS) tunnel
junctions. In agreement with previous measurements we have observed an increase
in the superconducting energy gap of aluminium with a decrease in film
thickness. In addition, we find grain size in small area films with thickness
\textbf{$\geq$} 10 nm has no appreciable effect on energy gap. Finally, we
utilize 7 and 30 nm films in a single Cooper-pair transistor, and observe the
modification of the finite bias transport processes due to the engineered gap
profile.
