We demonstrate the existence of entanglement sudden death (ESD), the complete
loss of entanglement in finite time, in qubit-qutrit systems. In particular,
ESD is shown to occur in such systems initially prepared in a one-parameter
class of entangled mixed states and then subjected to local dephasing noise.
Together with previous results, this proves the existence of ESD for some
states in all quantum systems for which rigorously defined mixed-state
entanglement measures have been identified. We conjecture that ESD exists in
all quantum systems prepared in appropriate bipartite states.
