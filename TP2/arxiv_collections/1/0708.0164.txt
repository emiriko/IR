The understanding of the nanoscale physical properties of biomolecules and
biomaterials will ultimately promote the research in the biological sciences.
In this review, we focused on theory, simulation, and experiments involving
nanoscale materials inspired by biological systems. Specifically, self-assembly
in living and synthetic materials, bio-functionalized nanomaterials and probing
techniques that use nanomaterials are discussed.
