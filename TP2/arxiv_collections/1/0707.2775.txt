We show that two stationary, asymptotically flat vacuum black holes in 5
dimensions with two commuting axial symmetries are identical if and only if
their masses, angular momenta, and their ``rod structures'' coincide. We also
show that the horizon must be topologically either a 3-sphere, a ring, or a
Lens-space. Our argument is a generalization of constructions of Morisawa and
Ida (based in turn on key work of Maison) who considered the spherical case,
combined with basic arguments concerning the nature of the factor manifold of
symmetry orbits.
