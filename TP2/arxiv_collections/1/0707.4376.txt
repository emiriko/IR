Using the method of adiabatic invariants and the Born-Oppenheimer
approximation, we have successfully got the excited-state wave functions for a
pair of coupled oscillators in the so-called \textit{semiquantum chaos}. Some
interesting characteristics in the \textit{Fourier spectra} of the wave
functions and its \textit{Correlation Functions} in the regular and chaos
states have been found, which offers a new way to distinguish the regular and
chaotic states in quantum system.
