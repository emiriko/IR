We present the results of a search for new particles that lead to a \Z boson
plus jets in $p\bar{p}$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=1.96$ TeV using the Collider
Detector at Fermilab (CDF II). A data sample with a luminosity of 1.06 \ifb\
collected using \Z boson decays to $ee$ and $\mu\mu$ is used. We describe a
completely data-based method to predict the dominant background from
standard-model \Z+jet events. This method can be similarly applied to other
analyses requiring background predictions in multi-jet environments, as shown
when validating the method by predicting the background from $W$+jets in \ttbar
production. No significant excess above the background prediction is observed,
and a limit is set using a fourth generation quark model to quantify the
acceptance. Assuming $BR(b' \to b\Z) = 100%$ and using a leading-order
calculation of the $b'$ cross section, $b'$ quark masses below 268 $\gev/c^2$
are excluded at 95% confidence level.
