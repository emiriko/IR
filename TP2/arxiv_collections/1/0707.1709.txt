An overview of W and Z production in high energy hadron collisions is given.
W and Z cross section and asymmetry measurements from CDF and DO are described,
with particular emphasis on recent results. The current status of precision W
mass and width measurements is reported. The fundamental physics parameters
that can be extracted from these measurements are described, and the relevance
of W and Z production studies for the LHC is pointed out.
