Epitaxial La2NiMnO6 thin films have been grown on (001)-oriented SrTiO3 using
the PLD technique. The thin films are semiconducting and FM with a TC close to
270K, a coercive field of 920Oe, and a saturation magnetization of 5muB per
f.u. TEM, conducted at RT, reveals a majority phase having "I-centered"
structure with a=c=1.4asub and b=2asub along with a minority phase-domains
having "P-type" structure (asub being the lattice parameter of the perovskite
structure). A discusion on the presence of Ni/Mn long-range ordering, in light
of recent literature on double perovskites La2NiMnO6 is presented.
