In this paper we consider a phase space path integral for general
time-dependent quantum operations, not necessarily unitary. We obtain the path
integral for a completely positive quantum operation satisfied Lindblad
equation (quantum Markovian master equation). We consider the path integral for
quantum operation with a simple infinitesimal generator.
