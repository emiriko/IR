We obtain analytic formulae for the spacing between conductance peaks in the
Coulomb blockade regime, based on the universal Hamiltonian model of quantum
dots. New random matrix theory results are developed in order to treat
correlations between two and three consecutive spacings in the energy level
spectrum. These are generalizations of the Wigner surmise for the probability
distribution of single level spacing. The analytic formulae are shown to be in
good agreement with numerical evaluation.
