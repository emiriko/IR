Martin has proposed a scenario dubbed ``compressed supersymmetry'' (SUSY)
where the MSSM is the effective field theory between energy scales M_{\rm weak}
and M_{\rm GUT}, but with the GUT scale SU(3) gaugino mass M_3<< M_1 or M_2. As
a result, squark and gluino masses are suppressed relative to slepton, chargino
and neutralino masses, leading to a compressed sparticle mass spectrum, and
where the dark matter relic density in the early universe may be dominantly
governed by neutralino annihilation into ttbar pairs via exchange of a light
top squark. We explore the dark matter and collider signals expected from
compressed SUSY for two distinct model lines with differing assumptions about
GUT scale gaugino mass parameters. For dark matter signals, the compressed
squark spectrum leads to an enhancement in direct detection rates compared to
models with unified gaugino masses. Meanwhile, neutralino halo annihilation
rates to gamma rays and anti-matter are also enhanced relative to related
scenarios with unified gaugino masses but, depending on the halo dark matter
distribution, may yet be below the sensitivity of indirect searches underway.
In the case of collider signals, we compare the rates for the potentially
dominant decay modes of the stop_1 which may be expected to be produced in
cascade decay chains at the LHC: \tst_1\to c\tz_1 and \tst_1\to bW\tz_1. We
examine the extent to which multilepton signal rates are reduced when the
two-body decay mode dominates. For the model lines that we examine here, the
multi-lepton signals, though reduced, still remain observable at the LHC.
