The studies of influence of spin on a photon motion in a Schwartzschild
spacetime is continued. In the previous paper [2] the first order correction to
the geodesic motion is reduced to a non-uniform linear ordinary differential
equation and the equation obtained has been solved by the standard method of
integration of the Green function. If each photon draws a world line specified
by this solution then light rays from infinitely distant source form a caustic
which does not appear without the spin-gravity interaction. The goal of the
present work is to obtain explicit form of caustic.
