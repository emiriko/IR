We study the disentanglement of two spin qubits which interact with a general
XY spin-chain environment. The dynamical process of the disentanglement is
numerically and analytically investigated in the vicinity of quantum phase
transition (QPT) of the spin chain in both weak and strong coupling cases. We
find that the disentanglement of the two qubits is in general enhanced greatly
when the environmental spin chain is exposed to QPT. We give a detailed
analysis to facilitate the understanding of the QPT-enhanced decaying behavior
of the disentanglement factor. Furthermore, the scaling behavior in the
disentanglement dynamics is also revealed and analyzed.
