We show that Berry's geometrical (topological) phase for circular quantum
dots with an odd number of electrons is equal to \pi and that eigenvalues of
the orbital angular momentum run over half-integer values. The non-zero value
of the Berry's phase is provided by axial symmetry and two-dimensionality of
the system. Its particular value (\pi) is fixed by the Pauli exclusion
principle. Our conclusions agree with the experimental results of T. Schmidt
{\it at el}, \PR B {\bf 51}, 5570 (1995), which can be considered as the first
experimental evidence for the existence of a new realization of Berry's phase
and half-integer values of the orbital angular momentum in a system of an odd
number of electrons in circular quantum dots.
