We analyze the zero temperature conductance of a parallel T-shaped double
quantum dot system. We present an analytical expression for the conductance of
the system in terms of the total number of electrons in both quantum dots. Our
results confirm that the system's conductance is strongly influenced by the dot
which is not directly connected to the leads. We discuss our results in
connection with similar results reported in the literature.
