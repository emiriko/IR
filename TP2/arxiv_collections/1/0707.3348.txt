Recent NMR experiments by Singer et al. [Singer et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 95,
236403 (2005).] showed a deviation from Fermi-liquid behavior in carbon
nanotubes with an energy gap evident at low temperatures. Here, a comprehensive
theory for the magnetic field and temperature dependent NMR 13C spin-lattice
relaxation is given in the framework of the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid. The low
temperature properties are governed by a gapped relaxation due to a spin gap (~
30K), which crosses over smoothly to the Luttinger liquid behaviour with
increasing temperature.
