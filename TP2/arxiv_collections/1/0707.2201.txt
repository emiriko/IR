The effect of spin filtering and spin mixing on the dc electric current for
voltage biased magnetic quantum point contact with superconducting leads is
theoretically studied. The I-V characteristics are calculated for the whole
range of spin filtering and spin mixing parameters. It is found that with
increasing of spin filtering the subharmonic step structure of the dc electric
current, typical for low-transparency junction and junction without
considerable spin filtering qualitatively changes. In the lower voltage region
and for small enough spin mixing the peak structure arises. When spin mixing
increases the peak subgap structure evolves to the step structure. The voltages
where subharmonic gap features are located are found to be sensitive to the
value of spin filtering. The positions of peaks and steps are calculated
analytically and the evolution of the subgap structure from well-known tunnel
limit to the large spin filtering case is explained in terms of multiple
Andreev reflection (MAR) processes. In particular, it is found that for large
spin filtering the subgap feature at $eV_k$ arises from $2k^{\rm th}$ and
$(2k\pm 1)^{\rm th}$ order MAR processes, while in the tunnel limit the step at
$eV_n$ is known to result from $n^{\rm th}$ order MAR process.
