We define a wall-crossing morphism for Khovanov-Rozansky homology; that is, a
map between the KR homology of knots related by a crossing change. Using this
map, we extend KR homology to an invariant of singular knots categorifying the
Vasilliev derivative of the HOMFLY polynomial, and of $\mathfrak{sl}_n$ quantum
invariants.
