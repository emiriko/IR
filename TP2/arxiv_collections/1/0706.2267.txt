The D0 and CDF experiments have been taking data at the Run 2 of the Tevatron
Collider since 2001. We present a selection of recent results, most of them
obtained with an integrated luminosity of $\simeq$ 1 fb$^{-1}$. I will describe
the most important facets of the physics programme and detail some results.
Recent direct limits on standard model Higgs obtained at the Tevatron, and
their their prospects will be also reviewed.
