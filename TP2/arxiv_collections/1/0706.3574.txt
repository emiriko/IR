We proposed the modified version of quantum-mechanical theory of continuous
measurements for the case of classical open systems. In our approach the
influence of measurement on evolution of distribution function of an open
system is described by the Fokker-Planck equation of a special form. The
diffusion tensor of this equation is uniquely defined by a type of the measured
quantity. On the basis of the approach proposed the stationary states of the
linear dissipative systems, induced by measurements in them, are considered.
Also we demonstrate on the simple example, how in the conservative system,
consisting of noninteracting parts, measurement of the integral of motion
results in relaxation to the quasi-thermodynamic equilibrium between parts of
the system. The "temperature" of such state is determined by energy of the
system and by the mean value of measured integral of motion. PACS numbers:
