Three-dimensional isospectral systems are constructed using the framework of
supersymmetric quantum mechanics. In case the supercharge of first order in
momentum is used, it is proved that the constructed systems reduce to a trivial
generalization of one-dimensional systems. In case the second order supercharge
is used, nontrivial three-dimensional isospectral systems are constructed.
