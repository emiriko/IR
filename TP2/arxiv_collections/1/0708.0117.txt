The resistance noise in a Bi_2Sr_2CaCu_2O$_{8+\delta}$ thin film is found to
increase strongly in the underdoped regime. While the increase of the raw
resistance noise with decreasing temperature appears to roughly track the
previously reported pseudogap temperature for this material, standard noise
analysis rather suggests that the additional noise contribution is driven by
the proximity of the superconductor-insulator transition.
