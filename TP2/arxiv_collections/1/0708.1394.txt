Based on the semiclassical, impact parameter method a theoretical model is
constructed to calculate totally differential cross sections for single
ionization of helium by impact with fast C$^{6+}$ ions. Good agreement with the
experiment is achieved in the scattering plane, while in the perpendicular
plane a similar structure to that observed experimentally is obtained. The
contribution of different partial waves to the cross section is also
investigated.
