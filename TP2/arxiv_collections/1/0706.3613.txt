We report a joint theoretical and experimental study focused on understanding
the optical and magneto-optical properties of Co-based full-Heusler compounds.
We show that magneto-optical spectra calculated within ab-initio density
functional theory are able to uniquely identify the features of the
experimental spectra in terms of spin resolved electronic transitions. As
expected for 3d-based magnets, we find that the largest Kerr rotation for these
alloys is of the order of 0.3o in polar geometry. In addition, we demonstrate
that (i) multilayered structures have to be carefully handled in the
theoretical calculations in order to improve the agreement with experiments,
and (ii) combined theoretical and experimental investigations constitute a
powerful approach to designing new materials for magneto-optical and
spin-related applications
