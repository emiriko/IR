We analyze non-integrable deformations of two-dimensional N=1 supersymmetric
quantum field theories with kink excitations. As example, we consider the
multi-frequency Super Sine Gordon model. At weak coupling, this model is robust
with respect to kink confinement phenomena, in contrast to the purely bosonic
case. If we vary the coupling, the model presents a sequence of phase
transitions, where pairs of kinks disappear from the spectrum. The phase
transitions fall into two classes: the first presents the critical behaviors of
the Tricritical Ising model, the second instead those of the gaussian model. In
the first case, close to the critical point, the model has metastable vacua,
with a spontaneously supersymmetry breaking. When the life-time of the
metastable vacua is sufficiently long, the role of goldstino is given by the
massless Majorana fermion of the Ising model. On the contrary, supersymmetry
remains exact in the phase transition of the second type.
