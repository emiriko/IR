The aim of the paper is to propose a new type of fits in terms of invariant
quantities for finding the entries of the CKM matrix from the quark sector, by
using the mathematical solution to the reconstruction problem of 3 x 3 unitary
matrices from experimental data, recently found. The necessity of this type of
fit comes from the compatibility conditions between the data and the
theoretical model formalised by the CKM matrix, which imply many strong
nonlinear conditions on moduli which all have to be satisfied in order to
obtain a unitary matrix.
