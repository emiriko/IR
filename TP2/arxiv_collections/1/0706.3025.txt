High scale conformal physics can lead to unusual unparticle stuff at our low
energies. In this paper we discuss how the exchange of unparticles between
Standard Model fields can lead to new contact interaction physics as well as a
pseudoresonance-like structure, an unresonance, that might be observable at the
Tevatron or LHC in, e.g., the Drell-Yan channel. The specific signatures of
this scenario are quite unique and can be used to easily identify this new
physics given sufficient integrated luminosity.
