We report on the kinetics of a low-temperature gas of indirect excitons in
the optically-induced exciton trap. The excitons in the region of laser
excitation are found to rapidly -- within 4 ns -- cool to the lattice
temperature T = 1.4 K, while the excitons at the trap center are found to be
cold -- essentially at the lattice temperature -- even during the excitation
pulse. The loading time of excitons to the trap center is found to be about 40
ns, longer than the cooling time yet shorter than the lifetime of the indirect
excitons. The observed time hierarchy is favorable for creating a dense and
cold exciton gas in optically-induced traps and for in situ control of the gas
by varying the excitation profile in space and time before the excitons
recombine.
