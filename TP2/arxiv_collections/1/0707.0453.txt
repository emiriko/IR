We derive an effective nonpolynomial Schrodinger equation (NPSE) for
self-repulsive or attractive BEC in the nearly-1D cigar-shaped trap, with the
transverse confining frequency periodically modulated along the axial
direction. Besides the usual linear cigar-shaped trap, where the periodic
modulation emulates the action of an optical lattice (OL), the model may be
also relevant to toroidal traps, where an ordinary OL cannot be created. For
either sign of the nonlinearity, extended and localized states are found, in
the numerical form (using both the effective NPSE and the full 3D
Gross-Pitaevskii equation) and by means of the variational approximation (VA).
The latter is applied to construct ground-state solitons and predict the
collapse threshold in the case of self-attraction. It is shown that numerical
solutions provided by the one-dimensional NPSE are always very close to full 3D
solutions, and the VA yields quite reasonable results too. The transition from
delocalized states to gap solitons, in the first finite bandgap of the linear
spectrum, is examined in detail, for the repulsive and attractive
nonlinearities alike.
