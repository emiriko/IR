In this work, I report the latest lattice QCD calculations of nucleon and
hyperon structure from chiral fermions in 2+1-flavor dynamical simulations. All
calculations are done with a chirally symmetric fermion action, domain-wall
fermions, for valence quarks. % I begin with the latest lattice results on the
nucleon structure, focusing on results from RBC/UKQCD using 2+1-flavor chiral
fermion actions. We find the chiral-extrapolated axial coupling constant at
physical pion mass point to be 1.23(5), consistent with experimental value. The
renormalization constants for the structure functions are obtained from
RI/MOM-scheme non-perturbative renormalization. We find first moments of the
polarized and unpolarized nucleon structure functions at zero transfer momentum
to be 0.133(13) and 0.203(23) respectively, using continuum chiral
extrapolation. These are consistent with the experimental values, unlike
previous calculations which have been 50% larger. We also have a prediction for
the transversity, which we find to be 0.56(4). The twist-3 matrix element is
consistent with zero which agrees with the prediction of the Wandzura-Wilczek
relation.
  In the second half of this work, I report an indirect dynamical estimation of
the strangeness proton magnetic moments using mixed actions. With the analysis
of hyperon form factors and using charge symmetry, the strangeness of proton is
found to be $-0.066(26)$, consistent with the Adelaide-JLab Collaboration's
result. The hyperon $\Sigma$ and $\Xi$ axial coupling constants are also
performed for the first time in a lattice calculation, $g_{\Sigma\Sigma}=
0.441(14)$ and $g_{\Xi\Xi} = -0.277(11)$.
