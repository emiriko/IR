We analyze the effects of both bond- and potential-disorder in the vicinity
of a first-order metal insulator transition in a two-band model for manganites
using a real-space Monte Carlo method. Our results reveal a novel
charge-ordered state coexisting with spin-glass behavior. We provide the basis
for understanding the phase diagrams of half-doped manganites, and contrast the
effects of bond- and potential-disorder and the combination of both.
