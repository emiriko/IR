A description of phonon dynamics and charge response of the $n$-doped
high-temperature superconductor (HTSC) NdCuO is presented based upon a
microscopic modeling of the electronic density response. This is accomplished
starting from the insulating state via the underdoped strange metallic to the
more conventional metallic state by consecutive orbital selective
incompressibility-compressibility transitions in terms of strict sum rules for
the charge response. The approach proposed in this work for the $n$-doped
HTSC's modifies the modeling recently applied to the $p$-doped compounds and
expresses an electron-hole asymmetry introduced by doping. A qualitative
physical picture consistent with our modeling of the electronic state in the
cuprates is given in which a sufficiently broad set of orbital degrees of
freedom, i.e. Cu3d/$4s$ and O$2p$ is essential. Within the framework of linear
response theory we calculate full phonon dispersion curves in the different
phases. In particular, the strongly doping dependent anomalous high-frequency
oxygen bond-stretching modes (OBSM) found experimentally in the $p$-doped
HTSC's and also recently for $n$-doped Nd$_{1.85}$Ce$_{0.15}$CuO$_{4}$ are
investigated and compared with experimental results from inelastic neutron
scattering and inelastic x-ray scattering, respectively. We calculate an
anticrossing scenario for the OBSM in $n$-doped NdCuO which is absent in the
case of $p$-doped LaCuO and relate it to the different crystal structure.
Phonon-induced electronic charge redistributions of the anomalous OBSM due to
nonlocal electron-phonon interaction effects of charge-fluctuation type giving
reason to dynamic stripes are also studied.
