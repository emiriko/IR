In this article, we take the point of view that the $D_s(2700)$ be a
tetraquark state, which consists of a scalar diquark and a vector antidiquark,
and calculate its mass with the QCD sum rules. The numerical result indicates
that the mass of the vector charmed tetraquark state is about
$M_V=(3.75\pm0.18)\rm{GeV}$ or $M_V=(3.71\pm0.15)\rm{GeV}$ from different sum
rules, which is about $1\rm{GeV}$ larger than the experimental data. Such
tetraquark component should be very small in the $D_s(2700)$.
