In this note, we introduce a class of algebras that are in some sense related
to conformal algebras. This class (called TC-algebras) includes Weyl algebras
and some of their (associative and Lie) subalgebras. By a conformal algebra we
generally mean what is known as $H$-pseudo-algebra over the polynomial Hopf
algebra $H=\Bbbk[T_1,..., T_n]$. Some recent results in structure theory of
conformal algebras are applied to get a description of TC-algebras.
