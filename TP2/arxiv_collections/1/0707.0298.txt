We introduce new techniques based on brane tilings to investigate D3-branes
probing orientifolds of toric Calabi-Yau singularities. With these new tools,
one can write down many orientifold models and derive the resulting low-energy
gauge theories living on the D-branes. Using the set of ideas in this paper one
recovers essentially all orientifolded theories known so far. Furthermore, new
orientifolds of non-orbifold toric singularities are obtained. The possible
applications of the tools presented in this paper are diverse. One particular
application is the construction of models which feature dynamical supersymmetry
breaking as well as the computation of D-instanton induced superpotential
terms.
