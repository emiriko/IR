We report the observation of negative magnetoresistance in the ferromagnetic
semiconductor GaMnAs at low temperatures ($T<3$ K) and low magnetic fields ($0<
B <20$ mT). We attribute this effect to weak localization. Observation of weak
localization provides a strong evidence of impurity band transport in these
materials, since for valence band transport one expects either weak
anti-localization due to strong spin-orbit interactions or total suppression of
interference by intrinsic magnetization. In addition to the weak localization,
we observe Altshuler-Aronov electron-electron interactions effect in this
material.
