We review the Resonating Valence Bond (RVB) theory of high temperatur e
superconductivity using Gutzwiller projected wave functions that incorporate
strong correlations. After a general overview of the phenomenon of high
temperature superconductivity, we discuss Anderson's RVB picture and its
implementation by renormalised mean field theory (RMFT) and variational Monte
Carlo (VMC) techniques. We review RMFT and VMC results with an emphasis on
recent development s in extending VMC and RMFT techniques to excited states. We
compare results obtained from these methods with angle resolved photoemission
spectroscopy (ARPES) and scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM). We conclude by
summarising recent successes of this approach and discuss open problems that
need to be solved for a consistent and complete description of high temperature
superconductivity using Gutzwiller projected wave functions.
