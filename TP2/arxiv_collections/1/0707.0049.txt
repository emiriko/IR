We use molecules to couple light into and out of microscale plasmonic
waveguides. Energy transfer, mediated by surface plasmons, from donor molecules
to acceptor molecules over ten micrometer distances is demonstrated. Also
surface plasmon coupled emission from the donor molecules is observed at
similar distances away from the excitation spot. The lithographic fabrication
method we use for positioning the dye molecules allows scaling to nanometer
dimensions. The use of molecules as couplers between far-field and near-field
light offers the advantages that no special excitation geometry is needed, any
light source can be used to excite plasmons and the excitation can be localized
below the diffraction limit. Moreover, the use of molecules has the potential
for integration with molecular electronics and for the use of molecular
self-assembly in fabrication. Our results constitute a proof-of-principle
demonstration of a plasmonic waveguide where signal in- and outcoupling is done
by molecules.
