We show that, for mechanical system with external forces, the equations of
deviations of solution curves of the corresponding Lagrange equations,determine
a nonlinear connection on the second order osculator (second order tangent)
bundle. In particular, Jacobi equations in Finsler and Riemann spaces determine
such a nonlinear connection.
