Talk based on work entitled ``Yukawa textures, new physics and
nondecoupling,'' done in collaboration with G. C. Branco and J. I.
Silva-Marcos, arXiv:hep-ph/0612252, to appear in Phys. Rev. D. In this work we
pointed out that New Physics can play an important r\^ ole in rescuing some of
the Yukawa texture zero ans\" atze which would otherwise be eliminated by the
recent, more precise measurements of $V_{CKM}$. We have shown that the presence
of an isosinglet vector-like quark which mixes with standard quarks, can render
viable a particularly interesting four texture zero Yukawa ansatz. The crucial
point is the nondecoupling of the effects of the isosinglet quark, even for
arbitrary large values of its mass.
