Graphene's honeycomb lattice structure underlies much of the remarkable
physics inherent in this material, most strikingly through the formation of two
``flavors'' of Dirac cones for each spin. In the quantum Hall regime, the
resulting flavor degree of freedom leads to an interesting problem when a
Landau level is partially occupied. Namely, while Zeeman splitting clearly
favors polarizing spins along the field, precisely how the states for each
flavor are occupied can become quite delicate. Here we focus on clean graphene
sheets in the regime of quantum Hall ferromagnetism, and discuss how subtler
lattice-scale physics, arising either from interactions or disorder, resolves
this ambiguity to measurable consequence. Interestingly, such lattice-scale
physics favors microscopic symmetry-breaking order coexisting with the usual
liquid-like quantum Hall physics emerging on long length scales. The current
experimental situation is briefly reviewed in light of our discussion.
