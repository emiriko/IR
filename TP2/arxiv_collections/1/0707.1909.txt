Finding the ground states of identical particles packed on spheres has
relevance for stabilizing emulsions and a venerable history in the literature
of theoretical physics and mathematics. Theory and experiment have confirmed
that defects such as disclinations and dislocations are an intrinsic part of
the ground state. Here we discuss the remarkable behavior of vacancies and
interstitials in spherical crystals. The strain fields of isolated
disclinations forced in by the spherical topology literally rip interstitials
and vacancies apart, typically into dislocation fragments that combine with the
disclinations to create small grain boundary scars. The fractionation is often
into three charge-neutral dislocations, although dislocation pairs can be
created as well. We use a powerful, freely available computer program to
explore interstitial fractionalization in some detail, for a variety of power
law pair potentials. We investigate the dependence on initial conditions and
the final state energies, and compare the position dependence of interstitial
energies with the predictions of continuum elastic theory on the sphere. The
theory predicts that, before fragmentation, interstitials are repelled from
5-fold disclinations and vacancies are attracted. We also use vacancies and
interstitials to study low energy states in the vicinity of "magic numbers"
that accommodate regular icosadeltahedral tessellations.
