We incorporate an Al-AlO_x-Al single-electron transistor as the gate of a
narrow (~100 nm) metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET).
Near the MOSFET channel conductance threshold, we observe oscillations in the
conductance associated with Coulomb blockade in the channel, revealing the
formation of a Si single-electron transistor. Abrupt steps present in sweeps of
the Al transistor conductance versus gate voltage are correlated with
single-electron charging events in the Si transistor, and vice versa. Analysis
of these correlations using a simple electrostatic model demonstrates that the
two single-electron transistor islands are closely aligned, with an
inter-island capacitance approximately equal to 1/3 of the total capacitance of
the Si transistor island, indicating that the Si transistor is strongly coupled
to the Al transistor.
