Control of the living cell functions with remarkable reliability despite the
stochastic nature of the underlying molecular networks -- a property presumably
optimized by biological evolution. We here ask to what extent the property of a
stochastic dynamical network to produce reliable dynamics is an evolvable
trait. Using an evolutionary algorithm based on a deterministic selection
criterion for the reliability of dynamical attractors, we evolve dynamical
networks of noisy discrete threshold nodes. We find that, starting from any
random network, reliability of the attractor landscape can often be achieved
with only few small changes to the network structure. Further, the evolvability
of networks towards reliable dynamics while retaining their function is
investigated and a high success rate is found.
