Sub-Riemannian Geometry is proved to play an important role in many
applications, e.g., Mathematical Physics and Control Theory. The simplest
example of sub-Riemannian structure is provided by the 3-D Heisenberg group.
Sub-Riemannian Geometry enjoys major differences from the Riemannian being a
generalisation of the latter at the same time, e.g., geodesics are not unique
and may be singular, the Hausdorff dimension is larger than the manifold
topological dimension. There exists a large amount of literature developing
sub-Riemannian Geometry. However, very few is known about its natural extension
to pseudo-Riemannian analogues. It is natural to begin such a study with some
low-dimensional manifolds. Based on ideas from sub-Riemannian geometry we
develop sub-Lorentzian geometry over the classical 3-D anti-de Sitter space.
Two different distributions of the tangent bundle of anti-de Sitter space yield
two different geometries: sub-Lorentzian and sub-Riemannian. It is shown that
the set of timelike and spacelike `horizontal' curves is non-empty and we study
the problem of horizontal connectivity in anti-de Sitter space. We also use
Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms for both sub-Lorentzian and
sub-Riemannian geometries to find geodesics.
