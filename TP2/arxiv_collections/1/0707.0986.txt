I apply the method of characteristics to both bi-directional and
uni-directional pulse propagation in dispersionless media containing
nonlinearity of arbitrary order. The differing analytic predictions for the
shocking distance quantify the effects of the uni-directional approximation
used in many pulse propagation models. Results from numerical simulations
support the theoretical predictions, and reveal the nature of the coupling
between forward and backward waves.
