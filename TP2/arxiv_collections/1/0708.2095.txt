Optical modulation of the effective refractive properties of a "fishnet"
metamaterial with a Ag/Si/Ag heterostructure is demonstrated in the near-IR
range and the associated fast dynamics of negative refractive index is studied
by pump-probe method. Photo excitation of the amorphous Si layer at visible
wavelength and corresponding modification of its optical parameters is found to
be responsible for the observed modulation of negative refractive index in
near-IR.
