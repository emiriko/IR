The branching ratio for the rare two-body B_s -> rho gamma decay is
calculated using the factorization assumption. This transition is dominated by
the annihilation diagrams and, in principle, prone to receiving substantial
contributions from new physics. We estimate Br(B_s -> rho gamma) = 1.6 x 10^-9
within the Standard Model and investigate the sensitivity of this decay mode to
the effects of two new physics scenarios: vector quark model and supersymmetry.
Our results indicate that the shift in branching ratio is at most around 10%
with the addition of vector quarks and is negligibly small in the constrained
minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model.
