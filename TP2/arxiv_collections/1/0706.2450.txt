We demonstrate quantum control of a large spin-angular momentum associated
with the F=3 hyperfine ground state of 133Cs. A combination of time dependent
magnetic fields and a static tensor light shift is used to implement
near-optimal controls and map a fiducial state to a broad range of target
states, with yields in the range 0.8-0.9. Squeezed states are produced also by
an adiabatic scheme that is more robust against errors. Universal control
facilitates the encoding and manipulation of qubits and qudits in atomic ground
states, and may lead to improvement of some precision measurements.
