We introduce an operational interpretation for pure-state global multipartite
entanglement based on quantum estimation. We show that the estimation of the
strength of low-noise locally depolarizing channels, as quantified by the
regularized quantum Fisher information, is directly related to the
Meyer-Wallach multipartite entanglement measure. Using channels that depolarize
across different partitions, we obtain related multipartite entanglement
measures. We show that this measure is the sum of expectation values of local
observables on two copies of the state.
