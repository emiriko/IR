We show that in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, the mass of the
lightest neutralino is experimentally unconstrained if the GUT relation between
the gaugino mass parameters M_1 and M_2 is dropped. We discuss what the impact
of light or massless neutralinos would be on their production at LEP, as well
as on electroweak precision data and rare decays.
