In a recent work, B\"ol and Reese have introduced a discrete model for
polymer networks by means of a finite element modeling. They have also provided
a comparison with real experiments. A key parameter of their model is the size
h of the finite element mesh, that is meant to be small in practice. The aim of
the present work is to study the asymptotic behaviour (and the convergence of
the finite element method) when the meshsize goes to zero. In particular, we
address the properties satisfied by the model at the limit, depending on the
properties of the mesh.
