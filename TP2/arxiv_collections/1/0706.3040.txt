We demonstrate experimentally that structural perturbations imposed on
highly-dispersive photonic crystal-based waveguides give rise to spectral
features that bear signatures of Anderson localization. Sharp resonances with
the effective Qs of over 30,000 are found in scattering spectra of disordered
waveguides. The resonances are observed in a ~20-nm bandwidth centered at the
cutoff of slowly-guided Bloch-modes. Their origin can be explained with
interference of coherently scattered electromagnetic waves which results in the
formation of a narrow impurity (or localization) band populated with spectrally
distinct quasistates. Standard photon localization criteria are fulfilled in
the localization band.
