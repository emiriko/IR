Recently proposed novel idea of "crabbed waist" beam-beam collisions will be
tested at DAFNE during the collider run for the Siddharta experiment. In order
to achieve the goal luminosity, large dynamic aperture is a matter of primary
importance. A new method of a dynamic aperture optimization based on
step-by-step chromaticity compensation with choosing the "best" sextupole pair
at each step was applied to the DAFNE upgrade lattice. Several tune points were
considered taking into account both high luminosity and large dynamic aperture.
Algorithm and results of optimization will be presented.
