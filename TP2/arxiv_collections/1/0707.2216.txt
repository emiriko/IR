Neutrinoless double beta decay is one of the most powerful tools to set the
neutrino mass absolute scale and establish whether the neutrino is a Majorana
particle. After a summary of the neutrinoless double beta decay phenomenology,
the present status of the experimental search for this rare decay is reported
and the prospects for next generation experiments are reviewed.
