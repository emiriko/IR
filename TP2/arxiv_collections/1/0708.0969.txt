We introduce a novel scheme for one-way quantum computing (QC) based on the
use of information encoded qubits in an effective cluster state resource. With
the correct encoding structure, we show that it is possible to protect the
entangled resource from phase damping decoherence, where the effective cluster
state can be described as residing in a Decoherence-Free Subspace (DFS) of its
supporting quantum system. One-way QC then requires either single or two-qubit
adaptive measurements. As an example where this proposal can be realized, we
describe an optical lattice setup where the scheme provides robust quantum
information processing. We also outline how one can adapt the model to provide
protection from other types of decoherence.
