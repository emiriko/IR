Waveguides composed of electromagnetically-coupled optical microcavities
(coupled resonator optical waveguides or CROWs) can be used for light guiding,
slowing and storage. In this paper, we present a two-dimensional analysis of
finite-size straight and curved CROW sections based on a rigorous Muller
boundary integral equations method. We study mechanisms of the coupling of
whispering gallery (WG) modes and guiding light around bends in CROWs composed
of both identical and size-mismatched microdisk resonators. Our accurate
analysis reveals differences in WG modes coupling in the vicinity of bends in
CROWs composed of optically-large and wavelength-scale microcavities. We
propose and discuss possible ways to design low-loss CROW bends and to reduce
bend losses. These include selecting specific bend angles depending on the
azimuthal order of the WG mode and tuning the radius of the microdisk
positioned at the CROW bend.
