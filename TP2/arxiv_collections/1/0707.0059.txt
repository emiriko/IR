Squeezing of a thermal bath introduces new features absent in an open quantum
system interacting with an uncorrelated (zero squeezing) thermal bath. The
resulting dynamics, governed by a Lindblad-type evolution, extends the concept
of a generalized amplitude damping channel, which corresponds to a dissipative
interaction with a purely thermal bath. Here we present the Kraus
representation of this map, which we call the squeezed generalized amplitude
damping channel. As an application of this channel to quantum information, we
study the classical capacity of this channel.
