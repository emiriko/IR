The composite CBS-QB3 method is widely used to obtain accurate energies of
molecules and radicals although its use in the case of singlet diradicals gives
rise to some difficulties. The problem is related to the parameterized
correction this method introduces to account for spin-contamination. We report
a new term specifically designed to describe singlet diradicals separated by at
least one CH2 unit. As a test case, we have computed the formation enthalpy of
a series of diradicals that includes hydrocarbons as well as systems involving
heteroatoms (nitrogen, oxygen). The resulting CBS-QB3 energies are very close
to experiment.
