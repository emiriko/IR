We propose the phase diagram of a new pseudo-ternary compound,
CoMnGe_{1-x}Sn_{x}, in the range x less than or equal to 0.1. Our phase diagram
is a result of magnetic and calometric measurements. We demonstrate the
appearance of a hysteretic magnetostructural phase transition in the range
x=0.04 to x=0.055, similar to that observed in CoMnGe under hydrostatic
pressure. From magnetisation measurements, we show that the isothermal entropy
change associated with the magnetostructural transition can be as high as 4.5
J/(K kg) in a field of 1 Tesla. However, the large thermal hysteresis in this
transition (~20 K) will limit its straightforward use in a magnetocaloric
device.
