In this note we study supersymmetric Wilson loops restricted to an S^2
submanifold of four-dimensional space in N=4 super Yang-Mills. We provide
evidence from both perturbation theory and the AdS dual that those loops are
equal to the analogous observables in two-dimensional Yang-Mills on S^2
(excluding non-perturbative contributions). This relates a subsector of N=4 SYM
to a low-dimensional soluble model and also suggests that this subsector of N
=4 SYM is invariant under area preserving diffeomorphisms.
