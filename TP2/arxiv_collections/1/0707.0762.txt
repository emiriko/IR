Grid Computing has made substantial advances in the past decade; these are
primarily due to the adoption of standardized Grid middleware. However Grid
computing has not yet become pervasive because of some barriers that we believe
have been caused by the adoption of middleware centric approaches. These
barriers include: scant support for major types of applications such as
interactive applications; lack of flexible, autonomic and scalable Grid
architectures; lack of plug-and-play Grid computing and, most importantly, no
straightforward way to setup and administer Grids. PhantomOS is a project which
aims to address many of these barriers. Its goal is the creation of a user
friendly pervasive Grid computing platform that facilitates the rapid
deployment and easy maintenance of Grids whilst providing support for major
types of applications on Grids of almost any topology. In this paper we present
the detailed system architecture and an overview of its implementation.
