We show that two coupled map lattices that are mutually coupled to one
another with a delay can display zero delay synchronization if they are driven
by a third coupled map lattice. We analytically estimate the parametric regimes
that lead to synchronization and show that the presence of mutual delays
enhances synchronization to some extent. The zero delay or isochronal
synchronization is reasonably robust against mismatches in the internal
parameters of the coupled map lattices and we analytically estimate the
synchronization error bounds.
