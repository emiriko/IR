Using the the concept of cracking we explore the influence of density
fluctuations and local anisotropy have on the stability of local and non-local
anisotropic matter configurations in general relativity. This concept,
conceived to describe the behaviour of a fluid distribution just after its
departure from equilibrium, provides an alternative approach to consider the
stability of selfgravitating compact objects. We show that potentially unstable
regions within a configuration can be identify as a function of the difference
of propagations of sound along tangential and radial directions. In fact, it is
found that these regions could occur when, at particular point within the
distribution, the tangential speed of sound is greater than radial one.
