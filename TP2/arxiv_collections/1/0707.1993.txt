We consider a particle coupled to a dissipative environment and derive a
perturbative formula for the dephasing rate based on the purity of the reduced
probability matrix. We apply this formula to the problem of a particle on a
ring, that interacts with a dirty metal environment. At low but finite
temperatures we find a dephasing rate $\propto T^{3/2}$, and identify dephasing
lengths for large and for small rings. These findings shed light on recent
Monte Carlo data regarding the effective mass of the particle. At zero
temperature we find that spatial fluctuations suppress the possibility of
having a power law decay of coherence.
