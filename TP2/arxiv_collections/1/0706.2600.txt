We classify the Lie superalgebra deformations of the Killing superalgebras of
some M-theory backgrounds. We show that the Killing superalgebras of the
Minkowski, Freund--Rubin and M5-brane backgrounds are rigid, whereas the ones
for the M-wave, the Kaluza--Klein monopole and the M2-brane admit deformations,
which we give explicitly.
