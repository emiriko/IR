I show using Landau theory that quenched dislocations can facilitate the
supersolid (SS) to normal solid (NS) transition, making it possible for the
transition to occur even if it does not in a dislocation-free crystal. I make
detailed predictions for the dependence of the SS to NS transition temperature
T_c(L), superfluid density %\rho_S(T, L), and specific heat C(T,L) on
temperature T and dislocation spacing L, all of which can be tested against
experiments. The results should also be applicable to an enormous variety of
other systems, including, e.g., ferromagnets.
