We report further evidence for $N(1900)P_{13}$ from an analysis of a large
variety of photo- and pion-induced reactions, in particular from the new CLAS
measurements of double polarization observables for photoproduction of
hyperons. The data are consistent with two classes of solutions both requiring
contributions from $N(1900)P_{13}$ but giving different $N(1900)P_{13}$ pole
positions. $(M-i\Gamma/2) = (1915\pm50)-i(90\pm25)$ MeV covers both solutions.
The small elasticity of 10% or less explains why it was difficult to observe
the state in $\pi N$ elastic scattering.
  $N(1900)P_{13}$ is a 2-star resonance which is predicted by symmetric
three-quark models. In diquark-quark models, the existence of the state is not
expected.
