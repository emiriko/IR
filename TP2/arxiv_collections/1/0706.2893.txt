A generalization of the heapsort algorithm is proposed. At the expense of
about 50% more comparison and move operations for typical cases, the dualheap
sort algorithm offers several advantages over heapsort: improved cache
performance, better performance if the input happens to be already sorted, and
easier parallel implementations.
