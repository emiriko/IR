The universal finite-size scaling function of the critical Casimir force for
the three dimensional XY universality class with Dirichlet boundary conditions
is determined using Monte Carlo simulations. The results are in excellent
agreement with recent experiments on $^4$He Films at the superfluid transition
and with available theoretical predictions.
