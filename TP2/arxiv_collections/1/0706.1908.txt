Recent studies have reported that T cells can integrate signals between
interrupted encounters with Antigen Presenting Cells (APCs) in such a way that
the process of signal integration exhibits a form of memory. Here, we carry out
a computational study using a simple mathematical model of T cell activation to
investigate the ramifications of interrupted T cell-APC contacts on signal
integration. We consider several mechanisms of how signal integration at these
time scales may be achieved and conclude that feedback control of immediate
early gene products (IEGs) appears to be a highly plausible mechanism that
allows for effective signal integration and cytokine production from multiple
exposures to APCs. Analysis of these computer simulations provides an
experimental roadmap involving several testable predictions.
