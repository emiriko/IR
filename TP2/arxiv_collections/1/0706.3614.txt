The interaction of orbital electrons with the charge and magnetic moment of
the nucleus polarizes it, and the detailed description requires a careful
treatment of the nuclear vector polarizability. We present a complete and
closed form expression for the resulting contribution to hyperfine splitting in
light atomic systems.
