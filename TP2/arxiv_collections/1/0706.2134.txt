We examine the stacking order of multilayer graphene grown on the
SiC$(000\bar{1})$ surface using low-energy electron diffraction and surface
X-ray diffraction. We show that the films contain a high density of rotational
stacking faults caused by three types of rotated graphene: sheets rotated
$30^\circ$ and $\pm 2.20^\circ$ relative to the SiC substrate. These angles are
unique because they correspond to commensurate phases of layered graphene, both
with itself and with the SiC substrate. {\it Ab intio} calculations show that
these rotational phases electronically decouple adjacent graphene layers. The
band structure from graphene at fault boundaries displays linear energy
dispersion at the $K$-point (Dirac cones), nearly identical to that of a single
graphene sheet.
