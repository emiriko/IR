We evaluate the antikaon and hyperon spectral functions in a self-consistent
and covariant many-body approach. The computation is based on coupled-channel
dynamics derived from the chiral SU(3) Lagrangian. A novel subtraction scheme
is developed that avoids kinematical singularities and medium-induced power
divergencies all together. Scalar and vector mean fields are used to model
nuclear binding and saturation. The effect of the latter is striking for the
antikaon spectral function that becomes significantly more narrow at small
momenta. Attractive mass shifts of about 30 and 40 MeV are predicted for the
Lambda(1405) and Sigma(1385) resonances. Once scalar and vector mean fields for
the nucleon are switched on the Lambda(1520) resonances dissolves almost
completely in nuclear matter. All together only moderate attraction is
predicted for the nuclear antikaon systems at saturation density. However, at
larger densities we predict a sizable population of soft antikaon modes that
arise from the coupling of the antikaon to a highly collective Lambda(1115)
nucleon-hole state. This may lead to the formation of exotic nuclear systems
with strangeness and antikaon condensation in compact stars at moderate
densities.
