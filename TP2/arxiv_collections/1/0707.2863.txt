The Clifford-Hermite and the Clifford-Gegenbauer polynomials of standard
Clifford analysis are generalized to the new framework of Clifford analysis in
superspace in a merely symbolic way. This means that one does not a priori need
an integration theory in superspace. Furthermore a lot of basic properties,
such as orthogonality relations, differential equations and recursion formulae
are proven. Finally, an interesting physical application of the super
Clifford-Hermite polynomials is discussed, thus giving an interpretation to the
super-dimension.
