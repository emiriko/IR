We report on a theoretical study of the influence of electron-electron
interactions on ARPES spectra in graphene that is based on the
random-phase-approximation and on graphene's massless Dirac equation continuum
model. We find that level repulsion between quasiparticle and plasmaron
resonances gives rise to a gap-like feature at small k. ARPES spectra are
sensitive to the electron-electron interaction coupling strength $\alpha_{\rm
gr}$ and might enable an experimental determination of this material parameter.
