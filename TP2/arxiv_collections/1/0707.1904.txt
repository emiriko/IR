Most work in game theory assumes that players are perfect reasoners and have
common knowledge of all significant aspects of the game. In earlier work, we
proposed a framework for representing and analyzing games with possibly unaware
players, and suggested a generalization of Nash equilibrium appropriate for
games with unaware players that we called generalized Nash equilibrium. Here,
we use this framework to analyze other solution concepts that have been
considered in the game-theory literature, with a focus on sequential
equilibrium. We also provide some insight into the notion of generalized Nash
equilibrium by proving that it is closely related to the notion of
rationalizability when we restrict the analysis to games in normal form and no
unawareness is involved.
