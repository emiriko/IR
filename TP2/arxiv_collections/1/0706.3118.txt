(In1-xFex)2O3 polycrystalline samples with x = (0.0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20
and 0.25) have been synthesized by a gel combustion method. Reitveld refinement
analysis of X raydiffraction data indicated the formation of single phase cubic
bixbyite structure without any parasitic phases. This observation is further
confirmed by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) imaging,
and indexing of the selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns, X-ray
Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) and Raman Spectroscopy. DC Magnetization studies
as a function of temperature and field indicatethat they are ferromagnetic with
Curie temperature (TC) well above room temperature.
