In microwaves, a TE-polarized rectangular-waveguide resonator with an
inserted thin ferrite disk gives an example of a nonintegrable system. The
interplay of reflection and transmission at the disk interfaces together with
the material gyrotropy effect gives rise to whirlpool-like electromagnetic
vortices in the proximity of the ferromagnetic resonance. Based on numerical
simulation, we show that a character of microwave vortices in a cavity can be
analyzed by means of consideration of equivalent magnetic currents. Maxwell
equations allows introduction of a magnetic current as a source of the
electromagnetic field. Specifically, we found that in such nonintegrable
structures, magnetic gyrotropy and geometrical factors leads to the effect of
symmetry breaking resulting in effective chiral magnetic currents and
topological magnetic charges. As an intriguing fact, one can observe precessing
behavior of the electric-dipole polarization inside a ferrite disk.
