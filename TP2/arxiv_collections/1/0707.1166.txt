Large mixing parameters of neutrino mass eigenstates in the neutrino flavor
eigenstates are determined, and interpreted as closely related to the neutrino
and charged lepton mass-ratio patterns. The three known seemingly different
charged lepton and quasi-degenerate neutrino deviation-from-extreme hierarchies
are shown to be three particular manifestations of one unifying quadratic
hierarchy-rule in lepton flavor physics.
