We report about La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 single crystal manganite thin films in
interaction with a gold capping layer. With respect to uncoated manganite
layers of the same thickness, Au-capped 4 nm-thick manganite films reveal a
dramatic reduction (about 185 K) of the Curie temperature TC and a lower
saturation low-temperature magnetization M0. A sizeable TC reduction (about 60
K) is observed even when an inert SrTiO3 layer is inserted between the gold
film and the 4 nm-thick manganite layer, suggesting that this effect might have
an electrostatic origin.
