Metal films grown on Si wafer perforated with a periodic array of
subwavelength holes have been fabricated and anomalous enhanced transmission in
the mid-infrared regime has been observed. High order transmission peaks up to
Si(2,2) are clearly revealed due to the large dielectric constant contrast of
the dielectrics at the opposite interfaces. Si(1,1) peak splits at oblique
incidence both in TE and TM polarization, which confirms that anomalous
enhanced transmission is a surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) assisted
diffraction phenomenon. Theoretical transmission spectra agree excellently with
the experimental results and confirm the role of SPPs diffraction by the
lattice.
