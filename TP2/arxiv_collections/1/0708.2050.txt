We show that matrix $Q\times Q$ Self-dual type $S$-integrable Partial
Differential
  Equations (PDEs) possess a family of lower-dimensional reductions represented
by the matrix $ Q \times n_0 Q$ quasilinear first order PDEs solved in
\cite{SZ1} by the method of characteristics. In turn, these PDEs admit two
types of available particular solutions: (a) explicit solutions and (b)
solutions described implicitly by a system of non-differential equations. The
later solutions, in particular, exhibit the wave profile breaking. Only first
type of solutions is available for (1+1)-dimensional nonlinear $S$-integrable
PDEs. (1+1)-dimensional $N$-wave equation, (2+1)- and (3+1)-dimensional
Pohlmeyer equations are represented as examples. We also represent a new
version of the dressing method which supplies both classical solutions and
solutions with wave profile breaking to the above $S$-integrable PDEs.
