A method is proposed for accurately describing arbitrary-shaped free
boundaries in single-grid finite-difference schemes for elastodynamics, in a
time-domain velocity-stress framework. The basic idea is as follows: fictitious
values of the solution are built in vacuum, and injected into the numerical
integration scheme near boundaries. The most original feature of this method is
the way in which these fictitious values are calculated. They are based on
boundary conditions and compatibility conditions satisfied by the successive
spatial derivatives of the solution, up to a given order that depends on the
spatial accuracy of the integration scheme adopted. Since the work is mostly
done during the preprocessing step, the extra computational cost is negligible.
Stress-free conditions can be designed at any arbitrary order without any
numerical instability, as numerically checked. Using 10 grid nodes per minimal
S-wavelength with a propagation distance of 50 wavelengths yields highly
accurate results. With 5 grid nodes per minimal S-wavelength, the solution is
less accurate but still acceptable. A subcell resolution of the boundary inside
the Cartesian meshing is obtained, and the spurious diffractions induced by
staircase descriptions of boundaries are avoided. Contrary to what occurs with
the vacuum method, the quality of the numerical solution obtained with this
method is almost independent of the angle between the free boundary and the
Cartesian meshing.
