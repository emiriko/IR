The results are reported of the molecular dynamics simulations of the
coherent static structure factor of molten AgI at 923 K using a polarizable ion
model. This model is based on a rigid ion potential, to which the many body
interactions due to the anions induced polarization are added. The calculated
structure factor is in better agreement with recent neutron diffraction data
than that obtained by using simple rigid ion pair potentials. The
Voronoi-Delaunay method has been applied to study the relationship between
voids in the spatial distribution of cations and the prepeak of the structure
factor.
