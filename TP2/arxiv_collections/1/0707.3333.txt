The purpose of this paper is to analyze in detail the Hamiltonian formulation
for the compact Gowdy models coupled to massless scalar fields as a necessary
first step towards their quantization. We will pay special attention to the
coupling of matter and those features that arise for the three-handle and
three-sphere topologies that are not present in the well studied three torus
case -in particular the polar constraints that come from the regularity
conditions on the metric. As a byproduct of our analysis we will get an
alternative understanding, within the Hamiltonian framework, of the appearance
of initial and final singularities for these models.
