We show how to engineer an extensive range of non-linear Hamiltonians for a
nano-mechanical resonator. The technique requires only a time dependent drive
applied to a Cooper-pair box or second oscillator to which the nano-resonator
is coupled. This method allows one to generate a large number of non-classical
states, as well as Hamiltonians whose classical counterparts are chaotic.
