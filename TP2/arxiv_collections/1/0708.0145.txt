A programmable quantum networks model is used in this paper for development
of methods of control of a quantum state transport. These methods may be
applied for a wide variety of patterns of controlled state transmission and
spreading in quantum systems. The programmable perfect state transfer and
quantum walk, mobile quantum (ro)bots and lattice gas automata may be described
by unified way with such approach.
