In the hole-doped $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave cuprate superconductor, due to the
midgap surface state (MSS), a zero bias conductance peak (ZBCP) is widely
observed in [110] interface point contact spectroscopy (PCS). However, ZBCP of
this geometry is rarely observed in the electron-doped cuprates, even though
their pairing symmetry is still likely the $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave. We argue
that this is due to the coexistence of antiferromagnetic (AF) and the
superconducting (SC) orders. Generalizing the Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk (BTK)
formula to include an AF coupling, it is shown explicitly that the MSS is
destroyed by the AF order. The calculated PCS is in good agreement with the
experiments.
