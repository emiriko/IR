We introduce the boundary measure at scale r of a compact subset of the
n-dimensional Euclidean space. We show how it can be computed for point clouds
and suggest these measures can be used for feature detection. The main
contribution of this work is the proof a quantitative stability theorem for
boundary measures using tools of convex analysis and geometric measure theory.
As a corollary we obtain a stability result for Federer's curvature measures of
a compact, allowing to compute them from point-cloud approximations of the
compact.
