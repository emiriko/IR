All the Doubly Special Relativity (DSR) models studied in literature so far
involve a deformation of the energy conservation rule that forces us to release
the hypothesis of the additivity of the energy for composite systems. In view
of the importance of the issue for a consistent formulation of a DSR
statistical mechanics and a DSR thermodynamics, we show that DSR models
preserving the usual (i.e. additive) energy conservation rule can be found.
These models allow the construction of a DSR-covariant extensive energy. The
implications of the analysis for the dynamics of DSR-covariant multiparticle
systems are also briefly discussed.
