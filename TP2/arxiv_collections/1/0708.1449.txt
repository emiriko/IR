Slow beams of neutral molecules are of great interest for a wide range of
applications, from cold chemistry through precision measurements to tests of
the foundations of quantum mechanics. We report on the quantitative observation
of thermal beams of perfluorinated macromolecules with masses up to 6000 amu,
reaching velocities down to 11 m/s. Such slow, heavy and neutral molecular
beams are of importance for a new class of experiments in matter-wave
interferometry and we also discuss the requirements for further manipulation
and cooling schemes with molecules in this unprecedented mass range.
