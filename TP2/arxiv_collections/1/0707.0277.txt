We study magnetic ordering of an extended Kondo-lattice model including an
additional on-site Coulomb interaction between the itinerant states. The model
is solved in the dynamical mean-field theory using Wilson's numerical
renormalization group approach as impurity solver. For a bipartite lattice we
find at half filling the expected antiferromagnetic phase. Upon doping this
phase is gradually suppressed and hints towards phase separation are observed.
For large doping the model exhibits ferromagnetism, the appearance of which can
at first sight be explained by Rudermann-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interaction.
However, for large values of the Kondo coupling $J$ significant differences to
a simple Rudermann-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida picture can be found. We furthermore
observe signs of quantum critical points for antiferromagnetic Kondo coupling
between the local spins and band states.
