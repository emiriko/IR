We investigate the magnetic response of a superconducting Nb ring containing
a ferromagnetic PdNi Josephson junction and a tunnel junction in parallel. A
doubling of the switching frequency is observed within certain intervals of the
external magnetic field. Assuming sinusoidal current-phase relations of both
junctions our model of a dc-SQUID embedded within a superconducting ring
explains this feature by a sequence of current reversals in the ferromagnetic
section of the junction in these field intervals. The switching anomalies are
induced by the coupling between the magnetic fluxes in the two superconducting
loops.
