The Lattice Hadron Physics Collaboration (LHPC) baryon spectroscopy effort is
reviewed. To date the LHPC has performed exploratory Lattice QCD calculations
of the low-lying spectrum of Nucleon and Delta baryons. These calculations
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by obtaining the masses of an
unprecedented number of excited states with definite quantum numbers. Future
work of the project is outlined.
