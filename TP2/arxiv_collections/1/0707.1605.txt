We completely describe the higher secant dimensions of all connected
homogeneous projective varieties of dimension at most 3, in all possible
equivariant embeddings. In particular, we calculate these dimensions for all
Segre-Veronese embeddings of P^1 * P^1, P^1 * P^1 * P^1, and P^2 * P^1, as well
as for the variety F of incident point-line pairs in P^2. For P^2 * P^1 and F
the results are new, while the proofs for the other two varieties are more
compact than existing proofs. Our main tool is the second author's tropical
approach to secant dimensions.
