Recent studies of quantum phase transitions in coupled atom-cavity arrays
have focused on the similarities between such systems and the Bose-Hubbard
model. However, the bipartite nature of the atom-cavity systems that make up
the array introduces some differences. In order to examine the unique features
of the coupled-cavity system, the behavior of a simple two-site model is
studied over a wide range of parameters. Four regions are identified, in which
the ground state of the system may be classified as either a polaritonic
insulator, a photonic superfluid, an atomic insulator, or a polaritonic
superfluid.
