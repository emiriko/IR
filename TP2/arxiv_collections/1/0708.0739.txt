Process of stripe formation is analyzed numerically in a binary mixture. The
system consists of particles of two sizes, without any direct mutual
interactions. Overlapping of large particles, surrounded by a dense system of
smaller particles induces indirect entropy driven interactions between large
particles. Under an influence of an external driving force the system orders
and stripes are formed. Mean width of stripes grows logarithmically with time,
in contrast to a typical power law temporal increase observed for driven
interacting lattice gas systems. We describe the mechanism responsible for this
behavior and attribute the logarithmic growth to a random walk of large
particles in a random potential due to the small ones.
