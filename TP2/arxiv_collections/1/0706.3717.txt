The idea of the vector dominance is still in use in various analyses of
experimental data of photon-hadron reactions. It makes sense, therefore, to
recast results of microscopic calculations of such reactions in this language.
Here we present the diffractive DIS $\rho_3$ production as a specific
correction to the generalized vector dominance. We perform a coupled channel
analysis of spin-orbital excitations in diffractive photoproduction and
reiterate the point that rho_3 in diffractive DIS will be sensitive to a novel
aspect of diffraction.
