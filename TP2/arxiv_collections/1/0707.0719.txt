We construct a DGP inspired braneworld scenario where a scalar field
non-minimally coupled to the induced Ricci curvature is present on the brane.
We show that this model allows for an embedding of the standard Friedmann
cosmology in the sense that the cosmological evolution of the background metric
on the brane can be described by the standard Friedmann equation. The relation
between our framework and the dark-energy formalism is explored.
