We study the spin Coulomb drag in a quasi-two-dimensional electron gas beyond
the random phase approximation (RPA). We find that the finite transverse width
of the electron gas causes a significant reduction of the spin Coulomb drag.
This reduction, however, is largely compensated by the enhancement coming from
the inclusion of many-body local field effects beyond the RPA, thereby
restoring good agreement with the experimental observations by C. P. Weber
