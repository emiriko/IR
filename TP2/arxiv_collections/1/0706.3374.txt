We demonstrate loading by laser ablation of $^{88}$Sr$^+$ ions into a
mm-scale surface-electrode ion trap. The laser used for ablation is a pulsed,
frequency-tripled Nd:YAG with pulse energies of 1-10 mJ and durations of 3-5
ns. An additional laser is not required to photoionize the ablated material.
The efficiency and lifetime of several candidate materials for the laser
ablation target are characterized by measuring the trapped ion fluorescence
signal for a number of consecutive loads. Additionally, laser ablation is used
to load traps with a trap depth (40 meV) below where electron impact ionization
loading is typically successful ($\gtrsim$ 500 meV).
