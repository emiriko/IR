The loop expansion is applied to a chiral effective hadronic lagrangian; with
the techniques of Infrared Regularization, it is possible to separate out the
short-range contributions and to write them as local products of fields that
are already present in our lagrangian. (The appropriate field variables must be
re-defined at each order in loops.) The corresponding parameters implicitly
include short-range effects to all orders in the interaction, so these effects
need not be calculated explicitly. The remaining (long-range) contributions
that must be calculated are nonlocal and resemble those in conventional
nuclear-structure calculations. Nonlinear isoscalar scalar $(\sigma)$ and
vector $(\omega)$ meson interactions are included, which incorporate
many-nucleon forces and nucleon substructure. Calculations are carried out at
the two-loop level to illustrate these techniques at finite nuclear densities
and to verify that the coupling parameters remain natural when fitted to the
empirical properties of equilibrium nuclear matter. Contributions from the
$\omega N$ tensor coupling are also discussed.
