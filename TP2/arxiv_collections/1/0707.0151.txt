We show the possibility of directional \textit{guided} superradiance from a
string of atoms separated by one or several wavelengths in a line parallel to
the axis of a nanofiber. We find that the rate and efficiency of channeling of
emission from the atoms into the fiber are cooperatively enhanced by the guided
modes.
