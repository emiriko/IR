We study a three dimensional system of a rectangular-waveguide resonator with
an inserted thin ferrite disk. The interplay of reflection and transmission at
the disk interfaces together with material gyrotropy effect, gives rise to a
rich variety of wave phenomena. We analyze the wave propagation based on full
Maxwell-equation numerical solutions of the problem. We show that the
power-flow lines of the microwave-cavity field interacting with a ferrite disk,
in the proximity of its ferromagnetic resonance, form whirlpool-like
electromagnetic vortices. Such vortices are characterized by the dynamical
symmetry breaking. The role of ohmic losses in waveguide walls and dielectric
and magnetic losses in a disk is a subject of our investigations.
