The optical properties of pentacene (PEN) and perfluoropentacene(PFP) thin
films on various SiO2 substrates were studied using variable angle
spectroscopic ellipsometry. Structural characterization was performed using
X-ray reflectivity and atomic force microscopy. A uniaxial model with the optic
axis normal to the sample surface was used to analyze the ellipsometry data. A
Strong optical anisotropy was observed and enabled the direction of the
transition dipole of the absorption bands to be determined. Furthermore,
comparison of the optical constants of PEN and PFP thin films with the
absorption spectra of the monomers in solution shows significant changes due to
the crystalline environment. Relative to the monomer spectrum the HOMO-LUMO
transition observed in PEN (PFP) thin film is reduced by 210 meV (280 meV).
Surprisingly, a second absorption band in the PFP thin film shows a slight
blueshift (40 meV) compared to the spectrum of the monomer with its transition
dipole perpendicular to that of the first absorption band.
