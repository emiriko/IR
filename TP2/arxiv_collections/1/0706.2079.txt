The charge response in the barium vanadium sulfide (BaVS3) single crystals is
characterized by dc resistivity and low frequency dielectric spectroscopy. A
broad relaxation mode in MHz range with huge dielectric constant ~= 10^6
emerges at the metal-to-insulator phase transition TMI ~= 67 K, weakens with
lowering temperature and eventually levels off below the magnetic transition
Tchi ~= 30 K. The mean relaxation time is thermally activated in a manner
similar to the dc resistivity. These features are interpreted as signatures of
the collective charge excitations characteristic for the orbital ordering that
gradually develops below TMI and stabilizes at long-range scale below Tchi.
