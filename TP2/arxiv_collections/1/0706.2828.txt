Generalizing the results of Kojima, Gritsenko and Krieg, we define an adelic
version of the Maass space for hermitian modular forms of weight k regarded as
functions on adelic points of the quasi-split unitary group U(2,2) associated
with an imaginary quadratic extension F/Q of discriminant D_F. When the class
number h_F of F is odd, we show that the Maass space is invariant under the
action of the local Hecke algebras of U(2,2)(Q_p) for all p not dividing D_F.
As a consequence we obtain a Hecke-equivariant injective map from the Maass
space to the h_F-fold direct product of the space of elliptic modular forms of
weight k-1 and level D_F.
