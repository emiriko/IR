A non-Hermitian operator with a real spectrum and a complete set of
eigenvectors may serve as the Hamiltonian operator for a unitary quantum system
provided that one makes an appropriate choice for the defining inner product of
the physical Hilbert state. We study the consequences of such a choice for the
representation of states in terms of projection operators and the geometry of
the state space. This allows for a careful treatment of the quantum
Brachistochrone problem and shows that it is indeed impossible to achieve
faster unitary evolutions using PT-symmetric or other non-Hermitian
Hamiltonians than those given by Hermitian Hamiltonians.
