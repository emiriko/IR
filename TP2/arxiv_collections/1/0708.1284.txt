We carry out a detailed analysis of the scalar sector of the nonminimal
supersymmetric standard model with lepton number violation, and study the
constraints imposed on it by the stability of the electroweak symmetry breaking
vacuum. The model contains a trilinear lepton mumber violating term in the
superpotential together with the associated \susy breaking interactions which
can give rise to neutrino masses. We evaluate the mass matrices for the various
boson and fermion modes and then discuss the effect that the lepton number
violating interactions have on the mass spectra using a phenomenological
precription to implement the experimental constraints on the light neutrinos
mass matrix. We also discuss qualitatively the conditions on the lepton number
violating parameters set by the unbounded from below directions, and from the
absence of the charge and color breaking minima in this model.
