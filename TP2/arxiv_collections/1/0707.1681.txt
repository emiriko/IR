We investigate the static and dynamic properties of a celebrated model of
social segregation, providing a complete explanation of the mechanisms leading
to segregation both in one- and two-dimensional systems. Standard statistical
physics methods shed light on the rich phenomenology of this simple model,
exhibiting static phase transitions typical of kinetic constrained models,
nontrivial coarsening like in driven-particle systems and percolation-related
phenomena.
