With a sample of 232x10^6 Upsilon(4S)->BBbar events collected with the BaBar
detector, we study the decays of B mesons to ppbarh final states, where
h=pi+,Ks,K*0 or K*+. We report evidence for the B->ppbarK*0 decay, with a
branching fraction (1.5+/-0.5(stat)+/-0.4(syst))x10^-6, and for the
B+->eta_cK*+ decay, with the branching fraction of
Br(B+->eta_cK*+)xBr(eta_c->ppbar)=(1.57^{+0.56}_{-0.45}(stat)^{+0.46}_{-0.36}(syst))x10^-6,
and provide improved measurements of the branching fractions of the other modes
of this type. We also report the measurements of the charge asymmetry
consistent with zero in the B+->ppbarpi+, B0->ppbarK*0 and B+->ppbarK*+ modes.
No evidence is found for the pentaquark candidate Theta+ in the mass range 1.52
to 1.55 GeV/c^2, decaying into pKs, or the glueball candidate fJ(2220) in the
mass range 2.2<mppbar<2.4GeV/c^2, and branching fraction limits are established
for both at the 10^-7 level.
