We study a nonzero-sum game of two players which is a generalization of the
antagonistic noisy duel of discrete type. The game is considered from the point
of view of various criterions of optimality. We prove existence of
epsilon-equilibrium situations and show that the epsilon-equilibrium strategies
that we have found are epsilon-maxmin. Conditions under which the equilibrium
plays are Pareto-optimal are given.
  Keywords: noisy duel, payoff function, strategy, equilibrium situation,
Pareto optimality, the value of a game.
