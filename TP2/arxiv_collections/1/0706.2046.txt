We investigate unattractor behavior in non-extremal black holes in
Einstein-Born-Infeld-Dilaton theory of gravity in four-dimensional
asymptotically flat spacetime. We obtain solutions which are non-singular near
the horizon and dependent on the value of the dilaton field at the infinity,
using perturbation method. It is shown that the value of the scalar field at
the horizon is determined by its asymptotic value and the charges carried by
the black hole. And we also find it is not true in general that the dilaton
value at the horizon is a monotonically increasing function of the first
coefficient of its series expansion in non-extremal Born-Infeld black holes.
