We report measurements of the temperature dependence of the magnetic
penetration depth \lambda(T) in non-centrosymmetric superconductor Re_3W. We
employed two experimental techniques: extraction of \lambda(T) from magnetic
{\em dc}-susceptibility, measured on a powder sample, and the rf tunnel diode
resonator technique, where a bulk polycrystalline sample was used. The results
of both techniques agree: the temperature dependence of the penetration depth
can be well described by weak-coupling, dirty-limit, s-wave BCS theory where we
obtain $\Delta(0)/k_BT_C=1.76$. No evidence for unconventional pairing
resulting from the absence of the inversion symmetry is found.
