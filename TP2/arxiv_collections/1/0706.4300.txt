The selection of a higher vapor deposition angle when growing a columnar thin
film (CTF) leads to surface-wave propagation at a planar metal-CTF interface
with phase velocity of lower magnitude and shorter propagation range.
Acordingly, a higher angle of plane-wave incidence is required to excite that
surface wave in a modified Kretschmann configuration.
