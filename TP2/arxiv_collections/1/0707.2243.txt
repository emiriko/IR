Dynamics and stability of solitons in two-dimensional (2D) Bose-Einstein
condensates (BEC), with low-dimensional (1D) conservative plus dissipative
nonlinear optical lattices are investigated. In the case of focusing media
(with attractive atomic systems) the collapse of the wave packet is arrested by
the dissipative periodic nonlinearity. The adiabatic variation of the
background scattering length leads to metastable matter-wave solitons.
  When the atom feeding mechanism is used, a dissipative soliton can exist in
focusing 2D media with 1D periodic nonlinearity. In the defocusing media
(repulsive BEC case) with harmonic trap in one dimension and one dimensional
nonlinear optical lattice in other direction, the stable soliton can exist.
This prediction of variational approach is confirmed by the full numerical
simulation of 2D Gross-Pitaevskii equation.
