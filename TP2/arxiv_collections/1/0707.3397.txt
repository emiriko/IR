We investigate the J^p=1/2^- baryons in the octets based on flavor SU(3)
symmetry. Since baryons with same quantum numbers can mix with each other, we
consider the mixing between two octets before their mixing with the singlet.
Most predicted decay widths are consistent with the experimental data, and
meanwhile we predict two possible $\Xi$ mass ranges of the two octets.
