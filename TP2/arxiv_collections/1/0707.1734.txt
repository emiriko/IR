Cosmic kinematic fast dynamo is found in non-inflationary phases of an
ellipsoidal anisotropic cosmological metric background solution of Einstein
field equations of general relativity. The magnetic field is amplified inside
the universe and spatially periodically. A finite resistivity is assumed, and a
nonsingular flow velocity is aligned with the magnetic field which is
orthogonal to a plane which is analog to a galactic plane in astrophysics.
Magnetic field components is stretched along the z-direction and a cosmic
dynamo is created in the spirit of Zeldovich stretch, twist and fold (STF)
dynamo generation mechanism. In the inflationary phase of the planar symmetric
universe, the primordial magnetic field decays and the galactic plane expands
as a de Sitter $(2+1)-spacetime$ and the eccentricity of the ellipsoidal
universe, tends to vanish with inflation. We may conclude that, as far as the
present model is concerned, anti-dynamos are obtained in inflationary phases.
