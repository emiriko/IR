We elaborate further on a hypothesis by Winterberg that turbulent
fluctuations of the zero point field may lead to a breakdown of the
superluminal quantum correlations over very large distances. A phenomenological
model that was proposed by Winterberg to estimate the transition scale of the
conjectured breakdown, does not lead to a distance that is large enough to be
agreeable with recent experiments. We consider, but rule out, the possibility
of a steeper slope in the energy spectrum of the turbulent fluctuations, due to
compressibility, as a possible mechanism that may lead to an increased
lower-bound for the transition scale. Instead, we argue that Winterberg
overestimated the intensity of the ZPF turbulent fluctuations. We calculate a
very generous corrected lower bound for the transition distance which is
consistent with current experiments.
