In two articles, the authors claim that the Heisenberg uncertainty principle
limits the precision of simultaneous measurements of the position and velocity
of a particle and refer to experimental evidence that supports their claim.
  It is true that ever since the inception of quantum mechanics, the
uncertainty relation that corresponds to a pair of observables represented by
non-commuting operators is interpreted by many scientists and engineers,
including Heisenberg himself, as a limitation on the accuracy with which
observables can be measured. However, such a limitation cannot be deduced from
the postulates and theorems of quantum thermodynamics.
