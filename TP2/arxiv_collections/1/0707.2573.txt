A phase-field model for dealing with dynamic instabilities in membranes is
presented. We use it to study curvature-driven pearling instability in vesicles
induced by the anchorage of amphiphilic polymers on the membrane. Within this
model, we obtain the morphological changes reported in recent experiments. The
formation of a homogeneous pearled structure is achieved by consequent pearling
of an initial cylindrical tube from the tip. For high enough concentration of
anchors, we show theoretically that the homogeneous pearled shape is
energetically less favorable than an inhomogeneous one, with a large sphere
connected to an array of smaller spheres.
