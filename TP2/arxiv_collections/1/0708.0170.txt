If a clock, mathematically modeled by a parametrized timelike curve in a
general-relativistic spacetime, is given, the radar method assigns a time and a
distance to every event which is sufficiently close to the clock. Several
geometric aspects of this method are reviewed and their physical interpretation
is discussed.
