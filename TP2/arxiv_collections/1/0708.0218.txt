We have determined the spins J of resonances in the 147Sm(n,gamma) reaction
by measuring multiplicities of gamma-ray cascades following neutron capture.
Using this technique, we were able to determine J values for all but 14 of the
140 known resonances below En = 1 keV, including 41 firm J assignments for
resonances whose spins previously were either unknown or tentative. These new
spin assignments, together with previously determined resonance parameters,
allowed us to extract separate level spacings and neutron strength functions
for J = 3 and 4 resonances. Furthermore, several statistical test of the data
indicate that very few resonances of either spin have been missed below En =
700eV. Because a non-statistical effect recently was reported near En = 350 eV
from an analysis of 147Sm(n,alpha) data, we divided the data into two regions;
0 < En < 350 eV and 350 < En < 700 eV. Using neutron widths from a previous
measurement and published techniques for correcting for missed resonances and
for testing whether data are consistent with a Porter-Thomas distribution, we
found that the reduced-neutron-width distribution for resonances below 350 eV
is consistent with the expected Porter-Thomas distribution. On the other hand,
we found that reduced-neutron-width data in the 350 < En < 700 eV region are
inconsistent with a Porter-Thomas distribution, but in good agreement with a
chi-squared distribution having two or more degrees of freedom. We discuss
possible explanations for these observed non-statistical effects and their
possible relation to similar effects previously observed in other nuclides.
