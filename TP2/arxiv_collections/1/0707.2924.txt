We show that classical and quantum Kolmogorov complexity of binary strings
agree up to an additive constant. Both complexities are defined as the minimal
length of any (classical resp. quantum) computer program that outputs the
corresponding string.
  It follows that quantum complexity is an extension of classical complexity to
the domain of quantum states. This is true even if we allow a small
probabilistic error in the quantum computer's output. We outline a mathematical
proof of this statement, based on an inequality for outputs of quantum
operations and a classical program for the simulation of a universal quantum
computer.
