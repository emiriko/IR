The problem of non-perturbative description of unsteady premixed flames with
arbitrary gas expansion is solved in the two-dimensional case. Considering the
flame as a surface of discontinuity with arbitrary local burning rate and gas
velocity jumps given on it, we show that the front dynamics can be determined
without having to solve the flow equations in the bulk. On the basis of the
Thomson circulation theorem, an implicit integral representation of the gas
velocity downstream is constructed. It is then simplified by a successive
stripping of the potential contributions to obtain an explicit expression for
the vortex component near the flame front. We prove that the unknown potential
component is left bounded and divergence-free by this procedure, and hence can
be eliminated using the dispersion relation for its on-shell value (i.e., the
value along the flame front). The resulting system of integro-differential
equations relates the on-shell fuel velocity and the front position. As
limiting cases, these equations contain all theoretical results on flame
dynamics established so far, including the linear equation describing the
Darrieus-Landau instability of planar flames, and the nonlinear
Sivashinsky-Clavin equation for flames with weak gas expansion.
