In most modern operating systems, init (as in "initialization") is the
program launched by the kernel at boot time. It runs as a daemon and typically
has PID 1. Init is responsible for spawning all other processes and scavenging
zombies. It is also responsible for reboot and shutdown operations. This
document describes existing solutions that implement the init process and/or
init scripts in Unix-like systems. These solutions range from the legacy and
still-in-use BSD and SystemV schemes, to recent and promising schemes from
Ubuntu, Apple, Sun and independent developers. Our goal is to highlight their
focus and compare their sets of features.
