Molecular orientation fluctuations in ferroelectric smectic liquid crystals
produce space charges, due to the divergence of the spontaneous polarization.
These space charges interact with mobile ions, so that one must consider the
coupled dynamics of the orientation and ionic degrees of freedom. Previous
theory and light scattering experiments on thin free-standing films of
ferroelectric liquid crystals have not included this coupling, possibly
invalidating their quantitative conclusions. We consider the most important
case of very slow ionic dynamics, compared to rapid orientational fluctuations,
and focus on the use of a short electric field pulse to quench orientational
fluctuations. We find that the resulting change in scattered light intensity
must include a term due to the quasistatic ionic configuration, which has
previously been ignored. In addition to developing the general theory, we
present a simple model to demonstrate the role of this added term.
