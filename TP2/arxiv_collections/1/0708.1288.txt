Linear chains of quantum scatterers are studied in the process of
lengthening, which is treated and analysed as a discrete dynamical system
defined over the manifold of scattering matrices. Elementary properties of such
dynamics relate the transport through the chain to the spectral properties of
individual scatterers. For a single-scattering channel case some new light is
shed on known transport properties of disordered and noisy chains, whereas
translationally invariant case can be studied analytically in terms of a simple
deterministic dynamical map. The many-channel case was studied numerically by
examining the statistical properties of scatterers that correspond to a certain
type of transport of the chain i.e. ballistic or (partially) localised.
