We show that the recently discovered double-valley splitting of the low-lying
Landau level(s) in the Quantum Hall Effect in graphene can be explained as
perturbative orbital interaction of intra- and inter-valley microscopic orbital
currents with a magnetic field. This effect is provided by the
translational-non-invariant terms corresponding to graphene's crystallographic
honeycomb symmetry but do not exist in the relativistic theory of massless
Dirac Fermions in Quantum Electrodynamics. We discuss recent data in view of
these results.
