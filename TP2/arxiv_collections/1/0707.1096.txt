In this paper, we use the variation of spontaneous magnetization to describe
the influence of electron holes in cuprate superconductors, and use competitive
energy relations to explore the superconductivity rule and energy criterion, on
this basis, we can deduce a clear physical image of superconducting phase
diagram and superconducting mechanism.
