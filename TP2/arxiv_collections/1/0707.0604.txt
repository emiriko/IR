We provide a generalization of the normal mode decomposition for
non-symmetric or locality constrained situations. This allows for instance to
locally decouple a bipartitioned collection of arbitrarily correlated
oscillators up to elementary pairs into which all correlations are condensed.
Similarly, it enables us to decouple the interaction parts of multi-mode
channels into single-mode and pair-interactions where the latter are shown to
be a clear signature of squeezing between system and environment. In
mathematical terms the result is a canonical matrix form with respect to real
symplectic equivalence transformations.
