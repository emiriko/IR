Twisted graph diagrams are virtual graph diagrams with bars on edges. A
bijection between abstract graph diagrams and twisted graph diagrams is
constructed. Then a polynomial invariant of Yamada-type is developed which
provides a lower bound for the virtual crossing number of virtual graph
diagrams.
