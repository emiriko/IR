These lecture notes provide a pedagogical introduction to a specific
continuum implementation of the Wilsonian renormalization group, the effective
average action. Its general properties and, in particular, its functional
renormalization group equation are explained in a simple scalar setting. The
approach is then applied to Quantum Einstein Gravity (QEG). The possibility of
constructing a fundamental theory of quantum gravity in the framework of
Asymptotic Safety is discussed and the supporting evidence is summarized.
