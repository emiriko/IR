The classical trajectories for FLRW universe with varying speed of light are
obtained for the cases in which the cosmological constant depends or not depend
on the velocity of light. The theory is then quantized and the corresponding
WDW equation is solved. It is shown that the method of causal interpretation of
Bohm can be applied successfully to the theory. Finally the Bohmian
trajectories are obtained and compared with the classical ones.
