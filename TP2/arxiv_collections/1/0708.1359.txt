The magnetic vortex with the in-plane curling magnetization and the
out-of-plane magnetization at the core is a unique ground state in nanoscale
magnetic elements. This kind of magnetic vortex can be used as a memory unit
for information storage, through its downward or upward core-orientation and,
thus, controllable core switching deserves some special attention. Our
analytical and micromagnetic calculations reveal that the origin of the vortex
core reversal is a gyrotropic field. This field is induced by vortex dynamic
motion and is proportional to the velocity of the moving vortex. Our
calculations elucidate the physical origin of the vortex core dynamic reversal
and offer a key to effective manipulation of the vortex-core orientation.
