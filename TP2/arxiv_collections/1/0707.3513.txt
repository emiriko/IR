We present measurements of resonant tunneling through discrete energy levels
of a silicon double quantum dot formed in a thin silicon-on-insulator layer. In
the absence of piezoelectric phonon coupling, spontaneous phonon emission with
deformation-potential coupling accounts for inelastic tunneling through the
ground states of the two dots. Such transport measurements enable us to observe
a Pauli spin blockade due to effective two-electron spin-triplet correlations,
evident in a distinct bias-polarity dependence of resonant tunneling through
the ground states. The blockade is lifted by the excited-state resonance by
virtue of efficient phonon emission between the ground states. Our experiment
demonstrates considerable potential for investigating silicon-based spin
dynamics and spin-based quantum information processing.
