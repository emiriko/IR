The International Roadmap for Ferroelectric Memories requires
three-dimensional integration of high-dielectric materials onto metal
interconnects or bottom electrodes by 2010. We report the first integration of
high-dielectric oxide films onto carbon nanotube electrodes with an aim of
ultra-high integration density of FeRAMs (Tb/in2).
