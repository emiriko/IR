Social interactions and personal tastes shape our consumption behavior of
cultural products. In this study, we present a computational model of a
cultural market and we aim to analyze the behavior of the consumer population
as an emergent phenomena. Our results suggest that the final market shares of
cultural products dramatically depend on consumer heterogeneity and social
interaction pressure. Furthermore, the relation between the resulting market
shares and social interaction is robust with respect to a wide range of
variation in the parameter values and the type of topology.
