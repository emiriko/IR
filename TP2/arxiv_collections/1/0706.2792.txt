Experimental one-way decoy pulse quantum key distribution running
continuously for 60 hours is demonstrated over a fiber distance of 20km. We
employ a decoy protocol which involves one weak decoy pulse and a vacuum pulse.
The obtained secret key rate is on average over 10kbps. This is the highest
rate reported using this decoy protocol over this fiber distance and duration.
