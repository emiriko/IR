We report $^{51}$V zero-field NMR of manganese vanadate spinel of
MnV$_2$O$_4$, together with both ac and dc magnetization measurements. The
field and temperature dependence of ac susceptibilities show a
reentrant-spin-glass-like behavior below the ferrimagnetic(FEM) ordering
temperature. The zero-field NMR spectrum consists of multiple lines ranging
from 240 MHz to 320 MHz. Its temperature dependence reveals that the ground
state is given by the simultaneous formation of a long-range FEM order and a
short-range order component. We attribute the spin-glass-like anomalies to
freezing and fluctuations of the short-range ordered state caused by the
competition between spin and orbital ordering of the V site.
