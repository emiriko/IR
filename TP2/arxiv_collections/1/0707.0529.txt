We propose a scheme to realize $1\to 2$ universal quantum cloning machine
(UQCM) with superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) qubits, embeded
in a high-Q cavity. CNOT operations are derived to present our scheme, and the
two-photon Raman resonance processes are used to increase the operation rate.
Compared with previous works, our scheme has advantages in the experimental
realization and further utilization.
