An effective theory based on ensembles of either regular gauge instantons or
merons is shown to produce confinement in SU(2) Yang-Mills theory. When the
scale is set by the string tension, the action density, topological
susceptibility and low-lying glueball spectrum are similar to those arising in
lattice QCD. The physical mechanism producing confinement is explained, and a
number of analytical insights into the effective theory are presented.
