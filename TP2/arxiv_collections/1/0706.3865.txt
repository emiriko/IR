This paper describes an optimization model for setting bid levels for certain
types of advertisements on web pages. This model is non-convex, but we are able
to obtain optimal or near-optimal solutions rapidly using branch and cut
open-source software. The financial benefits obtained using the prototype
system have been substantial.
