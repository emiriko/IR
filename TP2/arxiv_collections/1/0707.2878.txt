The search and the probe of the fundamental properties of Higgs boson(s) and,
in particular, the determination of their charge conjugation and parity (CP)
quantum numbers, is one of the main tasks of future high-energy colliders. We
demonstrate that the CP properties of a Standard Model-like Higgs particle can
be unambiguously assessed by measuring just the total cross section and the top
polarization in associated Higgs production with top quark pairs in e+e-
collisions.
