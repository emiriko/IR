The considerable center-of-mass energy and luminosity provided by the Large
Hadron Collider (LHC) will ensure a discovery reach for new particles which
extends well into the multi-TeV region. ATLAS and CMS have carried out many
studies of the implications of this capability for Beyond the Standard Model
physics. In this paper, we summarize some key results of studies involving
non-susy models, such as extra-dimensions, little higgs, compositeness, and
left-right symmetric models.
