We propose and numerically analyze novel reconfigurable logic gates using
"single-electron spin transistors" (SESTs), which are single-electron
transistors (SETs) with ferromagnetic electrodes and islands. The output
characteristics of a SEST depend on the relative magnetization configuration of
the ferromagnetic island with respect to the magnetization of the source and
the drain, i.e., high current drive capability in parallel magnetization and
low current drive capability in antiparallel magnetization. The summation of
multiple input signals can be achieved by directly coupling multiple input gate
electrodes to the SEST island, without using a floating gate. A Tucker-type
inverter with a variable threshold voltage, a reconfigurable AND/OR logic gate,
and a reconfigurable logic gate for all symmetric Boolean functions are
proposed and simulated using the Monte Carlo method.
