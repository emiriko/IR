Raman spectra of thin solid electrolyte films obtained by sputtering a
lithium sulfate target in nitrogen plasma are measured and compared to ab
initio electronic structure calculations for clusters composed of 28 atoms.
Agreement between measured and calculated spectra is obtained when oxygen atoms
are replaced by nitrogen atoms and when the nitrogen atoms form bonds with each
other. This suggests that the incorporation of nitrogen during the sputtering
process leads to structures in the film, which prevent crystallization of these
thin film salt glasses.
