We define and study virtual representation spaces having both positive and
negative dimensions at the vertices of a quiver without oriented cycles. We
consider the natural semi-invariants on these spaces which we call virtual
semi-invariants and prove that they satisfy the three basic theorems: the First
Fundamental Theorem, the Saturation Theorem and the Canonical Decomposition
Theorem. In the special case of Dynkin quivers with n vertices this gives the
fundamental interrelationship between supports of the semi-invariants and the
Tilting Triangulation of the (n-1)-sphere.
