High-resolution accelerometer and laser gyroscope measurements were performed
in the vicinity of spinning rings at cryogenic temperatures. After passing a
critical temperature, which does not coincide with the material's
superconducting temperature, the angular acceleration and angular velocity
applied to the rotating ring could be seen on the sensors although they are
mechanically de-coupled. A parity violation was observed for the laser
gyroscope measurements such that the effect was greatly pronounced in the
clockwise-direction only. The experiments seem to compare well with recent
independent tests obtained by the Canterbury Ring Laser Group and the
Gravity-Probe B satellite. All systematic effects analyzed so far are at least
3 orders of magnitude below the observed phenomenon. The available experimental
data indicates that the fields scale similar to classical frame-dragging
fields. A number of theories that predicted large frame-dragging fields around
spinning superconductors can be ruled out by up to 4 orders of magnitude.
