Radiative corrections of strong and electroweak interactions are presented at
next-to-leading order for the production of a Higgs boson plus two hard jets
via weak interactions at the LHC. The calculation includes all weak-boson
fusion and quark-antiquark annihilation diagrams as well as the corresponding
interferences. The electroweak corrections, which are discussed here for the
first time, reduce the cross sections by 5%, and thus are of the same order of
magnitude as the QCD corrections. As argued in previous papers, where s-channel
diagrams and interferences were neglected, the QCD corrections connected to
interference effects are small.
