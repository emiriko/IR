The OSGi Platform finds a growing interest in two different applications
domains: embedded systems, and applications servers. However, the security
properties of this platform are hardly studied, which is likely to hinder its
use in production systems. This is all the more important that the dynamic
aspect of OSGi-based applications, that can be extended at runtime, make them
vulnerable to malicious code injection. We therefore perform a systematic audit
of the OSGi platform so as to build a vulnerability catalog that intends to
reference OSGi Vulnerabilities originating in the Core Specification, and in
behaviors related to the use of the Java language. Standard Services are not
considered. To support this audit, a Semi-formal Vulnerability Pattern is
defined, that enables to uniquely characterize fundamental properties for each
vulnerability, to include verbose description in the pattern, to reference
known security protections, and to track the implementation status of the
proof-of-concept OSGi Bundles that exploit the vulnerability. Based on the
analysis of the catalog, a robust OSGi Platform is built, and recommendations
are made to enhance the OSGi Specifications.
