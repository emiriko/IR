It is theoretically shown that nanometric silver lamellar gratings present
very strong visible light absorption inside the grooves, leading to electric
field intensities by several orders of magnitude larger than that of the
impinging light. This effect, due to the excitation of long wave vector surface
plasmon polaritons with particular small penetration depth in the metal, may
explain the abnormal optical absorption observed a long time ago on almost flat
Ag films. Surface enhanced Raman scattering in rough metallic films could also
be due to the excitation of such plasmon polaritons in the grain boundaries or
notches of the films.
