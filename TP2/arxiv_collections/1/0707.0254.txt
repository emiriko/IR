We investigate magnetic-field asymmetries in the linear transport of a
mesoscopic conductor interacting with its environment. Interestingly, we find
that the interaction between the two systems causes an asymmetry only when the
environment is out of equilibrium. We elucidate our general result with the
help of a quantum dot capacitively coupled to a quantum Hall conductor and
discuss the asymmetry dependence on the environment bias and induced dephasing.
