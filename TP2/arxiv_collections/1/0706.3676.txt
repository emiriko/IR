Comment on the Waliszewski's article "A principle of fractal-sto-chastic
dualism and Gompertzian dynamics of growth and self-organization" (BioSystems
82 (2005)61-73) is presented. It has been proved that the main idea of this
work that Gompertzian dynamics is governed by the Schr\"{o}dinger-like equation
including anharmonic Morse potential has been already introduced by Molski and
Konarski in 2003. Some inconsistencies and mathematical errors in the
Waliszewski's model are also pointed out.
