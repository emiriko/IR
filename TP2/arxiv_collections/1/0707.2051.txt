We examine a proposed auction using quantum states to represent bids and
distributed adiabatic search to find the winner. When the auctioneer follows
the protocol, the final measurement giving the outcome of the auction also
destroys the bid states, thereby preserving privacy of losing bidders. We
describe how a dishonest auctioneer could alter the protocol to violate this
privacy guarantee, and present methods by which bidders can counter such
attacks. We also suggest possible quantum circuit implementations of the
auctions protocol, and quantum circuits to perpetrate and to counter attacks by
a dishonest auctioneer.
