Covariant version of the quark-parton model is studied. Dependence of the
structure functions and parton distributions on the 3D quark intrinsic motion
is discussed. The important role of the quark orbital momentum, which is a
particular case of intrinsic motion, appears as a direct consequence of the
covariant description. Effect of orbital motion is substantial especially for
polarized structure functions. At the same time, the procedure for obtaining
the quark momentum distributions of polarized quarks from the combination of
polarized and unpolarized structure functions is suggested.
