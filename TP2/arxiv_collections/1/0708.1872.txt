This is a written version of a series of lectures aimed at graduate students
and postdoctoral fellows in particle theory/string theory/particle experiment
familiar with the basics of the Standard Model. We begin with an overview of
flavor physics and its implications for new physics. We emphasize the "new
physics flavor puzzle". Then, we give four specific examples of flavor
measurements and the lessons that have been (or can be) drawn from them: (i)
Charm physics: lessons for supersymmetry from the upper bound on $\Delta m_D$.
(ii) Bottom physics: model independent lessons on the KM mechanism and on new
physics in neutral B mixing from $S_{\psi K_S}$. (iii) Top physics and beyond:
testing minimal flavor violation at the LHC. (iv) Neutrino physics:
interpreting the data on neutrino masses and mixing within flavor models.
