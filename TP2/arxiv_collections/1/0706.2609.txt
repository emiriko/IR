We perform a global parton fit to DIS and related data, including
next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) BFKL resummations in both the massless and
massive sectors. The resummed fit improves over a standard next-to-leading
order (NLO) DGLAP fit, with a positive definite gluon at the input scale as
opposed to the negative gluon seen at NLO. Furthermore, the predicted
longitudinal structure function is free of perturbative instability at small x,
and the reduced cross-section shows a turnover at high y (absent in the NLO
fit) consistent with the HERA data.
