We study long-distance effects in rare exclusive semileptonic decays B ->
K_{1}ell ^{+}ell ^{-}, K_{1} is the axial vector meson.The form factors,
describing the meson transition amplitudes of the effective Hamiltonian, are
calculated using Ward identites which are then used to calculate branching
ratio and forward-backward asymmetry in these decay modes. The zero of
forward-backward asymmetry is of special interest and provide us the precission
test of Standard model.
