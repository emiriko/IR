The latest results from the CDF and D0 collaborations on the top-quark
pair-production cross section and limits on electroweak production are
presented. Included are measurements of properties of the top quark such as
charge, lifetime, and the decay branching ratio t->Wb. In addition to
measurements about the top quark, the selected event samples are used to study
the helicity of the W boson and to search for additional exotic quarks (t') and
resonances in the ttbar invariant mass spectrum.
