A probe light in a squeezed vacuum state was injected into cold 87 $Rb atoms
with an intense control light in a coherent state. A sub-MHz window was created
due to electromagnetically induced transparency, and the incident squeezed
vacuum could pass through the cold atoms without optical loss, as was
successfully monitored using a time-domain homodyne method.
