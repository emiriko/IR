$Range$ and $load$ play keys on the problem of attacking on links in random
scale-free (RSF) networks. In this Brief Report we obtain the relation between
$range$ and $load$ in RSF networks analytically by the generating function
theory, and then give an estimation about the impact of attacks on the
$efficiency$ of the network. The analytical results show that short range
attacks are more destructive for RSF networks, and are confirmed numerically.
Further our results are consistent with the former literature (Physical Review
E \textbf{66}, 065103(R) (2002)).
