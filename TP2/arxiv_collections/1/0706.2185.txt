We discuss the effect of electron-electron interactions on the static
polarization properties of graphene beyond RPA. Divergent self-energy
corrections are naturally absorbed into the renormalized coupling constant
$\alpha$. We find that the lowest order vertex correction, which is the first
non-trivial correlation contribution, is finite, and about 30% of the RPA
result at strong coupling $\alpha \sim 1$. The vertex correction leads to
further reduction of the effective charge. Finite contributions to dielectric
screening are expected in all orders of perturbation theory.
