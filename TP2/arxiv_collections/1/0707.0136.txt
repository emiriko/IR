First, let the fractal dimension D=n(integer)+d(decimal), so the fractal
dimensional matrix was represented by a usual matrix adds a special decimal row
(column). We researched that mathematics, for example, the fractal dimensional
linear algebra, and physics may be developed to fractal and the complex
dimension extended from fractal. From this the fractal relativity is discussed,
which connects with self-similarity Universe and the extensive quantum theory.
The space dimension has been extended from real number to superreal and complex
number. Combining the quaternion, etc., the high dimensional time is
introduced. Such the vector and irreversibility of time are derived. Then the
fractal dimensional time is obtained, and space and time possess completely
symmetry. It may be constructed preliminarily that the higher dimensional,
fractal, complex and supercomplex space-time theory covers all. We propose a
generalized Noether theorem, and irreversibility of time should correspond to
non-conservation of a certain quantity. Resumed reversibility of time and
possible decrease of entropy are discussed. Finally, we obtain the quantitative
relations between energy-mass and space-time, which is consistent with the
space-time uncertainty relation in string theory.
