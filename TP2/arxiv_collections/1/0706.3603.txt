We show that the critical mass M_c=8\pi of bacterial populations in two
dimensions in the chemotactic problem is the counterpart of the critical
temperature T_c=GMm/4k_B of self-gravitating Brownian particles in
two-dimensional gravity. We obtain these critical values by using the Virial
theorem or by considering stationary solutions of the Keller-Segel model and
Smoluchowski-Poisson system. We also consider the case of one dimensional
systems and develop the connection with the Burgers equation. Finally, we
discuss the evolution of the system as a function of M or T in bounded and
unbounded domains in dimensions d=1, 2 and 3 and show the specificities of each
dimension. This paper aims to point out the numerous analogies between
bacterial populations, self-gravitating Brownian particles and, occasionally,
two-dimensional vortices.
