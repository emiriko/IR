We give an independent derivation of the Engle-Pereira-Rovelli spinfoam model
for quantum gravity which recently appeared in [arXiv:0705.2388]. Using the
coherent state techniques introduced earlier in [arXiv:0705.0674], we show that
the EPR model realizes a consistent imposition of the simplicity constraints
implementing general relativity from a topological BF theory.
