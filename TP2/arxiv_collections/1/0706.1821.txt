We demonstrate superradiant conversion between a two-mode collective atomic
state and a single-mode light field in an elongated cloud of Bose-condensed
atoms. Two off-resonant write beams induce superradiant Raman scattering,
producing two independent coherence gratings with a different wave vector in
the cloud. By applying phase-matched read beams after a controllable delay, the
gratings can be selectively converted into the light field also in a
superradiant way. Due to the large cooperativity parameter and the small
velocity width of the condensate, a high conversion efficiency of $> 70$ % and
a long storage time of $> 120$ $\mu$s were achieved.
