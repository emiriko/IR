We were able to quantize phenomenologically the first time the atomic and
nuclear rest masses. Note that this quantization rule is justified for atoms
and nuclei with different A, N and Z and the nuclei and atoms represent a
coherent synchronized systems - a complex of coupled oscillators (resonators).
The cooperative resonance synchronization mechanisms are responsible for
explanation of how the electron volt world can influence the nuclear mega
electron volt world. It means that we created new possibilities for inducing
and controlling nuclear reactions by atomic processes.
