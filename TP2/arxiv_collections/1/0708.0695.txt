A scanning superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) microscope
(SSM) is used to study the magnetic imaging of dynamic motion of quantized
interlayer vortices induced by the Lorentz force in anisotropic high-Tc
La_(1.87)Sr_(0.13)CuO_4 single crystals. It is found that 3 modes of flux
motion switch depending on the transport current. By increasing the current a
transition from the creep-like behavior of vortices to a steady flow of
vortices was observed. Even higher current induced a continuous expansion of
vortex-flow area indicating an inhomogeneous distribution of various pinning
centers.
