Addressing the recent criticisms of Kvinikhidze and Miller, we prove that the
spectator wave functions and currents based on ``fixed-axis'' polarization
states (previously introduced by us) are Lorentz covariant, and find an
explicit connection between them and conventional direction-dependent
polarization states. The discussion shows explicitly how it is possible to
construct pure $S$-wave models of the nucleon.
