Based on the Lifshitz theory we show that the illumination of one (Si) plate
in the three-layer systems Au--ethanol--Si, Si--ethanol--Si and
$\alpha$-Al${}_2$O${}_3$--ethanol--Si with laser pulses can change the Casimir
attraction to Casimir repulsion and vice versa. The proposed effect opens novel
opportunities in nanotechnology to actuate the periodic movement in electro-
and optomechanical micromachines based entirely on the zero-point oscillations
of the quantum vacuum without the action of mechanical springs.
