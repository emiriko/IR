The study of bosonic modes that couple to the charge carriers is a key
element in understanding superconductivity. Lee et al. have used
atomic-resolution scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STM) in an attempt to
extract the spectrum of of these modes in the high temperature superconductor
Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+d and they found a mode whose frequency did not depend on doping
but changed on 16O to 18O isotopic substitution leading them to suggest a role
for lattice modes (phonons). A careful examination of their published data
reveals a weaker but distinct feature that has all the characteristics of the
magnetic excitation identified as the bosonic mode in other competing
experiments. We suggest the lattice mode seen by Lee et al. is not relevant to
superconductivity and is due to inelastic tunneling through the insulating
oxide layer.
