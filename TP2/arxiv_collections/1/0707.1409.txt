A stochastic representation for the solutions of the Poisson-Vlasov equation,
with several charged species, is obtained. The representation involves both an
exponential and a branching process and it provides an intuitive
characterization of the nature of the solutions and its fluctuations. Here, the
stochastic representation is also proposed as a tool for the numerical
evaluation of the solutions
