We conjecture that certain patterns (scars), theoretically and numerically
predicted to be formed by electrons arranged on a sphere to minimize the
repulsive Coulomb potential (the Thomson problem) and experimentally found in
spherical crystals formed by self-assembled polystyrene beads (an instance of
the generalized Thomson problem), could be relevant to extend the classic
Caspar and Klug construction for icosahedrally-shaped virus capsids. The main
idea is that scars could be produced at an intermediate stage of the assembly
of the virus capsids and the release of the bending energy present in scars
into stretching energy could allow for a variety of non-spherical capsids'
shapes. The conjecture can be tested in experiments on the assembly of
artificial protein-cages where these scars should appear.
