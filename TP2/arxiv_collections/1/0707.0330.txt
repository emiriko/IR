We introduce an algebra qCCS of pure quantum processes in which no classical
data is involved, communications by moving quantum states physically are
allowed, and computations is modeled by super-operators. An operational
semantics of qCCS is presented in terms of (non-probabilistic) labeled
transition systems. Strong bisimulation between processes modeled in qCCS is
defined, and its fundamental algebraic properties are established, including
uniqueness of the solutions of recursive equations. To model sequential
computation in qCCS, a reduction relation between processes is defined. By
combining reduction relation and strong bisimulation we introduce the notion of
strong reduction-bisimulation, which is a device for observing interaction of
computation and communication in quantum systems. Finally, a notion of strong
approximate bisimulation (equivalently, strong bisimulation distance) and its
reduction counterpart are introduced. It is proved that both approximate
bisimilarity and approximate reduction-bisimilarity are preserved by various
constructors of quantum processes. This provides us with a formal tool for
observing robustness of quantum processes against inaccuracy in the
implementation of its elementary gates.
