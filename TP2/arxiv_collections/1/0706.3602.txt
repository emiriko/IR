We propose Weil and Cartan models for the equivariant cohomology of
noncommutative spaces which carry a covariant action of Drinfel'd twisted
symmetries. The construction is suggested by the noncommutative Weil algebra of
Alekseev and Meinrenken; we show that one can implement a Drinfel'd twist of
their models in order to take into account the noncommutativity of the spaces
we are acting on.
