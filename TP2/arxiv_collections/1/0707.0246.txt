We present in this paper a new tool for outliers detection in the context of
multiple regression models. This graphical tool is based on recursive
estimation of the parameters. Simulations were carried out to illustrate the
performance of this graphical procedure. As a conclusion, this tool is applied
to real data containing outliers according to the classical available tools.
