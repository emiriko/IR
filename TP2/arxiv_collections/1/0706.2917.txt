We derive a rigorous scaling law for minimizers in a natural version of the
regularized Cross-Newell model for pattern formation far from threshold. These
energy-minimizing solutions support defects having the same character as what
is seen in experimental studies of the corresponding physical systems and in
numerical simulations of the microscopic equations that describe these systems.
