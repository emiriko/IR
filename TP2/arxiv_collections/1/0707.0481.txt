In many modern applications, including analysis of gene expression and text
documents, the data are noisy, high-dimensional, and unordered--with no
particular meaning to the given order of the variables. Yet, successful
learning is often possible due to sparsity: the fact that the data are
typically redundant with underlying structures that can be represented by only
a few features. In this paper we present treelets--a novel construction of
multi-scale bases that extends wavelets to nonsmooth signals. The method is
fully adaptive, as it returns a hierarchical tree and an orthonormal basis
which both reflect the internal structure of the data. Treelets are especially
well-suited as a dimensionality reduction and feature selection tool prior to
regression and classification, in situations where sample sizes are small and
the data are sparse with unknown groupings of correlated or collinear
variables. The method is also simple to implement and analyze theoretically.
Here we describe a variety of situations where treelets perform better than
principal component analysis, as well as some common variable selection and
cluster averaging schemes. We illustrate treelets on a blocked covariance model
and on several data sets (hyperspectral image data, DNA microarray data, and
internet advertisements) with highly complex dependencies between variables.
