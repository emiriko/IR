Recently, the LUNA collaboration has carried out a high precision measurement
on the 3He(alpha,gamma)7Be reaction cross section with both activation and
on-line gamma-detection methods at unprecedented low energies. In this paper
the results obtained with the activation method are summarized. The results are
compared with previous activation experiments and the zero energy extrapolated
astrophysical S factor is determined using different theoretical models.
