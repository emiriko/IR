Let $\Omega\subset\C^n$ be a bounded smooth pseudoconvex domain. We show that
compactness of the complex Green operator $G_{q}$ on $(0,q)$-forms on $b\Omega$
implies compactness of the $\bar{\partial}$-Neumann operator $N_{q}$ on
$\Omega$. We prove that if $1 \leq q \leq n-2$ and $b\Omega$ satisfies $(P_q)$
and $(P_{n-q-1})$, then $G_{q}$ is a compact operator (and so is $G_{n-1-q}$).
Our method relies on a jump type formula to represent forms on the boundary,
and we prove an auxiliary compactness result for an `annulus' between two
pseudoconvex domains. Our results, combined with the known characterization of
compactness in the $\bar{\partial}$-Neumann problem on locally convexifiable
domains, yield the corresponding characterization of compactness of the complex
Green operator(s) on these domains.
