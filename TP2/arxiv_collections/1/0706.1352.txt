Although fully elastic when static, granular media become transiently elastic
when being slowly sheared -- during which both the elastic energy and stress
relax. Starting from this observation, we cogently derive the framework for
granular hydrodynamics, a set of differential equations consistent with general
principles of physics, especially reversible and irreversible thermodynamics.
In addition, an expression for the granular elastic energy is reviewed and
further discussed.
