The morphology of growing Pd nano-particles on MgO(001) surfaces have been
investigated in situ, during growth, by grazing incidence small angle x-ray
scattering, for different substrate temperatures. The 2D patterns obtained are
quantitatively analyzed, and the average morphological parameters (shape, size)
deduced. Above 650 K, the aggregates adopt their equilibrium shape of truncated
octahedron, and the interfacial energy is deduced.
