Kaon production is studied within the Giessen Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck
(GiBUU) model. Results are compared with experiment and with other models. The
influence of the kaon potential on the kaon azimuthal distributions at SIS
energies is considered. We also discuss the role of the many-body collisions at
high-density phase of reaction.
