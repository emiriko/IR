This paper presents the design and implementation of a Grid-enabled physics
analysis environment for handheld and other resource-limited computing devices
as one example of the use of mobile devices in eScience. Handheld devices offer
great potential because they provide ubiquitous access to data and
round-the-clock connectivity over wireless links. Our solution aims to provide
users of handheld devices the capability to launch heavy computational tasks on
computational and data Grids, monitor the jobs status during execution, and
retrieve results after job completion. Users carry their jobs on their handheld
devices in the form of executables (and associated libraries). Users can
transparently view the status of their jobs and get back their outputs without
having to know where they are being executed. In this way, our system is able
to act as a high-throughput computing environment where devices ranging from
powerful desktop machines to small handhelds can employ the power of the Grid.
The results shown in this paper are readily applicable to the wider eScience
community.
