The global features of spectrum of highly excited light nonstrange mesons can
be well understood within both chiral symmetry restoration scenario combined
with the relation $M^2\sim J+n$ and within nonrelativistic description based on
the relation $M^2\sim L+n$. The predictions of these two alternative
classifications for missing states are different and only future experiments
can distinguish between the two. We elaborate and compare systematically the
predictions of both schemes, which may serve as a suggestion for future
experiments devoted to the search for missing states.
