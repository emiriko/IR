The theoretical description of quantum phase transition, induced by the
external magnetic field, into antiferromagnetic state in the van Vleck -
singlet - magnet with a single-ion anisotropy of "easy-plane" type and ion spin
S=1 is proposed. It is shown that the spin polarization of the ground
non-degenerated state proves to be the order parameter of such a transition and
that the Landau thermodynamic approach can be employed for its (transition)
description. The magnetic properties which include the field behavior of the
magnetization and magnetic susceptibility of the antiferromagnetic phase in the
fields of different directions are studied. The peculiarities of induced
magnetostriction in van Vleck antiferromagnet, which as well as magnetization
has a singularity in the phase transition point, are investigated. An attempt
is made for qualitative comparison of results obtained with avaliable
experimental data.
