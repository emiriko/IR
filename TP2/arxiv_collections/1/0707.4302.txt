A new scenario, alternative to energy loss, for the observed suppression of
high-pT hadrons observed at RHIC is proposed. In the limit of a very dense
medium crated in nuclear collisions the mean free-path of the produced
(pre)hadron vanishes, and and the nuclear suppression, R_{AA} is completely
controlled by the production length. The RHIC data are well explained in a
parameter free way, and predictions for LHC are provided.
