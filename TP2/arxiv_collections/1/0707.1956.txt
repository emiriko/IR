We present a diagrammatic theory for coherent backscattering from disordered
dilute media in the nonlinear regime. The approach is non-perturbative in the
strength of the nonlinearity. We show that the coherent backscattering
enhancement factor is strongly affected by the nonlinearity, and corroborate
these results by numerical simulations. Our theory can be applied to several
physical scenarios like scattering of light in nonlinear Kerr media, or
propagation of matter waves in disordered potentials.
