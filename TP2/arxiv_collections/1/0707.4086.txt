The enhancement factors of the electric dipole moment (EDM) of the ground
states of two paramagnetic atoms; rubidium (Rb) and caesium (Cs) which are
sensitive to the electron EDM are computed using the relativistic
coupled-cluster theory and our results are compared with the available
calculations and measurements. The possibility of improving the limit for the
electron EDM using the results of our present work is pointed out.
