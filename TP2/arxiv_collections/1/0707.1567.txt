We use density-matrix theory to calculate the ultrafast dynamics of
unconventional superconductors from a microscopic viewpoint. We calculate the
time evolution of the optical conductivity as well as pump-probe spectra for a
d-wave order parameter. Three regimes can be distinguished in the spectra. The
Drude response at low photon energies is the only one of those which has been
measured experimentally so far. At higher energies, we predict two more
regimes: the pair-breaking peak, which is reduced as Cooper-pairs are broken up
by the exciting pulse; and a suppression above the pair-breaking peak due to
nonequilibrium quasiparticles. Furthermore, we consider the influence of the
electron-phonon coupling, and derive rate equations which have been widely used
so far.
