In this letter we propose an original mechanism to select scar modes through
coherent gain amplification in a multimode D-shaped fiber. More precisely, we
numerically demonstrate how scar modes can be amplified by positioning a gain
region in the vicinity of specific points of a short periodic orbit known to
give rise to scar modes.
