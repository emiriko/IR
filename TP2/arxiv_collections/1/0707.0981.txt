We describe the properties of a pair of ultracold bosonic atoms in a
one-dimensional harmonic trapping potential with a tunable zero-ranged barrier
at the trap centre. The full characterisation of the ground state is done by
calculating the reduced single-particle density, the momentum distribution and
the two-particle entanglement. We derive several analytical expressions in the
limit of infinite repulsion (Tonks-Girardeau limit) and extend the treatment to
finite interparticle interactions by numerical solution. As pair interactions
in double wells form a fundamental building block for many-body systems in
periodic potentials, our results have implications for a wide range of
problems.
