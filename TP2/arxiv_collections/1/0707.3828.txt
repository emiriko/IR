The structural, electronic and magnetic properties of Co$_n$ clusters
($n=2-$20) have been investigated using density functional theory within the
pseudopotential plane wave method. An unusual hexagonal growth pattern has been
observed in the intermediate size range, $n=15-$20. The cobalt atoms are
ferromagnetically ordered and the calculated magnetic moments are found to be
higher than that of corresponding hcp bulk value, which are in good agreement
with the recent Stern-Gerlach experiments. The average coordination number is
found to dominate over the average bond length to determine the effective
hybridization and consequently the cluster magnetic moment.
