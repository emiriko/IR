The solution of a fine tuning problem is one of the principal motivations of
Supersymmetry. However experimental constraints indicate that many
Supersymmetric models are also fine tuned (although to a much lesser extent).
We review the traditional measure of this fine tuning used in the literature
and propose an alternative. We apply this to the MSSM and show the
implications.
