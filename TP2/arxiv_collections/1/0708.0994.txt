A mechanism of light transmission through metallic films is proposed,
assisted by tunnelling between resonating buried dielectric inclusions. This is
illustrated by arrays of Si spheres embedded in Ag. Strong transmission peaks
are observed near the Mie resonances of the spheres. The interaction among
various planes of spheres and interference effects between these resonances and
the surface plasmons of Ag lead to mixing and splitting of the resonances.
Transmission is proved to be limited only by absorption. For small spheres, the
effective dielectric constant can be tuned to values close to unity and a
method is proposed to turn the resulting materials invisible.
