We report on quantum dot based Josephson junctions designed specifically for
measuring the supercurrent. From high-accuracy fitting of the current-voltage
characteristics we determine the full magnitude of the supercurrent (critical
current). Strong gate modulation of the critical current is observed through
several consecutive Coulomb blockade oscillations. The critical current crosses
zero close to, but not at, resonance due to the so-called 0-$\pi$ transition in
agreement with a simple theoretical model.
