We analyze the dynamics of ultracold atoms in optical lattices induced by a
sudden shift of the underlying harmonic trapping potential. In order to study
the effect of strong interactions, dimensionality and lattice topology on
transport properties, we consider bosonic atoms with arbitrarily strong
repulsive interactions, on a two-dimensional square lattice and a hexagonal
lattice. On the square lattice we find insulating behavior for weakly
interacting atoms and slow relaxation for strong interactions, even when a Mott
plateau is present, which in one dimension blocks the dynamics. On the
hexagonal lattice the center of mass relaxes to the new equilibrium for any
interaction strength.
