We study the longitudinal polarization of the Sigma_bar and Xi_bar
anti-hyperons in polarized high energy pp collisions at large transverse
momenta, extending a recent study for the Lambda_bar anti-hyperon. We make
predictions by using different parametrizations of the polarized parton
densities and models for the polarized fragmentation functions. Similar to the
Lambda_bar polarization, the Xi_bar0 and Xi_bar+ polarizations are found to be
sensitive to the polarized anti-strange sea in the nucleon. The Sigma_bar- and
Sigma_bar+ polarizations show sensitivity to the light sea quark polarizations,
\Delta \bar u(x) and \Delta \bar d(x), and their asymmetry.
