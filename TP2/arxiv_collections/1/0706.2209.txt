A new Lorentz-covariant gauge is presented for SU(3). In this gauge, both the
ghosts and the gauge fields in the (4, 5, 6, 7) gauge directions acquire
half-integral spin. As a result, the ghosts in these directions have the
correct relationship between spin and statistics, while the gauge fields have
the incorrect relationship. Consequently, asymptotic ghost states are not
forbidden in this gauge and can possibly form new matter states. Conversely,
asymptotic gauge fields in the (4, 5, 6, 7) directions are forbidden in this
gauge, so the SU(3) symmetry is broken down to an SU(2)xU(1) symmetry
asymptotically.
