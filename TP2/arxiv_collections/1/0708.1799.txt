The dream of every surfer is an extremely steep wave propagating at the
highest speed possible. The best waves for this would be shock waves, but are
very hard to surf. In the nanoscopic world the same is true: the surfers in
this case are electrons riding through nanomechanical devices on acoustic waves
[1]. Naturally, this has a broad range of applications in sensor technology and
for communication electronics for which the combination of an electronic and a
mechanical degree of freedom is essential. But this is also of interest for
fundamental aspects of nano-electromechanical systems (NEMS), when it comes to
quantum limited displacement detection [2] and the control of phonon number
states [3]. Here, we study the formation of shock waves in a NEMS resonator
with an embedded two-dimensional electron gas using surface acoustic waves. The
mechanical displacement of the nano-resonator is read out via the induced
acoustoelectric current. Applying acoustical standing waves we are able to
determine the anomalous acoustocurrent. This current is only found in the
regime of shock wave formation. We ontain very good agreement with model
calculations.
