The addition of an adjoint Polyakov loop term to the action of a pure gauge
theory at finite temperature leads to new phases of SU(N) gauge theories. For
SU(3), a new phase is found which breaks Z(3) symmetry in a novel way; for
SU(4), the new phase exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking of Z(4) to Z(2),
representing a partially confined phase in which quarks are confined, but
diquarks are not. The overall phase structure and thermodynamics is consistent
with a theoretical model of the effective potential for the Polyakov loop based
on perturbation theory.
