The finite size effects and relativistic corrections in pionic and kaonic
hydrogen are evaluated by generalizing the Breit equation for a spin-0 -
spin-1/2 amplitude with the inclusion of the hadron electromagnetic form
factors. The agreement of the relativistic corrections to the energies of the
mesonic atoms with other methods used to evaluate them is not exact, but
reasonably good. The precision values of the energy shifts due to the strong
interaction, extracted from data, are however subject to the hadronic form
factor uncertainties.
