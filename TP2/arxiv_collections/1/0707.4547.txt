We numerically construct and study the control landscape of a
$(\omega,2\omega)$ bichromatically driven double well in the presence of strong
fields. The control landscape is obtained by correlating the overlap
intensities between the floquet states and an initial phase space coherent
state with the parametric motion of the quasienergies {\it i.e.,}
intensity-level velocity correlator. "Walls" of no control, robust under
variations of the relative phase between the fields, are seen in the control
landscape and associated with multilevel interactions involving chaotic floquet
states.
