The 1H-NMR spectrum and nuclear relaxation rate 1/T_1 in the
antiferromagnetic wheel CsFe8 were measured to characterize the previously
observed magnetic field-induced low-temperature phase around the level crossing
at 8 T. The data show that the phase is characterized by a huge staggered
transverse polarization of the electronic Fe spins, and the opening of a gap,
providing microscopic evidence for the interpretation of the phase as a
field-induced magneto-elastic instability.
