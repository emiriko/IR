It is shown that the deformed Macdonald-Ruijsenaars operators can be
described as the restrictions on certain affine subvarieties of the usual
Macdonald-Ruijsenaars operator in infinite number of variables. The ideals of
these varieties are shown to be generated by the Macdonald polynomials related
to Young diagrams with special geometry. The super Macdonald polynomials and
their shifted version are introduced, the combinatorial formulas for them are
given.
