A unifying framework for the study of causal relations is presented. The
causal relations are regarded as subsets of M x M and the role of the
corresponding antisymmetry conditions in the construction of the causal ladder
is stressed. The causal hierarchy of spacetime is built from chronology up to
K-causality and new characterizations of the distinction and strong causality
properties are obtained. The closure of the causal future is not transitive, as
a consequence its repeated composition leads to an infinite causal subladder
between strong causality and K-causality - the A-causality subladder. A
spacetime example is given which proves that K-causality differs from infinite
A-causality.
