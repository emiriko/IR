There are many materials whose dielectric properties are described by a
stretched exponential, the so-called Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts (KWW) relaxation
function. Its physical origin and statistical-mechanical foundation have been a
matter of debate in the literature. In this paper we suggest a model of
dielectric relaxation, which naturally leads to a stretched exponential decay
function. Some essential characteristics of the underlying charge conduction
mechanisms are considered. A kinetic description of the relaxation and charge
transport processes is proposed in terms of equations with time-fractional
derivatives.
