We reinvestigate the cosmological Polonyi problem in the case where the
Polonyi mass is $\mathcal{O}(10) \rm{TeV}$. Such a large supersymmetry breaking
scale implies that the Polonyi field should be sequestered from the standard
model sector. Since the Polonyi field does not have a coupling to the gauge
multiplets at tree level, in order to obtain sufficiently high reheating
temperature compatible with the standard big-bang nucleosynthesis the Polonyi
mass well exceeds 100 - 1000 TeV, depending on the decay channels. Moreover, we
find that the branching ratio of the Polonyi field into neutralinos is of order
unity, and thus the resulting neutralino LSPs, if stable, overclose the
Universe even for the case of the wino-like LSP. Our explicit computation given
here exhibits a very serious cosmological difficulty for models where
supersymmetry breaking is caused by the Polonyi-type field.
