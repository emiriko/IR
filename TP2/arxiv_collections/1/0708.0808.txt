We compare pseudopure state ensemble implementations, quantified by their
initial polarization and ensemble size, of Grover's search algorithm to
probabilistic classical sequential search algorithms in terms of their success
and failure probabilities. We propose a criterion for quantifying the resources
used by the ensemble implementation via the aggregate number of oracle
invocations across the entire ensemble and use this as a basis for comparison
with classical search algorithms. We determine bounds for a critical
polarization such that the ensemble algorithm succeeds with a greater
probability than the probabilistic classical sequential search. Our results
indicate that the critical polarization scales as N^(-1/4) where N is the
database size and that for typical room temperature solution state NMR, the
polarization is such that the ensemble implementation of Grover's algorithm
would be advantageous for N > 10^22
