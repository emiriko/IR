The nature of the electromagnetic (EM) energy for general charge and current
distributions is analyzed. There are two well known forms for calculating EM
energy as the integral over all space of either the electromagnetic fields:
$u_{\bf EB}=({\bf E\bcdot D+B\bcdot H})/8\pi$, or the electromagnetic
potentials and charge-current densities: $u_{\rho{\bf A}}=1/2(\rho\phi+{\bf
j\bcdot A})$. We discuss the appropriate use of each of these forms in
calculating the total EM energy and the EM energy within a limited volume. We
conclude that only the form $u_{\bf EB}$ can be considered as a suitable EM
energy density, while either form can be integrated to find the total EM
energy. However, bounding surface integrals (if they don't vanish) must be
included when using the $u_{\bf EB}$ form. Including these surface integrals
resolves some seeming paradoxes in the energy of electric or magnetic dipoles
in uniform fields
