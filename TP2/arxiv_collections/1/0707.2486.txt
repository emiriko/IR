Preliminary measurements are reported on the azimuthal single-spin asymmetry
of exclusive rho0 mesons for a transversely polarized hydrogen target at HERMES
using the 27.6 GeV HERA positron beam. Within the generalized parton
distribution (GPD) formalism, this asymmetry is sensitive to the total angular
momentum of quarks and gluons in the nucleon. Since the GPD formalism is only
valid for mesons produced by longitudinal photons, the transverse target-spin
asymmetry of longitudinal rho0 mesons is extracted assuming s-channel helicity
conservation and compared to theoretical calculations.
