We demonstrate slow and stored light in Rb vapor with a combination of
desirable features: minimal loss and distortion of the pulse shape, and large
fractional delay (> 10). This behavior is enabled by: (i) a group index that
can be controllably varied during light pulse propagation; and (ii)
controllable gain integrated into the medium to compensate for pulse loss. Any
medium with the above two characteristics should be able to realize similarly
high-performance slow light.
