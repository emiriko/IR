It is generally considered as self evident that the lifetime of our vacuum in
the landscape of string theory cannot be much shorter than the current age of
the universe. Here I show why this lower limit is invalid. A certain type of
``parallel universes'' is a necessary consequence of the string-landscape
dynamics and might well allow us to ``survive'' vacuum decay. As a consequence
our stringy vacuum's lifetime is empirically unconstrained and could be very
short. Based on this counter-intuitive insight I propose a novel type of
laboratory experiment that searches for an apparent violation of the
quantum-mechanical Born rule by gravitational effects on vacuum decay. If the
lifetime of our vacuum should turn out to be shorter than 6 x 10^{-13} seconds
such an experiment is sufficiently sensitive to determine its value with
state-of-the-art equipment.
