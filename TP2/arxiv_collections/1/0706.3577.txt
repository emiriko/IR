We predict that parametric sum-frequency generation of an ultra-short pulse
may result from the mixing of an ultra-short optical pulse with a
quasi-continuous wave control. We analytically show that the intensity, time
duration and group velocity of the generated idler pulse may be controlled in a
stable manner by adjusting the intensity level of the background pump.
