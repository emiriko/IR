A quantum system put in interaction with another one that is repeatedly
measured is subject to a non-unitary dynamics, through which it is possible to
extract subspaces. This key idea has been exploited to propose schemes aimed at
the generation of pure quantum states (purification). All such schemes have so
far been considered in the ideal situations of isolated systems. In this paper,
we analyze the influence of non-negligible interactions with environment during
the extraction process, with the scope of investigating the possibility of
purifying the state of a system in spite of the sources of dissipation. A
general framework is presented and a paradigmatic example consisting of two
interacting spins immersed in a bosonic bath is studied. The effectiveness of
the purification scheme is discussed in terms of purity for different values of
the relevant parameters and in connection with the bath temperature.
