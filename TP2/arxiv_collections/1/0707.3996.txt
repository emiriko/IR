A simple string model inspired by the strong-coupling regime of Quantum
ChromoDynamics is used as a potential for studying the spectrum of multiquark
systems with two quarks and two antiquarks, with a careful treatment of the
four-body problem. It is found that the ground state is stable, lying below the
threshold for dissociation into two isolated mesons.
