To a compact hyperbolic Riemann surface, we associate a finitely summable
spectral triple whose underlying topological space is the limit set of a
corresponding Schottky group, and whose ``Riemannian'' aspect (Hilbert space
and Dirac operator) encode the boundary action through its Patterson-Sullivan
measure. We prove that the ergodic rigidity theorem for this boundary action
implies that the zeta functions of the spectral triple suffice to characterize
the (anti-)conformal isomorphism class of the corresponding Riemann surface.
Thus, you can hear the shape of a Riemann surface, by listening to a suitable
spectral triple.
