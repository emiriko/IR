The mechanisms for generation of long-lived spin coherence in a
two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) have been studied experimentally by means
of a picosecond pump-probe Kerr rotation technique. CdTe/(Cd,Mg)Te quantum
wells with a diluted 2DEG were investigated. The strong Coulomb interaction
between electrons and holes, which results in large binding energies of neutral
excitons and negatively charged excitons (trions), allows one to address
selectively the exciton or trion states by resonant optical excitation.
Different scenarios of spin coherence generation were analyzed theoretically,
among them the direct trion photocreation, the formation of trions from
photogenerated excitons and the electron-exciton exchange scattering. Good
agreement between experiment and theory is found.
