We consider the dynamics of skew product maps associated with finitely
generated semigroups of rational maps on the Riemann sphere. We show that under
some conditions on the dynamics and the potential function \psi, there exists a
unique equilibrium state for \psi and a unique $\exp(\P(\psi)-\psi)$-conformal
measure, where P(\psi) denotes the topological pressure of \psi.
