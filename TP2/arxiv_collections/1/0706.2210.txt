Semi-leptonic electroweak interactions in nuclei - such as \beta decay, \mu
capture, charged- and neutral-current neutrino reactions, and electron
scattering - are described by a set of multipole operators carrying definite
parity and angular momentum, obtained by projection from the underlying nuclear
charge and three-current operators. If these nuclear operators are approximated
by their one-body forms and expanded in the nucleon velocity through order
|\vec{p}|/M, where \vec{p} and M are the nucleon momentum and mass, a set of
seven multipole operators is obtained. Nuclear structure calculations are often
performed in a basis of Slater determinants formed from harmonic oscillator
orbitals, a choice that allows translational invariance to be preserved.
Harmonic-oscillator single-particle matrix elements of the multipole operators
can be evaluated analytically and expressed in terms of finite polynomials in
q^2, where q is the magnitude of the three-momentum transfer. While results for
such matrix elements are available in tabular form, with certain restriction on
quantum numbers, the task of determining the analytic form of a response
function can still be quite tedious, requiring the folding of the tabulated
matrix elements with the nuclear density matrix, and subsequent algebra to
evaluate products of operators. Here we provide a Mathematica script for
generating these matrix elements, which will allow users to carry out all such
calculations by symbolic manipulation. This will eliminate the errors that may
accompany hand calculations and speed the calculation of electroweak nuclear
cross sections and rates. We illustrate the use of the new script by
calculating the cross sections for charged- and neutral-current neutrino
scattering in ^{12}C.
