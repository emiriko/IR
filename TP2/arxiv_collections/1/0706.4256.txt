We theoretically explore the possibility of a superconducting proximity
effect in single-walled metallic carbon nanotubes due to the presence of a
superconducting substrate. An unconventional double-gap situation can arise in
the two bands for nanotubes of large radius wherein the tunneling is (almost)
symmetric in the two sublattices. In such a case, a proximity effect can take
place in the symmetric band below a critical experimentally-accessible Coulomb
interaction strength in the nanotube. Furthermore, due to interactions in the
nanotube, the appearance of a BCS gap in this band stabilizes superconductivity
in the other band at lower temperatures. We also discuss the scenario of highly
asymmetric tunneling and show that this case too supports double-gap
superconductivity.
