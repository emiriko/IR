We discuss a superluminal unphysical motion which, we believe, has a high
pedagogical potential. It highlights the physics behind the concept of
simultaneity in special relativity and illustrates the non-physical character
of superluminal speeds offering a rewarding exercise in handling the Minkowski
space-time diagram.
