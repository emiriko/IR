We explore the electronic properties of finite-length graphene nanoribbons as
well as graphene nanodisks with various sizes and shapes in quest of metallic
ones. For this purpose it is sufficient to search zero-energy states. We find
that there exist no zero-energy states in finite-length zigzag nanoribbons
though all infinite-length zigzag nanoribbons have zero-energy states. The
occurrence of zero-energy states is surprisingly rare. Among typical nanodisks,
only trigonal zigzag nanodisks have degenerate zero-energy states and show
metallic ferromagnetism, where the degeneracy can be controlled arbitrarily by
designing the size. A remarkable property is that the relaxation time is quite
large in spite of its small size in trigonal zigzag nanodisks.
