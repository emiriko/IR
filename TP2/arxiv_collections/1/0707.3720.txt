Particle production in Au-Au, Cu-Cu, d-Au and p-p collisions at 200 GeV c.m.
energy are analyzed in the wounded quark-diquark model. Existing data are well
reproduced. Emission functions of wounded and unwounded constituents are
determined. Implications for the collective evolution of the system are
discussed.
