The singular manifold method from the Painleve analysis can be used to
investigate many important integrable properties for the nonlinear partial
differential equations.In this paper, the two-singular-manifold method is
applied to the (2+1)-dimensional Gardner equation with two Painleve expansion
branches to determine the Hirota bilinear form, Backlund transformation, Lax
pairs and Darboux transformation. Based on the obtained Lax pairs, the binary
Darboux transformation is constructed and the N N Grammian solution is also
derived by performing the iterative algorithm Ntimes with symbolic computation.
