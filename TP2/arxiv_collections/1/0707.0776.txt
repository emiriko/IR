We report the measurement of Beliaev damping of bulk excitations in cigar
shaped Bose Einstein condensates of atomic vapor. By using post selection,
excitation line shapes of the total population are compared with those of the
undamped excitations. We find that the damping depends on the initial
excitation energy of the decaying quasi particle, as well as on the excitation
momentum. We model the condensate as an infinite cylinder and calculate the
damping rates of the different radial modes. The derived damping rates are in
good agreement with the experimentally measured ones. The damping rates
strongly depend on the destructive interference between pathways for damping,
due to the quantum many-body nature of both excitation and damping products.
