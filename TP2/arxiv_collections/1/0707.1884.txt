A generalized Fermi-Bose mapping method is used to determine the exact ground
states of six models of strongly interacting ultracold gases of two-level atoms
in tight waveguides, which are generalizations of the Tonks-Girardeau (TG) gas
(1D Bose gas with point hard cores) and fermionic Tonks-Girardeau (FTG) gas (1D
spin-aligned Fermi gas with infinitely strong zero-range attractions). Three of
these models exhibit a quantum phase transition in the presence of an external
magnetic field, associated with a cooperative ground state rearrangement
wherein Fermi energy is traded for internal excitation energy. After
investigation of these models in the absence of an electromagnetic field, one
is generalized to include resonant interactions with a single photon mode,
leading to a possible thermal phase transition associated with Dicke
superradiance.
