Lifetimes of the first two metastable states in Sc^{2+} and Y^{2+} are
determined using the relativistic coupled-cluster theory. There is a
considerable interest in studying the electron correlation effects in these
ions as though their electronic configurations are similar to the neutral
alkali atoms, their structures are very different from the latter. We have made
a comparative study of the correlation trends between the above doubly ionized
systems with their corresponding neutral and singly ionized iso-electronic
systems. The lifetimes of the excited states of these ions are very important
in the field of astrophysics, especially for the study of post-main sequence
evolution of the cool giant stars.
