Here Randall-Sundrum brane-gravity models of the homogeneous and flat
universe, dominated by phantom fluid, is considered. It is noted that
brane-gravity corrections effect the behaviour of phantom fluid in RS-II model
(where brane-tension $\lambda$ is negative) drastically. It is interesting to
see that, phantom fluid violates the weak energy condition (WEC) till energy
density $\rho < \lambda$, but when phantom energy density $\rho$ grows more,
the effective equation of state does not violate WEC. Moreover, with increasing
phantom energy density, a stage comes when even strong energy condition is not
violated due to effect of these corrections. Also expansion stops, when $\rho =
2 \lambda$. As a consequence, RS-II phantom universe accelerates upto a finite
time explaining the present cosmic acceleration, but it decelerates later.Thus,
RS-II phantom universe is singularity-free. In the case of RS-I model, where
$\lambda$ is positive, characteristics of phantom fluid is not suppressed by
brane-corrections and phantom universe accelerates ending up in big-rip
singularity in finite future time.
