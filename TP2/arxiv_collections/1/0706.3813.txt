We study entanglement dynamics between four qubits interacting through two
isolated Jaynes-Cummings hamiltonians, via the entanglement measure based on
the wedge product. We compare the results with similar results obtained using
bipartite concurrence resulting in what is referred to as "entanglement sudden
death". We find a natural entanglement invariant under evolution demonstrating
that entanglement sudden death is caused by ignoring (tracing over) some of the
system's degrees of freedom that become entangled through the interaction.
