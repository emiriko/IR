The Brans-Dicke Theory of Gravity is one of the most promising alternatives
to the Einstein's Theory of General Relativity. We have examined an action term
with wrong signs for both the kinetic and mass terms for the scalar field and
have found solutions for both the scale factor of the universe and the
Brans-Dicke scalar field which vary exponentially in time.
