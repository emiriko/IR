We present measurements of the branching fractions for B0 meson decays to
eta'K0 and omegaK0, and of the branching fractions and CP-violation charge
asymmetries for B+ meson decays to etapi+, etaK+, eta'pi+, eta'K+, omegapi+,
and omegaK+. The data, collected with the BABAR detector at the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center, represent 383 million BBbar pairs produced in e+e-
annihilation. The measurements agree with previous results; we find no evidence
for direct CP violation.
