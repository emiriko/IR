We consider a nonlinear integral equation with infinitely many derivatives
that appears when a system of interacting open and closed strings is
investigated if the nonlocality in the closed string sector is neglected. We
investigate the properties of this equation, construct an iterative method for
solving it, and prove that the method converges.
