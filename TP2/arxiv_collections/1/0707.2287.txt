We analyze the salient features of vortex-ring solitons supported by
cylindrically symmetric media with nonlocal thermal nonlinearity. We discover
the existence of a maximum allowed topological charge for such vortex solitons
to be stable on propagation: Only vortex-ring solitons with topological charge
m<=2 are found to be stable. This remarkable result holds independently of the
radius of the sample.
