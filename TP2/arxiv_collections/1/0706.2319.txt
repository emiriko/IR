The elasticity difference tensor, used in [1] to describe elasticity
properties of a continuous medium filling a space-time, is here analysed from
the point of view of the space-time connection. Principal directions associated
with this tensor are compared with eigendirections of the material metric.
Examples concerning spherically symmetric and axially symmetric space-times are
then presented.
