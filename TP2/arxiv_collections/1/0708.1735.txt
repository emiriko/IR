Based upon the observations (i) that their in-plane lattice constants match
almost perfectly and (ii) that their electronic structures overlap in
reciprocal space for one spin direction only, we predict perfect spin filtering
for interfaces between graphite and (111) fcc or (0001) hcp Ni or Co. The spin
filtering is quite insensitive to roughness and disorder. The formation of a
chemical bond between graphite and the open $d$-shell transition metals that
might complicate or even prevent spin injection into a single graphene sheet
can be simply prevented by dusting Ni or Co with one or a few monolayers of Cu
while still preserving the ideal spin injection property.
