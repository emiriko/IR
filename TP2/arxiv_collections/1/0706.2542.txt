The magnetic field (or electric current) driven domain-wall motion in
magnetic nanostripes is of considerable interest because it is essential to the
performance of information storage and logic devices. One of the currently key
problems is to unveil the complex behaviors of oscillatory domain-wall motions
under applied magnetic fields stronger than the so-called Walker field, beyond
which the velocity of domain walls markedly drops. Here, we provide not only
considerably better understandings but also new details of the complex
domain-wall motions. In a certain range just above the Walker field, the
motions are not chaotic but rather periodic with different unique periodicities
of dynamic transformations of a moving domain wall between the different types
of its internal structure. Three unique periodicities found, which consist of
different types of domain wall that are transformed from type one to another.
The transformation periods vary with the field strength and the nanostripe
width. This novel phenomenon can be described by the dynamic motion of a
limited number of magnetic topological solitons such as vortex and antivortex
in nanostripes.
