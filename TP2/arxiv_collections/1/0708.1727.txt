We consider the tropical variety $\mathcal{T}(I)$ of a prime ideal $I$
generated by the polynomials $f_1, ..., f_r$ and revisit the regular projection
technique introduced by Bieri and Groves from a computational point of view. In
particular, we show that $I$ has a short tropical basis of cardinality at most
$r + \codim I + 1$ at the price of increased degrees, and we provide a
computational description of these bases.
