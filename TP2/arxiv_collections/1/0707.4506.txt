The ionosphere is the only large-scale plasma laboratory without walls that
we have direct access to. From results obtained in systematic, repeatable
experiments in this natural laboratory, where we can vary the stimulus and
observe its response in a controlled, repeatable manner, we can draw
conclusions on similar physical processes occurring naturally in the Earth's
plasma environment as well as in parts of the plasma universe that are not
easily accessible to direct probing.
  Of particular interest is electromagnetic turbulence excited in the
ionosphere by beams of particles (photons, electrons) and its manifestation in
terms of secondary radiation (electrostatic and electromagnetic waves),
structure formation (solitons, cavitons, alfveons, striations), and the
associated exchange of energy, linear momentum, and angular momentum.
  We present a new diagnostic technique, based on vector radio allowing the
utilization of EM angular momentum (vorticity), to study plasma turbulence
remotely.
