We study mass fluxes in aggregation models where mass transfer to large
scales by aggregation occurs alongside desorption or fragmentation. Two models
are considered. (1) A system of diffusing, aggregating particles with influx
and outflux of particles (in-out model) (2) A system of diffusing aggregating
particles with fragmentation (chipping model). Both these models can exist in
phases where probability distributions are power laws. In these power law
phases, we argue that the two point correlation function should have a certain
homogeneity exponent. These arguments are based on the exact constant flux
scaling valid for simple aggregation with input. Predictions are compared with
Monte Carlo simulations.
