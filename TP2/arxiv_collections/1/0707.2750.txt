A single-column model run under the weak temperature gradient approximation,
a parameterization of large-scale dynamics appropriate for the tropical
atmosphere, is shown to have multiple stable equilibria. Under conditions
permitting persistent deep convection, the model has a statistically steady
state in which such convection occurs, as well as an extremely dry state in
which convection does not occur. Which state is reached depends on the initial
moisture profile.
