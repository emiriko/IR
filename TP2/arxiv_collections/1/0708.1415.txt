The production of dijets in diffractive deep inelastic scattering has been
measured with the ZEUS detector at HERA using an integrated luminosity of $61
\pbi$. The dijet cross section has been measured for virtualities of the
exchanged virtual photon, $5 < Q^2 < 100 \gev^2$, and $\gamma^{*} p$
centre-of-mass energies, 100 < W < 250 GeV. The jets, identified using the
inclusive k_{T} algorithm in the $\gamma^* p$ frame, were required to have a
transverse energy $E^*_{T, \rm jet} > 4 \gev$ and the jet with the highest
transverse energy was required to have $E^*_{T,\rm jet} > 5 \gev$. All jets
were required to be in the pseudorapidity range $-3.5 < \eta^*_{\rm jet} < 0$.
The differential cross sections are compared to leading-order predictions and
next-to-leading-order QCD calculations based on recent diffractive parton
densities extracted from inclusive diffractive deep inelastic scattering data.
