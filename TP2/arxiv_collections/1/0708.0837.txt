Charge impurities in graphene can host an infinite family of Rydberg-like
resonance states of massless Dirac particles. These states, appearing for
supercritical charge, are described by Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization of
collapsing classical trajectories that descend on point charge, in analogy to
Rydberg states relation with planetary orbits. We argue that divalent and
trivalent charge impurities in graphene is an ideal system for realization of
this atomic collapse regime. Strong coupling of these states to the Dirac
continuum via Klein tunneling leads to striking resonance effects with direct
signatures in transport, local properties and enhancement of the Kondo effect.
