The Gaussian quantum key distribution protocol based on coherent states and
heterodyne detection [Phys. Rev. Lett. 93, 170504 (2004)] has the advantage
that no active random basis switching is needed on the receiver's side. Its
security is, however, not very satisfyingly understood today because the bounds
on the secret key rate that have been derived from Heisenberg relations are not
attained by any known scheme. Here, we address the problem of the optimal
Gaussian individual attack against this protocol, and derive tight upper bounds
on the information accessible to an eavesdropper. The optical scheme achieving
this bound is also exhibited, which concludes the security analysis of this
protocol.
