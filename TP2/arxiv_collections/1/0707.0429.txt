We consider the axion arising from five-dimensional supergravity in the
presence of boundaries. We find the approximate bosonic effective action to
estimate the lower bound on the "Peccei-Quinn" energy scale with a flat bulk.
With a warped bulk, one can obtain a scale within the standard window; this
puts a bound on the required curvature scale relative to the proper separation
between boundaries. We comment on the scalar potential that may ruin the
strong-CP resolution, and the effective derivative coupling to matter in 5D
hypermultiplets.
