The interplay of the effects of geometry and collective motion on d-$\alpha$
correlation functions is investigated for central Xe+Au collisions at E/A=50
MeV. The data cannot be explained without collective motion, which could be
partly along the beam axis. A semi-quantitative description of the data can be
obtained using a Monte-Carlo model, where thermal emission is superimposed on
collective motion. Both the emission volume and the competition between the
thermal and collective motion influence significantly the shape of the
correlation function, motivating new strategies for extending intensity
interferometry studies to massive particles.
