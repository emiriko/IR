We study shot noise in the current of quantum dots whose low-energy behaviour
corresponds to an SU(N) Kondo model, focusing on the case N=4 relevant to
carbon nanotube dots. For general N, two-particle Fermi liquid interactions
have two distinct effects: they can enhance the noise via back-scattering
processes with an N-dependent effective charge, and can also modify the
coherent partition noise already present without interactions. For N=4, in
contrast to the SU(2) case, interactions enhance shot noise solely through an
enhancement of partition noise. This leads to a non-trivial prediction for
experiment.
