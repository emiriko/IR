When the vacuum fluctuation pressure is calculated directly from fundamental
principles of quantum field theory, in the same manner as vacuum fluctuation
energy density is commonly calculated, one finds it is not equal to the
negative of the vacuum fluctuation energy density. Thus, vacuum fluctuations
cannot manifest as a cosmological constant of any order.
