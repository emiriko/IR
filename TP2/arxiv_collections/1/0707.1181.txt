In Einstein gravity, for an inhomogeneous phantom energy distribution having
linear equation of state (but anisotropic), there exists simple exact solution
for spherically symmetric space time describing a wormhole. At infinity, the
space time is not asymptotically flat and possesses a regular cosmological
Killing horizon with an infinite area. In this work, we have shown that, this
wormhole solution is also possible in brane world for various matter
distribution, which are not necessarily phantom in nature.
