We study heat conduction in (n, 0)/(2n, 0) intramolecular junctions by using
molecular dynamics method. It is found that the heat conduction is asymmetric,
namely, heat transports preferably in one direction. This phenomenon is also
called thermal rectification. The rectification is weakly dependent on the
detailed structure of connection part, but is strongly dependent on the
temperature gradient. We also study the effect of the tube radius and
intramolecular junction length on the rectification. Our study shows that the
tensile stress can increase rectification. The physical mechanism of the
rectification is explained.
