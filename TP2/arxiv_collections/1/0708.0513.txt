We study the critical collapse of a massless scalar field with angular
momentum in spherical symmetry. In order to mimic the effects of angular
momentum we perform a sum of the stress-energy tensors for all the scalar
fields with the same eigenvalue, l, of the angular momentum operator and
calculate the equations of motion for the radial part of these scalar fields.
We have found that the critical solutions for different values of l are
discretely self-similar (as in the original l=0 case). The value of the
discrete, self-similar period, Delta_l, decreases as l increases in such a way
that the critical solution appears to become periodic in the limit. The mass
scaling exponent, gamma_l, also decreases with l.
