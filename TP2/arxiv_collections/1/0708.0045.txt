Higher-dimensional black holes have long been considered within the context
of brane worlds. Recently, it was shown that the brane-world ethos also permits
the consideration of higher-dimensional wormholes. When such a wormhole,
preexisting in the bulk, impinges upon our universe, taken to be a
positive-tension 3-brane, it induces the creation in our universe of a wormhole
of ordinary dimensionality. The throat of this wormhole might fully constrict,
pinch off, and thus birth a baby universe. Alternatively, the induced wormhole
might persist. I show that persistence is more likely and note that the
persistent wormhole manifests as a particle-like object whose interaction with
cosmic matter is purely gravitational. As such it may be considered a viable
candidate for the sort of weakly interacting massive particle long believed to
be the prime constituent of cold dark matter.
