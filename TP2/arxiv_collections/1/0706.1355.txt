Water is necessary both for the evolution of life and its continuance. It
possesses particular properties that cannot be found in other materials and
that are required for life-giving processes. These properties are brought about
by the hydrogen bonded environment particularly evident in liquid water. Each
liquid water molecule is involved in about four hydrogen bonds with strengths
considerably less than covalent bonds but considerably greater than the natural
thermal energy. These hydrogen bonds are roughly tetrahedrally arranged such
that when strongly formed the local clustering expands, decreasing the density.
Such low density structuring naturally occurs at low and supercooled
temperatures and gives rise to many physical and chemical properties that
evidence the particular uniqueness of liquid water. If aqueous hydrogen bonds
were actually somewhat stronger then water would behave similar to a glass,
whereas if they were weaker then water would be a gas and only exist as a
liquid at sub-zero temperatures. The overall conclusion of this investigation
is that water's hydrogen bond strength is poised centrally within a narrow
window of its suitability for life.
