We present recent results on a systematic method to calculate transport
coefficients for a meson gas (in particular, we analyze a pion gas) at low
temperatures in the context of Chiral Perturbation Theory. Our method is based
on the study of Feynman diagrams with a power counting which takes into account
collisions in the plasma by means of a non-zero particle width. In this way, we
obtain results compatible with analysis of Kinetic Theory with just the leading
order diagram. We show the behavior with temperature of electrical and thermal
conductivities and shear and bulk viscosities, and we discuss the fundamental
role played by unitarity. We obtain that bulk viscosity is negligible against
shear viscosity near the chiral phase transition. Relations between the
different transport coefficients and bounds on them based on different
theoretical approximations are also discussed. We also comment on some
applications to heavy-ion collisions.
