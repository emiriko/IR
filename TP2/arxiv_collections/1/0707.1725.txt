Using a one-parameter case as an example, we demonstrate that multicanonical
simulations allow for accurate estimates of the residual combinatorial entropy
of partially ordered ice. For the considered case corrections to an
(approximate) analytical formula are found to be small, never exceeding 0.5%.
The method allows one as well to calculate combinatorial entropies for many
other systems.
