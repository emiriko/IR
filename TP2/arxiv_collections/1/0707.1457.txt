Decoherence is the main process behind the quantum to classical transition.
It is a purely quantum mechanical effect by which the system looses its ability
to exhibit coherent behavior. The recent experimental observation of
diffraction and interference patterns for large molecules raises some
interesting questions. In this context, we identify possible agents of
decoherence to take into account when modeling these experiments and study
theirs visible (or not) effects on the interference pattern. Thereby, we
present an analysis of matter wave interferometry in the presence of a dynamic
quantum environment and study how much the visibility fringe is reduced and in
which timescale the decoherence effects destroy the interference of massive
objects. Finally, we apply our results to the experimental data reported on
fullerenes and cold neutrons.
