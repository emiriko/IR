An impurity solver based on a continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo method is
developed for the Coqblin-Schrieffer model. The Monte Carlo simulation does not
encounter a sign problem for antiferromagnetic interactions, and accurately
reproduces the Kondo effect. Our algorithm can deal with an arbitrary number N
of local degrees of freedom, becomes more efficient for larger values of N, and
is hence suitable for models with orbital degeneracy. The dynamical
susceptibility and the impurity t-matrix are derived with the aid of the Pad\'e
approximation for various values of N, and good agreement is found with other
methods and available exact results. We point out that the Korringa-Shiba
relation needs correction for a finite value of the exchange interaction.
