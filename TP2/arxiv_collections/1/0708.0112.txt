We investigate the possibility to suppress noise-induced intensity pulsations
(relaxation oscillations) in semiconductor lasers by means of a time-delayed
feedback control scheme. This idea is first studied in a generic normal form
model, where we derive an analytic expression for the mean amplitude of the
oscillations and demonstrate that it can be strongly modulated by varying the
delay time. We then investigate the control scheme analytically and numerically
in a laser model of Lang-Kobayashi type and show that relaxation oscillations
excited by noise can be very efficiently suppressed via feedback from a
Fabry-Perot resonator.
