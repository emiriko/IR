We present a faithful qubit transmission scheme with linear optics against
collective noise, not resorting to ancillary qubits. Its set-up is composed of
three unbalanced polarization interferometers, based on a polarizing beam
splitter, a beam splitter and a half-wave plate, which makes this scheme more
feasible than others with present technology. The fidelity of successful
transmission is 1, independent of the parameters of the collective noise, and
the success probability for obtaining an uncorrupted state can be improved to
100% with some time delayers. Moreover, this scheme has some good applications
in one-way quantum communication for rejecting the errors caused by the
collective noise in quantum channel.
