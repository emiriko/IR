The effect of quantum fluctuations on the current-voltage characteristics of
Josephson junctions and superconducting nanowires is studied in the underdamped
limit. Quantum fluctuations induce transitions between a Coulomb--blockade and
a supercurrent branch, and can significantly modify the shape of
current-voltage characteristics in the case of a highly resistive environment.
Owing to the phase-charge duality, our results can be directly extended to the
opposite overdamped limit.
