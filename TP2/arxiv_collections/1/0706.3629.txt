Cooperative behaviors near the disorder-induced critical point in a random
field Ising model are numerically investigated by analyzing time-dependent
magnetization in ordering processes from a special initial condition. We find
that the intensity of fluctuations of time-dependent magnetization, $\chi(t)$,
attains a maximum value at a time $t=\tau$ in a normal phase and that
$\chi(\tau)$ and $\tau$ exhibit divergences near the disorder-induced critical
point. Furthermore, spin configurations around the time $\tau$ are
characterized by a length scale, which also exhibits a divergence near the
critical point. We estimate the critical exponents that characterize these
power-law divergences by using a finite-size scaling method.
