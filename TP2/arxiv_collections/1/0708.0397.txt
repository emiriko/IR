Finite presentations for the mapping class group M(F) are known for arbitrary
orientable compact surface F. If F is non-orientable, then such presentations
are known only when F has genus at most 3 and few boundary components. In this
paper we obtain finite presentation for the mapping class group of the closed
non-orientable surface of genus 4 from its action on the so called ordered
complex of curves.
