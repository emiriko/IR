In this paper, we give an explicit construction of dynamical systems (defined
within a solid torus) containing any knot (or link) and arbitrarily knotted
chaos. The first is achieved by expressing the knots in terms of braids,
defining a system containing the braids and extending periodically to obtain a
system naturally defined on a torus and which contains the given knotted
trajectories. To get explicit differential equations for dynamical systems
containing the braids, we will use a certain function to define a tube
neigbourhood of the braid. The second one, generating chaotic systems, is
realized by modeling the Smale horseshoe.
