Generalized comb filters (GCFs) are efficient anti-aliasing decimation
filters with improved selectivity and quantization noise (QN) rejection
performance around the so called folding bands with respect to classical comb
filters.
  In this paper, we address the design of GCF filters by proposing an efficient
partial polyphase architecture with the aim to reduce the data rate as much as
possible after the Sigma-Delta A/D conversion. We propose a mathematical
framework in order to completely characterize the dependence of the frequency
response of GCFs on the quantization of the multipliers embedded in the
proposed filter architecture. This analysis paves the way to the design of
multiplier-less decimation architectures.
  We also derive the impulse response of a sample 3rd order GCF filter used as
a reference scheme throughout the paper.
