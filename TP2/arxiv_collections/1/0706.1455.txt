Gravitational radiation of binary systems can be studied by using the
adiabatic approximation in General Relativity. In this approach a small
astrophysical object follows a trajectory consisting of a chained series of
bounded geodesics (orbits) in the outer region of a Kerr Black Hole,
representing the space time created by a bigger object. In our paper we study
the entire class of orbits, both of constant radius (spherical orbits), as well
as non-null eccentricity orbits, showing a number of properties on the physical
parameters and trajectories. The main result is the determination of the
geometrical locus of all the orbits in the space of physical parameters in Kerr
space-time. This becomes a powerful tool to know if different orbits can be
connected by a continuous change of their physical parameters. A discussion on
the influence of different values of the angular momentum of the hole is given.
Main results have been obtained by analytical methods.
