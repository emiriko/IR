The present work tests the suitability of the narrow transitions $7s \
^2S_{1/2} \to 6d ^2D_{3/2}$ and $7s ^2S_{1/2} \to 6d ^2D_{5/2}$ in Ra$^+$ for
optical frequency standard studies. Our calculations of the lifetimes of the
metastable $6d$ states using the relativistic coupled-cluster theory suggest
that they are sufficiently long for Ra$^+$ to be considered as a potential
candidate for an atomic clock. This is further corroborated by our studies of
the hyperfine interactions, dipole and quadrupole polarizabilities and
quadrupole moments of the appropriate states of this system.
