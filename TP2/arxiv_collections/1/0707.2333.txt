It is a classical result of Wigner that for an hermitian matrix with
independent entries on and above the diagonal, the mean empirical eigenvalue
distribution converges weakly to the semicircle law as matrix size tends to
infinity. In this paper, we prove analogs of Wigner's theorem for random
matrices taken from all infinitesimal versions of classical symmetric spaces.
This is a class of models which contains those studied by Wigner and Dyson,
along with seven others arising in condensed matter physics. Like Wigner's, our
results are universal in that they only depend on certain assumptions about the
moments of the matrix entries, but not on the specifics of their distributions.
What is more, we allow for a certain amount of dependence among the matrix
entries, in the spirit of a recent generalization of Wigner's theorem, due to
Schenker and Schulz-Baldes. As a byproduct, we obtain a universality result for
sample covariance matrices with dependent entries.
