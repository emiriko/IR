Twist stiffness and an asymmetric bending stiffness of a polymer or a polymer
bundle is captured by the elastic ribbon model. We investigate the effects a
ring geometry induces to a thermally fluctuating ribbon, finding bend-bend
coupling in addition to twist-bend coupling. Furthermore, due to the geometric
constraint the polymer's effective bending stiffness increases. A new parameter
for experimental investigations of polymer bundles is proposed: the mean square
diameter of a ribbonlike ring, which is determined analytically in the
semiflexible limit. Monte Carlo simulations are performed which affirm the
model's prediction up to high flexibility.
