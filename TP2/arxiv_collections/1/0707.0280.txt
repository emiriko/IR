Magnetic systems are fertile ground for the emergence of exotic states when
the magnetic interactions cannot be satisfied simultaneously due to the
topology of the lattice - a situation known as geometrical frustration.
Spinels, AB2O4, can realize the most highly frustrated network of
corner-sharing tetrahedra. Several novel states have been discovered in
spinels, such as composite spin clusters and novel charge-ordered states. Here
we use neutron and synchrotron X-ray scattering to characterize the fractional
magnetization state of HgCr2O4 under an external magnetic field, H. When the
field is applied in its Neel ground state, a phase transition occurs at H ~ 10
Tesla at which each tetrahedron changes from a canted Neel state to a
fractional spin state with the total spin, Stet, of S/2 and the lattice
undergoes orthorhombic to cubic symmetry change. Our results provide the
microscopic one-to-one correspondence between the spin state and the lattice
distortion.
