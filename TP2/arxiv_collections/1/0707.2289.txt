Precision data on Kl3 and Kl2 decay rates and form factors allow us to
perform significant tests of lepton universality and to constrain the strength
of non-standard interactions. The present status of these tests and new physics
searches are discussed, as obtained by combining all the available results of
the various kaon physics experiments.
