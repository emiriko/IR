Predictions for particle production at LHC are discussed in the context of
the statistical model. Moreover, the capability of particle ratios to determine
the freeze-out point experimentally is studied, and the best suited ratios are
specified. Finally, canonical suppression in p-p collisions at LHC energies is
discussed in a cluster framework. Measurements with p-p collisions will allow
us to estimate the strangeness correlation volume and to study its evolution
over a large range of incident energies.
