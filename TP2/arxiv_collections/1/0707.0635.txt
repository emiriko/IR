Following our discussion [Physica A, 375 (2007) 123] to associate an
analogous probabilistic description with spacetime geometry in the
Schwarzschild metric from the macro- to the micro-domain, we argue that there
is a possible connection among normalized probabilities, spacetime geometry (in
the form of Schwarzschild radii) and quantum mechanics (in the form of complex
wave functions). We show how this association along different (n)-nested
surfaces --representing curve space due to an inhomogeneous density of matter--
preserves the postulates of quantum mechanics at different geometrical scales.
