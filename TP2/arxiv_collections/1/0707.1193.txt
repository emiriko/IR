This paper investigates the singular curves in two-dimensional slices of the
joint space of a family of planar parallel manipulators. It focuses on special
points, referred to as cusp points, which may appear on these curves. Cusp
points play an important role in the kinematic behavior of parallel
manipulators since they make possible a nonsingular change of assembly mode.
The purpose of this study is twofold. First, it reviews an important previous
work, which, to the authors' knowledge, has never been exploited yet. Second,
it determines the cusp points in any two-dimensional slice of the joint space.
First results show that the number of cusp points may vary from zero to eight.
This work finds applications in both design and trajectory planning.
