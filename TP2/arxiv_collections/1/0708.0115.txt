Nuclear matrix elements of the neutrinoless double beta decays of 96Zr,
100Mo, 116Cd, 128Te, 130Te and 136Xe are calculated for the light-neutrino
exchange mechanism by using the proton-neutron quasiparticle random-phase
approximation (pnQRPA) with a realistic nucleon-nucleon force. The g_pp
parameter of the pnQRPA is fixed by the data on the two-neutrino double beta
decays and single beta decays. The finite size of a nucleon, the higher-order
terms of nucleonic weak currents, and the nucleon-nucleon short-range
correlations (s.r.c) are taken into account. The s.r.c. are computed by the
traditional Jastrow method and by the more advanced unitary correlation
operator method (UCOM). Comparison of the results obtained by the two methods
is carried out. The UCOM computed matrix elements turn out to be considerably
larger than the Jastrow computed ones. This result is important for the
assessment of the neutrino-mass sensitivity of the present and future double
beta experiments.
