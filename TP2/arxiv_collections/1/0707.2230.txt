This work presents accurate ab initio determination of the hyperfine
splitting for the ground state and few low-lying excited states of 113Cd+;
important candidates for the frequency standard in the microwave region, using
coupled-cluster theory (CC) in the relativistic framework. The calculated
hyperfine splitting are well in agreement with recent experimental results. We
have also carried out the lifetimes of the 5p2P1=2 and 5p2P3=2 states, which
are in well agreement with recent experimental result (Moehring et al., PRA 73
023413, 2006). The roles of different electron correlation effects in the
determination of these quantities are discussed and their contributions are
presented in the CC terms.
