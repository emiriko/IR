The Hochschild homology/cohomology an associative algebra, together with the
Connes differential, the contraction map and the Lie derivative, forms the
structure of calculus. In this paper we compute explicitely the calculus
structure of preprojective algebras of Dynkin quivers over a field of
characteristic zero. This also completes the work in math.AG/0502301, where the
Batalin-Vilkovisky structure of the Hochschild cohomology of preprojective
algebras of non-Dynkin quivers are computed and the calculus can be easily
computed from that.
