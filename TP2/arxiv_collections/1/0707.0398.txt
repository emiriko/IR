We have developed a theoretical method to study scattering processes of an
incident electron through an N-electron quantum dot (QD) embedded in a
two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor. The generalized Lippmann-Schwinger
equations including the electron-electron exchange interaction in this system
are solved for the continuum electron by using the method of continued
fractions (MCF) combined with 2D partial-wave expansion technique. The method
is applied to a one-electron QD case. Cross-sections are obtained for both the
singlet and triplet couplings between the incident electron and the QD electron
during the scattering. The total elastic cross-sections as well as the
spin-flip scattering cross-sections resulting from the exchange potential are
presented. Furthermore, inelastic scattering processes are also studied using a
multichannel formalism of the MCF.
