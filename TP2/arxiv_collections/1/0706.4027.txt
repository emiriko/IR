Alkali halide (100) crystal surfaces are poorly wetted by their own melt at
the triple point. We carried out simulations for NaCl(100) within the well
tested BMHFT model potential. Calculations of the solid-vapor, solid-liquid and
liquid-vapor free energies showed that solid NaCl(100) is a non-melting
surface, and explain its bad wetting in detail.
  The extreme stability of NaCl(100) is ideal for a study of the nanofriction
in the high temperature regime, close to and even above the bulk melting
temperature (T_M). Our simulations reveal in this regime two distinct and
opposite phenomena for plowing and for grazing friction. We found a frictional
drop close to T_M for deep ploughing and wear, but on the contrary a frictional
rise for grazing, wearless sliding. For both phenomena we obtain a fresh
microscopic understanding, relating the former to ``skating'' through a local
liquid cloud, the latter to softening of the free substrate surface. It is
argued that both phenomena, to be pursued experimentally, should be much more
general than the specific NaCl surface case. Most metals in particular
possessing one or more close packed non-melting surface, such as Pb, Al or
Au(111), should behave quite similarly.
