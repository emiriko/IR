We study the temperature dependence of the pseudoscalar meson properties in a
relativistic bound-state approach exhibiting the chiral behavior mandated by
QCD. Concretely, we adopt the Dyson-Schwinger approach with a rank-2 separable
model interaction. After extending the model to the strange sector and fixing
its parameters at zero temperature, T=0, we study the T-dependence of the
masses and decay constants of all ground-state mesons in the pseudoscalar
nonet. Of chief interest are $\eta$ and $\eta^\prime$. The influence of the QCD
axial anomaly on them is successfully obtained through the Witten-Veneziano
relation at T=0. The same approach is then extended to T>0, using lattice QCD
results for the topological susceptibility. The most conspicuous finding is an
increase of the $\eta^\prime$ mass around the chiral restoration temperature
$T_{\rm Ch}$, which would suggest a suppression of $\eta^\prime$ production in
relativistic heavy-ion collisions. The increase of the $\eta^\prime$ mass may
also indicate that the extension of the Witten-Veneziano relation to finite
temperatures becomes unreliable around and above $T_{\rm Ch}$. Possibilities of
an improved treatment are discussed.
