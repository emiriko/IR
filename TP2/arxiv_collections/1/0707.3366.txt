We define the pion-photon Transition Distribution Amplitudes (TDA) in a field
theoretic formalism from a covariant Bethe-Salpeter approach for the
determination of the bound state. We apply our formalism to the Nambu - Jona
Lasinio model, as a realistic theory of the pion. The obtained vector and axial
TDAs satisfy all features required by general considerations. In particular,
sum rules and polynomiality condition are explicitly verified. We have
numerically proved that the odd coefficients in the polynomiality expansion of
the vector TDA vanish in the chiral limit. The role of PCAC and the presence of
a pion pole are explicitly shown.
