A combined experimental and numerical study of the boundary layer in a 4:1
aspect-ratio Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard cell over a four-decade range of Rayleigh
numbers has been undertaken aimed at gaining a better insight into the
character of the boundary layers. The experiments involved the simultaneous
Laser Doppler Anemometry (LDA) measurements of fluid velocity at two locations,
i.e. in the boundary layer and far away from it in the bulk, for Rayleigh
numbers varying between $1.6 \times 10^7$ and $2.4 \times 10^9$. In parallel,
direct numerical simulations (DNS) have been performed for the same
configuration for Rayleigh numbers between $7.0 \times 10^4$ and $7.7 \times
10^7$. The temperature and velocity probability density functions and the power
spectra of the horizontal velocity fluctuations measured in the boundary layer
and in the bulk flow are found to be practically identical. Except for the
smallest Rayleigh numbers, the spectra in the boundary layer and in the bulk
central region are continuous and have a wide range of active scales. This
indicates that both the bulk and the boundary layers are turbulent in the
$\textrm{Ra}$ number range considered. However, molecular effects can still be
observed and the boundary layer does not behave like a classical shear-driven
turbulent boundary layer.
