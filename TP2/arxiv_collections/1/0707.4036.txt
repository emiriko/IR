Over a period of approximately five years, Pankaj Ghemawat of Harvard
Business School and Daniel Levinthal of the Wharton School have been working on
a detailed simulation (producing approximately a million fitness landscape
graphs) in order to determine optimal patterns of decision-making for
corporations. In 2006, we adapted this study, combining it with our own work on
terrorism to examine what would happen if we inverted Ghemawat and Levinthal's
findings and sought to provide disinformation or otherwise interfere with the
communications and decision processes of terrorist organizations in order to
optimize poor decision making and inefficiencies in organizational
coordination, command and control.
  The bulk of this study was then presented at the 2006 annual meeting of the
North American Association for Computation in the Social and Organizational
Sciences. We present here an updated version of that study, emphasizing the
rather counter-intuitive finding that "soft" targets have almost no value and
that unless one can influence key factors, an effort directed at the easy to
reach elements of terrorist organizations may actually be worse than mounting
no effort at all. We conclude with the recommendation that some fundamental
rethinking may be required if the United States is to effectively defend itself
from future terrorist attacks.
