The present paper discusses the fog and dew water collection in Croatia.
Zavizan, the highest meteorological station in Croatia(1594m) is chosen for
collecting of fog water with a standard fog collector (SFC). The highest daily
collection rate was 27.8 L / m2. The highest daily collection rate in days
without rain was 19.1 l/m2. Dew is also a noticeable source of water,
especially during the drier summer season. Dew condensers in Croatia have been
installed on the Adriatic coast (Zadar) and islands Vis and Bisevo. We report
and discuss the data collected since 2003. In the small Bisevo island, a
special roof has been designed to improve the formation and collection of dew
on a house. Data from April 2005 will be presented and discussed.
