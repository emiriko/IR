In this work are considered some questions of Monte-Carlo modeling on
nontrivial bundles. As a basic example is used problem of generation of
straight lines in 3D space, related with modeling of interaction of a solid
body with a flux of particles and with some other tasks. Space of lines used in
given model is example of nontrivial fiber bundle, that is equivalent with
tangent sheaf of a sphere.
