Transverse polarization of $\Lambda^0$ hyperons in inclusive photoproduction
at x_F>0 is tackled within the framework of the quark recombination model,
which has been successfully applied to the polarization of different hyperons
in a variety of unpolarized hadron-hadron reactions. The results are compared
with recent experimental data of HERMES.
