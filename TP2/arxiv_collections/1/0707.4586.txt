We study the lowest-lying scalar mesons in the QCD sum rule by considering
them as tetraquark states. We find that there are five independent currents for
each state with a certain flavor structure. By forming linear combinations, we
find that some mixed currents give reliable QCD sum rules. Among various
tetraquark currents, we consider those which are constructed by the diquarks
having anti-symmetric and symmetric flavor structures. That the results of the
QCD sum rule derived from the two types of currents are similar suggests that
the tetraquark states can have a large mixing between different flavor
structures.
