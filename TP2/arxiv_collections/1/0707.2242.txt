In this work, fundamental results for carrier statistics in graphene
2-dimensional sheets and nanoscale ribbons are derived. Though the behavior of
intrinsic carrier densities in 2d graphene sheets is found to differ
drastically from traditional semiconductors, very narrow (sub-10 nm) ribbons
are found to be similar to traditional narrow-gap semiconductors. The quantum
capacitance, an important parameter in the electrostatic design of devices, is
derived for both 2d graphene sheets and nanoribbons.
