We study spin accumulation and spin relaxation in a superconducting nanowire.
Spins are injected and detected by using a set of magnetic tunnel contact
electrodes, closely spaced along the nanowire. We observe a giant enhancement
of the spin accumulation of up to five orders of magnitude on transition into
the superconducting state, consistent with the expected changes in the density
of states. The spin relaxation length decreases by an order of magnitude from
its value in the normal state. These measurements combined with our theoretical
model, allow us to distinguish the individual spin flip mechanisms present in
the transport channel. Our conclusion is that magnetic impurities rather than
spin-orbit coupling dominate spin-flip scattering in the superconducting state.
