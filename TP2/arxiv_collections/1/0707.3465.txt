In a recent article, Desai and Fisher (2007) proposed that the speed of
adaptation in an asexual population is determined by the dynamics of the
stochastic edge of the population, that is, by the emergence and subsequent
establishment of rare mutants that exceed the fitness of all sequences
currently present in the population. Desai and Fisher perform an elaborate
stochastic calculation of the mean time $\tau$ until a new class of mutants has
been established, and interpret $1/\tau$ as the speed of adaptation. As they
note, however, their calculations are valid only for moderate speeds. This
limitation arises from their method to determine $\tau$: Desai and Fisher
back-extrapolate the value of $\tau$ from the best-fit class' exponential
growth at infinite time. This approach is not valid when the population adapts
rapidly, because in this case the best-fit class grows non-exponentially during
the relevant time interval. Here, we substantially extend Desai and Fisher's
analysis of the stochastic edge. We show that we can apply Desai and Fisher's
method to high speeds by either exponentially back-extrapolating from finite
time or using a non-exponential back-extrapolation. Our results are compatible
with predictions made using a different analytical approach (Rouzine et al.
2003, 2007), and agree well with numerical simulations.
