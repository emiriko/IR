We present an application of evolutionary algorithms to the curve-fitting
problems commonly encountered when trying to extract particle masses from
correlators in Lattice QCD. Harnessing the flexibility of evolutionary methods
in global optimization allows us to dynamically adapt the number of states to
be fitted along with their energies so as to minimize overall \chi^2/(d.o.f.),
leading to a promising new way of extracting the mass spectrum from measured
correlation functions.
