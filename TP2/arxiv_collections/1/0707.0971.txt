It is shown that a light beam in free space is representable by an integral
over a vectorial angular spectrum that is expressed in terms of an extension
matrix, which describes the vectorial nature of the beam. A symmetry axis of
the extension matrix is identified. When it is neither perpendicular nor
parallel to the propagation axis, we arrive at such beams that show us for the
first time the observable evidence of the Beauregard effect. The advanced
representation theory may yield any kinds of light beam, and the uncovered
Beauregard effect would play its unique roles in applications.
