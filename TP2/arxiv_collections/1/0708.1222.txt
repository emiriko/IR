We treat theoretically Shapiro steps in tunnel Josephson junctions with
spatially alternating critical current density. Explicit analytical formulas
for the width of the first integer (normal) and half-integer (anomalous)
Shapiro steps are derived for short junctions. We develop coarse-graining
approach, which describes Shapiro steps in the voltage-current curves of the
asymmetric grain boundaries in YBCO thin films and different
superconductor-ferromagnet-superconductor Josephson-type heterostructures.
