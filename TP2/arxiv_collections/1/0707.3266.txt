We investigate the possible enhancement to the discovery of the heavy Higgs
boson through the possible fourth SM family heavy neutrino. Using the channel
h-> v4 v4->mu W mu W-> mu j j mu j j, it is found that for certain ranges of
Higgs boson and v4 masses LHC could discover both of them simultaneously with 1
fb^-1 integrated luminosity.
