We consider the possibility to extract spins that are generated by an
electric current in a two-dimensional electron gas with Rashba-Dresselhaus
spin-orbit interaction (R2DEG) in the Hall geometry. To this end, we discuss
boundary conditions for the spin accumulations between a spin-orbit coupled
region and contact without spin-orbit coupling, i.e. a normal two-dimensional
electron gas (2DEG). We demonstrate that in contrast to contacts that extend
along the whole sample, a spin accumulation can diffuse into the normal region
through finite contacts and detected by e.g. ferromagnets. For an
impedance-matched narrow contact the spin accumulation in the 2DEG is equal to
the current induced spin accumulation in the bulk of R2DEG up to a
geometry-dependent numerical factor.
