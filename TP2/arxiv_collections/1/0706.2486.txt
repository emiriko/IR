We consider semiclassical higher-order wave packet solutions of the
Schrodinger equation with phase vortices. The vortex line is aligned with the
propagation direction, and the wave packet carries a well-defined orbital
angular momentum (OAM) $\hbar l$ ($l$ is the vortex strength) along its main
linear momentum. The probability current coils around momentum in such OAM
states of electrons. In an electric field, these states evolve like massless
particles with spin $l$. The magnetic-monopole Berry curvature appears in
momentum space, which results in a spin-orbit-type interaction and a
Berry/Magnus transverse force acting on the wave packet. This brings about the
OAM Hall effect. In a magnetic field, there is a Zeeman interaction, which, can
lead to more complicated dynamics.
