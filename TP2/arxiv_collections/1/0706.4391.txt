We propose a generalization of the cavity method to quantum spin glasses on
fixed connectivity lattices. Our work is motivated by the recent refinements of
the classical technique and its potential application to quantum computational
problems. We numerically solve for the phase structure of a connectivity $q=3$
transverse field Ising model on a Bethe lattice with $\pm J$ couplings, and
investigate the distribution of various classical and quantum observables.
