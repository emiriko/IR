The nonlinear polariton transmission, reflection and trapping by a defect in
the resonantly absorbing Bragg grating (RABG) is demonstrated in numerical
simulation. It is shown that the wide defect under some conditions could
effectively serve as microresonator for polaritonic wave storage. The three
types of the defect such as microcavity, groove and stripe are considered.
Capture the electromagnetic field inside the microcavity (with no resonant
nanoparticles) placed in the RABG is observed, as well as stuck of trapped
polarization modes to the defect edges for the groove (defect span with reduced
density of nanoparticles) and for the stripe with relatively increased density.
Strong radiation reflection and adhered propagation of the polarization mode
along the first edge of the stripe with high density of resonant atoms is
exhibited by numerical computation.
