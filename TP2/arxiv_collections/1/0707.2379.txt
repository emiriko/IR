We systematically construct realistic mass matrices for the type-I seesaw
mechanism out of more than 20 trillion possibilities. We use only very generic
assumptions from extended quark-lepton complementarity, i.e., the leptonic
mixing angles between flavor and mass eigenstates are either maximal, or
parameterized by a single small quantity epsilon that is of the order of the
Cabibbo angle epsilon theta_C. The small quantity epsilon also describes all
fermion mass hierarchies. We show that special cases often considered in the
literature, such as having a symmetric Dirac mass matrix or small mixing among
charged leptons, constitute only a tiny fraction of our possibilities.
Moreover, we find that in most cases the spectrum of right-handed neutrino
masses is only mildly hierarchical. As a result, we provide for the charged
leptons and neutrinos a selected list of 1981 qualitatively different Yukawa
coupling matrices (or textures) that are parameterized by the Cabibbo angle and
allow for a perfect fit to current data. In addition, we also briefly show how
the textures could be generated in explicit models from flavor symmetries.
