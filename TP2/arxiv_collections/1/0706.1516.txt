In low temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) experiments a cerium
adatom on Ag(100) possesses two discrete states with significantly different
apparent heights. These atomic switches also exhibit a Kondo-like feature in
spectroscopy experiments. By extensive theoretical simulations we find that
this behavior is due to diffusion of hydrogen from the surface onto the Ce
adatom in the presence of the STM tip field. The cerium adatom possesses
vibrational modes of very low energy (3-4meV) and very high efficiency (> 20%),
which are due to the large changes of Ce-states in the presence of hydrogen.
The atomic vibrations lead to a Kondo-like feature at very low bias voltages.
We predict that the same low-frequency/high-efficiency modes can also be
observed at lanthanum adatoms.
