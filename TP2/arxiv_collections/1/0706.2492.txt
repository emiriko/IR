We formulate quantum tunneling as a time-of-arrival problem: we determine the
detection probability for particles passing through a barrier at a detector
located a distance L from the tunneling region. For this purpose, we use a
Positive-Operator-Valued-Measure (POVM) for the time-of-arrival determined in
quant-ph/0509020 [JMP 47, 122106 (2006)]. This only depends on the initial
state, the Hamiltonian and the location of the detector. The POVM above
provides a well-defined probability density and an unambiguous interpretation
of all quantities involved. We demonstrate that for a class of localized
initial states, the detection probability allows for an identification of
tunneling time with the classic phase time. We also establish limits to the
definability of tunneling time.
  We then generalize these results to a sequential measurement set-up: the
phase space properties of the particles are determined by an unsharp sampling
before their attempt to cross the barrier. For such measurements the tunneling
time is defined as a genuine observable. This allows us to construct a
probability distribution for its values that is definable for all initial
states and potentials. We also identify a regime, in which these probabilities
correspond to a tunneling-time operator.
