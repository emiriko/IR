We prove non-Archimedean analogs of results of Noguchi and Winkelmann showing
algebraic degeneracy of rigid analytic maps to projective varieties omitting an
effective divisor with sufficiently many irreducible components relative to the
rank of the group they generate in the Neron-Severi group of the variety.
