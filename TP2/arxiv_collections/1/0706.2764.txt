The Extended Theory of Finite Fermi Systems(ETFFS) describes nuclear
excitations considering phonons and pairing degrees of freedom, using
experimental single particle energies and the effective Landau-Migdal
interaction. Here we use the Skyrme interactions in order to extend the range
of applicability of the ETFFS to experimentally not yet investigated
short-lived isotopes. We find that Skyrme interactions which reproduce at the
mean field level both ground state properties and nuclear excitations are able
to describe the spreading widths of the giant resonances in the new approach,
but produce shifts of the centroid energies. A renormalization of the Skyrme
interactions is required for approaches going beyond the mean field level.
