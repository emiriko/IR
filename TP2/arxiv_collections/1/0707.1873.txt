The minimal supersymmetric standard model with soft breaking has a large
landscape of supersymmetric particle mass hierarchies. This number is reduced
significantly in well-motivated scenarios such as minimal supergravity and
alternatives. We carry out an analysis of the landscape for the first four
lightest particles and identify at least 16 mass patterns, and provide
benchmarks for each. We study the signature space for the patterns at the CERN
Large Hadron Collider by analyzing the lepton + (jet $\geq 2$) + missing $P_T$
signals with 0, 1, 2 and 3 leptons. Correlations in missing $P_T$ are also
analyzed. It is found that even with 10 fb$^{-1}$ of data a significant
discrimination among patterns emerges
