For a long time, RBS and PIXE techniques have been used in the field of
cultural heritage. Although the complementarity of both techniques has long
been acknowledged, its full potential has not been yet developed due to the
lack of general purpose software tools for analysing the data from both
techniques in a coherent way. In this work we provide an example of how the
recent addition of PIXE to the set of techniques supported by the DataFurnace
code can significantly change this situation. We present a case in which a non
homogeneous sample (an oxidized metal from a photographic plate -heliography-
made by Niepce in 1827) is analysed using RBS and PIXE in a straightforward and
powerful way that can only be performed with a code that treats both techniques
simultaneously as a part of one single and coherent analysis. The optimization
capabilities of DataFurnace, allowed us to obtain the composition profiles for
these samples in a very simple way.
