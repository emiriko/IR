The stationary nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (or Gross-Pitaevskii
equation) for one-dimensional potential scattering is studied. The nonlinear
transmission function shows a distorted profile, which differs from the
Lorentzian one found in the linear case. This nonlinear profile function is
analyzed and related to Siegert type complex resonances. It is shown, that the
characteristic nonlinear profile function can be conveniently described in
terms of skeleton functions depending on a few instructive parameters. These
skeleton functions also determine the decay behavior of the underlying
resonance state. Furthermore we extend the Siegert method for calculating
resonances, which provides a convenient recipe for calculating nonlinear
resonances. Applications to a double Gaussian barrier and a square well
potential illustrate our analysis.
