We study the United States Congress by constructing networks between Members
of Congress based on the legislation that they cosponsor. Using the concept of
modularity, we identify the community structure of Congressmen, as connected
via sponsorship/cosponsorship of the same legislation, to investigate the
collaborative communities of legislators in both chambers of Congress. This
analysis yields an explicit and conceptually clear measure of political
polarization, demonstrating a sharp increase in partisan polarization which
preceded and then culminated in the 104th Congress (1995-1996), when
Republicans took control of both chambers. Although polarization has since
waned in the U.S. Senate, it remains at historically high levels in the House
of Representatives.
