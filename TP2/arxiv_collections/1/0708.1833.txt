A novel atomistic-continuum method (ACM) based on finite element method (FEM)
is proposed to numerically simulate the nano-scaled Poisson's ratio and Young's
modulus effect of Lithium (Li) body-centered cubic (BCC) structure. The
potential energy between Li atoms is described by the Morse potential function
[1]. The pre-force effect will be discussed due to the different Li lattice
length between experimental lattice constant and diatom distance from Morse
function. Moreover, the size effect of the nano-scaled Li cluster will be
introduced.
