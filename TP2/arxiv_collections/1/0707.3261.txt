We propose a representation of science as a citation-density landscape and
investigate scaling rules with the field-specific citation density as a main
topological property. We focus on the size-dependence of several main
bibliometric indicators for a large set of research groups while distinguishing
between top-performance and lower performance groups. We demonstrate that this
representation of the science system is particularly effective to understand
the role and the interdependencies of the different bibliometric indicators and
related topological properties of the landscape.
