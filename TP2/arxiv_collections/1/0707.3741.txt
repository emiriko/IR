In a way similar to the continuous case formally, we define in different but
equivalent manners the difference discrete connection and curvature on discrete
vector bundle over the regular lattice as base space. We deal with the
difference operators as the discrete counterparts of the derivatives based upon
the differential calculus on the lattice. One of the definitions can be
extended to the case over the random lattice. We also discuss the relation
between our approach and the lattice gauge theory and apply to the discrete
integrable systems.
