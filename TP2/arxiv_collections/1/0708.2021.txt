Co-authorship graphs (that is, the graph of authors linked by co-authorship
of papers) are complex networks, which expresses the dynamics of a complex
system. Only recently its study has started to draw interest from the EC
community, the first paper dealing with it having been published two years ago.
In this paper we will study the co-authorship network of EC at a microscopic
level. Our objective is ascertaining which are the most relevant nodes (i.e.
authors) in it. For this purpose, we examine several metrics defined in the
complex-network literature, and analyze them both in isolation and combined
within a Pareto-dominance approach. The result of our analysis indicates that
there are some well-known researchers that appear systematically in top
rankings. This also provides some hints on the social behavior of our
community.
