Phenomena analogous to ground state quantum phase transitions have recently
been noted to occur among states throughout the excitation spectra of certain
many-body models. These excited state phase transitions are manifested as
simultaneous singularities in the eigenvalue spectrum (including the gap or
level density), order parameters, and wave function properties. In this
article, the characteristics of excited state quantum phase transitions are
investigated. The finite-size scaling behavior is determined at the mean field
level. It is found that excited state quantum phase transitions are universal
to two-level bosonic and fermionic models with pairing interactions.
