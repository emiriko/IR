We study a hybrid system consisting of a spin-incoherent Luttinger liquid
adjoined at one or both ends to a superconductor. We find the tunneling density
of states diverges at low energies and exhibits a universal frequency
dependence independent of the strength of the interactions in the system. We
show that in spite of exponentially decaying pair correlations with distance
into the spin-incoherent Luttinger liquid, the Josephson current remains
robust. Compared to the zero temperature Luttinger liquid case there is a
factor of 2 reduction in the critical current and a halving of the period in
the phase difference between the superconductors. Our results open the way for
a new class of experiments in the spin-incoherent regime of one dimensional
systems.
