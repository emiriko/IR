We consider wave packet propagation in a quantum wire with either an embedded
antidot or an embedded parallel double open quantum dot under the influence of
a uniform magnetic field. The magnetoconductance and the time evolution of an
electron wave packet are calculated based on the Lippmann-Schwinger formalism.
This approach allows us to look at arbitrary embedded potential profiles and
illustrate the results by performing computational simulations for the
conductance and the time evolution of the electron wave packet through the
quantum wire. In the double-dot system we observe a long-lived resonance state
that enhances the spatial spreading of the wave packet, and quantum
skipping-like trajectories are induced when the envelop function of the wave
packet covers several subbands in appropriate magnetic fields.
