We derive a formula predicting dynamical tunneling rates from regular states
to the chaotic sea in systems with a mixed phase space. Our approach is based
on the introduction of a fictitious integrable system that resembles the
regular dynamics within the island. For the standard map and other kicked
systems we find agreement with numerical results for all regular states in a
regime where resonance-assisted tunneling is not relevant.
