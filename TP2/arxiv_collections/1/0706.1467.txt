Two recent studies have presented new information relevant to the transition
from quantum behavior to classical behavior, and related this to parameters
characterizing the universe as a whole. The present study based on a separate
approach has developed similar results that appear to substantiate aspects of
earlier work and also to introduce further new ideas.
