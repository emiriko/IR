We present a holographic dark energy model of the universe considering
modified generalized Chaplygin gas (GCG). The modified GCG behaves as an
ordinary barotropic fluid in the early epoch when the universe was tiny but
behaves subsequently as a $\Lambda$CDM model at late epoch. An equivalent model
with scalar field is obtained here by constructing the corresponding potential.
The holographic dark energy is identified with the modified GCG and we
determine the corresponding holographic dark energy field and its potential.
The stability of the holographic dark energy in this case is also discussed.
