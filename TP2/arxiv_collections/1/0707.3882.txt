We investigate entanglement properties of mixtures of short-range spin-s
dimer coverings in lattices of arbitrary topology and dimension. We show that
in one spacial dimension nearest neighbour entanglement exists for any spin
$s$. Surprisingly, in higher spatial dimensions there is a threshold value of
spin $s$ below which the nearest neighbour entanglement disappears. The
traditional "classical" limit of large spin value corresponds to the highest
nearest neighbour entanglement that we quantify using the negativity.
