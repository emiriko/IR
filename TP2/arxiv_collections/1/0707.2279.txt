The cross section of the process $e^+e^- \to K^+K^-$ was measured in the
energy range $\sqrt{s}$ = 1.04--1.38 GeV in the SND experiment at the VEPP-2M
$e^+e^-$ collider. The measured cross section is described by the model of
vector meson dominance with contributions from the light vector mesons $\rho$,
$\omega$, $\phi$ and their lowest excitations. The mean statistical accuracy of
the measurement is 4.4 %, and the systematic uncertainty is 5.2 %.
