In explicit CP violation scenario of the minimal non-minimal supersymmetric
standard model (MNMSSM), the possibility of a strongly first-order electroweak
phase transition (EWPT) is investigated at the one-loop level, where the
radiative corrections from the loops of the top and stop quarks are taken into
account. Assuming that the stop quark masses are not degenerate, the radiative
corrections due to the stop quarks give rise to a CP phase, which triggers the
scalar-pseudoscalar mixing in the Higgs sector of the MNMSSM. The lighter stop
quark need not always to have a small mass in order to ensure the strongly
first-order EWPT. In the MNMSSM with explicit CP violation, it is found that
the strength of the first-order EWPT depends on several factors, such as the
lightest neutral Higgs boson mass and the nontrivial CP phase arising from stop
quark masses. The effects of these factors are discussed.
