We use the phenomenological model proposed in our previous paper [Phys. Rev.
Lett. {\bf 98}, 237001 (2007)] to analyse the magnetic field dependence of the
onset temperature for two-dimensional fluctuating superconductivity $T^{**}
(H)$. We demonstrate that the slope of $T^{**} (H)$ progressively goes down as
$H$ increases, such that the upper critical field progressively increases as
$T$ decreases. The quantitative agreement with the recent measurements of
$T^{**} (H)$ in $La_{1.85}Ba_{0.125}CuO_4$ is achieved for the same parameter
value as was derived in our previous publication from the analysis of the
electron self energy.
