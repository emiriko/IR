In this work we implement the self-consistent Thomas-Fermi model that also
incorporates a local conductivity model to an electron-electron bilayer system,
in order to describe novel magneto-transport properties such as the Drag
Phenomenon. The model can successfully account for the poor screening of the
potential within the incompressible strips and its impact on the interlayer
Coulomb interaction. An externally applied current in the active layer results
in the tilting of the Landau levels and built-up of a Hall potential across the
layer, which, in turn, induces a tilted potential profile in the passive layer
as well. We investigate the effect of the current intensity, temperature,
magnetic field, and unequal density of layers on the self-consistent density
and potential profiles of the bilayer system.
