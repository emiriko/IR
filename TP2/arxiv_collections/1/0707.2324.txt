The photoproduction of vector mesons on various nuclei has been studied using
the CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer (CLAS) at Jefferson Laboratory. The
vector mesons, $\rho$, $\omega$, and $\phi$, are observed via their decay to
$e^+e^-$, in order to reduce the effects of final state interactions in the
nucleus. Of particular interest are possible in-medium effects on the
properties of the $\rho$ meson. The $\rho$ spectral function is extracted from
the data on various nuclei, carbon, iron, and titanium, and compared to the
spectrum from liquid deuterium, which is relatively free of nuclear effects. We
observe no significant mass shift for the $\rho$ meson; however, there is some
widening of the resonance in titanium and iron, which is consistent with
expected collisional broadening.
