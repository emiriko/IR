Some linear dynamical systems over finite fields are studied and the
self-similar character of their development is proved. Connections with
aperiodic tilings, Delanoy numbers and other topics are also proved. The prime
fields F_p have a canonical presentation as sets of self-similar carpets. The
multiplicative inverse corresponds to mirroring.
