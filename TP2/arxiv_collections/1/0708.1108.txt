An earlier finding that the van der waals radii are related to their de
broglie wavelengths for some non-metallic elements has been extended here to
show that in fact, they vary linearly with the ground state bohr radii for all
the elements of groups 1a to 8 a. Similarly, the valence shell radii and the
covalent radii are shown to be linearly dependent on the bohr radii. One table
of data and 5 figures have been provided here showing that all the above radii
are sums of two lengths, one of which is a multiple of the bohr radius and the
other, a positive or negative constant for each group of elements.
