Forward jet cross sections have been measured in neutral current deep
inelastic scattering at low Bjorken-x with the ZEUS detector at HERA using an
integrated luminosity of ${81.8 \rm pb}^{-1}$. Measurements are presented for
inclusive forward jets as well as for forward jets accompanied by a dijet
system. The explored phase space, with jet pseudorapidity up to 4.3 is expected
to be particularly sensitive to the dynamics of QCD parton evolution at low x.
The measurements are compared to fixed-order QCD calculations and to
leading-order parton-shower Monte Carlo models.
