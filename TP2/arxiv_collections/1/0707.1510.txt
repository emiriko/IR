We present the STAR measurement of transverse momentum spectra at
mid-rapidity for identified particles in p+p collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 200
GeV. These high statistics data are ideal for comparing to existing leading-
and next-to-leading order (NLO) perturbative QCD calculations. Next-to-leading
models have been successful in describing inclusive hadron production using
parameterized fragmentation functions (FF) for quarks and gluons. However, in
order to describe baryon spectra at NLO, knowledge of flavor separated FF is
essential. Such FF have recently been parameterized using data by the OPAL
experiment and allow for the first time to obtain good agreement between NLO
and identified baryons from p+p collisions.
