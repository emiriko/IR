We study the dynamics of a probe soliton propagating in an optical fiber and
exchanging energy in fast collisions with a random sequence of pump solitons.
The energy exchange is induced by Raman scattering or by cubic nonlinear
loss/gain. We show that the equation describing the dynamics of the probe
soliton's amplitude has the same form as the equation for the local space
average of energy dissipation in random cascade models in turbulence. We
characterize the statistics of the probe soliton's amplitude by the \tau_{q}
exponents from multifractal theory and by the Cram\'er function S(x). We find
that the n-th moment of the two-time correlation function and the
bit-error-rate contribution from amplitude decay exhibit power-law behavior as
functions of propagation distance, where the exponents can be expressed in
terms of \tau_{q} or S(x).
