We carry out a detailed analysis of sparticle mass spectrum in supersymmetric
grand unified theories. We consider the spectroscopy of the squarks and
sleptons in SU(5) and SO(10) grand unified theories, and show how the
underlying supersymmetry breaking parameters of these theories can be
determined from a measurement of different sparticle masses. This analysis is
done analytically by integrating the one-loop renormalization group equations
with appropriate boundary conditions implied by the underlying grand unified
gauge group. We also consider the impact of non-universal gaugino masses on the
sparticle spectrum, especially the neutralino and chargino masses which arise
in supersymmetric grand unified theories with non-minimal gauge kinetic
function. In particular, we study the interrelationships between the squark and
slepton masses which arise in grand unified theories at the one-loop level,
which can be used to distinguish between the different underlying gauge groups
and their breaking pattern to the Standard Model gauge group. We also comment
on the corrections that can affect these one-loop results.
