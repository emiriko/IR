The usual dispersionless limit of the KP hierarchy does not work in the case
where the dependent variable has values in a noncommutative (e.g. matrix)
algebra. Passing over to the potential KP hierarchy, there is a corresponding
scaling limit in the noncommutative case, which turns out to be the hierarchy
of a `pseudodual chiral model' in 2+1 dimensions (`pseudodual' to a hierarchy
extending Ward's (modified) integrable chiral model). Applying the scaling
procedure to a method generating exact solutions of a matrix (potential) KP
hierarchy from solutions of a matrix linear heat hierarchy, leads to a
corresponding method that generates exact solutions of the matrix
dispersionless potential KP hierarchy, i.e. the pseudodual chiral model
hierarchy. We use this result to construct classes of exact solutions of the
su(m) pseudodual chiral model in 2+1 dimensions, including various multiple
lump configurations.
