The idea that the parton system created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions
(i) emerges in a state with transverse momenta close to thermodynamic
equilibrium and (ii) its evolution at early times is dominated by the
2-dimensional (transverse) hydrodynamics of the ideal fluid is investigated. It
is argued that this mechanism may help to solve the problem of early
equilibration.
