Using a combined quantum mechanical/classical method, we study the dynamics
of deposition of small Na clusters on Ar(001) surface. We work out basic
mechanisms by systematic variation of substrate activity, impact energy,
cluster orientations, cluster sizes, and charges. The soft Ar material is found
to serve as an extremely efficient shock absorber which provides cluster
capture in a broad range of impact energies. Reflection is only observed in
combination with destruction of the substrate. The kinetic energy of the
impinging cluster is rapidly transfered at first impact. The distribution of
the collision energy over the substrate proceeds very fast with velocity of
sound. The full thermalization of ionic and atomic energies goes at a much
slower pace with times of several ps. Charged clusters are found to have a much
stronger interface interaction and thus get in significantly closer contact
with the surface.
