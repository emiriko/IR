Wrinkling patterns at the metallized surface of thin polymer films are shown
to be sensitive to the sticky or slippery character of the polymer/substrate
interface (titanium coating, polystyrene film and coated silicon substrate).
Selective prefered wrinkle orientation and amplitude are achieved. Existing
theoretical models are expanded to specific boundary conditions (adhesive vs
slippery) and rationalize these observations.
