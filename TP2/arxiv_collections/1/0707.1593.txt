Uncertainties on parton distribution functions (PDFs) compromise discovery at
the LHC for any new physics which can be described as a contact-interaction.
PDF uncertainties also limit our ability to use W and Z cross-sections as an
accurate luminosity monitor. The impact of the current level of PDF uncertainty
on LHC physics is reviewed and the possibility of reducing this uncertainty
using LHC data is investigated.
