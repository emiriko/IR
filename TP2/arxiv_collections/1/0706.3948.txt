We investigate the infinite-dimensional two-orbital Hubbard model at
arbitrary band fillings. By means of the self-energy functional approach, we
discuss the stability of the metallic state in the systems with same and
different bandwidths. It is found that the Mott insulating phases are realized
at commensurate band fillings. Furthermore, it is clarified that the orbital
selective Mott phase with one orbital localized and the other itinerant is
stabilized even at fractional band fillings in the system with different
bandwidths.
