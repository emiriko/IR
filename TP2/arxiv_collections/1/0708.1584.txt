Physics of non-inertial reference frames is a generalizing of Newton's laws
to any reference frames. The first, Law of Kinematic in non-inertial reference
frames reads: the kinematic state of a body free of forces conserves and
determinates a constant n-th order derivative with respect to time being equal
in absolute value to an invariant of the observer's reference frame. The
second, Law of Dynamic extended Newton's second law to non-inertial reference
frames and also contains additional variables there are higher derivatives of
coordinates. Dynamics Law in non-inertial reference frames reads: a force
induces a change in the kinematic state of the body and is proportional to the
rate of its change. It is mean that if the kinematic invariant of the reference
frame is n-th derivative with respect the time, then the dynamics of a body
being affected by the force F is described by the (n+1)-th differential
equation. The third, Law of Static in non-inertial reference frames reads: the
sum of all forces acting a body at rest is equal to zero.
