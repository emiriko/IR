The mechanical properties of platinum monatomic chains were investigated by
simultaneous measurement of an effective stiffness and the conductance using
our newly developed mechanically controllable break junction (MCBJ) technique
with a tuning fork as a force sensor. When stretching a monatomic contact
(two-atom chain), the stiffness and conductance increases at the early stage of
stretching and then decreases just before breaking, which is attributed to a
transition of the chain configuration and bond weakening. A statistical
analysis was made to investigate the mechanical properties of monatomic chains.
The average stiffness shows minima at the peak positions of the
length-histogram. From this result we conclude that the peaks in the
length-histogram are a measure of the number of atoms in the chains, and that
the chains break from a strained state. Additionally, we find that the smaller
the initial stiffness of the chain is, the longer the chain becomes. This shows
that softer chains can be stretched longer.
