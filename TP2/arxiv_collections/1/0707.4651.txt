This brief paper: (1) Discusses strategies to generate random test cases that
can be used to extensively test any Linear Distance Program (LDP) software. (2)
Gives three numerical examples of input cases generated by this strategy that
cause problems in the Lawson and Hanson LDP module. (3) Proposes, as a standard
matter of acceptable implementation procedures, that (unless it is done
internally in the software itself, but, in general, this seems to be much rarer
than one would expect) all users should test the returned output from any LDP
module for self-consistency since it incurs only a small amount of added
computational overhead and it is not hard to do.
