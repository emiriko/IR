We consider the doped Rokhsar-Kivelson quantum dimer model on the triangular
lattice with one mobile hole (monomer) at the Rokhsar-Kivelson point. The
motion of the hole is described by two branches of excitations: the hole may
either move with or without a trapped Z2 vortex (vison). We perform a study of
the hole dispersion in the limit where the hole hopping amplitude is much
smaller than the interdimer interaction. In this limit, the hole without vison
moves freely and has a tight-binding spectrum. On the other hand, the hole with
a trapped vison is strongly constrained due to interference effects and can
only move via higher-order virtual processes.
