Encapsulation layers are explored for passivating the surfaces of silicon to
reduce optical absorption in the 1500-nm wavelength band. Surface-sensitive
test structures consisting of microdisk resonators are fabricated for this
purpose. Based on previous work in silicon photovoltaics, coatings of SiNx and
SiO2 are applied under varying deposition and annealing conditions. A short dry
thermal oxidation followed by a long high-temperature N2 anneal is found to be
most effective at long-term encapsulation and reduction of interface
absorption. Minimization of the optical loss is attributed to simultaneous
reduction in sub-bandgap silicon surface states and hydrogen in the capping
material.
