The probability representation, in which cosmological quantum states are
described by a standard positive probability distribution, is constructed for
minisuperspace models selected by Noether symmetries. In such a case, the
tomographic probability distribution provides the classical evolution for the
models and can be considered an approach to select "observable" universes. Some
specific examples, derived from Extended Theories of Gravity, are worked out.
We discuss also how to connect tomograms, symmetries and cosmological
parameters.
