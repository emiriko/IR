The theory, computer simulations, and experimental measurements are presented
for electrically small two-element supergain arrays with near optimal endfire
gains of 7 dB. We show how the difficulties of narrow tolerances, large
mismatches, low radiation efficiencies, and reduced scattering of electrically
small parasitic elements are overcome by using electrically small resonant
antennas as the elements in both separately driven and singly driven
(parasitic) two-element electrically small supergain endfire arrays. Although
rapidly increasing narrow tolerances prevent the practical realization of the
maximum theoretically possible endfire gain of electrically small arrays with
many elements, the theory and preliminary numerical simulations indicate that
near maximum supergains are also achievable in practice for electrically small
arrays with three (and possibly more) resonant elements if the decreasing
bandwidth with increasing number of elements can be tolerated.
