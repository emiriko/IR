M. Bestvina has shown that for any given torsion-free CAT(0) group G, all of
its boundaries are shape equivalent. He then posed the question of whether they
satisfy the stronger condition of being cell-like equivalent. In this article
we prove that the answer is "Yes" in the situation where the group in question
splits as a direct product with infinite factors. We accomplish this by proving
an interesting theorem in shape theory.
