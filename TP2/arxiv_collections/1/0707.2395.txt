Using the relativistic electrodynamics of continuous media formalism and main
relativistic quantum field theory principles the covariant Lagrangian of
electromagnetic field interaction with polarizable 1/2-spin particles have been
obtained. This Lagrangian let us to determine canonical and metric
energy-momentum tensors as well as low-energy Compton scattering amplitude. The
application of this Lagrangian for the calculation of the radiative correction
to the imaginary part of double virtual Compton scattering is demonstrated.
