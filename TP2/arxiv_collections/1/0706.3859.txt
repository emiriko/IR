Light charged particles emitted at about 90 deg in the frame of the
projectile-like fragment in semi-peripheral collisions of 93Nb+93Nb at 38A MeV
give evidence for the simultaneous occurrence of two different production
mechanisms. This is demonstrated by differences in the kinetic energy spectra
and in the isotopic composition of the particles. The emission with a softer
kinetic energy spectrum and a low N/Z ratio for the hydrogen isotopes is
attributed to an evaporation process. The harder emission, with a much higher
N/Z ratio, can be attributed to a ``midvelocity'' process consisting of a
non-isotropic emission, on a short time-scale, from the surface of the
projectile-like fragment.
