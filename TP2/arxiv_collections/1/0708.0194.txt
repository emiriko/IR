Triggering of long-lived nuclear isomeric states via coupling to the atomic
shells in the process of nuclear excitation by electron capture (NEEC) is
studied. NEEC occurring in highly-charged ions can excite the isomeric state to
a triggering level that subsequently decays to the ground state. We present
total cross sections for NEEC isomer triggering considering experimentally
confirmed low-lying triggering levels and reaction rates based on realistic
experimental parameters in ion storage rings. A comparison with other isomer
triggering mechanisms shows that, among these, NEEC is the most efficient.
