Quantum wire superlattices (1D) realized by controlled dislocation slipping
in quantum well superlattices (2D) (atomic saw method) have already shown
magnetophonon oscillations. This effect has been used to investigate the
electronic properties of such systems and prove the quantum character of the
physical properties of the wires. By cooling the temperature and using pulsed
magnetic field up to 35 T, we have observed both quantum Hall effect (QHE) and
Shubnikov de Haas (SdH) oscillations for various configurations of the magnetic
field. The effective masses deduced from the values of the fundamental fields
are coherent with those obtained with magnetophonon effect. The field rotation
induces a change in the resonance frequencies due to the modification of the
mass tensor as in a (3D) electron gas. In view the QHE, the plateaus observed
in rho_yz are dephased relatively to rho_zz minima which seems to be linked to
the dephasing of the minima of the density of states of the broadened Landau
levels.
