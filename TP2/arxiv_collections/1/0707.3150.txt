We examine the transverse momentum $Q_\perp$ dependence of the helicity
structure functions for massive vector bosons of mass $Q$ in hadron reactions.
We demonstrate that large logarithmic terms of the form $\ln(Q/Q_\perp)$ in the
helicity structure functions have the same origin as the logarithmic terms in
the angular-integrated cross section and that they can be resummed to all
orders in the strong coupling $\alpha_s$, in the same way as the
angular-integrated cross section. As a consequence of current conservation, the
resummed part of the helicity structure functions preserves the Lam-Tung
relation as a function of $Q_\perp$ to all orders in $\alpha_s$.
