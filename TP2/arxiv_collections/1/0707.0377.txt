Shapes of relative emission sources can be accessed by expanding shapes of
correlations at low relative velocities in pair center of mass in Cartesian
harmonics. Coefficients of expansion for correlations are related to the
respective coefficients of expansion for the sources through one dimensional
integral transforms involving properties of pair relative wavefunctions. The
methodology is illustrated with analyses of NA49 and PHENIX correlation data.
