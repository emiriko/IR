Optical reflectivity measurements were performed on a single crystal of the
d-electron heavy-fermion (HF) metal LiV2O4. The results evidence the highly
incoherent character of the charge dynamics for all temperatures above T^*
\approx 20 K. The spectral weight of the optical conductivity is redistributed
over extremely broad energy scales (~ 5 eV) as the quantum coherence of the
charge carriers is recovered. This wide redistribution is, in sharp contrast to
f-electron Kondo lattice HF systems, characteristic of a metallic system close
to a correlation driven insulating state. Our results thus reveal that strong
electronic correlation effects dominate the low-energy charge dynamics and
heavy quasiparticle formation in LiV2O4. We propose the geometrical
frustration, which limits the extension of charge and spin ordering, as an
additional key ingredient of the low-temperature heavy-fermion formation in
this system.
