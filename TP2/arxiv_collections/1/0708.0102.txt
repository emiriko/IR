A geometric method is described to characterize the different kinds of
extremals in optimal control theory. This comes from the use of a presymplectic
constraint algorithm starting from the necessary conditions given by
Pontryagin's Maximum Principle. Apart from the design of this general algorithm
useful for any optimal control problem, it is showed how it works to split the
set of extremals and, in particular, to characterize the strict abnormality. An
example of strict abnormal extremal for a particular control-affine system is
also given.
