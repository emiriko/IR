E-Laboratories are important components of e- learning environments,
especially in scientific and technical disciplines. First widespread E-Labs
consisted in proposing simulations of real systems (virtual labs), as building
remote labs (remote control of real systems) was difficult by lack of
industrial standards and common protocols. Nowadays, robotics and automation
technologies make easier the interfacing of systems with computers. In this
frame, many researchers (such as those mentioned in [1]) focus on how to set up
such a remote control. But, only a few of them deal with the educational point
of view of the problem. This paper outlines our current research and reflection
about remote laboratory modelling.
