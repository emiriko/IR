The master asymptotic behavior of the usual parachor correlations, expressing
surface tension $\sigma$ as a power law of the density difference
$\rho_{L}-\rho_{V}$ between coexisting liquid and vapor, is analyzed for a
series of pure compounds close to their liquid-vapor critical point, using only
four critical parameters $(\beta_{c})^{-1}$, $\alpha_{c}$, $Z_{c}$ and $Y_{c}$,
for each fluid.
  ... The main consequences of these theoretical estimations are discussed in
the light of engineering applications and process simulations where parachor
correlations constitute one of the most practical method for estimating surface
tension from density and capillary rise measurements.
