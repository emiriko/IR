In a recent paper Donaldson defines three operators on a space of Hermitian
metrics on a complex projective manifold: $T, T_{\nu}, T_K.$ Iterations of
these operators converge to balanced metrics, and these themselves approximate
constant scalar curvature metrics. In this paper we investigate the convergence
properties of these iterations by examining the case of the Riemann sphere as
well as higher dimensional $\mathbb{CP}^n$.
