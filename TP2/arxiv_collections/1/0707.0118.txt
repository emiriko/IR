Neutral and charged current deep inelastic scattering cross sections and
structure functions are presented. The review also discusses improvements to
the parton density measurements using jet cross section data and recent high
$Q^{2}$ inclusive cross section measurements. The projected parton density
uncertainties using the entire HERA data set are also presented.
