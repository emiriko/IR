In this paper the singlet and non-singlet structure functions have been
obtained by solving Dokshitzer, Gribove, Lipatov, Alterelli, Parisi (DGLAP)
evolution equations in leading order (LO) and next to leading order (NLO) at
the small x limit. Here we have used a Taylor Series expansion and then the
method of characteristics to solve the evolution equations. We have also
calculated t and x-evolutions of deuteron structure function and the results
are compared with the New Muon Collaboration (NMC) data.
