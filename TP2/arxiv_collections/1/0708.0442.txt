Based on a microscopic many-particle theory, we predict large optical gain in
the probe and background-free four-wave mixing directions caused by excitonic
instabilities in semiconductor quantum wells. For a single quantum well with
radiative-decay limited dephasing in a typical pump-probe setup we discuss the
microscopic driving mechanisms and polarization and frequency dependence of
these instabilities.
