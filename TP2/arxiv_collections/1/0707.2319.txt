All measurable predictions of classical mechanics can be reproduced from a
quantum-like interpretation of a nonlinear Schrodinger equation. The key
observation leading to classical physics is the fact that a wave function that
satisfies a linear equation is real and positive, rather than complex. This has
profound implications on the role of the Bohmian classical-like interpretation
of linear quantum mechanics, as well as on the possibilities to find a
consistent interpretation of arbitrary nonlinear generalizations of quantum
mechanics.
