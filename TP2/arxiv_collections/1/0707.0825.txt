We propose a procedure which allows one to construct local symmetry
generators of general quadratic Lagrangian theory. Manifest recurrence
relations for generators in terms of so-called structure matrices of the Dirac
formalism are obtained. The procedure fulfilled in terms of initial variables
of the theory, and do not implies either separation of constraints on first and
second class subsets or any other choice of basis for constraints.
