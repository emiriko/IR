We present a theoretical study of the electronic structure of modulated
graphene in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field. The density of
states and the bandwidth for the Dirac electrons in this system are determined.
The appearance of unusual Weiss oscillations in the bandwidth and density of
states is the main focus of this work.
