Most particle induced X-ray emission (PIXE) data analysis codes are not
focused on handling multilayered samples. We have developed an open-source
library called "LibCPIXE", for PIXE data analysis. It is written in standard C
and implements functions for simulating X-ray yields of PIXE spectra taken from
arbitrary samples, including multilayered targets. The library is designed to
be fast, portable, modular and scalable, as well as to facilitate its
incorporation into any existing program. In order to demonstrate the
capabilities of the library, a program called CPIXE was developed and used to
analyze various real samples involving both bulk and layered samples. Just as
the library, the CPIXE source code is freely available under the General Public
License. We demonstrate that it runs both under GNU/Linux systems as well as
under MS Windows. There is in principle no limitation to port it to other
platforms.
