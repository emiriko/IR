We study the dynamics and resulting score distribution of three-agent games
where after each competition a single agent wins and scores a point. A single
competition is described by a triplet of numbers $p$, $t$ and $q$ denoting the
probabilities that the team with the highest, middle or lowest accumulated
score wins. We study the full family of solutions in the regime, where the
number of agents and competitions is large, which can be regarded as a
hydrodynamic limit. Depending on the parameter values $(p,q,t)$, we find six
qualitatively different asymptotic score distributions and we also provide a
qualitative understanding of these results. We checked our analytical results
against numerical simulations of the microscopic model and find these to be in
excellent agreement. The three agent game can be regarded as a social model
where a player can be favored or disfavored for advancement, based on his/her
accumulated score. It is also possible to decide the outcome of a three agent
game through a mini tournament of two-a gent competitions among the
participating players and it turns out that the resulting possible score
distributions are a subset of those obtained for the general three agent-games.
We discuss how one can add a steady and democratic decline rate to the model
and present a simple geometric construction that allows one to write down the
corresponding score evolution equations for $n$-agent games.
