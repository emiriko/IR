Recent work has demonstrated the strong qualitative differences between the
dynamics near a glass transition driven by short-ranged repulsion and one
governed by short-ranged attraction. Here, we study in detail the behavior of
non-linear, higher-order correlation functions that measure the growth of
length scales associated with dynamical heterogeneity in both types of systems.
We find that this measure is qualitatively different in the repulsive and
attractive cases with regards to the wave vector dependence as well as the time
dependence of the standard non-linear four-point dynamical susceptibility. We
discuss the implications of these results for the general understanding of
dynamical heterogeneity in glass-forming liquids.
