We consider the polynuclear growth (PNG) model in 1+1 dimension with flat
initial condition and no extra constraints. The joint distributions of surface
height at finitely many points at a fixed time moment are given as marginals of
a signed determinantal point process. The long time scaling limit of the
surface height is shown to coincide with the Airy_1 process. This result holds
more generally for the observation points located along any space-like path in
the space-time plane. We also obtain the corresponding results for the discrete
time TASEP (totally asymmetric simple exclusion process) with parallel update.
