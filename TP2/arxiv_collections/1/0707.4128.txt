A spin-polarized current with the polarization perpendicular to the plane of
a vortex-state disk results in renormalization of the effective damping for a
given magnetization mode, and the effective damping becomes zero if the current
exceeds a threshold value. The lowest threshold current corresponds to the
lowest frequency vortex gyroscopic mode. For larger values of the current the
dynamic magnetization state is characterized by precession of the vortex around
the dot center with non-small amplitude and higher frequency.
