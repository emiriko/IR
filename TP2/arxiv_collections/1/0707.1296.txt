Recently, axion-like particle search has received renewed interest. In
particular, several groups have started ``light shining through a wall''
experiments based on magnetic field and laser both continuous, which is very
demanding in terms of detector background. We present here the 2$\sigma$ limits
obtained so far with our novel set-up consisting of a pulsed magnetic field and
a pulsed laser. In particular, we have found that the axion-like particle two
photons inverse coupling constant $M$ is $> 8\times 10^5$ GeV provided that the
particle mass $m_\mathrm{a} \sim$ 1 meV. Our results definitively invalidate
the axion interpretation of the original PVLAS optical measurements with a
confidence level greater than 99.9%.
