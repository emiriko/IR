We compute Poisson kernels for integer weight parameter standard weighted
biharmonic operators in the unit disc with Dirichlet boundary conditions. The
computations performed extend the supply of explicit examples of such kernels
and suggest similar formulas for these Poisson kernels to hold true in more
generality. Computations have been carried out using the open source computer
algebra package Maxima.
