The results of investigation of kinetics of nanopores filling into membranes
from aluminum oxide (pore diameter - 200 nm, porosity ~ 50%) at
electrodeposition of copper and silver are described. It is shown, that at
identical quantity of electricity passed through solutions, the degree of pores
filling by metal (average thickness of a deposit) is various for copper and
silver deposition. Calculated (according Faraday Law) and experimental
dependences of deposition rates of these metals on quantity of electricity
passed at direct and pulse currents are presented. Galvanodynamic i - v
dependences have been obtained at various current scanning rates. The smaller
rate of deposition allows to decrease concentration limitations of electrode
process and to obtain higher average thickness of metal deposits and higher
filling degree. The limiting values of quantity of electricity for direct and
pulse currents were determined. The average thickness of silver and copper
deposits was obtained. A degree of pores filling, the morphology and chemical
microanalysis were studied on cross-section of the membrane, using TESCAN SEM
equipped with an Oxford Instruments INCA Enerqy EDX-system.
