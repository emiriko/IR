We present the first results of directional point-contact spectroscopy in
high quality CaC6 samples both along the ab plane and in the c-axis direction.
The superconducting order parameter \Delta(0), obtained by fitting the
Andreev-reflection (AR) conductance curves at temperatures down to 400 mK with
the single-band 3D Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk model, presents two different
distributions in the two directions of the main current injection, peaked at
1.35 and 1.71 meV, respectively. By ab-initio calculations of the AR
conductance spectra, we show that the experimental results are in good
agreement with the recent predictions of gap anisotropy in CaC6.
