We show that the presumed wavy roughness distributed along the wall of
different nanopores (radius : a around 3.5 nm for Vycor or a silica glass;
around 245 nm for porous gold) will induce larger volume flow rates of solid
helium (of which there is a minimum) which might explain reported experimental
differences of the supersolid fractions observed so far.
