We use molecular dynamics computer simulations to investigate a critical
temperature T_c for a dynamical glass transition as proposed by the
mode-coupling theory (MCT) of dense liquids in a glass forming
Ni_{0.8}Zr_{0.2}-system. The critical temperature T_c are analyzed from
different quantities and checked the consistency of the estimated values, i.e.
from (i) the non-vanishing nonergodicity parameters as asymptotic solutions of
the MCT equations in the arrested state, (ii) the ${\bf{g}}_m$-parameters
describing the approach of the melt towards the arrested state on the ergodic
side, (iii) the diffusion coefficients in the melt. The resulting T_c values
are found to agree within about 10%.
