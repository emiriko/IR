A which-way measurement in Young's double-slit will destroy the interference
pattern. Bohr claimed this complementarity between wave- and particle behaviour
is enforced by Heisenberg's uncertainty principle: distinguishing two positions
a distance s apart transfers a random momentum q \sim \hbar/s to the particle.
This claim has been subject to debate: Scully et al. asserted that in some
situations interference can be destroyed with no momentum transfer, while
Storey et al. asserted that Bohr's stance is always valid. We address this
issue using the experimental technique of weak measurement. We measure a
distribution for q that spreads well beyond [-\hbar/s, \hbar/s], but
nevertheless has a variance consistent with zero. This weakvalued
momentum-transfer distribution P_{wv}(q) thus reflects both sides of the
debate.
