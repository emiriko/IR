In this review, I first discuss briefly some theoretical motivations for
potential Lorentz Violation and deviation from ordinary quantum mechanical
behavior (decoherence) of field theoretic systems in the background of some
quantum gravity (QG) models. Both types of effects lead to CPT violation, but
they can be disentangled experimentally. I, then, proceed to a description of
precision tests of CPT symmetry using neutral and charged Kaons, which are of
direct relevance to the main theme of this conference. I emphasize the
potentially unique r\^ole of neutral meson factories in providing
``smoking-gun'' evidence of some QG-decoherence models in which the CPT quantum
mechanical operator is not well defined. This is achieved by means of potential
observations of QG-induced modifications of the pertinent
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) particle correlations.
