Given a holomorphic vector bundle $\cale$ on a connected compact complex
manifold X, [FLS] construct a $\compl$-linear functional $I_{\cale}$ on
$\hh{2n}{\compl}$. This is done by constructing a linear functional on the 0-th
completed Hochschild homology $\choch{0}{(\dif(\cale))}$ of the sheaf of
holomorphic differential operators on $\cale$ using topological quantum
mechanics. They show that this functional is $\int_X$ if $\cale$ has non zero
Euler characteristic. They conjecture that this functional is $\int_X$ for all
$\cale$.
  A subsequent work [Ram] by the author proved that the linear functional
$I_{\cale}$ is independent of the vector bundle $\cale$. This note builds upon
the work in [Ram] to prove that $I_{\cale}=\int_X$ for an arbitrary holomorphic
vector bundle $\cale$ on an arbitrary connected compact complex manifold X.
This is done using an argument that is very natural from the geometric point of
view. This argument enables us to extend the construction in [FLS] to a
construction of a linear functional $I_{\cale}$ on
$\text{H}^{2n}_{c}(Y,\compl)$ for an arbitrary holomorphic vector bundle
$\cale$ on an arbitrary connected complex manifold Y and prove that $I_{\cale}
= \int_Y$. We also generalize a result of [Ram] pertaining to "cyclic homology
analogs" of $I_{\cale}$.
