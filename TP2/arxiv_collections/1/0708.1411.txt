We consider the decoding of bit interleaved coded modulation (BICM) applied
to multiband OFDM for practical scenarios where only a noisy (possibly very
bad) estimate of the channel is available at the receiver. First, a decoding
metric based on the channel it a posteriori probability density, conditioned on
the channel estimate is derived and used for decoding BICM multiband OFDM.
Then, we characterize the limits of reliable information rates in terms of the
maximal achievable outage rates associated to the proposed metric. We also
compare our results with the outage rates of a system using a theoretical
decoder. Our results are useful for designing a communication system where a
prescribed quality of service (QoS), in terms of achievable target rates with
small error probability, must be satisfied even in the presence of imperfect
channel estimation. Numerical results over both realistic UWB and theoretical
Rayleigh fading channels show that the proposed method provides significant
gain in terms of BER and outage rates compared to the classical mismatched
detector, without introducing any additional complexity.
