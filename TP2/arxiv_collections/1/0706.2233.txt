In this article, localized linear defect modes due to bandgap guidance in
two-dimensional photonic lattices with localized or non-localized defects are
investigated theoretically. First, when the defect is localized and weak,
eigenvalues of defect modes bifurcated from edges of Bloch bands are derived
analytically. It is shown that in an attractive (repulsive) defect, defect
modes bifurcate out from Bloch-band edges with normal (anomalous) diffraction
coefficients. Furthermore, distances between defect-mode eigenvalues and
Bloch-band edges are exponentially small functions of the defect strength,
which is very different from the one-dimensional case where such distances are
quadratically small with the defect strength. It is also found that some
defect-mode branches bifurcate not from Bloch-band edges, but from quasi-edge
points within Bloch bands, which is very unusual. Second, when the defect is
localized but strong, defect modes are determined numerically. It is shown that
both the repulsive and attractive defects can support various types of defect
modes such as fundamental, dipole, quadrupole, and vortex modes. These modes
reside in various bandgaps of the photonic lattice. As the defect strength
increases, defect modes move from lower bandgaps to higher ones when the defect
is repulsive, but remain within each bandgap when the defect is attractive,
similar to the one-dimensional case. The same phenomena are observed when the
defect is held fixed while the applied dc field (which controls the lattice
potential) increases. Lastly, if the defect is non-localized (i.e. it persists
at large distances in the lattice), it is shown that defect modes can be
embedded inside the continuous spectrum, and they can bifurcate out from edges
of the continuous spectrum algebraically rather than exponentially.
