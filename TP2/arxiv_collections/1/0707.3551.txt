Using the harmonic theory developed by Takegoshi for representation of
relative cohomology and the framework of computation of curvature of direct
images bundles by Berndtsson, we prove that the higher direct images by a
smooth morphism of the relative canonical bundle twisted by a semi-positive
vector bundle are locally free and semi-positively curved, when endowed with a
suitable Hodge type metric.
