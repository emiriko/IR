Recently, Li and Liu have studied global monoole of tachyon in a four
dimensional static space-time. We analyze the motion of massless and massive
particles around tachyon monopole. Interestingly, for the bending of light rays
due to tachyon monopole instead of getting angle of deficit we find angle of
surplus. Also we find that the tachyon monopole exerts an attractive
gravitational force towards matter.
