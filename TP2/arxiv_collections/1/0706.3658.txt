This paper is devoted to detailed investigations of free scalar field theory
on $\kappa$-Minkowski space. After reviewing necessary mathematical tools we
discuss in depth the Lagrangian and solutions of field equations. We analyze
the spacetime symmetries of the model and construct the conserved charges
associated with translational and Lorentz symmetry. We show that the version of
the theory usually studied breaks Lorentz invariance in a subtle way: There is
an additional trans-Planckian mode present, and an associated conserved charge
(the number of such modes) is not a Lorentz scalar.
