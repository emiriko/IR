Superconducting quantum circuits, fabricated with multiple layers, are
proposed to implement perfect quantum state transfer between nodes of a
hypercube network. For tunable devices such as the phase qubit, each node can
transmit quantum information to any other node at a constant rate independent
of the distance between qubits. The physical limits of quantum state transfer
in this network are theoretically analyzed, including the effects of disorder,
decoherence, and higher-order couplings.
