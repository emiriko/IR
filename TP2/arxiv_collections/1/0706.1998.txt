We have made a detailed proposal for a two-channel quantum dot setup. The
energy scales in the problem are such that we are able to make connection with
the two-channel Anderson model, which, in spite of being well-known in the
context of heavy-Fermion systems remained theoretically elusive until recently
and lacked a mesoscopic realization. Verification of our precise and robust
predictions for the differential capacitance lineshape of the dot will provide
an experimental signature of the two-channel behavior.
