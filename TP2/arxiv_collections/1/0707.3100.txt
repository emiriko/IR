We present results on two-particle correlations using singly-strange
particles ($\Lambda$, $\bar{\Lambda}$, $K^0_S$) and charged hadrons at
intermediate p_T in d+Au and Au+Au collisions at RHIC. We discuss properties of
the near-side correlation peak in both azimuthal and pseudo-rapidity space and
separate jet-like contributions from the long-range pseudo-rapidity
correlations (the ridge). In particular, we study the centrality and p_T
dependence of the jet and ridge yields for various trigger and associated
particle species and compare the results to model predictions.
