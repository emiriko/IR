The aim of these notes is to elucidate some aspects of quantum field theory
in curved spacetime, especially those relating to the notion of particles. A
selection of issues relevant to wave-particle duality is given. The case of a
generic curved spacetime is outlined. A Hamiltonian formulation of quantum
field theory in curved spacetime is elaborated for a preferred reference frame
with a separated space metric (a static spacetime and a reductive synchronous
reference frame). Applications: (1) Black hole. (2) The universe; the
cosmological redshift is obtained in the context of quantum field theory.
