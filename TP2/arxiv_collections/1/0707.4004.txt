Can the presence of molecular-tilt order significantly affect the shapes of
lipid bilayer membranes, particularly membrane shapes with narrow necks?
Motivated by the propensity for tilt order and the common occurrence of narrow
necks in the intermediate stages of biological processes such as endocytosis
and vesicle trafficking, we examine how tilt order inhibits the formation of
necks in the equilibrium shapes of vesicles. For vesicles with a spherical
topology, point defects in the molecular order with a total strength of $+2$
are required. We study axisymmetric shapes and suppose that there is a
unit-strength defect at each pole of the vesicle. The model is further
simplified by the assumption of tilt isotropy: invariance of the energy with
respect to rotations of the molecules about the local membrane normal. This
isotropy condition leads to a minimal coupling of tilt order and curvature,
giving a high energetic cost to regions with Gaussian curvature and tilt order.
Minimizing the elastic free energy with constraints of fixed area and fixed
enclosed volume determines the allowed shapes. Using numerical calculations, we
find several branches of solutions and identify them with the branches
previously known for fluid membranes. We find that tilt order changes the
relative energy of the branches, suppressing thin necks by making them costly,
leading to elongated prolate vesicles as a generic family of tilt-ordered
membrane shapes.
