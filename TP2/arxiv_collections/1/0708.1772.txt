We analyze the vacuum structure of SU(2) QCD with multiple massless adjoint
representation fermions formulated on a small spatial $S^1 \times \R^3$. The
absence of thermal fluctuations, and the fact that quantum fluctuations
favoring the vacuum with unbroken center symmetry in a weakly coupled regime
renders the interesting dynamics of these theories analytically calculable.
Confinement, the area law behavior for large Wilson loops, and the generation
of the mass gap in the gluonic sector are shown analytically. By abelian
duality transformation, the long distance effective theory of QCD is mapped
into an amalgamation of $d=3$ dimensional Sine-Gordon and NJL models. The
duality necessitates going to IR first. In this regime, theory exhibits
confinement without continuous chiral symmetry breaking. However, a flavor
singlet chiral condensate (which breaks a discrete chiral symmetry) persists at
arbitrarily small $S^1$. Under the reasonable assumption that the theory on
$\R^4$ exhibits chiral symmetry breaking, there must exist a zero temperature
chiral phase transition in the absence of any change in spatial center symmetry
realizations.
