In the framework of the instanton vacuum model we make expansion over the
current mass m and number of colors N_c and evaluate ${\cal O}(1/N_c, m, m/N_c,
m \ln m/N_c)$-corrections to the dynamical quark mass M, the quark condensate
$<\bar qq>$, the pion mass M_\pi and decay constant F_\pi. There are several
sources of these corrections: meson loops, finite size of the instanton
distribution and the quark-quark "tensor" interaction terms. In contrast to the
expectations, we found that numerically the 1/N_c-corrections to dynamical mass
are large and mostly come from meson loops. As a consequence, we have large
1/N_c-corrections to all the other quantities. To provide the values of
$F_\pi(m=0), \ave{\bar qq(m=0)}$ in agreement with \chiPT, we offer a new set
of parameters \rho, R. Finally, we find the low-energy SU(2)_f chiral
lagrangian constants $\bar l_3, \bar l_4$ in a rather good correspondence with
the phenomenology.
