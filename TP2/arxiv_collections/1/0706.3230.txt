A dynamical theory of geophysical precipitation pattern formation is
presented and applied to irreversible calcium carbonate (travertine)
deposition. Specific systems studied here are the terraces and domes observed
at geothermal hot springs, such as those at Yellowstone National Park, and
speleothems, particularly stalactites and stalagmites. The theory couples the
precipitation front dynamics with shallow water flow, including corrections for
turbulent drag and curvature effects. In the absence of capillarity and with a
laminar flow profile, the theory predicts a one-parameter family of steady
state solutions to the moving boundary problem describing the precipitation
front. These shapes match well the measured shapes near the vent at the top of
observed travertine domes. Closer to the base of the dome, the solutions
deviate from observations, and circular symmetry is broken by a fluting
pattern, which we show is associated with capillary forces causing thin film
break-up. We relate our model to that recently proposed for stalactite growth,
and calculate the linear stability spectrum of both travertine domes and
stalactites. Lastly, we apply the theory to the problem of precipitation
pattern formation arising from turbulent flow down an inclined plane, and
identify a linear instability that underlies scale-invariant travertine terrace
formation at geothermal hot springs.
