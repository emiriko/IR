We investigate the phase transition in full QCD with two flavors of staggered
fermions in presence of a constant abelian chromomagnetic field. We find that
the critical temperature depends on the strength of the chromomagnetic field
and that the deconfined phase extends to very low temperatures for strong
enough fields. As in the case of zero external field, a single transition is
detected, within statistical uncertainties, where both deconfinement and chiral
symmetry restoration take place. We also find that the chiral condensate
increases with the strength of the chromomagnetic field.
