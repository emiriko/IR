We experimentally investigate the critical behavior of a phase transition
between two topologically different turbulent states of electrohydrodynamic
convection in nematic liquid crystals. The statistical properties of the
observed spatiotemporal intermittency regimes are carefully determined,
yielding a complete set of static critical exponents in full agreement with
those defining the directed percolation class in (2+1) dimensions. This
constitutes the first clear and comprehensive experimental evidence of an
absorbing phase transition in this prominent non-equilibrium universality
class.
