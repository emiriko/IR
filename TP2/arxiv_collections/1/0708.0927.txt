We live in the Information Age, and information has become a critically
important component of our life. The success of the Internet made huge amounts
of it easily available and accessible to everyone. To keep the flow of this
information manageable, means for its faultless circulation and effective
handling have become urgently required. Considerable research efforts are
dedicated today to address this necessity, but they are seriously hampered by
the lack of a common agreement about "What is information?" In particular, what
is "visual information" - human's primary input from the surrounding world. The
problem is further aggravated by a long-lasting stance borrowed from the
biological vision research that assumes human-like information processing as an
enigmatic mix of perceptual and cognitive vision faculties. I am trying to find
a remedy for this bizarre situation. Relying on a new definition of
"information", which can be derived from Kolmogorov's compexity theory and
Chaitin's notion of algorithmic information, I propose a unifying framework for
visual information processing, which explicitly accounts for the perceptual and
cognitive image processing peculiarities. I believe that this framework will be
useful to overcome the difficulties that are impeding our attempts to develop
the right model of human-like intelligent image processing.
