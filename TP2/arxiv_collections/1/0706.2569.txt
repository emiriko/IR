We compare different procedures for combining fixed-order tree-level
matrix-element generators with parton showers. We use the case of W-production
at the Tevatron and the LHC to compare different implementations of the
so-called CKKW and MLM schemes using different matrix-element generators and
different parton cascades. We find that although similar results are obtained
in all cases, there are important differences.
