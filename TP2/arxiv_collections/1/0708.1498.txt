We introduce the method of using an annealing genetic algorithm to the
numerically complex problem of looking for quantum logic gates which
simultaneously have highest fidelity and highest success probability. We first
use the linear optical quantum nonlinear sign (NS) gate as an example to
illustrate the efficiency of this method. We show that by appropriately
choosing the annealing parameters, we can reach the theoretical maximum success
probability (1/4 for NS) for each attempt. We then examine the controlled-z
(CZ) gate as the first new problem to be solved. We show results that agree
with the highest known maximum success probability for a CZ gate (2/27) while
maintaining a fidelity of 0.9997. Since the purpose of our algorithm is to
optimize a unitary matrix for quantum transformations, it could easily be
applied to other areas of interest such as quantum optics and quantum sensors.
