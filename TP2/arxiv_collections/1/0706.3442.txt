We compare results of $k_t$-factorization approach and next-to-leading order
collinear-factorization approach for photon-jet correlations in $pp$ and $p
\bar p$ collisions at RHIC, Tevatron and LHC energies. We discuss correlations
in azimuthal angle as well as in two-dimensional space of transverse momenta of
photon and jet. Different unintegrated parton distributions (UPDF) are included
in the $k_t$-factorization approach. The results depend on UPDFs used. The
results of NLO collinear-factorization are shown for comparison.
