The tensor properties of the algebra generators and the basis are determined
in respect to the reduction chain $Sp(12,R) \supset U(6)% \supset U(3)\otimes
U(2)\supset O(3)\otimes (U(1)\otimes U(1))$, which defines one of the dynamical
symmetries of the Interacting Vector Boson Model. The action of the Sp(12,R)
generators as transition operators between the basis states is presented.
Analytical expressions for their matrix elements in the symmetry-adapted basis
are obtained. As an example the matrix elements of the E2 transition operator
between collective states of the ground band are determined and compared with
the experimental data for the corresponding intraband transition probabilities
of nuclei in the actinide and rare earth region. On the basis of this
application the important role of the symplectic extension of the model is
analyzed.
