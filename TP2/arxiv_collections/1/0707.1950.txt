We study an integrable case of n-particle Toda lattice: open chain with
boundary terms containing 4 parameters. For this model we construct a
B\"acklund transformation and prove its basic properties: canonicity,
commutativity and spectrality. The B\"acklund transformation can be also viewed
as a discretized time dynamics. Two Lax matrices are used: of order 2 and of
order 2n+2, which are mutually dual, sharing the same spectral curve.
