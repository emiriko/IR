We report on the production of a F=1 spinor condensate of 87Rb atoms in a
single beam optical dipole trap formed by a focused CO2 laser. The condensate
is produced 13mm below the tip of a scanning electron microscope employing
standard all-optical techniques. The condensate fraction contains up to 100,000
atoms and we achieve a duty cycle of less than 10s.
