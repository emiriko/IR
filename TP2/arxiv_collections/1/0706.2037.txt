An elastic surface model is investigated by using the canonical Monte Carlo
simulation technique on triangulated spherical meshes. The model undergoes a
first-order collapsing transition and a continuous surface fluctuation
transition. The shape of surfaces is maintained by a one-dimensional bending
energy, which is defined on the mesh, and no two-dimensional bending energy is
included in the Hamiltonian.
