The ground-state hyperfine splitting values of high-Z boronlike ions are
calculated. Calculation of the interelectronic-interaction contribution is
based on a combination of the 1/Z perturbation theory and the large-scale
configuration-interaction Dirac-Fock-Sturm method. The screened QED corrections
are evaluated utilizing an effective screening potential approach. Total
hyperfine splitting energies are presented for several B-like ions of
particular interest: {}^{45}Sc{}^{16+}, {}^{57}Fe{}^{21+}, {}^{207}Pb{}^{77+},
and {}^{209}Bi{}^{78+}. For lead and bismuth the experimental values of the 1s
hyperfine splitting are employed to improve significantly the theoretical
results by reducing the uncertainty due to the nuclear effects.
