To investigate ultracold fermionic atoms of three internal states (colors) in
an optical lattice, subject to strong attractive interaction, we study the
attractive three-color Hubbard model in infinite dimensions by using a
variational approach. We find a quantum phase transition between a
weak-coupling superconducting phase and a strong-coupling trionic phase where
groups of three atoms are bound to a composite fermion. We show how the
Gutzwiller variational theory can be reformulated in terms of an effective
field theory with three-body interactions and how this effective field theory
can be solved exactly in infinite dimensions by using the methods of dynamical
mean field theory.
