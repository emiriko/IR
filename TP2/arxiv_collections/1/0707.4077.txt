The semi-inclusive difference asymmetry A^{h^{+}-h^{-}} for hadrons of
opposite charge has been measured by the COMPASS experiment at CERN. The data
were collected in the years 2002-2004 using a 160 GeV polarised muon beam
scattered off a large polarised ^6LiD target and cover the range 0.006 < x <
0.7 and 1 < Q^2 < 100 (GeV/c)^2. In leading order QCD (LO) the asymmetry
A_d^{h^{+}-h^{-}} measures the valence quark polarisation and provides an
evaluation of the first moment of Delta u_v + Delta d_v which is found to be
equal to 0.40 +- 0.07 (stat.) +- 0.05 (syst.) over the measured range of x at
Q^2 = 10 (GeV/c)^2. When combined with the first moment of g_1^d previously
measured on the same data, this result favours a non-symmetric polarisation of
light quarks Delta u-bar = - Delta d-bar at a confidence level of two standard
deviations, in contrast to the often assumed symmetric scenario Delta u-bar =
Delta d-bar = Delta s-bar = Delta s.
