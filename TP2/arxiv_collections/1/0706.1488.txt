In a quantizing magnetic field, the two-dimensional electron (2DEG) gas has a
rich phase diagram with broken translational symmetry phases such as Wigner,
bubble, and stripe crystals. In this paper, we derive a method to get the
dynamical matrix of these crystals from a calculation of the density response
function performed in the Generalized Random Phase Approximation (GRPA). We
discuss the validity of our method by comparing the dynamical matrix calculated
from the GRPA with that obtained from standard elasticity theory with the
elastic coefficients obtained from a calculation of the deformation energy of
the crystal.
