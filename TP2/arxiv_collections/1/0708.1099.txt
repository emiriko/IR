Attosecond pulses can be used to initiate and control electron dynamics on a
sub-femtosecond time scale. The first step in this process occurs when an atom
absorbs an ultraviolet photon leading to the formation of an attosecond
electron wave packet (EWP). Until now, attosecond pulses have been used to
create free EWPs in the continuum, where they quickly disperse. In this paper
we use a train of attosecond pulses, synchronized to an infrared (IR) laser
field, to create a series of EWPs that are below the ionization threshold in
helium. We show that the ionization probability then becomes a function of the
delay between the IR and attosecond fields. Calculations that reproduce the
experimental results demonstrate that this ionization control results from
interference between transiently bound EWPs created by different pulses in the
train. In this way, we are able to observe, for the first time, wave packet
interference in a strongly driven atomic system.
