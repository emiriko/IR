We report the direct observation of slow fluctuations of helical
antiferromagnetic domains in an ultra-thin holmium film using coherent resonant
magnetic x-ray scattering. We observe a gradual increase of the fluctuations in
the speckle pattern with increasing temperature, while at the same time a
static contribution to the speckle pattern remains. This finding indicates that
domain-wall fluctuations occur over a large range of time scales. We ascribe
this non-ergodic behavior to the strong dependence of the fluctuation rate on
the local thickness of the film.
