We present the analytical Bethe ansatz for spin chains based on the
superalgebras gl(M|N), $M\neq N$, with at each site an arbitrary representation
(and including inhomogeneities).
  The calculation is done for closed and open spin chains. In this latter case,
the boundary matrices $K_{\pm}(u)$ are of general type, provided they commute.
We compute the Bethe ansatz equations in full generality, and for any type of
Dynkin diagram. Examples are worked out to illustrate the techniques.
