The thermal heating of aligned nuclear targets of HIO_3, LiIO_3 ans Sb target
materials under neutron irradiation at JSNS is considered. It is shown that
presently the targets of large volumes (several tens of cm^3) can be used in
experiment. The optimal target dimensions are recommended for investigation
with resonance neutrons. The use of proposed aligned targets at the new neutron
spallation source JSNS (Japan) will make p[ossible to discover TRIV or decrease
the present limit on the intensity of parity conserving time violating
interaction by two-three order of magnitude.
