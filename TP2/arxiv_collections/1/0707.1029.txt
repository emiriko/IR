The standard series expansion for the period of a finite amplitude pendulum
as a function of energy (and hence amplitude) provides a lower limit on the
period when the series is truncated. An adjustment to the last term in the
truncated series to take account of the dropped terms improves the accuracy of
the approximation and provides an upper limit on the period. More accurate
approximations can then be obtained using intermediate expressions.
