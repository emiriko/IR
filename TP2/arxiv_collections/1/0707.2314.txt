The running coupling is introduced into the equation for the odderon via the
bootstrap relation. It is shown that the previously found odderon state with a
maximal intercept, which is constructed from antisymmetric pomeron wave
function, continues to exist in the running coupling case. Its intercept is
found to remain equal to unity independent of the behaviour assumed for the
running coupling at low momenta.
