Transition frequencies of Fe II ion are known to be very sensitive to
variation of the fine structure constant \alpha. The resonance absorption lines
of Fe II from objects at cosmological distances are used in a search for the
possible variation of \alpha in cause of cosmic time. In this paper we
calculated the dependence of the transition frequencies on \alpha^2 (q-factors)
for Fe II ion. We found corrections to these coefficients from valence-valence
and core-valence correlations and from the Breit interaction. Both the
core-valence correlation and Breit corrections to the q-factors appeared to be
larger than had been anticipated previously. Nevertheless our calculation
confirms that the Fe II absorption lines seen in quasar spectra have large
q-factors of both signs and thus the ion Fe II alone can be used in the search
for the \alpha-variation at different cosmological epochs.
