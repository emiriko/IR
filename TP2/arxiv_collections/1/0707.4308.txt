The new interpretation of Mach's principle of mass of a particle being a
measure of the interactions of this particle with all other gravitating
particles inside its causal spheres is introduced. It is shown that within some
alternative model of gravitation that incorporates this principle, the Machian
influence of the universe can reduce Planck's scale to the electro-weak scale
and the large number that is needed to explain the hierarchy between the scales
is the amount of gravitating particles inside the universe horizon. Our model
can lead to new observable effects at cosmological distances and close to the
sources of a strong gravitational field.
