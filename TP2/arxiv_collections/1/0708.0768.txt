We present the first measurements of the electroluminescence response to the
emission of single electrons in a two-phase noble gas detector. Single
ionization electrons generated in liquid xenon are detected in a thin gas layer
during the 31-day background run of the ZEPLIN-II experiment, a two-phase xenon
detector for WIMP dark matter searches. Both the pressure dependence and
magnitude of the single-electron response are in agreement with previous
measurements of electroluminescence yield in xenon. We discuss different
photoionization processes as possible cause for the sample of single electrons
studied in this work. This observation may have implications for the design and
operation of future large-scale two-phase systems.
