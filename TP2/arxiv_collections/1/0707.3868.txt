Using the the convex semidefinite programming method and superoperator
formalism we obtain the finite quantum tomography of some mixed quantum states
such as: qudit tomography, N-qubit tomography, phase tomography and coherent
spin state tomography, where that obtained results are in agreement with those
of References \cite{schack,Pegg,Barnett,Buzek,Weigert}.
