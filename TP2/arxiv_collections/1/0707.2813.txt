We consider a new interacting particle system on the one-dimensional lattice
that interpolates between TASEP and Toom's model: A particle cannot jump to the
right if the neighboring site is occupied, and when jumping to the left it
simply pushes all the neighbors that block its way.
  We prove that for flat and step initial conditions, the large time
fluctuations of the height function of the associated growth model along any
space-like path are described by the Airy_1 and Airy_2 processes. This includes
fluctuations of the height profile for a fixed time and fluctuations of a
tagged particle's trajectory as special cases.
