Conventional simulations of complex systems in the canonical ensemble suffer
from the quasi-ergodicity problem. A simulation in generalized ensemble
overcomes this difficulty by performing a random walk in potential energy space
and other parameter space. From only one simulation run, one can obtain
canonical-ensemble averages of physical quantities as functions of temperature
by the single-histogram and/or multiple-histogram reweighting techniques. In
this article we review the generalized-ensemble algorithms. Three well-known
methods, namely, multicanonical algorithm, simulated tempering, and
replica-exchange method, are described first. Both Monte Carlo and molecular
dynamics versions of the algorithms are given. We then present further
extensions of the above three methods.
