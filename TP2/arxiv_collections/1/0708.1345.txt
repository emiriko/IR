The electronic structure of bilayer graphene is investigated from a resonant
Raman study using different laser excitation energies. The values of the
parameters of the Slonczewski-Weiss-McClure model for graphite are measured
experimentally and some of them differ significantly from those reported
previously for graphite, specially that associated with the difference of the
effective mass of electrons and holes. The splitting of the two TO phonon
branches in bilayer graphene is also obtained from the experimental data. Our
results have implications for bilayer graphene electronic devices.
