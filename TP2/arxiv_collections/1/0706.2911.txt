We study the roles of the tensor and pairing correlations on the halo
formation in 11Li with an extended 9Li+n+n model. We first solve the ground
state of 9Li in the shell model basis by taking 2p-2h states using the Gaussian
functions with variational size parameters to take into account the tensor
correlation fully. In 11Li, the tensor and pairing correlations in 9Li are
Pauli-blocked by additional two neutrons, which work coherently to make the
configurations containing the 0p1/2 state pushed up and close to those
containing the 1s1/2 state. Hence, the pairing interaction works efficiently to
mix the two configurations by equal amount and develop the halo structure in
11Li. For 10Li, the inversion phenomenon of s- and p-states is reproduced in
the same framework. Our model furthermore explains the recently observed
Coulomb breakup strength and charge radius for 11Li.
