A measurement of W->e nu + n-jet cross sections in ppbar collisions at
sqrt(s)=1.96 TeV using the Collider Detector at Fermilab in Run II is
presented. The measurement is based on an integrated luminosity of 320 pb-1,
and includes events with jet multiplicity from >= 1 to >= 4. In each jet
multiplicity sample the differential and cumulative cross sections with respect
to the transverse energy of the n^(th)-leading jet are measured. For W+>=2 jets
the differential cross section with respect to the 2-leading jets invariant
mass m_(j_(1)j_(2)) and angular separation Delta R_(j_(1)j_(2)) is also
reported. The data are compared to predictions from Monte Carlo simulations.
