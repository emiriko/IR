The transport properties of quantum dot (QD) systems based on double-walled
carbon nanotube (DWCNT) are investigated. The interplay between microscopic
structure and strong Coulomb interaction is treated within a bosonization
framework. The linear and nonlinear G-V-V_g characteristics of the QD system is
calculated by starting from the Liouville equation for the reduced density
matrix. Depending on the intershell couplings, an 8-electron periodicity of the
Coulomb blockade peak spacing in the case of commensurate DWCNT QDs and a
4-electron periodicity in the incommensurate case are predicted. The
contribution of excited states of DWCNTs to the nonlinear transport is
investigated as well.
