Investigation of electrical conduction in polysilicon nanowires (polySiNW)
with nanograins (5 to 20nm), based on Monte Carlo (MC) simulations and
electrical measurements from 4K to 300K are presented. Some irregular Coulomb
Oscillations (CO) are observed at temperatures lower than 200K showing several
period widths due to the random distribution in grain size (5-20nm). A
remarkable result consists in more effective oscillations observed at
intermediate range of temperatures (between 25K and 150K) and high drain
voltages. The temperature dependence of COs is explained by the fact that in a
multiple asymmetric dot system at low temperature, COs are observed not at the
lowest but at an intermediate temperature range, whereas the drain voltage
dependence is due to an enhanced non-resonant tunneling. MC simulations have
confirmed experimental observations.
