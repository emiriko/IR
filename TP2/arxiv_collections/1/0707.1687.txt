We present a theory of spin, electronic and transport properties of a
few-electron lateral triangular triple quantum dot molecule in a magnetic
field. Our theory is based on a generalization of a Hubbard model and the
Linear Combination of Harmonic Orbitals combined with Configuration Interaction
method (LCHO-CI) for arbitrary magnetic fields. The few-particle spectra
obtained as a function of the magnetic field exhibit Aharonov-Bohm
oscillations. As a result, by changing the magnetic field it is possible to
engineer the degeneracies of single-particle levels, and thus control the total
spin of the many-electron system. For the triple dot with two and four
electrons we find oscillations of total spin due to the singlet-triplet
transitions occurring periodically in the magnetic field. In the three-electron
system we find a transition from a magnetically frustrated to the
spin-polarized state. We discuss the impact of these phase transitions on the
addition spectrum and the spin blockade of the lateral triple quantum dot
molecule.
