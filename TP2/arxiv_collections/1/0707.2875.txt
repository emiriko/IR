We consider a general Hamiltonian describing coexistence of itinerant
ferromagnetism, spin-orbit coupling and mixed spin-singlet/triplet
superconducting pairing in the context of mean-field theory. The Hamiltonian is
diagonalized and exact eigenvalues are obtained, thus allowing us to write down
the coupled gap equations for the different order parameters. Our results may
then be applied to any model describing coexistence of any combination of these
three phenomena. As a specific application of our results, we consider
tunneling between a normal metal and a noncentrosymmetric superconductor with
mixed singlet and triplet gaps. The conductance spectrum reveals information
about these gaps in addition to how the influence of spin-orbit coupling is
manifested. We also consider the coexistence of itinerant ferromagnetism and
triplet superconductivity as a model for recently discovered ferromagnetic
superconductors. The coupled gap equations are solved self-consistently, and we
study the conditions necessary to obtain the coexistent regime of
ferromagnetism and superconductivity. Analytical expressions are presented for
the order parameters, and we provide an analysis of the free energy to identify
the preferred system state. Moreover, we make specific predictions concerning
the heat capacity for a ferromagnetic superconductor. In particular, we report
a nonuniversal relative jump in the specific heat, depending on the
magnetization of the system, at the uppermost superconducting phase transition.
