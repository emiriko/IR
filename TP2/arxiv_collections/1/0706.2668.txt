A simple model is applied to study a high temperature rather dense plasma
ball. It is assumed that the ions and delocalized electrons are distributed
uniformly throughout the ball, and extra/missing charge is found in a thin
layer on the surface of a ball. It is shown in the framework of this model that
regarded plasma ball can be relatively stable as a metastable state.
Calculations show that electrostatic forces, repulsive forces between the ions,
and atmospheric pressure can provide stability of a plasma ball. Presented
model could be useful to understand the nature of a ball lightning.
