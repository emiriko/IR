In 1888, Hilbert described how to find real polynomials in more than one
variable which take only non-negative values but are not a sum of squares of
polynomials. His construction was so restrictive that no explicit examples
appeared until the late 1960s. We revisit and generalize Hilbert's construction
and present many such polynomials.
