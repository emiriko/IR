We propose a framework for studying predictability of extreme events in
complex systems. Major conceptual elements -- direct cascading or
fragmentation, spatial dynamics, and external driving -- are combined in a
classical age-dependent multi-type branching diffusion process with
immigration. A complete analytic description of the size- and space-dependent
distributions of particles is derived. We then formulate an extreme event
prediction problem and determine characteristic patterns of the system behavior
as an extreme event approaches. In particlular, our results imply specific
premonitory deviations from self-similarity, which have been heuristically
observed in real-world and modeled complex systems. Our results suggest a
simple universal mechanism of such premonitory patterns and natural framework
for their analytic study.
