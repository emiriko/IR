Applying the analytical closed-form solutions of the 'quasi-static' potential
distribution around two conjoined resonant half-cylinders with different
permittivities, reported in the first part of our manuscript, here we interpret
these results in terms of our nanocircuit paradigm applicable to nanoparticles
at infrared and optical frequencies [N. Engheta, A. Salandrino, A. Alu, Phys.
Rev. Lett. 95, 095504 (2005)]. We investigate the possibility of connecting in
series and parallel configurations plasmonic and/or dielectric nanoparticles
acting as nanocircuit elements, with a goal for the design of a more complex
nanocircuit circuit system with the desired response. The present analysis
fully validates the heuristic predictions regarding the parallel and series
combination of a pair of nanocircuit elements. Moreover, the geometries under
analysis present interesting peculiar features in their wave interaction, such
as the intermediate stage between the parallel and series configurations, which
may be of interest for certain applications. In particular, the resonant
nanocircuit configuration analyzed here may dramatically change, in a
continuous way, its effective total impedance by simply rotating its
orientation with respect to the polarization of the impressed optical electric
field, providing a novel optical nanodevice that may alter its function by
rotation with respect to the impressed optical local field.
