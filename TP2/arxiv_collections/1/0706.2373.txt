We create a Josephson parametric amplifier from a transmission line resonator
whose inner conductor is made from a series SQUID array. By changing the
magnetic flux through the SQUID loops, we are able to adjust the circuit's
resonance frequency and, consenquently, the center of the amplified band,
between 4 and 7.8 GHz. We observe that the amplifier has gains as large as 28
dB and infer that it adds less than twice the input vacuum noise.
