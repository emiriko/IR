We adapt Sarason's proof of the Julia-Caratheodory theorem to the class of
Schur-Agler mappings of the unit ball, obtaining a strengthened form of this
theorem. In particular those quantities which appear in the classical theorem
and depend only on the component of the mapping in the complex normal direction
have K-limits (not just restricted K-limits) at the boundary.
