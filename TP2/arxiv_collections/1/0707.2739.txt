We investigate the cycles in the transcription network of S. cerevisiae.
Unlike a similar network of E. coli, it contains many cycles. We characterize
properties of these cycles and their place in the regulatory mechanism of the
cell. Almost all cycles in the transcription network of S. cerevisiae are
contained in a single strongly connected component, which we call LSCC (L for
``largest''), except for a single cycle of two transcription factors. Among
different physiological conditions, cell cycle has the most significant
relationship with LSCC, as the set of 64 transcription interactions that are
active in all phases of the cell cycle has overlap of 27 with the interactions
of LSCC (of which there are 49). Conversely, if we remove the interactions that
are active in all phases of the cell cycle (fewer than 1% of the total), the
LSCC would have only three nodes and 5 edges, 4 of which are active only in the
stress response subnetwork. LSCC has a special place in the topology of the
network and it can be used to define a natural hierarchy in the network; in
every physiological subnetwork LSCC plays a pivotal role. Apart from those
well-defined conditions, the transcription network of S. cerevisiae is devoid
of cycles. It was observed that two conditions that were studied and that have
no cycles of their own are exogenous: diauxic shift and DNA repair, while cell
cycle, sporulation are endogenous.
