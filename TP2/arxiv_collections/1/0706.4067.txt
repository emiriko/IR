It is a well known fact that an quantum state $|\psi(\theta,\phi)>$ is
represented by a point on the Bloch sphere, characterized by two parameters
$\theta$ and $\phi$. In a recent work we already proved that it is impossible
to partially swap these quantum parameters. Here in this work we will show that
this impossibility theorem is consistent with principles like unitarity of
quantum mechanics and no signalling principle.
