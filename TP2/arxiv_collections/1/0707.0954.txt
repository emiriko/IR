Effects of impurity scatterings on the strong coupling (SC) contribution,
stabilizing the ABM (axial) pairing state, to the quartic term of the
Ginzburg-Landau (GL) free energy of superfluid $^3$He are theoretically studied
to examine recent observations suggestive of an anomalously small SC effect in
superfluid $^3$He in aerogels. To study the SC corrections, two approaches are
used. One is based on a perturbation in the short-range repulsive interaction,
and the other is a phenomenological approach used previously for the bulk
liquid by Sauls and Serene [Phys.Rev.B 24, 183 (1981)]. It is found that the
impurity scattering favors the BW pairing state and shrinks the region of the
ABM pairing state in the T-P phase diagram. In the phenomenological approach,
the resulting shrinkage of the ABM region is especially substantial and, if
assuming an anisotropy over a large scale in aerogel, leads to justifying the
phase diagrams determined experimentally.
