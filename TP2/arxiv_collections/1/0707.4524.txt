Neural network has been attracting more and more researchers since the past
decades. The properties, such as parameter sensitivity, random similarity,
learning ability, etc., make it suitable for information protection, such as
data encryption, data authentication, intrusion detection, etc. In this paper,
by investigating neural networks' properties, the low-cost authentication
method based on neural networks is proposed and used to authenticate images or
videos. The authentication method can detect whether the images or videos are
modified maliciously. Firstly, this chapter introduces neural networks'
properties, such as parameter sensitivity, random similarity, diffusion
property, confusion property, one-way property, etc. Secondly, the chapter
gives an introduction to neural network based protection methods. Thirdly, an
image or video authentication scheme based on neural networks is presented, and
its performances, including security, robustness and efficiency, are analyzed.
Finally, conclusions are drawn, and some open issues in this field are
presented.
