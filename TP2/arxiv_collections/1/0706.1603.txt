To understand the mechanism of the fermion pair and fermion-antifermion pair
condensation,the solutions of Bethe-Salpeter equation in QED$_{3}$ is
examined.In the ladder appoximation our solution for the axial-scalar is
consistent with Ward-Takahashi-identity for the axial vector currents.Since the
massless scalar-vector sector is described by a coupled integral equation,it is
difficult to solve explicitly.We approximate the equation for large and small
momentum region separately and convert them into differential equations in
position space.These equation can be solved easily.Boundary condition at the
origin leads the eigenvalue for dimensionless coupling constant
$\lambda=e^{2}/m$.There exists solutions for massless scalar-vector
fermion-antifermion (fa) system with discrete spectrum. In our approximation
massless-scalar-vector ff systemes does not seem to exist.
