Introducing the fermionic R-operator and solutions of the inverse scattering
problem for local fermion operators, we derive a multiple integral
representation for zero-temperature correlation functions of a one-dimensional
interacting spinless fermion model. Correlation functions particularly
considered are the one-particle Green's function and the density-density
correlation function both for any interaction strength and for arbitrary
particle densities. In particular for the free fermion model, our formulae
reproduce the known exact results. Form factors of local fermion operators are
also calculated for a finite system.
