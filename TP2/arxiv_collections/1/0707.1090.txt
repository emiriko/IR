Here we report the magnetic and heat capacity studies of the double
perovskite com-pounds Ba2SmRuO6 and Ba2DyRuO6. Antiferromagnetic transitions
are inferred at 54 K and 47 K in Ba2SmRuO6 and Ba2DyRuO6, respectively in the
magnetization measure-ments. Heat capacity measurements show large jumps at the
corresponding temperatures and confirm the bulk magnetic ordering. Both the
measurements provide clear indication of the ordering of the rare earth moments
also along with the Ruthenium moments. How-ever, the heat capacity results
suggest that the ordering of rare earth magnetic moments is spread over a large
temperature range and is affected by a large crystal field effect on Ru and
rare earth ions. The anomaly observed in the magnetization measurements at 42 K
(below the magnetic ordering) in Ba2SmRuO6 is discerned as a reorientation of
Sm3+ moments
