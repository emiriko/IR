Bunches of streamers form the early stages of sparks and lightning but theory
presently concentrates on single streamers or on coarse approximations of whole
breakdown trees. Here a periodic array of interacting streamer discharges in a
strong homogeneous electric field is studied in PDE approximation in two
dimensions. If the period of the streamer array is small enough, the streamers
do not branch, but approach uniform translation. When the streamers are close
to the branching regime, the enhanced field at the tip of the streamer is close
to $2 E_{\infty}$, where $E_{\infty}$ is the homogeneous field applied between
the electrodes. We discuss a moving boundary approximation to the set of PDEs.
This moving boundary model turns out to be essentially the same as the one for
two-fluid Hele-Shaw flows. In two dimensions, this model possesses a known
analytical solution. The shape of the 2D interacting streamers in uniform
motion obtained from the PDE simulations is actually well fitted by the
analytically known ``selected Saffman-Taylor finger''. This finding helps to
understand streamer interactions and raises new questions on the general theory
of finger selection in moving boundary problems.
