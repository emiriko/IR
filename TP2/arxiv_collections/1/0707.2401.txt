We have studied the effect of resonant electronic state coupling on the
formation of ultracold ground-state $^{85}$Rb$_2$. Ultracold Rb$_2$ molecules
are formed by photoassociation (PA) to a coupled pair of $0_u^+$ states,
$0_u^+(P_{1/2})$ and $0_u^+(P_{3/2})$, in the region below the $5S+5P_{1/2}$
limit. Subsequent radiative decay produces high vibrational levels of the
ground state, $X ^1\Sigma_g^+$. The population distribution of these $X$ state
vibrational levels is monitored by resonance-enhanced two-photon ionization
through the $2 ^1\Sigma_u^+$ state. We find that the populations of vibrational
levels $v''$=112$-$116 are far larger than can be accounted for by the
Franck-Condon factors for $0_u^+(P_{1/2}) \to X ^1\Sigma_g^+$ transitions with
the $0_u^+(P_{1/2})$ state treated as a single channel. Further, the
ground-state molecule population exhibits oscillatory behavior as the PA laser
is tuned through a succession of $0_u^+$ state vibrational levels. Both of
these effects are explained by a new calculation of transition amplitudes that
includes the resonant character of the spin-orbit coupling of the two $0_u^+$
states. The resulting enhancement of more deeply bound ground-state molecule
formation will be useful for future experiments on ultracold molecules.
