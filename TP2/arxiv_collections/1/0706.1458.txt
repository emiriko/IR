This work explores a simple approximation to describe isolated impurity
scattering in a strongly correlated metal. The approximation combines
conventional one electron scattering theory and the Dynamic Mean Field Theory
to describe strong correlations in the host. It becomes exact in several
limits, including those of very weak and very strong impurity potentials.
Original electronic structure appears at the impurity site when the impurity
potential strength is moderate and the host is close to the Mott transition.
Our results may provide useful guidance for interpretation of scanning
tunneling microscopy experiments in strongly correlated systems.
