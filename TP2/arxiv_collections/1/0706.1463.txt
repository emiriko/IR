In NdBa_2[Cu_{1-y}Ni_y]_3O_{7-\delta}, magnetic Ni-impurities suppress Tc but
at the same time the pseudogap is strongly enhanced. This unique feature makes
it an ideal system to study possible relations between the anomalous Nernst
effect, superconductivity and the pseudogap. We present Nernst effect
measurements on a series of optimally doped (O_7) and underdoped (O_{6.8})
samples with Ni contents ranging from y=0 to 0.12. In all samples an onset of
the Nernst signal is found at T^\nu > Tc. For the optimally doped samples T^\nu
and Tc decrease simultaneously with increasing Ni content. The underdoped
samples show a different behavior, i.e. the onset of the Nernst signal is
hardly affected by increasing the Ni content from y=0 to 0.03. Irrespective of
the oxygen content, T^\nu clearly does not track the enhanced pseudogap
temperature T*.
