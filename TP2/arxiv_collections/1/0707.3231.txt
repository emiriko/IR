In the classical s-t network reliability problem a fixed network G is given
including two designated vertices s and t (called terminals). The edges are
subject to independent random failure, and the task is to compute the
probability that s and t are connected in the resulting network, which is known
to be #P-complete. In this paper we are interested in approximating the s-t
reliability in case of a directed acyclic original network G. We introduce and
analyze a specialized version of the Monte-Carlo algorithm given by Karp and
Luby. For the case of uniform edge failure probabilities, we give a worst-case
bound on the number of samples that have to be drawn to obtain an epsilon-delta
approximation, being sharper than the original upper bound. We also derive a
variance reduction of the estimator which reduces the expected number of
iterations to perform to achieve the desired accuracy when applied in
conjunction with different stopping rules. Initial computational results on two
types of random networks (directed acyclic Delaunay graphs and a slightly
modified version of a classical random graph) with up to one million vertices
are presented. These results show the advantage of the introduced Monte-Carlo
approach compared to direct simulation when small reliabilities have to be
estimated and demonstrate its applicability on large-scale instances.
