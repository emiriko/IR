We propose a quantum theory of rotating light beams and study some of its
properties. Such beams are polychromatic and have either a slowly rotating
polarization or a slowly rotating transverse mode pattern. We show there are,
for both cases, three different natural types of modes that qualify as
rotating, one of which is a new type not previously considered. We discuss
differences between these three types of rotating modes on the one hand and
non-rotating modes as viewed from a rotating frame of reference on the other.
We present various examples illustrating the possible use of rotating photons,
mostly for quantum information processing purposes. We introduce in this
context a rotating version of the two-photon singlet state.
