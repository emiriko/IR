We use the covariant and gauge-invariant 1+1+2 formalism of Clarkson and
Barrett \cite{Clarkson2003} to analyze electromagnetic (EM) perturbations on
non-vacuum {\it locally rotationally symmetric} (LRS) class II space-times.
Ultimately, we show how to derive six real decoupled equations governing the
total of six EM scalar and 2-vector harmonic amplitudes. Four of these are new,
and result from expanding the complex EM 2-vector which we defined in
\cite{Burston2007} in terms of EM 2-vector harmonic amplitudes. We are then
able to show that there are four precise combinations of the amplitudes that
decouple, two of these are polar perturbations whereas the remaining two are
axial. The remaining two decoupled equations are the generalized Regge-Wheeler
equations which were developed previously in \cite{Betschart2004}, and these
govern the two EM scalar harmonic amplitudes. However, our analysis generalizes
this by including a full description and classification of energy-momentum
sources, such as charges and currents.
