A finite temperature version of body-centered solid-on-solid growth models
involving attachment and detachment of dimers is discussed in 1+1 dimensions.
The dynamic exponent of the growing interface is studied numerically via the
spectrum gap of the underlying evolution operator. The finite size scaling of
the latter is found to be affected by a standard surface tension term on which
the growth rates depend. This non-universal aspect is also corroborated by the
growth behavior observed in large scale simulations. By contrast, the
roughening exponent remains robust over wide temperature ranges.
