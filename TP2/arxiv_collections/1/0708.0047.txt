In this series of three lectures, we discuss several aspects of high energy
scattering among hadrons in Quantum Chromodynamics. The first lecture is
devoted to a description of the parton model, Bjorken scaling and the scaling
violations due to the evolution of parton distributions with the transverse
resolution scale. The second lecture describes parton evolution at small
momentum fraction x, the phenomenon of gluon saturation and the Color Glass
Condensate (CGC). In the third lecture, we present the application of the CGC
to the study of high energy hadronic collisions, with emphasis on
nucleus-nucleus collisions. In particular, we provide the outline of a proof of
high energy factorization for inclusive gluon production.
