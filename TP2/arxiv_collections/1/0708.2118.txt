We apply the methodology of optimal control theory to the problem of
implementing quantum gates in continuous variable systems with quadratic
Hamiltonians. We demonstrate that it is possible to define a fidelity measure
for continuous variable (CV) gate optimization that is devoid of traps, such
that the search for optimal control fields using local algorithms will not be
hindered. The optimal control of several quantum computing gates, as well as
that of algorithms composed of these primitives, is investigated using several
typical physical models and compared for discrete and continuous quantum
systems. Numerical simulations indicate that the optimization of generic CV
quantum gates is inherently more expensive than that of generic discrete
variable quantum gates, and that the exact-time controllability of CV systems
plays an important role in determining the maximum achievable gate fidelity.
The resulting optimal control fields typically display more complicated Fourier
spectra that suggest a richer variety of possible control mechanisms. Moreover,
the ability to control interactions between qunits is important for delimiting
the total control fluence. The comparative ability of current experimental
protocols to implement such time-dependent controls may help determine which
physical incarnations of CV quantum information processing will be the easiest
to implement with optimal fidelity.
