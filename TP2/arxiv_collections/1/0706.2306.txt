Attaching a superconductor in good contact with a normal metal makes rise to
a proximity effect where the superconducting correlations leak into the normal
metal. An additional contact close to the first one makes it possible to carry
a supercurrent through the metal. Forcing this supercurrent flow along with an
additional quasiparticle current from one or many normal-metal reservoirs makes
rise to many interesting effects. The supercurrent can be used to tune the
local energy distribution function of the electrons. This mechanism also leads
to finite thermoelectric effects even in the presence of electron-hole
symmetry. Here we review these effects and discuss to which extent the existing
observations of thermoelectric effects in metallic samples can be explained
through the use of the dirty-limit quasiclassical theory.
