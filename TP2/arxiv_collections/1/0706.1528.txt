We define a new class of quantum vertex algebras, based on the Hopf algebra
$H_D=\mathbb{C}[D]$ of "infinitesimal translations" generated by $D$. Besides
the braiding map describing the obstruction to commutativity of products of
vertex operators, $H_D$-quantum vertex algebras have as main new ingredient a
"translation map" that describes the obstruction of vertex operators to
satisfying translation covariance. The translation map also appears as
obstruction to the state-field correspondence being a homomorphism. We use a
bicharacter construction of Borcherds to construct a large class of
$H_D$-quantum vertex algebras. One particular example of this construction
yields a quantum vertex algebra that contains the quantum vertex operators
introduced by Jing in the theory of Hall-Littlewood polynomials.
