We consider an integrable system in five unknowns having three quartics
invariants. We show that the complex affine variety defined by putting these
invariants equal to generic constants, completes into an abelian surface; the
jacobian of a genus two hyperelliptic curve. This system is algebraic
completely integrable and it can be integrated in genus two hyperelliptic
functions.
