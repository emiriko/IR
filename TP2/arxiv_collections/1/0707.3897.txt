We analyze the ground state properties of an array of quantum dots connected
in series between superconducting electrodes. This system is represented by a
finite Hubbard chain coupled at both ends to BCS superconductors. The ground
state is obtained using the Lanczos algorithm within a low energy theory in
which the bulk superconductors are replaced by effective local pairing
potentials. We study the conditions for the inversion of the sign of the
Josephson coupling ($\pi$-junction behavior) as a function of the model
parameters. Results are presented in the form of phase diagrams which provide a
direct overall view of the general trends as the size of the system is
increased, exhibiting a strong even-odd effect. The analysis of the spin-spin
correlation functions and local charges give further insight into the nature of
the ground state and how it is transformed by the presence of superconductivity
in the leads. Finally we study the scaling of the Josephson current with the
system size and relate these results with previous calculations of Josephson
transport through a Luttinger liquid.
