We propose a novel mechanism for photogeneration of multiexcitons by single
photons (carrier multiplication) in semiconductor nanocrystals. In this
mechanism, the Coulomb interaction between two valence-band electrons involving
their transfer to the conduction band creates a virtual biexciton from vacuum
that is then converted into a real biexciton by photon absorption on an
intraband optical transition. This mechanism is inactive in bulk semiconductors
as momentum conservation suppresses intraband absorption. However, it becomes
highly efficient in zero-dimensional nanocrystals and can provide a significant
contribution to carrier multiplication in these materials.
