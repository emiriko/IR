The dissertation consists of two parts. The first presents an account of the
effective worldvolume description of $N$ coincident M2-branes ending on an
M5-brane in M-theory. It reviews Basu and Harvey's recent description of the
worldvolume theory of the M2-branes in terms of a Bogomol'nyi equation, and its
solution via a fuzzy (three-) funnel. Tests of the consistency of this picture
are then performed and many of the issues with it are addressed. This is
followed by a discussion of how a refinement of the fuzzy three-sphere algebra
used can lead to the correct $N^{3/2}$ scaling of degrees of freedom for this
system. A reduction of this Basu-Harvey picture to the D1-string picture of the
D1-D3 intersection is then performed via constructing a reduction of the
fuzzy-three sphere to the fuzzy two-sphere.
  The second part of the dissertation describes how a holomorphic factorisation
argument can be used to demonstrate quantum equivalence of the doubled
formalism of string theory with the standard formalism by deriving the
partition function, including instanton and oscillator sectors.
