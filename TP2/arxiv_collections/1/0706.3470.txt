We examine the attosecond electron recollision dissociation of D2+ recently
demonstrated experimentally [H. Niikura et al., Nature (London) 421, 826
(2003)] from a coherent control perspective. In this process, a strong laser
field incident on D2 ionizes an electron, accelerates the electron in the laser
field to eV energies, and then drives the electron to recollide with the parent
ion, causing D2+ dissociation. A number of results are demonstrated. First, a
full dimensional Strong Field Approximation (SFA) model is constructed and
shown to be in agreement with the original experiment. This is then used to
rigorously demonstrate that the experiment is an example of coherent pump-dump
control. Second, extensions to bichromatic coherent control are proposed by
considering dissociative recollision of molecules prepared in a coherent
superposition of vibrational states. Third, by comparing the results to similar
scenarios involving field-free attosecond scattering of independently prepared
D2+ and electron wave packets, recollision dissociation is shown to provide an
example of wave-packet coherent control of reactive scattering. Fourth, this
analysis makes clear that it is the temporal correlations between the continuum
electron and D2+ wave packet, and not entanglement, that are crucial for the
sub-femtosecond probing resolution demonstrated in the experiment. This result
clarifies some misconceptions regarding the importance of entanglement in the
recollision probing of D2+. Finally, signatures of entanglement between the
recollision electron and the atomic fragments, detectable via coincidence
measurements, are identified.
