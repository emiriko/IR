Mass measurements on radionuclides along the potassium isotope chain have
been performed with the ISOLTRAP Penning trap mass spectrometer. For 35K
T1/2=178ms) to 46K (T1/2=105s) relative mass uncertainties of 2x10-8 and better
have been achieved. The accurate mass determination of 35K (dm=0.54keV) has
been exploited to test the Isobaric Multiplet Mass Equation (IMME) for the
A=35, T=3/2 isospinquartet. The experimental results indicate a deviation from
the generally adopted quadratic form.
