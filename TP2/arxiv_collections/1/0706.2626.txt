We propose a unifying phase-space approach to the construction of mutually
unbiased bases for a two-qubit system. It is based on an explicit
classification of the geometrical structures compatible with the notion of
unbiasedness. These consist of bundles of discrete curves intersecting only at
the origin and satisfying certain additional properties. We also consider the
feasible transformations between different kinds of curves and show that they
correspond to local rotations around the Bloch-sphere principal axes. We
suggest how to generalize the method to systems in dimensions that are powers
of a prime.
