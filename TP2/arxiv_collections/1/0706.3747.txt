The properties of the known superconductors can be explained with the
correlations dominated superconducting mechanism (CSM). The correlations have
the spin correlation, the charge correlation and the spin-charge correlation,
and their strengths can be described by the related correlation lengths in
their correlation functions. Our evaluation from many superconductors is that
superconductivities occur if both the spin correlation and the charge
correlation are stronger, and the calculation of a Hubbard model showed that
the spin-charge correlation may govern superconductivities1. Afterwards, this
mechanism has led a model which includes various superconductivities and
magnetisms, and the relation between superconductivities and magnetisms can be
understood on this model2 (these results have been shown by calculations). This
mechanism is very practical, for example, to turn a material into a
superconductor or increase the Tc of a superconductor, what we will do is to
increase the spin-charge correlation. In this letter, we first describe the
relations between the spin-charge correlation, the spin correlation and the
charge correlation, take these relations as the basis of constructing a new
phase diagram, and then classify the known superconductors into various
sections in this phase diagram. This letter also gives a new explanation about
the pressure effect on Tc, the isotope effect on Tc and the pairing symmetry
with the CSM.
