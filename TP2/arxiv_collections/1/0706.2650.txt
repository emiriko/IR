Fil {\it et al.} has proposed an interesting experimental method to
investigate vortex dynamics. Some preliminary results have been obtained. In
this comment I discuss a few missing but strongly related theoretical models
and experiments on Hall anomaly and Magnus force. I conclude that those missing
literature can enhance the value of novel experimental method proposed in the
commented 2006 Europhysics Letters by Fil {\it et al.}.
