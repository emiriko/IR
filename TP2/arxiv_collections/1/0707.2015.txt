We describe the realization of a dc electric-field trap for ultracold polar
molecules, the thin-wire electrostatic trap (TWIST). The thin wires that form
the electrodes of the TWIST allow us to superimpose the trap onto a
magneto-optical trap (MOT). In our experiment, ultracold polar NaCs molecules
in their electronic ground state are created in the MOT via photoassociation,
achieving a continuous accumulation in the TWIST of molecules in low-field
seeking states. Initial measurements show that the TWIST trap lifetime is
limited only by the background pressure in the chamber.
