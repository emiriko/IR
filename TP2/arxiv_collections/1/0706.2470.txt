We consider the effects of doping the S=3/2 kagome lattice with static,
nonmagnetic impurities. By exact diagonalization calculations on small clusters
we deduce the local spin correlations and magnetization distribution around a
vacancy. As in the S=1/2 kagome lattice, in the vicinity of the impurity we
find an extended region where the spin correlations are altered as a
consequence of frustation relief, and no indications for the formation of local
moments. We discuss the implications of our results for local probe
measurements on S=3/2 kagome materials.
