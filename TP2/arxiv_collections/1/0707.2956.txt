We show that nuclear spin subsystems can be completely controlled via
microwave irradiation of resolved anisotropic hyperfine interactions with a
nearby electron spin. Such indirect addressing of the nuclear spins via
coupling to an electron allows us to create nuclear spin gates whose
operational time is significantly faster than conventional direct addressing
methods. We experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of this method on a
solid-state ensemble system consisting of one electron and one nuclear spin.
