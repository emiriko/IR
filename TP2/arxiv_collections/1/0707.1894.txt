We describe an algorithm that computes the ground state energy and
correlation functions for 2-local Hamiltonians in which interactions between
qubits are weak compared to single-qubit terms. The running time of the
algorithm is polynomial in the number of qubits and the required precision.
Specifically, we consider Hamiltonians of the form $H=H_0+\epsilon V$, where
H_0 describes non-interacting qubits, V is a perturbation that involves
arbitrary two-qubit interactions on a graph of bounded degree, and $\epsilon$
is a small parameter. The algorithm works if $|\epsilon|$ is below a certain
threshold value that depends only upon the spectral gap of H_0, the maximal
degree of the graph, and the maximal norm of the two-qubit interactions. The
main technical ingredient of the algorithm is a generalized Kirkwood-Thomas
ansatz for the ground state. The parameters of the ansatz are computed using
perturbative expansions in powers of $\epsilon$. Our algorithm is closely
related to the coupled cluster method used in quantum chemistry.
