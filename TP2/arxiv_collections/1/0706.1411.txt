In an earlier work [1] J. Suzuki proposed a set of nonlinear integral
equations (NLIE) to describe the excited state spectrum of the integrable
spin-1 XXZ chain in its repulsive regime. In this paper we extend his equations
for the attractive regime of the model, and calculate analytically the
conformal spectrum of the spin chain. We also discuss the typical root
configurations of the thermodynamic limit as well as the 2-string deviations of
certain excited states of the model. Special objects appearing in the NLIE are
also treated with special care.
