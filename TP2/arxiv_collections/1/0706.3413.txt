We found, using density-functional theory calculations within the generalized
gradient approximation, that Cs$_2$AgF$_4$ is stabilized in the insulating
orthorhombic phase rather than in the metallic tetragonal phase. The lattice
distortion present in the orthorhombic phase corresponds to the
$x^2-z^2$/$y^2-z^2$ hole-orbital ordering of the Ag$^{2+}$ $4d^9$ ions, and
this orbital ordering leads to the observed ferromagnetism, as confirmed by the
present total-energy calculations. This picture holds in the presence of
moderate 4d-electron correlation. The results are compared with the picture of
ferromagnetism based on the metallic tetragonal phase.
