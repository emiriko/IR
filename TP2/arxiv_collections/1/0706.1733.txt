We report the rectifying effect of a constant-wave radio frequency (RF)
current by a magnetic domain wall (DW) on a single-layered ferromagnetic wire.
A direct-current (DC) voltage is generated by the spin torque diode effect,
which is a consequence of magnetoresistance oscillation due to the resonant
spin wave excitation induced by the spin-polarized RF current. The DC voltage
spectrum strongly depends on the internal spin structure in the DW, which
corresponds to the magnetic fingerprint of the spin structure in the
ferromagnetic wire.
