A lattice Boltzmann model is considered in which the speed of sound can be
varied independently of the other parameters. The range over which the speed of
sound can be varied is investigated and good agreement is found between
simulations and theory. The onset of nonlinear effects due to variations in the
speed of sound is also investigated and good agreement is again found with
theory. It is also shown that the fluid viscosity is not altered by changing
the speed of sound.
