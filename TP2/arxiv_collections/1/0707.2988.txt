Kinetic equations governing time evolution of positions and momenta of atoms
in extended systems are derived using quantum-classical ensembles within the
Non-Equilibrium Statistical Operator Method (NESOM). Ions are treated
classically, while their electrons quantum mechanically; however, the
statistical operator is not factorised in any way and no simplifying
assumptions are made concerning the electronic subsystem. Using this method, we
derive kinetic equations of motion for the classical degrees of freedom (atoms)
which account fully for the interaction and energy exchange with the quantum
variables (electrons). Our equations, alongside the usual Newtonian-like terms
normally associated with the Ehrenfest dynamics, contain additional terms,
proportional to the atoms velocities, which can be associated with the
electronic friction. Possible ways of calculating the friction forces which are
shown to be given via complicated non-equilibrium correlation functions, are
discussed. In particular, we demonstrate that the correlation functions are
directly related to the thermodynamic Matsubara Green's functions, and this
relationship allows for the diagrammatic methods to be used in treating
electron-electron interaction perturbatively when calculating the correlation
functions. This work also generalises previous attempts, mostly based on model
systems, of introducing the electronic friction into Molecular Dynamics
equations of atoms.
