A classical result about minimal geodesics on R^2 with Z^2 periodic metric
that goes back to H.M. Morse asserts that a minimal geodesic that is asymptotic
to a periodic minimal geodesic cannot intersect any periodic minimal geodesic
of the same period. This paper treats a similar theorem for nonparametric
minimizing hypersurfaces without selfintersections -- as were studied by J.
