A movable inclusion in an elastic material oscillates as a rigid body with
six degrees of freedom. Displacement/rotation and force/moment tensors which
express the motion of the inclusion in terms of the displacement and force at
arbitrary exterior points are introduced. Using reciprocity arguments two
general identities are derived relating these tensors. Applications of the
identities to spherical particles provide several new results, including simple
expressions for the force and moment on the particle due to plane wave
excitation.
