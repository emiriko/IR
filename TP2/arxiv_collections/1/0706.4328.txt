The exclusive reaction of rho meson pair electroproduction in gamma*gamma*
collisions is a nice place to study various dynamics and factorization
properties in the perturbative sector of QCD. At low energy (quarks dominance),
this process can be considered as a way to explore QCD factorizations involving
generalized distribution amplitudes (GDA) and transition distribution
amplitudes (TDA), and, in the Regge limit of QCD (gluons dominance), it seems
to offer a promising probe of the BFKL resummation effects which could be
studied at the next international linear collider (ILC).
