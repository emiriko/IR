In this paper we introduce the notion of a geometric associative r-matrix
attached to a genus one fibration with a section and irreducible fibres. It
allows us to study degenerations of solutions of the classical Yang-Baxter
equation using the approach of Polishchuk. We also calculate certain solutions
of the classical, quantum and associative Yang-Baxter equations obtained from
moduli spaces of (semi-)stable vector bundles on Weierstrass cubic curves.
