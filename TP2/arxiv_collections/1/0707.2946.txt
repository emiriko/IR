We report high-bandwidth charge sensing measurements using a GaAs quantum
point contact embedded in a radio frequency impedance matching circuit
(rf-QPC). With the rf-QPC biased near pinch-off where it is most sensitive to
charge, we demonstrate a conductance sensitivity of 5x10^(-6) e^(2)/h Hz^(-1/2)
with a bandwidth of 8 MHz. Single-shot readout of a proximal few-electron
double quantum dot is investigated in a mode where the rf-QPC back-action is
rapidly switched.
