In this article we address the physical basis of the deviation of hadron
shapes from spherical symmetry (non-spherical amplitudes) with focus on the
nucleon and $\Delta$. An overview of both the experimental methods and results
and the current theoretical understanding of the issue is presented. At the
present time the most quantitative method is the $\gamma^{*} p \to \Delta$
reaction for which significant non-spherical electric (E2) and Coulomb
quadrupole (C2) amplitudes have been observed with good precision as a function
of Q^{2} from the photon point through 6 GeV^{2}. Quark model calculations for
these quadrupole amplitudes are at least an order of magnitude too small and
even have the wrong sign. Lattice QCD, chiral effective field theory, and
dynamic model calculations which include the effects of the pion-cloud are in
approximate agreement with experiment. This is expected due to the spontaneous
breaking of chiral symmetry in QCD and the resulting, long range (low Q^{2})
effects of the pion-cloud. Other observables such as nucleon form factors and
virtual Compton scattering experiments indicate that the pion-cloud is playing
a significant role in nucleon structure. Semi-inclusive deep inelastic
scattering experiments with transverse polarized beam and target also show the
effect of non-zero quark angular momentum.
