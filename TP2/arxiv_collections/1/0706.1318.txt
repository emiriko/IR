We present an algorithm for constructing an optimal slate of sponsored search
advertisements which respects the ordering that is the outcome of a generalized
second price auction, but which must also accommodate complicating factors such
as overall budget constraints. The algorithm is easily fast enough to use on
the fly for typical problem sizes, or as a subroutine in an overall
optimization.
