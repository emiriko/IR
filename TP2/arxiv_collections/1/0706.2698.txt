The evolution of the PDR strength with the neutron excess is investigated in
Sn isotopic and N=82 isotonic chains with regard to its possible connection
with the neutron skin thickness. For this purpose a recently proposed method
incorporating both HFB and multi-phonon QPM theory is applied. Analysis of the
corresponding neutron and proton dipole transition densities is presented.
