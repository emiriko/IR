We consider electron waveguides (quantum wires) in graphene created by
suitable inhomogeneous magnetic fields. The properties of uni-directional snake
states are discussed. For a certain magnetic field profile, two spatially
separated counter-propagating snake states are formed, leading to conductance
quantization insensitive to backscattering by impurities or irregularities of
the magnetic field.
