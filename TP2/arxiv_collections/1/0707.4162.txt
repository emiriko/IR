Working with a large basis of covariant derivative-based meson interpolating
fields we demonstrate the feasibility of reliably extracting multiple excited
states using a variational method. The study is performed on quenched
anisotropic lattices with clover quarks at the charm mass. We demonstrate how a
knowledge of the continuum limit of a lattice interpolating field can give
additional spin-assignment information, even at a single lattice spacing, via
the overlap factors of interpolating field and state. Excited state masses are
systematically high with respect to quark potential model predictions and,
where they exist, experimental states. We conclude that this is most likely a
result of the quenched approximation.
