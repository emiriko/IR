We probe the temperature dependence of friction at the interface between a
glassy poly(methylmethacrylate) lens and a flat substrate coated with a
methyl-terminated self-assembled monolayer. The monolayer exhibits density
defects which act as pinning sites for the polymer chains. We show that the
shear response of such an interface supports the existence, at the surface of
the glassy polymer, of a nanometer-thick layer of mobile chains. Friction can
be ascribed to the interplay between viscouslike dissipation in this layer and
depinning of chains adsorbed on the substrate. We further show that the pinning
dynamics is controlled by \beta rotational motions localized at the interface.
