We examine stochastic processes that are used to model nonequilibrium
processes (e.g, pulling RNA or dragging colloids) and so deliberately violate
detailed balance. We argue that by combining an information-theoretic measure
of irreversibility with nonequilibrium work theorems, the thermal physics
implied by abstract dynamics can be determined. This measure is bounded above
by thermodynamic entropy production and so may quantify how well a stochastic
dynamics models reality. We also use our findings to critique various modeling
approaches and notions arising in steady-state thermodynamics.
