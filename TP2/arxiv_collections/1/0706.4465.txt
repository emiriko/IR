In this paper we study a methodical problem related to the magnetic scenario
recently suggested and initiated by the authors \cite{Liao_ES_mono} to
understand the strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma (sQGP): the electric flux
tube in monopole plasma. A macroscopic approach, interpolating between Bose
condensed (dual superconductor) and classical gas medium is developed first.
Then we work out a microscopic approach based on detailed quantum mechanical
calculation of the monopole scattering on electric flux tube, evaluating
induced currents for all partial waves. As expected, the flux tube looses its
stability when particles can penetrate it: we make this condition precise by
calculating the critical value for the product of the flux tube size times the
particle momentum, above which the flux tube dissolves. Lattice static
potentials indicate that flux tubes seem to dissolve at $T>T_{dissolution}
\approx 1.3 T_c$. Using our criterion one gets an estimate of the magnetic
density $n\approx 4.4 \sim 6.6 fm^{-3}$ at this temperature.
