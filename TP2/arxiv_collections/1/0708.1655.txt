In the first part of this paper (mainly a review) we present general and
formal (simple) introductions to the ordinary gaussian waves and to the Bessel
waves, by explicitly separating the cases of the beams from the cases of the
pulses; and, finally, an analogous introduction is presented for the Localized
Waves (LW), pulses or beams. Always we stress the very different
characteristics of the gaussian with respect to the Bessel waves and to the
LWs, showing the numerous and important properties of the latter w.r.t. the
former ones: Properties that may find application in all fields in which an
essential role is played by a wave-equation (like electromagnetism, optics,
acoustics, seismology, geophysics, gravitation, elementary particle physics,
etc.). In the second part of this paper (namely, in its Appendix), we recall at
first how, in the seventies and eighties, the geometrical methods of Special
Relativity (SR) had predicted --in the sense below specified-- the existence of
the most interesting LWs, i.e., of the X-shaped pulses. At last, in connection
with the circumstance that the X-shaped waves are endowed with Superluminal
group-velocities (as carefully discussed in the first part of this article), we
briefly mention the various experimental sectors of physics in which
Superluminal motions seem to appear: In particular, a bird's-eye view is
presented of the experiments till now performed with evanescent waves (and/or
tunneling photons), and with the "localized Superluminal solutions" to the wave
equations.
