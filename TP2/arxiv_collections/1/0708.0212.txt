Strong repulsive interactions in a one-dimensional electron system suppress
the exchange coupling J of electron spins to a value much smaller than the
Fermi energy E_F. The conventional theoretical description of such systems
based on the bosonization approach and the concept of Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid
is applicable only at energies below J. In this paper we develop a theoretical
approach valid at all energies below the Fermi energy, including a broad range
of energies between J and E_F. The method involves bosonization of the charge
degrees of freedom, while the spin excitations are treated exactly. We use this
technique to calculate the spectral functions of strongly interacting electron
systems at energies in the range J<<epsilon<< E_F$. We show that in addition to
the expected features at the wavevector k near the Fermi point k_F, the
spectral function has a strong peak centered at k=0. Our theory also provides
analytical description of the spectral function singularities near 3k_F (the
"shadow band" features).
