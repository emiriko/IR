This paper introduces an iterative tomogravity algorithm for the estimation
of a network traffic matrix based on one snapshot observation of the link loads
in the network. The proposed method does not require complete observation of
the total load on individual edge links or proper tuning of a penalty parameter
as existing methods do. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate that the
iterative tomogravity method controls the estimation error well when the link
data is fully observed and produces robust results with moderate amount of
missing link data.
