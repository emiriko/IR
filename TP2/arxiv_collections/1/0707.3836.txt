The charge and spin sectors, which are intimately coupled to the fermionic
one, of the $t$-$t'$ Hubbard model have been computed self-consistently within
the two-pole approximation. The relevant unknown correlators appearing in the
causal bosonic propagators have been computed by enforcing the constraints
dictated by the hydrodynamics and the algebra of the composite operators coming
into play. The proposed scheme of approximation extends previous calculations
made for the fermionic sector of the $t$-$t'$ Hubbard model and the bosonic
sector of the Hubbard model, which showed to be very effective to describe the
overdoped region of cuprates (the former) and the magnetic response of their
parent compounds (the latter).
