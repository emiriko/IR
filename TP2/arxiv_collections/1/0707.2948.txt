We analyze charging effects in graphene quantum dots. Using a simple model,
we show that, when the Fermi level is far from the neutrality point, charging
effects lead to a shift in the electrostatic potential and the dot shows
standard Coulomb blockade features. Near the neutrality point, surface states
are partially occupied and the Coulomb interaction leads to a strongly
correlated ground state which can be approximated by either a Wigner crystal or
a Laughlin like wave function. The existence of strong correlations modify the
transport properties which show non equilibrium effects, similar to those
predicted for tunneling into other strongly correlated systems.
