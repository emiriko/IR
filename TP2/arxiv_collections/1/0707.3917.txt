We demonstrate a general weak measurement model which allows Gaussian
preserving entanglement concentration of the two mode squeezed vacuum. The
power of this simple and elegant protocol is through the constraints it places
on possible ancilla states and measurement strategies that will allow
entanglement concentration. In particular, it is shown how previously
discovered protocols of this kind emerge as special examples of the general
model described here. Finally, as evidence of its utility, we use it to provide
another novel example of such a protocol.
