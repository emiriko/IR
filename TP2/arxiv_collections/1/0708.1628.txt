The length of minimal and maximal blocks equally distant on log-log scale
versus fluctuation function considerably influences bias and variance of DFA.
Through a number of extensive Monte Carlo simulations and different fractional
Brownian motion/fractional Gaussian noise generators, we found the pair of
minimal and maximal blocks that minimizes the sum of mean-squared error of
estimated Hurst exponents for the series of length N=2^p, p=7,...,15.
Sensitivity of DFA to sort-range correlations was examined using ARFIMA(p,d,q)
generator. Due to the bias of the estimator for anti-persistent processes, we
narrowed down the range of Hurst exponent to 1/2<=H< 1.
