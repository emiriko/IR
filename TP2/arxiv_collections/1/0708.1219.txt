The off-resonant hyperpolarizability is calculated using the dipole-free
sum-over-stats expression from a randomly chosen set of energies and transition
dipole moments that are forced to be consistent with the sum rules. The process
is repeated so that the distribution of hyperpolarizabilities can be
determined. We find this distribution to be a cycloid-like function. In
contrast to variational techniques that when applied to the potential energy
function yield an intrinsic hyperpolarizability less than 0.71, our Monte Carlo
method yields values that approach unity. While many transition dipole moments
are large when the calculated hyperpolarizability is near the fundamental
limit, only two excited states dominate the hyperpolarizability - consistent
with the three-level ansatz.
