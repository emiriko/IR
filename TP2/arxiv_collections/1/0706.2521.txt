The collapse of cavities under shock is a key problem in various fields
ranging from erosion of material, ignition of explosive, to sonoluminescence,
etc. We study such processes using the material-point-method developed recently
in the field of solid physics. The main points of the research include the
relations between symmetry of collapsing and the strength of shock, other
coexisting interfaces, as well as hydrodynamic and thermal-dynamic behaviors
ignored by the pure fluid models. In the case with strong shock, we study the
procedure of jet creation in the cavity; in the case with weak shock, we found
that the cavity can not be collapsed completely by the shock and the cavity may
collapse in a nearly isotropic way. The history of collapsing significantly
influences the distribution of "hot spots" in the shocked material. The change
in symmetry of collapsing is investigated. Since we use the Mie-Gr% \"{u}neisen
equation of state and the effects of strain rate are not taken into account,
the behavior is the same if one magnifies the spatial and temporal scales in
the same way.
