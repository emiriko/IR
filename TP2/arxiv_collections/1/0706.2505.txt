We present a simple but efficient geometrical method for determining the
inert states of spin-S systems. It can be used if the system is described by a
spin vector of a spin-S particle and its energy is invariant in spin rotations
and phase changes. Our method is applicable to an arbitrary S and it is based
on the representation of a pure spin state of a spin-S particle in terms of 2S
points on the surface of a sphere. We use this method to find candidates for
some of the ground states of spinor Bose-Einstein condensates.
