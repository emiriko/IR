Results from several studies indicate that cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is
involved in ischemic brain injury. The purpose of this study was to evaluate
the neuroprotective effects of the selective COX-2 inhibitor nimesulide on
cerebral infarction and neurological deficits in a standardized model of
transient focal cerebral ischemia in rats. Three doses of nimesulide (3, 6 and
12 mg/kg; i.p.) or vehicle were administered immediately after stroke and
additional doses were given at 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 h after ischemia. In other
set of experiments, the effect of nimesulide was studied in a situation in
which its first administration was delayed for 3-24 h after ischemia. Total,
cortical and subcortical infarct volumes and functional outcome (assessed by
neurological deficit score and rotarod performance) were determined 3 days
after ischemia. The effect of nimesulide on prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) levels
in the injured brain was also investigated. Nimesulide dose-dependently reduced
infarct volume and improved functional recovery when compared to vehicle. Of
interest is the finding that neuroprotection conferred by nimesulide (reduction
of infarct size and neurological deficits and improvement of rotarod
performance) was also observed when treatment was delayed until 24 h after
ischemia. Further, administration of nimesulide in a delayed treatment paradigm
completely abolished PGE(2) accumulation in the postischemic brain, suggesting
that COX-2 inhibition is a promising therapeutic strategy for cerebral ischemia
to target the late-occurring inflammatory events which amplify initial damage.
