We consider actions of non-compact simple Lie groups preserving an analytic
rigid geometric structure of algebraic type on a compact manifold. The
structure is not assumed to be unimodular, so an invariant measure may not
exist. Ergodic stationary measures always exist, and when such a measure has
full support, we show the following.
  1) Either the manifold admits a smooth equivariant map onto a homogeneous
projective variety, defined on an open dense conull invariant set, or the Lie
algebra of the Zariski closure of the Gromov representation of the fundamental
group contains a Lie subalgebra isomorphic to the Lie algebra of the acting
group. As a corollary, a smooth non-trivial homogeneous projective factor does
exist whenever the fundamental group of $M$ admits only virtually solvable
linear representations, and thus in particular when $M$ is simply connected,
regardless of the real rank.
  2) There exist explicit examples showing that analytic rigid actions of
certain simple groups (of real rank one) may indeed fail to have a smooth
projective factor.
  3) It is possible to generalize Gromov's theorem on the algebraic hull of the
representation of the fundamental group of the manifold to the case of analytic
rigid non-unimodular structures, for actions of simple groups of any real rank.
  An important ingredient in the proofs is a generalization of Gromov's
centralizer theorem beyond the case of invariant measures.
