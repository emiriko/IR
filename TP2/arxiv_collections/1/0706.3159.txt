This report specifies an observational semantics and gives an original
presentation of the Byrd's box model. The approach accounts for the semantics
of Prolog tracers independently of a particular implementation. Traces are, in
general, considered as rather obscure and difficult to use. The proposed formal
presentation of a trace constitutes a simple and pedagogical approach for
teaching Prolog or for implementing Prolog tracers. It constitutes a form of
declarative specification for the tracers. Our approach highlights qualities of
the box model which made its success, but also its drawbacks and limits. As a
matter of fact, the presented semantics is only one example to illustrate
general problems relating to tracers and observing processes. Observing
processes know, from observed processes, only their traces. The issue is then
to be able to reconstitute by the sole analysis of the trace the main part of
the observed process, and if possible, without any loss of information.
