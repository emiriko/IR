The search for elementary excitations with fractional quantum numbers is a
central challenge in modern condensed matter physics. We explore the
possibility in a realistic model for several materials, the spin-1/2 spatially
anisotropic frustrated Heisenberg antiferromagnet in two dimensions. By
restricting the Hilbert space to that expressed by exact eigenstates of the
Heisenberg chain, we derive an effective Schr\"odinger equation valid in the
weak interchain-coupling regime. The dynamical spin correlations from this
approach agree quantitatively with inelastic neutron measurements on the
triangular antiferromagnet Cs_2CuCl_4. The spectral features in such
antiferromagnets can be attributed to two types of excitations: descendents of
one-dimensional spinons of individual chains, and coherently propagating
"triplon" bound states of spinon pairs. We argue that triplons are generic
features of spatially anisotropic frustrated antiferromagnets, and arise
because the bound spinon pair lowers its kinetic energy by propagating between
chains.
