We discuss the results of a search for anomaly free Abelian Z_N discrete
symmetries that lead to automatic R-parity conservation and prevents dangerous
higher-dimensional proton decay operators in simple extensions of the minimal
supersymmetric extension of the standard model (MSSM) based on the left-right
symmetric group, the Pati-Salam group and SO(10). We require that the
superpotential for the models have enough structures to be able to give correct
symmetry breaking to MSSM and potentially realistic fermion masses. We find
viable models in each of the extensions and for all the cases, anomaly freedom
of the discrete symmetry restricts the number of generations.
