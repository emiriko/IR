There are two infinitesimal (i.e., additive) versions of the $K$-theory of a
field $F$: one was introduced by Cathelineau, which is an $F$-module, and
another one introduced by Bloch-Esnault, which is an $F^*$-module. Both
versions are equipped with a regulator map, when $F$ is the field of complex
numbers.
  In our short paper we will introduce an extended version of Cathelineau's
group, and a complex-valued regulator map given by the entropy. We will also
give a comparison map between our extended version and Cathelineau's group.
  Our results were motivated by two unrelated sources: Neumann's work on the
extended Bloch group (which is isomorphic to indecomposable $K_3$ of the
complex numbers), and the study of singularities of generating series of
hypergeometric multisums. Final version.
