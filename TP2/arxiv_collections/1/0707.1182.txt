In this communication we have shown that Schwarzschild solution is possible
in brane world for some specific choices of brane matter and the non local
effects from the bulk. A conformally flat bulk space time with fine-tuned
vacuum energy (brane tension) shows that, Schwarzschild solution may also be
the vacuum solution for brane world scenario.
