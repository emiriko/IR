Dielectric permittivity spectra of yttrium-doped EuMnO$_3$ in the composition
range 0 =< x =< 0.5 have been investigated in the terahertz frequency range.
Magnetoelectric contributions to the permittivity were observed in all
compositions for ac electric fields parallel to the crystallographic a-axis.
Well defined electromagnons exist for x >= 0.2 close to \nu ~ 20 cm^{-1} and
with dielectric strength strongly increasing on doping. In addition to
electromagnons, a broad contribution of magnetoelectric origin is observed for
all compositions. For Eu_{0.8}Y_{0.2}MnO_3 the electromagnons can be suppressed
by external magnetic fields which induce a canted antiferromagnetic phase.
Magnetoelectric effects in the different doping regimes are discussed in
detail.
