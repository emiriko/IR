The thermal decomposition of n-dodecane, a component of some jet fuels, has
been studied in a jet-stirred reactor at temperatures from 793 to 1093 K, for
residence times between 1 and 5 s and at atmospheric pressure. Thermal
decomposition of hydrocarbon fuel prior the entrance in the combustion chamber
is an envisaged way to cool the wall of hypersonic vehicles. The products of
the reaction are mainly hydrogen, methane, ethane, 1,3-butadiene and 1-alkenes
from ethylene to 1-undecene. For higher temperatures and residence times
acetylene, allene, propyne, cyclopentene, 1,3-cyclopentadiene and aromatic
compounds from benzene to pyrene through naphthalene have also been observed. A
previous detailed kinetic model of the thermal decomposition of n-dodecane
generated using EXGAS software has been improved and completed by a
sub-mechanism explaining the formation and the consumption of aromatic
compounds.
