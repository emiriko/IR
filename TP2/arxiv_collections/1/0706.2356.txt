We present the first protocol for the anonymous transmission of a quantum
state that is information-theoretically secure against an active adversary,
without any assumption on the number of corrupt participants. The anonymity of
the sender and receiver is perfectly preserved, and the privacy of the quantum
state is protected except with exponentially small probability. Even though a
single corrupt participant can cause the protocol to abort, the quantum state
can only be destroyed with exponentially small probability: if the protocol
succeeds, the state is transferred to the receiver and otherwise it remains in
the hands of the sender (provided the receiver is honest).
