A general relation between quantum phase transitions and the second
derivative of the fidelity (or the "fidelity susceptibility") is proposed. The
validity and the limitation of the fidelity susceptibility in characterizing
quantum phase transitions is thus established. Moreover, based on the
bosonization method, general formulas of the fidelity and the fidelity
susceptibility are obtained for a class of one-dimensional gapless systems
known as the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid. Applying these formulas to the
one-dimensional spin-1/2 $XXZ$ model, we find that quantum phase transitions,
even of the Beresinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless type, can be signaled by the
fidelity susceptibility.
