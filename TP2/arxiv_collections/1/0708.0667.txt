We investigate multiple linear optical teleportation in the
Knill-Laflamme-Milburn scheme with both maximally and nonmaximally entangled
states. We show that if the qubit is teleported several times via nonmaximally
entangled state then the errors introduced in the previous teleportations can
be corrected by the errors introduced in the following teleportations. This
effect is so strong that it leads to another interesting phenomenon, i.e., the
total probability of successful multiple linear optical teleportation is higher
for nonmaximally entangled states than maximally entangled states.
