This is an investigation on the dynamical screening of an atom confined
within a fullerene of finite width. The two surfaces of the fullerene lead to
the presence of two surface plasmon eigenmodes. It is shown that, in the
vicinity of these two eigenfrequencies, there is a large enhancement of the
confined atom's photoabsorption rate.
