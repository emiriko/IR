SrMoO4 was studied under compression up to 25 GPa by angle-dispersive x-ray
diffraction. A phase transition was observed from the scheelite-structured
ambient phase to a monoclinic fergusonite phase at 12.2(9) GPa with cell
parameters a = 5.265(9) A, b = 11.191(9) A, c = 5.195 (5) A, and beta = 90.9, Z
= 4 at 13.1 GPa. There is no significant volume collapse at the phase
transition. No additional phase transitions were observed and on release of
pressure the initial phase is recovered, implying that the observed structural
modifications are reversible. The reported transition appeared to be a
ferroelastic second-order transformation producing a structure that is a
monoclinic distortion of the low-pressure phase and was previously observed in
compounds isostructural to SrMoO4. A possible mechanism for the transition is
proposed and its character is discussed in terms of the present data and the
Landau theory. Finally, the EOS is reported and the anisotropic compressibility
of the studied crystal is discussed in terms of the compression of the Sr-O and
Mo-O bonds.
