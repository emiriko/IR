Thermal shape fluctuations of grafted microtubules were studied using high
resolution particle tracking of attached fluorescent beads. First mode
relaxation times were extracted from the mean square displacement in the
transverse coordinate. For microtubules shorter than 10 um, the relaxation
times were found to follow an L^2 dependence instead of L^4 as expected from
the standard wormlike chain model. This length dependence is shown to result
from a complex length dependence of the bending stiffness which can be
understood as a result of the molecular architecture of microtubules. For
microtubules shorter than 5 um, high drag coefficients indicate contributions
from internal friction to the fluctuation dynamics.
