Trines and Norreys state that a principle aim of their work on warm
wave-breaking was ``to create some order in the diverse landscape of warm fluid
models and establish which model is most suitable for the study of wave
breaking in thermal plasma.'' Unfortunately, we must conclude that they have
obfuscated more than they have clarified, and have advanced the waterbag model
only by exaggerating or misstating its benefits while mischaracterizing
features of alternative warm fluid theories.
