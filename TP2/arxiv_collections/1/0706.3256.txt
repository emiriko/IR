We study the folding dynamics of polyalanine (Ala$_{20}$), a protein fragment
with 20 residues whose native state is a single alpha helix. We use the CSAW
model (conditioned self-avoiding walk), which treats the protein molecule as a
chain in Brownian motion, with interactions that include hydrophobic forces and
internal hydrogen bonding. We find that large scale structures form before
small scale structures, and obtain the relevant relaxation times. We find that
helix nucleation occurs at two separate points on the protein chain. The
evolution of small and large scale structures involve different mechanisms.
While the former can be describe by rate equations governing the growth of
helical content, the latter is akin to the relaxation of an elastic solid.
