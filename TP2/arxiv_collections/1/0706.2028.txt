Given a Riemannian submersion, we study the relation between lambda constants
introduced by G.Perelman on the base manifold and the total space of a
Riemannian submersion. We also discuss the relationship between the first
eigenvalues of Laplacians on the base manifold and that of the total space. The
quantities on warped products are discussed in detail.
