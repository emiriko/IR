We study the dynamics of the quantum phase distribution associated with the
reduced density matrix of a system for a number of situations of practical
importance, as the system evolves under the influence of its environment,
interacting via a quantum nondemoliton type of coupling, such that there is
decoherence without dissipation, as well as when it interacts via a dissipative
interaction, resulting in decoherence as well as dissipation. The system is
taken to be either a two-level atom (or equivalently, a spin-1/2 system) or a
harmonic oscillator, and the environment is modeled as a bath of harmonic
oscillators, starting out in a squeezed thermal state. The impact of the
different environmental parameters on the dynamics of the quantum phase
distribution for the system starting out in various initial states, is
explicitly brought out. An interesting feature that emerges from our work is
that the relationship between squeezing and temperature effects depends on the
type of system-bath interaction. In the case of quantum nondemolition type of
interaction, squeezing and temperature work in tandem, producing a diffusive
effect on the phase distribution. In contrast, in case of a dissipative
interaction, the influence of temperature can be counteracted by squeezing,
which manifests as a resistence to randomization of phase. We make use of the
phase distributions to bring out a notion of complementarity in atomic systems.
We also study the dispersion of the phase using the phase distributions
conditioned on particular initial states of the system.
