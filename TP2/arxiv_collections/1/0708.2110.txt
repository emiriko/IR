Optical-window birefringence is frequently a major obstacle in experiments
measuring changes in the polarization state of light traversing a sample under
investigation. It can contribute a signal indistinguishable from that due to
the sample and complicate the analysis. Here, we explore a method to measure
and compensate for the birefringence of an optical window using the reflection
from the last optical surface before the sample. We demonstrate that this
arrangement can cancel out false signals due to the optical-window
birefringence-induced ellipticity drift to about 1%, for the values of total
ellipticity less than 0.25 rad.
