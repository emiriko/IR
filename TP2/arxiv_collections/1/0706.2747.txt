In the present work we discuss cosmic strings in natural inflation. Our
analysis is based entirely on the CMB quadrupole temperature anisotropy and on
the existing upper bound on the cosmic string tension. Our results show that
the allowed range for both parameters of the inflationary model is very
different from the range obtained recently if cosmic strings are formed at the
same time with inflation, while if strings are formed after inflation we find
that the parameters of the inflationary model are similar to the ones obtained
recently.
