We review one-particle inclusive production of heavy-flavoured hadrons in a
framework which resums the large collinear logarithms through the evolution of
the FFs and PDFs and retains the full dependence on the heavy-quark mass
without additional theoretical assumptions. We focus on presenting results for
the inclusive cross section for the production of charmed mesons in p anti-p
collisions and the comparison with CDF data from the Tevatron as well as on
inclusive B-meson production and comparison with recent CDF data. The third
topic is the production of D^* mesons in photoproduction and comparison with
recent H1 data from HERA.
