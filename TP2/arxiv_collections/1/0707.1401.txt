In this paper the complete two-loop corrections to the Higgs-boson decay, H
-> gamma gamma, are presented. The evaluations of both QCD and electroweak
corrections are based on a numerical approach. The results cover all
kinematical regions, including the WW normal-threshold, by introducing complex
masses in the relevant (gauge-invariant) parts of the LO and NLO amplitudes.
