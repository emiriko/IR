Neutrino physics has entered an era of precision measurements. With these
precise measurements, we may be able to distinguish different models that have
been constructed to explain the small neutrino masses and the large mixing
among them. In this talk, I review some of the existing theoretical models and
their predictions for neutrino oscillations.
