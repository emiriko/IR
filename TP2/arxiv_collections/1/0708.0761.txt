We study the statistics of quantum transmission through a one-dimensional
disordered system modelled by a sequence of independent scattering units. Each
unit is characterized by its length and by its action, which is proportional to
the logarithm of the transmission probability through this unit. Unit actions
and lengths are independent random variables, with a common distribution that
is either narrow or broad. This investigation is motivated by results on
disordered systems with non-stationary random potentials whose fluctuations
grow with distance.
  In the statistical ensemble at fixed total sample length four phases can be
distinguished, according to the values of the indices characterizing the
distribution of the unit actions and lengths. The sample action, which is
proportional to the logarithm of the conductance across the sample, is found to
obey a fluctuating scaling law, and therefore to be non-self-averaging, in
three of the four phases. According to the values of the two above mentioned
indices, the sample action may typically grow less rapidly than linearly with
the sample length (underlocalization), more rapidly than linearly
(superlocalization), or linearly but with non-trivial sample-to-sample
fluctuations (fluctuating localization).
