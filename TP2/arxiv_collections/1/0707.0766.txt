We observe that the pattern of the quenching factors for scintillation light
from various ions, recently studied in $CaWO_4$ in connection with dark matter
detectors, can be understood as a saturation phenomenon in which the light
output is simply proportional to track length, independent of the ion and its
energy. This observation is in accord with the high dE/dx limit of Birks' law.
It suggests a simple model for the intrinsic resolution of light detectors for
low energy ions, which we briefly discuss.
