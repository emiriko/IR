The low temperature heat capacity C_{p} of Fe_{1-x}Ga_{x} alloys with large
magnetostriction has been investigated. The data were analyzed in the standard
way using electron ($\gamma T$) and phonon ($\beta T^{3}$) contributions. The
Debye temperature $\Theta_{D}$ decreases approximately linearly with increasing
Ga concentration, consistent with previous resonant ultrasound measurements and
measured phonon dispersion curves. Calculations of $\Theta_{D}$ from lattice
dynamical models and from measured elastic constants C_{11}, C_{12} and C_{44}
are in agreement with the measured data. The linear coefficient of electronic
specific heat $\gamma$ remains relatively constant as the Ga concentration
increases, despite the fact that the magnetoelastic coupling increases. Band
structure calculations show that this is due to the compensation of majority
and minority spin states at the Fermi level.
