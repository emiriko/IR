We study the charge density distribution, the electric field profile, and the
resistance of an electrostatically created lateral p-n junction in graphene. We
show that the electric field at the interface of the electron and hole regions
is strongly enhanced due to limited screening capacity of Dirac quasiparticles.
Accordingly, the junction resistance is lower than estimated in previous
literature.
