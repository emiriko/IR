The development of analytic-gradient methodology for excited states within
conventional time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) would seem to
offer a relatively inexpensive alternative to better established
quantum-chemical approaches for the modeling of photochemical reactions.
However, even though TDDFT is formally exact, practical calculations involve
the use of approximate functionals, in particular the TDDFT adiabatic
approximation, whose use in photochemical applications must be further
validated. Here, we investigate the prototypical case of the symmetric CC ring
opening of oxirane. We demonstrate by direct comparison with the results of
high-quality quantum Monte Carlo calculations that, far from being an
approximation on TDDFT, the Tamm-Dancoff approximation (TDA) is a practical
necessity for avoiding triplet instabilities and singlet near instabilities,
thus helping maintain energetically reasonable excited-state potential energy
surfaces during bond breaking. Other difficulties one would encounter in
modeling oxirane photodynamics are pointed out but none of these is likely to
prevent a qualitatively correct TDDFT/TDA description of photochemistry in this
prototypical molecule.
