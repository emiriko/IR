Ultrasound is a well-established method for particle size reduction in
dispersions and emulsions. Ultrasonic processors are used in the generation of
nano-size material slurries, dispersions and emulsions because of the potential
in the deagglomeration and the reduction of primaries. These are the mechanical
effects of ultrasonic cavitation. Ultrasound can also be used to influence
chemical reactions by the cavitation energy. This is sonochemistry. As the
market for nano-size materials grows, the demand for ultrasonic processes at
production level increases. At this stage, energy efficiency becomes important.
Since the energy required per weight or volume of processed material links
directly to the equipment size required, optimization of the process efficiency
is essential to reduce investment and operational costs. Furthermore it is
required to scale the lab and bench top configurations to this final level
without any variations in the process achievements. Scale up by power alone
will not do this.
