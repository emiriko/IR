Optical lattice loaded with cold atoms can exhibit a tunable photonic band
gap for a weak probe field under the conditions of electromagnetically induced
transparency. This system possesses a number of advantageous properties,
including reduced relaxation of Raman coherence and the associated probe
absorption, and simultaneous enhancement of the index modulation and the
resulting reflectivity of the medium. This flexible system has a potential to
serve as a testbed of various designs for the linear and nonlinear photonic
band gap materials at a very low light level and can be employed for realizing
deterministic entanglement between weak quantum fields.
