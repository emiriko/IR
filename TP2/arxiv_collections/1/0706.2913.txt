We report the observation of strong electron dephasing in a series of
disordered Cu$_{93}$Ge$_4$Au$_3$ thin films. A very short electron dephasing
time possessing very weak temperature dependence around 6 K, followed by an
upturn with further decrease in temperature below 4 K, is found. The upturn is
progressively more pronounced in more disordered samples. Moreover, a ln$T$
dependent, but high-magnetic-field-insensitive, resistance rise persisting from
above 10 K down to 30 mK is observed in the films. These results suggest a
nonmagnetic dephasing process which is stronger than any known mechanism and
may originate from the coupling of conduction electrons to dynamic defects.
