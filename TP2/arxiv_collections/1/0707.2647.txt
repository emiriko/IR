Rolls in finite Prandtl number rotating convection with free-slip top and
bottom boundary conditions are shown to be unstable with respect to small angle
perturbations for any value of the rotation rate. This instability is driven by
the horizontal mean flow whose estimation requires a special singular
perturbation analysis.
