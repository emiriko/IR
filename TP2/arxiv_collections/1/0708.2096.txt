A classical lazy random walk on cycles is known to mix to the uniform
distribution. In contrast, we show that a continuous-time quantum walk on
cycles exhibit strong non-uniform mixing properties. Our results include the
following:
  - The instantaneous distribution of a quantum walk on most even-length cycles
is never uniform. - The average distribution of a quantum walk on any Abelian
circulant graph is never uniform. As a corollary, the average distribution of a
quantum walk on any standard circulant graph, such as the cycles, complete
graphs, and even hypercubes, is never uniform.
