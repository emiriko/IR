We study the spin-dependent scattering of charge carriers in a magnetized one
dimensional Luttinger liquid from a localized non-homogeneous magnetic field,
which might be brought about by the stray field of magnetic tip near a uniform
liquid, or by a transverse domain wall (DW) between two oppositely magnetized
liquids.
  From a renormalization group treatment of the electron interactions we deduce
scaling equations for the transmission and reflection amplitudes as the
bandwidth is progressively reduced to an energy scale set by the temperature.
The repulsive interactions dictate two possible zero temperature insulator
fixed points: one in which electrons are reflected in the same spin channel and
another where the electron spin is reversed upon reflection. In the latter
case, a finite spin current emerges in the absence of a charge current at zero
temperature and the Friedel oscillations form a transverse spiraling spin
density. Adding a purely potential scattering term has no effect on the fixed
points of a uniformly magnetized liquid. For a DW we find that the introduction
of potential scattering stabilizes the spin-flip insulator phase even if the
single-particle spin-flip scattering produced by the DW is arbitrarily weak.
The potential can be induced externally, e.g. by a local gate voltage or a
constriction, providing a means for controlling the transport properties of the
wire.
