The important task of determining the connectivity of gene networks, and at a
more detailed level even the kind of interaction existing between genes, can
nowadays be tackled by microarraylike technologies. Yet, there is still a large
amount of unknowns with respect to the amount of data provided by a single
microarray experiment, and therefore reliable gene network retrieval procedures
must integrate all of the available biological knowledge, even if coming from
different sources and of different nature. In this paper we present a reverse
engineering algorithm able to reveal the underlying gene network by using
time-series dataset on gene expressions considering the system response to
different perturbations. The approach is able to determine the sparsity of the
gene network, and to take into account possible {\it a priori} biological
knowledge on it. The validity of the reverse engineering approach is
highlighted through the deduction of the topology of several {\it simulated}
gene networks, where we also discuss how the performance of the algorithm
improves enlarging the amount of data or if any a priori knowledge is
considered. We also apply the algorithm to experimental data on a nine gene
network in {\it Escherichia coli
