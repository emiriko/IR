The interpretation by the author in recent years of bond lengths as sums of
the relevant atomic or ionic radii has been extended here to the bonds in the
skeletal structures of adenine, guanine, thymine, cytosine, uracil, ribose,
deoxyribose and phosphoric acid. On examining the bond length data in the
literature, it has been found that the averages of the bond lengths are close
to the sums of the corresponding atomic covalent radii of carbon, nitrogen,
oxygen, hydrogen and phosphorus. Thus, the conventional molecular structures
have been resolved here, for the first time, into probable atomic structures.
