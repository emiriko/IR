This paper presents a proof that existence of a polynomial Lyapunov function
is necessary and sufficient for exponential stability of sufficiently smooth
nonlinear ordinary differential equations on bounded sets. The main result
states that if there exists an n-times continuously differentiable Lyapunov
function which proves exponential stability on a bounded subset of R^n, then
there exists a polynomial Lyapunov function which proves exponential stability
on the same region. Such a continuous Lyapunov function will exist if, for
example, the right-hand side of the differential equation is polynomial or at
least n-times continuously differentiable. The proof is based on a
generalization of the Weierstrass approximation theorem to differentiable
functions in several variables. Specifically, we show how to use polynomials to
approximate a differentiable function in the Sobolev norm W^{1,\infty} to any
desired accuracy. We combine this approximation result with the second-order
Taylor series expansion to find that polynomial Lyapunov functions can
approximate continuous Lyapunov functions arbitrarily well on bounded sets. Our
investigation is motivated by the use of polynomial optimization algorithms to
construct polynomial Lyapunov functions.
