The deformation at the core-mantle boundary produced by the 2004 Sumatra
earthquake is investigated by means of a semi-analytic theoretical model of
global coseismic and postseismic deformation, predicting a millimetric
coseismic perturbation over a large portion of the core-mantle boundary.
Spectral features of such deformations are analysed and discussed. The
time-dependent postseismic evolution of the elliptical part of the gravity
field (J2) is also computed for different asthenosphere viscosity models. Our
results show that, for asthenospheric viscosities smaller than 10^18 Pa s, the
postseismic J2 variation in the next years is expected to leave a detectable
signal in geodetic observations.
