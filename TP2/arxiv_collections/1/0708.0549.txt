We study the azimuthal angle decorrelation of forward jets in Deep Inelastic
Scattering. We make predictions for this observable at HERA describing the high
energy limit of the relevant scattering amplitudes with quasi-multi-Regge
kinematics together with a collinearly improved evolution kernel for
multiparton emissions.
