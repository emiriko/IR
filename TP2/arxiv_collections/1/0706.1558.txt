We study finite-frequency transport properties of the double-dot system
recently constructed to observe the two-channel Kondo effect [R. M. Potok et
al., Nature 446, 167 (2007)]. We derive an analytical expression for the
frequency-dependent linear conductance of this device in the Kondo regime. We
show how the features characteristic of the 2-channel Kondo quantum critical
point emerge in this quantity, which we compute using the results of conformal
field theory as well as numerical renormalization group methods. We determine
the universal cross-over functions describing non-Fermi liquid vs. Fermi liquid
cross-overs and also investigate the effects of a finite magnetic field.
