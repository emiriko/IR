It is shown that an exact chiral symmetry can be described for Dirac-Kahler
fermions using the two complexes of the geometric discretization. This
principle is extended to describe exact flavour projection and it is shown that
this necessitates the introduction of a new operator and two new structures of
complex. To describe simultaneous chiral and flavour projection, eight
complexes are needed in all and it is shown that projection leaves a single
flavour of chiral field on each.
