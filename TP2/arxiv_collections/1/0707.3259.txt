We study the generalized harmonic oscillator which has both the
position-dependent mass and the potential depending on the form of mass
function in a more general framework. The explicit expressions of the
eigenvalue and eigenfunction for such system are given, they have the same
forms as those for the usual harmonic oscillator with constant mass. The
coherent state and the its properties for the system with PDM are also
discussed. We give the corresponding effective potentials for several mass
functions, the systems with such potentials are isospectral to the usual
harmonic oscillator.
