Discrete Fourier transform (DFT) is the base of modern signal or information
processing. 1-Dimensional fast Fourier transform (1D FFT) and 2D FFT have time
complexity O(NlogN) and O(N^2logN) respectively. Quantum 1D and 2D DFT
algorithms with classical output (1D QDFT and 2D QDFT) are presented in this
paper. And quantum algorithm for convolution estimation is also presented in
this paper. Compared with FFT, QDFT has two advantages at least. One of
advantages is that 1D and 2D QDFT has time complexity O(sqrt(N)) and O(N)
respectively. The other advantage is that QDFT can process very long signal
sequence at a time. QDFT and quantum convolution demonstrate that quantum
signal processing with classical output is possible.
