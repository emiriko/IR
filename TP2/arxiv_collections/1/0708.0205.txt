We report the design and measurement of
Superconducting/normal/superconducting (SNS) proximity DC squids in the long
junction limit, i.e. superconducting loops interrupted by two normal metal
wires roughly a micrometer long. Thanks to the clean interface between the
metals, at low temperature a large supercurrent flows through the device. The
dc squid-like geometry leads to an almost complete periodic modulation of the
critical current through the device by a magnetic flux, with a flux periodicity
of a flux quantum h/2e through the SNS loop. In addition, we examine the entire
field dependence, notably the low and high field dependence of the maximum
switching current. In contrast with the well-known Fraunhoffer-type
oscillations typical of short wide junctions, we find a monotonous gaussian
extinction of the critical current at high field. As shown in [15], this
monotonous dependence is typical of long and narrow diffusive junctions. We
also find in some cases a puzzling reentrance at low field. In contrast, the
temperature dependence of the critical current is well described by the
proximity effect theory, as found by Dubos {\it et al.} [16] on SNS wires in
the long junction limit. The switching current distributions and hysteretic IV
curves also suggest interesting dynamics of long SNS junctions with an
important role played by the diffusion time across the junction.
