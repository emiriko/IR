Photonic entanglement has a wide range of applications in quantum computation
and communication. Here we introduce a new device: the "photonic module", which
allows for the rapid, deterministic preparation of a large class of entangled
photon states. The module is an application independent, "plug and play"
device, with sufficient flexibility to prepare entanglement for all major
quantum computation and communication applications in a completely
deterministic fashion without number-discriminated photon detection. We present
two alternative constructions for the module, one using free-space components
and one in a photonic bandgap structures. The natural operation of the module
is to generate states within the stabilizer formalism and we present an
analysis on the cavity-QED requirements to experimentally realize this device.
