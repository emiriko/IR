Certain null singularities in ten dimensional supergravity have natural
holographic duals in terms of Matrix Theory and generalizations of the AdS/CFT
correspondence. In many situations the holographic duals appear to be well
defined in regions where the supergravity develops singularities. We describe
some recent progress in this area.
