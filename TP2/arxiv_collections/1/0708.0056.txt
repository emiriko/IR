We report results of investigations of structural and transport properties of
GaAs/Ga(1-x)In(x)As/GaAs quantum wells (QWs) having a 0.5-1.8 ML thick Mn
layer, separated from the QW by a 3 nm thick spacer. The structure has hole
mobility of about 2000 cm2/(V*s) being by several orders of magnitude higher
than in known ferromagnetic two-dimensional structures. The analysis of the
electro-physical properties of these systems is based on detailed study of
their structure by means of high-resolution X-ray diffractometry and
glancing-incidence reflection, which allow us to restore the depth profiles of
structural characteristics of the QWs and thin Mn containing layers. These
investigations show absence of Mn atoms inside the QWs. The quality of the
structures was also characterized by photoluminescence spectra from the QWs.
Transport properties reveal features inherent to ferromagnetic systems: a
specific maximum in the temperature dependence of the resistance and the
anomalous Hall effect (AHE) observed in samples with both "metallic" and
activated types of conductivity up to ~100 K. AHE is most pronounced in the
temperature range where the resistance maximum is observed, and decreases with
decreasing temperature. The results are discussed in terms of interaction of
2D-holes and magnetic Mn ions in presence of large-scale potential fluctuations
related to random distribution of Mn atoms. The AHE values are compared with
calculations taking into account its "intrinsic" mechanism in ferromagnetic
systems.
