In this paper we employ all-electron \textit{ab-initio} time-dependent
density functional theory based method to calculate the long range
dipole-dipole dispersion coefficient (van der Waals coefficient) $C_{6}$ of
sodium atom clusters containing even number of atoms ranging from 2 to 20
atoms. The dispersion coefficients are obtained via Casimir-Polder relation.
The calculations are carried out with two different exchange-correlation
potentials: (i) the asymptotically correct statistical average of orbital
potential (SAOP) and (ii) Vosko-Wilk-Nusair representation of
exchange-correlation potential within local density approximation. A comparison
with the other theoretical results has been performed. We also present the
results for the static polarizabilities of sodium clusters and also compare
them with other theoretical and experimental results. These comparisons reveal
that the SAOP results for C_{6} and static polarizability are quite accurate
and very close to the experimental results. We examine the relationship between
volume of the cluster and van der Waals coefficient and find that to a very
high degree of correlation C_{6} scales as square of the volume. We also
present the results for van der Waals coefficient corresponding to cluster-Ar
atom and cluster-N_{2} molecule interactions.
