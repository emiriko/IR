As is already known, a spacetime horizon acts like a boundary of a thermal
system an we can associate with it notions as temperature and entropy.
Following the work of M. Akbar, in this paper we will show how it is possible
to interpret the field equation of a charged BTZ black hole near horizon as a
thermodynamic identity dE=TdS+PdA+PhidQ, where Phi is the electric potential
and Q is the electric charge of BTZ black hole. These results indicate that the
field equations for the charged BTZ black hole possess intrinsic thermodynamic
properties near horizon.
