A simple lattice model, recently introduced as a generalization of the
Wako--Sait\^o model of protein folding, is used to investigate the properties
of widely studied molecules under external forces. The equilibrium properties
of the model proteins, together with their energy landscape, are studied on the
basis of the exact solution of the model. Afterwards, the kinetic response of
the molecules to a force is considered, discussing both force clamp and dynamic
loading protocols and showing that theoretical expectations are verified. The
kinetic parameters characterizing the protein unfolding are evaluated by using
computer simulations and agree nicely with experimental results, when these are
available. Finally, the extended Jarzynski equality is exploited to investigate
the possibility of reconstructing the free energy landscape of proteins with
pulling experiments.
