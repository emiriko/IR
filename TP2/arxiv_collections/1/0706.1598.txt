We derive the lower and upper bounds on the entanglement of a given
multipartite superposition state in terms of the entanglement of the states
being superposed. The first entanglement measure we use is the geometric
measure, and the second is the q-squashed entanglement. These bounds allow us
to estimate the amount of the multipartite entanglement of superpositions. We
also show that two states of high fidelity to one another do not necessarily
have nearly the same q-squashed entanglement.
