The recent discovery of unstable travelling waves (TWs) in pipe flow has been
hailed as a significant breakthrough with the hope that they populate the
turbulent attractor. We confirm the existence of coherent states with internal
fast and slow streaks commensurate in both structure and energy with known TWs
using numerical simulations in a long pipe. These only occur, however, within
less energetic regions of (localized) `puff' turbulence at low Reynolds numbers
(Re=2000-2400), and not at all in (homogeneous) `slug' turbulence at Re=2800.
This strongly suggests that all currently known TWs sit in an intermediate
region of phase space between the laminar and turbulent states rather than
being embedded within the turbulent attractor itself. New coherent fast streak
states with strongly decelerated cores appear to populate the turbulent
attractor instead.
