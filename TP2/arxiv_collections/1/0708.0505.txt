Haplotype Inference is a challenging problem in bioinformatics that consists
in inferring the basic genetic constitution of diploid organisms on the basis
of their genotype. This information allows researchers to perform association
studies for the genetic variants involved in diseases and the individual
responses to therapeutic agents.
  A notable approach to the problem is to encode it as a combinatorial problem
(under certain hypotheses, such as the pure parsimony criterion) and to solve
it using off-the-shelf combinatorial optimization techniques. The main methods
applied to Haplotype Inference are either simple greedy heuristic or exact
methods (Integer Linear Programming, Semidefinite Programming, SAT encoding)
that, at present, are adequate only for moderate size instances.
  We believe that metaheuristic and hybrid approaches could provide a better
scalability. Moreover, metaheuristics can be very easily combined with problem
specific heuristics and they can also be integrated with tree-based search
techniques, thus providing a promising framework for hybrid systems in which a
good trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency can be reached.
  In this paper we illustrate a feasibility study of the approach and discuss
some relevant design issues, such as modeling and design of approximate solvers
that combine constructive heuristics, local search-based improvement strategies
and learning mechanisms. Besides the relevance of the Haplotype Inference
problem itself, this preliminary analysis is also an interesting case study
because the formulation of the problem poses some challenges in modeling and
hybrid metaheuristic solver design that can be generalized to other problems.
