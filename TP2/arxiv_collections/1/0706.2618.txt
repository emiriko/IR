Density of states, dynamic (optical) conductivity and phase diagram of
strongly correlated and strongly disordered paramagnetic Anderson-Hubbard model
are analyzed within the generalized dynamical mean field theory (DMFT+\Sigma
approximation). Strong correlations are accounted by DMFT, while disorder is
taken into account via the appropriate generalization of self-consistent theory
of localization. The DMFT effective single impurity problem is solved by
numerical renormalization group (NRG) and we consider the three-dimensional
system with semi-elliptic density of states. Correlated metal, Mott insulator
and correlated Anderson insulator phases are identified via the evolution of
density of states and dynamic conductivity, demonstrating both Mott-Hubbard and
Anderson metal-insulator transition and allowing the construction of complete
zero-temperature phase diagram of Anderson-Hubbard model. Rather unusual is the
possibility of disorder induced Mott insulator to metal transition.
