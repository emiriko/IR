We give a framework to describe gauge theory in which a nonassociative
Moufang loop takes the place of the structure group. The structure of such
gauge theory has many formal similarities with that of Yang-Mills theory. We
extend the gauge invariance to this theory and construct an on-shell version of
N=1 supersymmetric gauge theory.
