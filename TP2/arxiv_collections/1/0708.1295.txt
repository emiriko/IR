I explore the origins of the unphysical predictions from rooted staggered
fermion algorithms. Before rooting, the exact chiral symmetry of staggered
fermions is a flavored symmetry among the four "tastes." The rooting procedure
averages over tastes of different chiralities. This averaging forbids the
appearance of the correct 't Hooft vertex for the target theory.
