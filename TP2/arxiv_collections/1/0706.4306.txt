For any moduli space of stable representations of quivers, certain smooth
varieties, compactifying projective space fibrations over the moduli space, are
constructed. The boundary of this compactification is analyzed. Explicit
formulas for the Betti numbers of the smooth models are derived. In the case of
moduli of simple representations, explicit cell decompositions of the smooth
models are constructed.
