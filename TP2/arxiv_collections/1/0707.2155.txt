The modular multiplication operator, a central subroutine in Shor's factoring
algorithm, is shown to be a coherent superposition of two quantum bakers maps
when the multiplier is 2. The classical limit of the maps being completely
chaotic, it is shown that there exist perturbations that push the modular
multiplication operator into regimes of generic quantum chaos with spectral
fluctuations that are those of random matrices. For the initial state of
relevance to Shor's algorithm we study fidelity decay due to phase and bit-flip
errors in a single qubit and show exponential decay with shoulders at multiples
or half-multiples of the order. A simple model is used to gain some
understanding of this behavior.
