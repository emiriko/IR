Malaria and other parasites, including virus often induce an increase in host
lipids which the invaders use to their own advantage. We obtained encouraging
results in our investigations on bird malaria with a new approach namely the
use of nanosilica to mop up excess host lipids. While this project is
continuing we have investigated another, simpler system namely silkworms which
suffer from a deadly baculovirus, BmNPV. This virus decimates the infected
population within 24 hours or so and no known antibiotic antidote or
genetically resistant strain of silkworm3 exists. We report here a partial
success, which is worth following up. Our rationale, we believe, has a broad
and interdisciplinary appeal, for, this nanosilica treatment might be used
together with other arsenals on all sorts of virus which take advantage of
enhanced host lipids. It has not escaped our notice that Ebola and HIV also
belong to this category. Nanoparticles are being preferentially harnessed,
because they offer a greater surface area, circulate more easily and in
lepidopteran system4 they are removed within 24 hours from the body. Lawry
surmised, on cogent theoretical grounds that particles significantly smaller
than micron order would be less harmful in the hemocoele. Furthermore, Hui-peng
et al. pointed out that lipase treatment, the only viable option for
controlling BmNPV interferes in hormonal balance and cannot be applied to pre
molting stage.
