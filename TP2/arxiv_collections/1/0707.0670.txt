The physics of the state at even denominator fractional fillings of Landau
levels depends on the Coulomb pseudopotentials, and produces, in different GaAs
Landau levels, a composite fermion Fermi sea, a stripe phase, or, possibly, a
paired composite fermion state. We consider here even denominator fractions in
graphene, which has different pseudopotentials as well as a possible four fold
degeneracy of each Landau level. We test various composite fermion Fermi sea
wave functions (fully polarized, SU(2) singlet, SU(4) singlet) as well as the
paired composite fermion states in the n=0 and $n=1$ Landau levels and predict
that (i) the paired states are not favorable, (ii) CF Fermi seas occur in both
Landau levels, and (iii) an SU(4) singlet composite fermion Fermi sea is
stabilized in the appropriate limit. The results from detailed microscopic
calculations are generally consistent with the predictions of the mean field
model of composite fermions.
