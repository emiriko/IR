The importance is emphasized of taking into account the channeling along the
low index crystallographic axes and planes of a part of low-energy (1-10 keV)
recoil ions in measurements of their parameters with crystal scintillators of
the type of NaI(Tl) etc. Because the nucleus stopping power in channels is low
as compared with electronic stopping power, the light yield of the scintillator
must be, accordingly, higher in the given case than that for ions having higher
energy (tens keV and more), which lose most part of their energy via nuclear
collisions outside channels. Hence, in particular, it follows that the DAMA/NaI
observations in Gran Sasso of the annual modulation of the signal frequency in
a narrow range of scintillations with an amplitude of 2-6 keV electron
equivalent may be due to incidence onto the Earth of exceedingly massive
particles (of the type of Planckian objects) from elongated Earth-crossing
heliocentric orbits at a velocity of 30-50 km/s. In NaI(Tl), these particles
create the iodine recoil ions with just the energy of 2-6 keV.
