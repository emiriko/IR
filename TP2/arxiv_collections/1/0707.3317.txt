Monte Carlo and series expansion data for the energy, specific heat,
magnetisation and susceptibility of the 4-state Potts model in the vicinity of
the critical point are analysed. The role of logarithmic corrections is
discussed. Estimates of universal ratios A_+/A_-, $\Gamma_+/\Gamma_L$,
$\Gamma_T/\Gamma_L$ and R_c^+ are given.
