We suggest that there are time-varying quanta of mass (gomidia) and of length
(somia), thus pointing to a quantization of geometry and gravitation. The
present numerical value of the gomidium and somium, are, 10 to the power minus
65 grams, and 10 to the power minus 91 centimeters. Gomidia may be responsible
for dark matter in the Universe; Heisenberg's principle, confirms the numerical
estimates for gomidia and somia, either for the present Universe, or for
Planck's time.
