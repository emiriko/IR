A long-standing controversy related to the dimer pattern formed by S atoms in
methanethiol ($CH_{3}SH$) on the Au(111) surface has been resolved using
density functional theory. For the first time, dimerization of methanethiol
adsorbates on the Au(111) surface is established by computational modeling. For
methylthiolate ($CH_{3}S$), it is shown that the S atoms do not dimerize at
high coverage but reveal a dimer pattern at intermediate coverage. Molecular
dynamics simulation at high coverage demonstrates that the observed dialkyl
disulfide species are formed during the desorption process, and thus are not
attached to the surface.
