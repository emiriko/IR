We analyze the performance of two different core-hole potentials in the
theoretical modeling of XAS of ice, liquid and gas phase water; the use of a
full core-hole (FCH) in the calculations, as suggested by Hetenyi et al. [J.
Chem. Phys. 120 (18), 8632 (2004)], gives poor agreement with experiment in
terms of intensity distribution as well as transition energies, while the half
core hole (HCH) potential, in the case of water, provides a better compromise
between initial and final state effects, leading to good agreement with the
experimental data.
