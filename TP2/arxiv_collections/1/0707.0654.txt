The pure spinor heterotic string in a generic super Yang-Mills and
supergravity background is considered. We determine the one-loop BRST anomaly
at the cohomological level. We prove that it can be absorbed by consistent
corrections of the classical constraints due to Berkovits and Howe, in
agreement with the Green-Schwarz cancelation mechanism.
