A chiral quark model approach is extended to the study of the $\pi N$
scattering at low energies. The process of $\pi^{-}p \to \eta n$ near threshold
is investigated. The model is successful in describing the differential cross
sections and total cross section near the $\eta$ production threshold. The
roles of the resonances in $n\leq 2$ shells are clarified. Near threshold, the
$S_{11}(1535)$ dominates the reactions, while the interferences from the
$S_{11}(1650)$ turn out to be destructive around $W\lesssim 1.6$ GeV. The
$D_{13}(1520)$ is crucial to give correct shapes of the differential cross
sections. The nucleon pole term contributions are significant. The
$P_{11}(1710)$ plays an important role around the c.m. energy $W=1.7$ GeV, it
is crucial to produce an enhancement in the region of $W>1.6$ GeV as suggested
by the data for total cross section. The $t$-channel is negligible in the
reactions.
