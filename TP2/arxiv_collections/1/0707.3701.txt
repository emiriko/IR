We present a unified description of zitterbewegung-like phenomena for
electron and hole systems showing Rashba spin splitting as well as for
electrons in single-layer and bilayer graphene. The former class of systems can
be interpreted as "nonrelativistic" whereas the latter are often called
"ultrarelativistic" so that our unified description indicates an interesting
connection between these two opposite limits.
