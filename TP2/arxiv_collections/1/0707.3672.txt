We consider the recursive equation ``x(n+1)=A(n)x(n)'' where x(n+1) and x(n)
are column vectors of size k and where A(n) is an irreducible random matrix of
size k x k. The matrix-vector multiplication in the (max,+) algebra is defined
by (A(n)x(n))_i= max_j [ A(n)_{ij} +x(n)_j ]. This type of equation can be used
to represent the evolution of Stochastic Event Graphs which include cyclic
Jackson Networks, some manufacturing models and models with general blocking
(such as Kanban). Let us assume that the sequence (A(n))_n is i.i.d or more
generally stationary and ergodic. The main result of the paper states that the
system couples in finite time with a unique stationary regime if and only if
there exists a set of matrices C such that P {A(0) in C} > 0, and the matrices
in C have a unique periodic regime.
