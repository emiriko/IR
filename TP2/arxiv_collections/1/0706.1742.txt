Phase diagram and pattern formation in two-dimensional Ising model with
coupling between order parameter and lattice vibrations is investigated by
Monte-Carlo simulations. It is shown that if the coupling is strong enough (or
phonons are soft enough) a short-range order exists in disordered phase for a
broader temperature interval. Different types of this short-range order
(stripe-like, checkboard-like, etc.) depending on the temperature and model
parameters are investigated. With further increase of the coupling, a
reconstruction of the ground state happens and new ordered phases appear at low
enough temperatures.
