The wireless network technology WiFi finds more and more applications in the
industrial field as for the exchange of information between the people or the
equipment. It has the advantage of allowing a great flexibility of the network
but requires precautions of installation to be effective (flow,
reliability...). The fitter of such a network must have knowledge to install
and configure the materials (access points, wifi interface) but also of
knowledge in propagation of electromagnetic waves which is the support of the
transmission of data. The teaching of this technology requires practical works
which must make it possible for the student to implement this knowledge. This
article presents the various means of calculations which we implemented within
the framework of practical works to allow the student to visualize and thus to
better control the phenomena of propagation existing in a WiFI network.
