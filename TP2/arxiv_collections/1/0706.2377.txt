We study the collisional energy loss mechanism for particles produced off
mass-shell in a finite size QCD medium. The off mass-shell effects introduced
are to consider particles produced in wave packets instead of plane waves and
the length scale associated to an in-medium particles' life-time. We show that
these effects reduce the energy loss as compared to the case when the particles
are described as freely propagating from the source. The reduction of the
energy loss is stronger as this scale becomes of the order or smaller than the
medium size. We discuss possible consequences of the result on the description
of the energy loss process in the parton recombination scenario.
