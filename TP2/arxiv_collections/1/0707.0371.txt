The notion of quadratic maps between arbitrary groups appeared at several
places in the literature on quadratic algebra. Here a unified extensive
treatment of their properties is given; the relation with a relative version of
Passi's polynomial maps and groups of degree 2 is established and used to study
the structure of the latter.
