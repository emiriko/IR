We have studied, with the KLOE detector at the DA$\Phi$NE $\Phi$-Factory, the
dynamics of the decay $\eta\to\pi^+\pi^-\pi^0$ using data from the radiative
$\phi\to\eta\gamma$ decay for an integrated luminosity $L = 450
\textrm{pb^{-1}}$. From a fit to the Dalitz plot density distribution we obtain
a precise measurement of the slope parameters. This should allow to improve the
knowledge of the decay amplitude which is sensitive to the u-d quark mass
difference. We also present new best results on the C-violating asymmetries in
the $\eta\to\pi^+\pi^-\pi^0$ decay.
