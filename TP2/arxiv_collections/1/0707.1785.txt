In this paper we consider supercritical nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations in
an analytic Riemannian manifold $(M^d,g)$, where the metric $g$ is analytic.
Using an analytic WKB method, we are able to construct an Ansatz for the
semiclassical equation for times independent of the small parameter. These
approximate solutions will help to show two different types of instabilities.
The first is in the energy space, and the second is an immediate loss of
regularity in higher Sobolev norms.
