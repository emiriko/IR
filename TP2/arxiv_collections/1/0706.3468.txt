We compute the hard diffractive hadroproduction of bosons W at high energies
using Regge factorization and taking into account multiple Pomeron exchange
corrections. The ratio of diffractive to non-diffractive W production agrees
with the current Tevatron data and a prediction for the LHC is presented.
