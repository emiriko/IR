With proton-proton collisions at PHENIX a variety of direct channels are used
to probe the proton substructure. Of the many channels available at PHENIX,
charged pion measurements are expected to have sensitivity of Delta g and thus
help in the global analysis that will constrain it. We present a measurement of
mid-rapidity charged pion production double longitudinal spin asymmetries (ALL)
at the pT range of 5-10 GeV/c at collision energies of sqrt(s) = 200 GeV.
