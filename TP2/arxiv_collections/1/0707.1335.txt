This is a semi-expository article concerning Langlands functoriality and
Deligne's conjecture on the special values of $L$-functions. The emphasis is on
symmetric power $L$-functions associated to a holomorphic cusp form, while
appealing to a recent work of Mahnkopf on the special values of automorphic
$L$-functions.
