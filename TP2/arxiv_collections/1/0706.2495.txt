We study fidelity susceptibility in one-dimensional asymmetric Hubbard model,
and show that the fidelity susceptibility can be used to identify the
universality class of the quantum phase transitions in this model. The critical
exponents are found to be 0 and 2 for cases of half-filling and away from
half-filling respectively.
