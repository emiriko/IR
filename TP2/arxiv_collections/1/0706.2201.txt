In this paper we analyze the spin-wave excitations (magnons) of an
inhomogeneous spin system within the Boltzmann-Gibbs framework and then connect
the results with the nonextensive approach (in the sense of Tsallis
statistics). Considering an equivalence between those two frameworks, we could
connect the entropic parameter q with moments of the distribution of exchange
integrals of the inhomogenous system. It ratifies the idea that the entropic
parameter is connected to the microscopic properties of the system.
