It has been shown that Information-Disturbance theorem can play an important
role in security proof of quantum cryptography. The theorem is by itself
interesting since it can be regarded as an information theoretic version of
uncertainty principle. It, however, has been able to treat restricted
situations. In this paper, the restriction on the source is abandoned, and a
general information-disturbance theorem is obtained. The theorem relates
information gain by Eve with information gain by Bob.
