We investigate the phenomenology of new abelian gauge bosons, which we denote
as $X$ bosons, that suffer a mixed anomaly with the Standard Model, but are
made self-consistent by the Green-Schwarz mechanism. A distinguishing aspect of
the resulting effective theory is the decay of $X$ bosons into Standard Model
gauge bosons, $X\to ZZ, WW, \gamma Z$. We compute the production cross-section
of the $X$ boson from vector boson fusion at the Large Hadron Collider. We
study the $pp\to X\to ZZ\to 4l$ signal, and analyze the prospects of discovery.
We argue that such a discovery could indirectly probe high energies, even up to
the string scale.
