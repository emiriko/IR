We discuss the properties of the collective modes of a system composed by a
thermalized quark-gluon plasma traversed by a relativistic jet of partons. The
transport equations obeyed by the components of the plasma and of the jet are
studied in the Vlasov approximation. Assuming that the partons in the jet can
be described with a tsunami-like distribution function we derive the
expressions of the dispersion law of the collective modes. Then the behavior of
the unstable gauge modes of the system is analyzed for various values of the
velocity of the jet, of the momentum of the collective modes and of the angle
between these two quantities. We find that the most unstable modes are those
with momentum orthogonal to the velocity of the jet and that these
instabilities appear when the velocity of the jet is higher than a threshold
value, which depends on the plasma and jet frequencies. The results obtained
within the Vlasov approximation are compared with the corresponding results
obtained using a chromohydrodynamical approach.The effect we discuss here
suggests a possible collective mechanism for the description of the jet
quenching phenomena in heavy ion collisions.
