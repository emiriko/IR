Considering the Balitsky-Kovchegov QCD evolution equation in full momentum
space, we derive the travelling wave solutions expressing the nonlinear
saturation constraints on the dipole scattering amplitude at non-zero momentum
transfer. A phenomenological application to elastic vector meson production
shows the compatibility of data with the QCD prediction: an enhanced saturation
scale at intermediate momentum transfer.
