The $O(\alpha_s^2)$ massive operator matrix elements for unpolarized and
polarized heavy flavor production at asymptotic values $Q^2 >> m^2$ are
calculated in Mellin space without applying the integration-by-parts method. We
confirm previous results given in Refs. \cite{BU1,BU2}, however, obtain much
more compact representations.
