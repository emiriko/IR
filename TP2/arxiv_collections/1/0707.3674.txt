We investigated domain nucleation process in epitaxial Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 capacitors
under a modified piezoresponse force microscope. We obtained domain evolution
images during polarization switching process and observed that domain
nucleation occurs at particular sites. This inhomogeneous nucleation process
should play an important role in an early stage of switching and under a high
electric field. We found that the number of nuclei is linearly proportional to
log(switching time), suggesting a broad distribution of activation energies for
nucleation. The nucleation sites for a positive bias differ from those for a
negative bias, indicating that most nucleation sites are located at
ferroelectric/electrode interfaces.
