At moderately low momentum transfer (-t up to 1 GeV^2) the coupling to the
vector meson production channels gives the dominant contribution to real
Compton and deeply virtual Compton scattering (DVCS). Starting from a Regge
Pole approach that successfully describes vector meson production, the singular
part of the corresponding box diagrams (where the intermediate vector
meson-baryon pair propagates on-shell) is evaluated without any further
assumptions (unitarity). Such a treatment explains not only the unexpectedly
large DVCS unpolarized cross section that has been recently measured at
Jefferson Laboratory (JLab), but also all the beam spin and charge asymmetries
that has been measured at JLab and Hermes, without explicit need of Generalized
Parton Distributions (GPD). The issue of the relationship between the two
approaches is addressed.
