The observed variation of the total cross section for the dp -> 3He eta
reaction near threshold means that the magnitude of the s--wave amplitude falls
very rapidly with the eta centre--of--mass momentum. It is shown here that
recent measurements of the momentum dependence of the angular distribution
imply a strong variation also in the phase of this amplitude. Such a behaviour
is that expected from a quasi--bound or virtual eta-3He state. The
interpretation can be investigated further through measurements of the deuteron
or proton analysing powers and/or spin--correlations.
