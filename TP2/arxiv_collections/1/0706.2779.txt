The shape of experimentally observed R(T) transition of thin superconducting
wires is analyzed. Broadening of the transition in quasi-1-dimensional
superconducting channels is typically associated with phase slip mechanism
provided by thermal or quantum fluctuations. It is shown that consideration of
inevitable geometrical inhomogeneity and finite dimensions of real samples
studied in experiments is of primary importance for interpretation of results.
The analysis is based on experimental fact that for many superconducting
materials the critical temperature is a function of characteristic dimension of
a low-dimensional system: film thickness or wire cross section
