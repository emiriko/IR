The open access agenda of the Max Planck Society, initiator of the Berlin
Declaration, envisions the support of both the green way and the golden way to
open access. For the implementation of the green way the Max Planck Society
through its newly established unit (Max Planck Digital Library) follows the
idea of providing a centralized technical platform for publications and a local
support for editorial issues. With regard to the golden way, the Max Planck
Society fosters the development of open access publication models and
experiments new publishing concepts like the Living Reviews journals.
