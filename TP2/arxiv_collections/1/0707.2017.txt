The subject of this paper is a special class of closed-chain manipulators.
First, we analyze a family of two-degree-of-freedom (dof) five-bar planar
linkages. Two Jacobian matrices appear in the kinematic relations between the
joint-rate and the Cartesian-velocity vectors, which are called the ``inverse
kinematics" and the "direct kinematics" matrices. It is shown that the loci of
points of the workspace where the condition number of the direct-kinematics
matrix remains constant, i.e., the isoconditioning loci, are the coupler points
of the four-bar linkage obtained upon locking the middle joint of the linkage.
Furthermore, if the line of centers of the two actuated revolutes is used as
the axis of a third actuated revolute, then a three-dof hybrid manipulator is
obtained. The isoconditioning loci of this manipulator are surfaces of
revolution generated by the isoconditioning curves of the two-dof manipulator,
whose axis of symmetry is that of the third actuated revolute.
