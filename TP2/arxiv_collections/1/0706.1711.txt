We present the results of exact diagonalization calculations of the isolated
and isothermal on-site static susceptibilities in the anisotropic extended
Heisenberg model on a linear chain with periodic boundary conditions. Based on
the ergodicity considerations we conclude that the isothermal susceptibility
will diverge as $T\to 0$ both in finite clusters and in the bulk system in two
non-ergodic regions of the phase diagram of the system.
