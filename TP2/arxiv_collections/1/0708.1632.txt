We study the two-filament insulin fibril's structure by incorporating recent
simulation results and mechanical measurements. Our investigation suggests that
the persistence length measurement correlates well with the previously proposed
structural model, while the elasticity measurement suggests that stretching the
fibril may involve hydrogen bond breakage. Our work illustrates an attempt to
correlate nanoscale measurements with microscopic information on the quaternary
protein structure.
