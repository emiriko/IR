We present a formalism to determine the imaginary part of a general chiral
model in the derivative expansion. Our formalism is based on the worldline path
integral for the covariant current that can be given in an explicit chiral and
gauge covariant form. The effective action is then obtained by integrating the
covariant current, taking account of the anomaly.
