We have performed measurements and numerical simulations on a bundle of
vortex lines which is expanding along a rotating column of initially
vortex-free 3He-B. Expanding vortices form a propagating front: Within the
front the superfluid is involved in rotation and behind the front the twisted
vortex state forms, which eventually relaxes to the equilibrium vortex state.
We have measured the magnitude of the twist and its relaxation rate as function
of temperature above 0.3Tc. We also demonstrate that the integrity of the
propagating vortex front results from axial superfluid flow, induced by the
twist.
