A theoretical proposal for reducing an entire atomic clock to micron
dimensions. A phosphorus or nitrogen atom is introduced into a fullerene cage.
This endohedral fullerene is then coated with an insulating shell and a number
of them are deposited as a thin layer on a silicon chip. Next to this layer a
GMR sensor is fabricated which is close to the endohedral fullerenes. This GMR
sensor measures oscillating magnetic fields on the order of micro-gauss from
the nuclear spins varying at the frequency of the hyperfine transition (413 MHz
frequency). Given the micron scale and simplicity of this system only a few
transistors are needed to control the waveforms and to perform digital
clocking. This new form of atomic clock exhibits extremely low power (nano
watts), high vibration and shock resistance, stability on the order of 10^{-9},
and is compatible with MEMS fabrication and chip integration. As GMR sensors
continue to improve in sensitivity the stability of this form of atomic clock
will increase proportionately.
