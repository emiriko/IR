The discovery that the Universe is undergoing an accelerated expansion has
suggested the existence of an evolving equation of state. This paper discusses
various wormhole solutions in a spherically symmetric spacetime with an
equation of state that is both space and time dependent. The solutions obtained
are exact and generalize earlier results on static wormholes supported by
phantom energy.
