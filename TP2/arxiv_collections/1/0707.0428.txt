The construction of optimal template banks for matched-filtering searches is
an example of the sphere covering problem. For parameter spaces with
constant-coefficient metrics a (near-) optimal template bank is achieved by the
A_n* lattice, which is the best lattice-covering in dimensions n <= 5, and is
close to the best covering known for dimensions n <= 16. Generally this
provides a substantially more efficient covering than the simpler hyper-cubic
lattice. We present an algorithm for generating lattice template banks for
constant-coefficient metrics and we illustrate its implementation by generating
A_n* template banks in n=2,3,4 dimensions.
