We have studied Bloch electrons in a perfect unidirectional superlattice
subject to crossed electric and magnetic fields, where the magnetic field is
oriented ``in-plane'', i.e. in parallel to the sample plane. Two orientation of
the electric field are considered. It is shown that the magnetic field
suppresses the intersubband tunneling of the Zener type, but does not change
the frequency of Bloch oscillations, if the electric field is oriented
perpendicularly to both the sample plane and the magnetic field. The electric
field applied in-plane (but perpendicularly to the magnetic field) yields the
step-like electron energy spectrum, corresponding to the magnetic-field-tunable
oscillations alternative to the Bloch ones.
