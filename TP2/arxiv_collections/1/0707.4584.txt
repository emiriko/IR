We deal with fixed-time and Strichartz estimates for the Schr\"odinger
propagator as an operator on Wiener amalgam spaces. We discuss the sharpness of
the known estimates and we provide some new estimates which generalize the
classical ones. As an application, we present a result on the wellposedness of
the linear Schr\"odinger equation with a rough time dependent potential.
