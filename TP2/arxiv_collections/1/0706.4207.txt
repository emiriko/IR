In the weak measurement formalism of Y. Aharonov et al. the so-called weak
value A_w of any observable A is generally a complex number. We derive a
physical interpretation of its value in terms of the shift in the measurement
pointer's mean position and mean momentum. In particular we show that the mean
position shift contains a term jointly proportional to the imaginary part of
the weak value and the rate at which the pointer is spreading in space as it
enters the measurement interaction.
