The Rutherford Backscattering Spectroscopy (RBS) and Particle Induced X-ray
Emission (PIXE) techniques can be used to obtain complementary information
about the characteristics of a sample but, traditionally, a gap has separated
the available computer codes for analyzing data from each technique, being hard
to simultaneously analyze data from the same sample. The recent development of
a free and open source library, LibCPIXE, for PIXE simulation and analysis of
arbitrary multilayered samples, has permitted to integrate this technique into
the DataFurnace code which already handles many other IBA techniques such as
Rutherford and non-Rutherford backscattering, elastic recoil detection, and
non-resonant nuclear reaction analysis. The fitting capabilities of DataFurnace
can therefore now be applied to PIXE spectra as well, including the Bayesian
Inference analysis and the simultaneous and coherent fitting of multiple
spectra from different techniques. Various examples are presented in which the
simultaneous RBS and PIXE analysis allows us to obtain consistent results that
cannot be obtained by independent analysis of the data from each technique.
