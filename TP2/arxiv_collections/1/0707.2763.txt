A novel strategy for the large scale and continuous production of aligned
carbon nanotube arrays using millimeter-diameter spheres as growth substrates
is reported. The present technique is more productive than the conventional
process on flat wafers because of the higher available growth surface and the
good fluidity of the spherical substrates. It can be adapted for the industrial
production and application of aligned carbon nanotube arrays with lengths up to
millimeter.
