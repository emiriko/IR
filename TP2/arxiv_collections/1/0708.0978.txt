False discovery rate (FDR) has been widely used as an error measure in large
scale multiple testing problems, but most research in the area has been focused
on procedures for controlling the FDR based on independent test statistics or
the properties of such procedures for test statistics with certain types of
stochastic dependence. Based on an approach proposed in Tang and Zhang (2005),
we further develop in this paper empirical Bayes methods for controlling the
FDR with dependent data. We implement our methodology in a time series model
and report the results of a simulation study to demonstrate the advantages of
the empirical Bayes approach.
