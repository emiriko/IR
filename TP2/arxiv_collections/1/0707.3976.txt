Magnetic gates in close proximity to graphene can induce ferromagnetic
correlations. We study the effect of such induced magnetization dependent
Zeeman splittings on the graphene transport properties. We estimate that
induced spin splittings of the order of \Delta ~ 5 meV could be achieved with
the use of magnetic insulator gates, e.g. EuO-gates, deposited on top of
graphene. We demonstrate that such splittings in proximity induced
ferromagnetic graphene could be determined directly from the tunneling
resonances in the linear response conductance, as the top gate creates also a
tunable barrier in the graphene layer. We show how such splittings could also
be determined independently by magnetoresistance measurements in a spin-valve
geometry. Because the spin polarization of the current near the Dirac point
increases with the length of the barrier, long magnetic gates are desirable for
determining \Delta experimentally.
