Quantum theory is applicable, in principle, to both the microscopic and
macroscopic realms. It is therefore worthwhile to investigate whether it is
possible to evolve a quantum-compatible view of the properties and states of
macroscopic objects in everyday thinking. It will allow a realistic
interpretation of quantum theory in a manner directly consistent with the
observations. The construction of such a view will provide a solution to what I
term the observation problem. Toward solving the observation problem, I
identify a category of new objective properties called 'relational properties'
that are (so to speak) in-between primary and secondary properties. We
regularly associate such properties with everyday objects, and I discuss how in
fact these are quantum-compatible. If this relational-property viewpoint could
be worked into quantum theory, it would altogether avoid the measurement
problem, which is an artifact of our current inconsistent (albeit pragmatically
successful) strategy of retaining a classical view of the macroscopic world
while applying quantum theory to the microscopic world. Some implications of
the relational property viewpoint to neurobiological issues underlying
cognition are touched upon.
