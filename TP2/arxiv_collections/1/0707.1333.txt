The failure of Bell's theorem for Clifford algebra valued local variables is
further consolidated by proving that the conditions of remote parameter
independence and remote outcome independence are duly respected within the
recently constructed exact, local realistic model for the EPR-Bohm
correlations. Since the conjunction of these two conditions is equivalent to
the locality condition of Bell, this provides an independent geometric proof of
the local causality of the model, at the level of microstates. In addition to
local causality, the model respects at least seven other conceptual and
operational requirements, arising either from the predictions of quantum
mechanics or the premises of Bell's theorem, including the Malus's law for
sequential spin measurements. Since the agreement between the predictions of
the model and those of quantum mechanics is quantitatively precise in all
respects, the ensemble interpretation of the entangled singlet state becomes
amenable.
