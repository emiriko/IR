The structure function of the vortex lattice of layered superconductor is
calculated to one-loop order. Based on a phenomenological melting criterion
concerning the Debye-Waller factor, we calculate the melting line of the vortex
lattice, and compare our results to Monte Carlo simulation and experiment. We
find that our results are quantitatively in good agreement with the Monte Carlo
results. Moreover, our analytic calculation of the melting line of BSCCO fits
the experiment reasonably well in a temperature range not far from Tc.
