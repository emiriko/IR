Small superconducting grains are discussed in the frameworks of both the
reduced BCS Hamiltonian and the Universal Hamiltonian. It is shown that
fluctuations of electrons in levels far from the Fermi energy dominate
superconducting properties in small and ultrasmall grains. Experimental
consequences related to the spin susceptibility and persistent currents of
grains and rings with weak electron-electron interactions are discussed.
