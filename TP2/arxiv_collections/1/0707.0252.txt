We show that the transformation equation for the tardyon velocity involves
two generic functions which in turn depend on the relative velocity of the
involved reference frames, on the tardyon velocity u and on the polar angle
which define the direction along which the tardyon moves. The same functions
are further involved in the transformation equations for the space-time
coordinates of the same event generated by a moving tardyon and for its
relativistic mass, momentum and energy. Taking the limits of these functions
for u approaching c we obtain exactly the transformation equations for the
space-time coordinates of the same event generated by a photon and for its
momentum and energy. The same procedure works also for the transition from a
plane acoustic wave to an electromagnetic wave.
