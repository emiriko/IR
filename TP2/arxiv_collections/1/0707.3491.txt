We report the observation of a new $D_{sJ}$ meson produced in $B^{+} \to
\bar{D}^{0} D_{sJ} \to \bar{D}^{0} D^{0} K^{+}$. This state has a mass of
$M=2708 \pm 9 ^{+11}_{-10} \rm{MeV}/{\it c}^{2}$, a width $\Gamma = 108 \pm 23
^{+36}_{-31} ~\rm{MeV}/ {\it c}^{2}$ and a $1^{-}$ spin-parity. The results are
based on an analysis of 449 million $B\bar{B}$ events collected at the
$\Upsilon(4S)$ resonance with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy
$e^{+} e^{-}$ collider.
