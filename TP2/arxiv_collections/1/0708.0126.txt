Monte Carlo simulations have been performed to investigate the relaxation of
the L10 long-range order in dimensionally reduced systems. The effect of the
number of (001)-type monatomic layers and of the pair interaction energies on
these kinetics has been examined. The vacancy migration energies have been
deduced from the Arrhenius plots of the relaxation times. A substantial
increase in the migration energy for small film thickness is observed. The
results agree with previous Monte Carlo simulations and with recent
experimental results in L1_0 thin films and multilayers.
