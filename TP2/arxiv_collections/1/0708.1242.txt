Supervised learning deals with the inference of a distribution over an output
or label space $\CY$ conditioned on points in an observation space $\CX$, given
a training dataset $D$ of pairs in $\CX \times \CY$. However, in a lot of
applications of interest, acquisition of large amounts of observations is easy,
while the process of generating labels is time-consuming or costly. One way to
deal with this problem is {\em active} learning, where points to be labelled
are selected with the aim of creating a model with better performance than that
of an model trained on an equal number of randomly sampled points. In this
paper, we instead propose to deal with the labelling cost directly: The
learning goal is defined as the minimisation of a cost which is a function of
the expected model performance and the total cost of the labels used. This
allows the development of general strategies and specific algorithms for (a)
optimal stopping, where the expected cost dictates whether label acquisition
should continue (b) empirical evaluation, where the cost is used as a
performance metric for a given combination of inference, stopping and sampling
methods. Though the main focus of the paper is optimal stopping, we also aim to
provide the background for further developments and discussion in the related
field of active learning.
