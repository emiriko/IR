We consider unitary transformations on a bipartite system A x B. To what
extent entails the ability to transmit information from A to B the ability to
transfer information in the converse direction? We prove a dimension-dependent
lower bound on the classical channel capacity C(A<--B) in terms of the capacity
C(A-->B) for the case that the bipartite unitary operation consists of
controlled local unitaries on B conditioned on basis states on A. This can be
interpreted as a statement on the strength of the inevitable backaction of a
quantum system on its controller.
  If the local operations are given by the regular representation of a finite
group G we have C(A-->B)=log |G| and C(A<--B)=log N where N is the sum over the
degrees of all inequivalent representations. Hence the information deficit
C(A-->B)-C(A<--B) between the forward and the backward capacity depends on the
"non-abelianness" of the control group. For regular representations, the ratio
between backward and forward capacities cannot be smaller than 1/2. The
symmetric group S_n reaches this bound asymptotically. However, for the general
case (without group structure) all bounds must depend on the dimensions since
it is known that the ratio can tend to zero.
