The large magnetic anisotropy in the layered ferromagnet Fe_{1/4}TaS_2 leads
to very sharp reversals of the magnetization $\bf M$ at the coercive field. We
have exploited this feature to measure the anomalous Hall effect (AHE),
focussing on the AHE conductivity $\sigma^A_{xy}$ in the inelastic regime. At
low temperature T (5-50 K), $\sigma^A_{xy}$ is T-independent, consistent with
the Berry-phase/Karplus-Luttinger theory. Above 50 K, we extract an inelastic
AHE conductivity $\sigma^{in}_{xy}$ that scales as the square of $\Delta\rho$
(the T dependent part of the resistivity $\rho$). The term $\sigma^{in}_{xy}$
clarifies the T dependence and sign-reversal of the AHE coefficient R_s(T). We
discuss the possible ubiquity of $\sigma^{in}_{xy}$ in ferromagnets, and ideas
for interpreting its scaling with $(\Delta\rho)^2$. Measurements of the
magnetoresistance (MR) reveal a rich pattern of behavior vs. T and field
tilt-angle. We show that the 2 mechanisms, the anisotropic MR effect and
field-suppression of magnons, account for the intricate MR behavior, including
the bow-tie features caused by the sharp reversals in $\bf M$.
