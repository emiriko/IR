We study the effect of gluon number fluctuations (Pomeron loops) on deep
inelastic scattering (DIS) in the fixed coupling case. We find that the
description of the DIS data is improved once gluon number fluctuations are
included. Also the values of the parameters, like the saturation exponent and
the diffussion coefficient, turn out reasonable and agree with values obtained
from numerical simulations of toy models which take into account fluctuations.
This outcome seems to indicate the evidence of geometric scaling violations,
and a possible implication of gluon number fluctuations, in the DIS data.
However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the scaling violations may also
come from the diffusion part of the solution to the BK-equation, instead of
gluon number fluctuations.
