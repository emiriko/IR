This paper has mainly a pedagogical meaning. Our aim is to demonstrate a
correct general approach for constructing indicative surfaces of higher-rank
tensors. We reconstruct the surfaces of piezo-optic tensor for beta-BaB2O4 and
LiNbO3 crystals, which have been incorrectly presented in our recent papers.
