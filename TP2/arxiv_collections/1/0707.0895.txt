We test a segmentation algorithm, based on the calculation of the
Jensen-Shannon divergence between probability distributions, to two symbolic
sequences of literary and musical origin. The first sequence represents the
successive appearance of characters in a theatrical play, and the second
represents the succession of tones from the twelve-tone scale in a keyboard
sonata. The algorithm divides the sequences into segments of maximal
compositional divergence between them. For the play, these segments are related
to changes in the frequency of appearance of different characters and in the
geographical setting of the action. For the sonata, the segments correspond to
tonal domains and reveal in detail the characteristic tonal progression of such
kind of musical composition.
