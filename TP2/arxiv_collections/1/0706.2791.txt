We introduce a composition of quantum states of a bipartite system which is
based on the reshuffling of density matrices. This non-Abelian product is
associative and stems from the composition of quantum maps acting on a simple
quantum system. It induces a semi-group in the subset of states with maximally
mixed partial traces. Subadditivity of the von Neumann entropy with respect to
this product is proved. It is equivalent to subadditivity of the entropy of
bistochastic maps with respect to their composition, where the entropy of a map
is the entropy of the corresponding state under the Jamiolkowski isomorphism.
Strong dynamical subadditivity of a concatenation of three bistochastic maps is
established. Analogous bounds for the entropy of a composition are derived for
general stochastic maps. In the classical case they lead to new bounds for the
entropy of a product of two stochastic matrices.
