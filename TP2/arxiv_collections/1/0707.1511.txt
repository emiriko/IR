We develop a framework to calculate the density matrix of a pair of photons
emitted in a decay cascade with partial "which path" ambiguity. We describe an
appropriate entanglement distillation scheme which works also for certain
random cascades. The qualitative features of the distilled entanglement are
presented in a two dimensional "phase diagram". The theory is applied to the
quantum tomography of the decay cascade of a biexciton in a semiconductor
quantum dot. Agreement with experiment is obtained.
