Multinucleon transfer reactions in 40Ca+96Zr and 90Zr+208Pb have been
measured at energies close to the Coulomb barrier in a high resolution
gamma-particle coincidence experiment. The large solid angle magnetic
spectrometer PRISMA coupled to the CLARA gamma-array has been employed.
Trajectory reconstruction has been applied for the complete identification of
transfer products. Mass and charge yields, total kinetic energy losses, gamma
transitions of the binary reaction partners, and comparison of data with
semiclassical calculations are reported. Specific transitions in 95Zr populated
in one particle transfer channels are discussed in terms of particle-phonon
couplings. The gamma decays from states in 42Ca in the excitation energy region
expected from pairing vibrations are also observed.
