We review a recently introduced set of N-dimensional quasi-maximally
superintegrable Hamiltonian systems describing geodesic motions, that can be
used to generate "dynamically" a large family of curved spaces. From an
algebraic viewpoint, such spaces are obtained through kinetic energy
Hamiltonians defined on either the sl(2) Poisson coalgebra or a quantum
deformation of it. Certain potentials on these spaces and endowed with the same
underlying coalgebra symmetry have been also introduced in such a way that the
superintegrability properties of the full system are preserved. Several new N=2
examples of this construction are explicitly given, and specific Hamiltonians
leading to spaces of non-constant curvature are emphasized.
