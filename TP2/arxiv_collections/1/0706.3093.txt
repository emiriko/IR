New high resolution data for heat capacity, heat capacity under applied
magnetic fields and resistivity of high quality single crystal of MnSi are
reported. Striking mirror symmetry between temperature derivative of
resistivity and thermal expansion coefficient of MnSi is displayed. Close
similarity between variation of the heat capacity and the temperature
derivative of resistivity through the phase transition is observed. It is shown
that the heat capacity and thermal expansion coefficient of the helical phase
are not influenced by moderate magnetic field.
