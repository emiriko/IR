Machs principle and the principle of relativity have been discussed by H. I.
Hartman and C. Nissim-Sabat in this journal. Several phenomena were said to
violate the principle of relativity as applied to rotating motion. These claims
have recently been contested. However, in neither of these articles have the
general relativistic phenomenon of inertial dragging been invoked, and no
calculation have been offered by either side to substantiate their claims. Here
I discuss the possible validity of the principle of relativity for rotating
motion within the context of the general theory of relativity, and point out
the significance of inertial dragging in this connection. Although my main
points are of a qualitative nature, I also provide the necessary calculations
to demonstrate how these points come out as consequences of the general theory
of relativity
