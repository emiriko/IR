Let N(f) be a number of nodal domains of a random Gaussian spherical harmonic
f of degree n. We prove that as n grows to infinity, the mean of N(f)/n^2 tends
to a positive constant, and that N(f)/n^2 exponentially concentrates around
that constant.
  This result is consistent with predictions made by Bogomolny and Schmit using
a percolation-like model for nodal domains of random Gaussian plane waves.
