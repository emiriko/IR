Ever since the landmark discovery of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs)
in 1993, they have been considered as ideal materials for any kind of
application based on their outstanding properties (e.g. mechanical strength,
thermal conductivity, ultra stability, etc.), and various techniques, including
laser furnace technique, arc discharge technique, and recently, Catalytic
Chemical Vapor Deposition (CCVD) technique, have been developed for the
high-quality macroscopic generation. Recently Hata et al. realized the
macroscopic production after great efforts of many scientists ; however, the
growth mechanisms are still unclear and this incomplete knowledge prevents us
from applying SWNTs to any fields. Here we can partially control the diameter
distribution of SWNTs using Alcohol Catalytic CVD (ACCVD) technique and well
combined catalysts. Their diameter is quite depend on the size of catalyst and
their species, that is why this can be a technique to control SWNTs, and
finally we propose the simple growth model.
