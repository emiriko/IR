It is shown that exact, amplitude-based resummation allows IR-improvement of
the usual DGLAP theory. This results in a new set of kernels, parton
distributions and attendant reduced cross sections, so that the QCD
perturbative result for the respective hadron-hadron or lepton-hadron cross
section is unchanged order-by-order in $\alpha_s$ at large squared-momentum
transfers. We compare these new objects with their usual counter-parts and
illustrate the effects of the IR-improvement in some phenomenological cases of
interest with an eye toward precision applications in LHC physics scenarios.
