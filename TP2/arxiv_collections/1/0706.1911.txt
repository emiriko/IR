We theoretically demonstrate the formation of different kinds of
two-dimensional split-ring arrays in both triangular and square lattices by
one-step holographic interference. The slit width of the split-ring can be
adjusted by proper polarization configurations. The dimension of the rings can
be adjusted easily by using different wavelengths for interference, so the
resonant frequency of the split-rings can be obtained in a wide range. Our
theory is also proved in experiment. Our work would extend the application of
holographic lithography to the fabrication of magnetic metamaterials.
