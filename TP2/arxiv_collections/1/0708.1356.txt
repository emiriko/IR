A quantum control landscape is defined as the physical objective as a
function of the control variables to be optimized. Analyzing the topology of
these landscapes is important for understanding the origins of the increasing
number of laboratory successes in the optimal control of quantum processes.
This paper proposes a simple scheme to compute the characteristics of the
critical topology of the quantum ensemble control landscapes for observables,
showing that the set of disjoint critical submanifolds one-to-one corresponds
to a finite number of contingency tables that solely depend on the degeneracy
structure of the eigenvalues of the initial system density matrix and the
observable to be controlled. The landscape characteristics can be calculated as
functions of the table entries, including the dimensions and the numbers of
positive and negative eigenvalues of the Hessian quadratic form of each of the
connected components of the critical submanifolds. Typical examples are given
to illustrate the effectiveness of this method.
