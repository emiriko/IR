The paper presents a unified approach to different fluctuation relations for
classical nonequilibrium dynamics described by diffusion processes. Such
relations compare the statistics of fluctuations of the entropy production or
work in the original process to the similar statistics in the time-reversed
process. The origin of a variety of fluctuation relations is traced to the use
of different time reversals. It is also shown how the application of the
presented approach to the tangent process describing the joint evolution of
infinitesimally close trajectories of the original process leads to a
multiplicative extension of the fluctuation relations.
