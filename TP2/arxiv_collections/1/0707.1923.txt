We report the first observation of photon antibunching in the
photoluminescence from single carbon nanotubes. The emergence of a fast
luminescence decay component under strong optical excitation indicates that
Auger processes are partially responsible for inhibiting two-photon generation.
Additionally, the presence of exciton localization at low temperatures ensures
that nanotubes emit photons predominantly one by one. The fact that multiphoton
emission probability can be smaller than 5% suggests that carbon nanotubes
could be used as a source of single photons for applications in quantum
cryptography.
