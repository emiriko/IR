Using irreversible thermodynamics we show that current-induced spin transfer
torque within a magnetic domain implies spin pumping of current within that
domain. This has experimental implications for samples both with conducting
leads and that are electrically isolated. These results are obtained by
deriving the dynamical equations for two models of non-uniform conducting
magnets: (1) a generic conducting magnet, with net conduction electron density
n and net magnetization $\vec{M}$; and (2) a two-band magnet, with up and down
spins each providing conduction and magnetism. For both models, in regions
where the equilibrium magnetization is non-uniform, voltage gradients can drive
adiabatic and non-adiabatic bulk spin torques. Onsager relations then ensure
that magnetic torques likewise drive adiabatic and non-adiabatic currents --
what we call bulk spin pumping. For a given amount of adiabatic and
non-adiabatic spin torque, the two models yield similar but distinct results
for the bulk spin pumping, thus distinguishing the two models. As in the recent
spin-Berry phase study by Barnes and Maekawa, we find that within a domain wall
the ratio of the effective emf to the magnetic field is approximately given by
$P(2\mu_{B}/e)$, where P is the spin polarization. The adiabatic spin torque
and spin pumping terms are shown to be dissipative in nature.
