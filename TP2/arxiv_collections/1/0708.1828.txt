Structure and properties of nanoparticles formed under conditions of wire
electrical explosion were studied. It was shown that the state of WEE power
particles can be characterized as a metastable state. It leads to an increased
stability of nanopowders at normal temperatures and an increased reactivity
during heating, which is revealed in the form of threshold phenomena.
