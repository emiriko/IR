We combine Bethe Ansatz and field theory methods to study the longitudinal
dynamical structure factor S^{zz}(q,omega) for the anisotropic spin-1/2 chain
in the gapless regime. Using bosonization, we derive a low energy effective
model, including the leading irrelevant operators (band curvature terms) which
account for boson decay processes. The coupling constants of the effective
model for finite anisotropy and finite magnetic field are determined exactly by
comparison with corrections to thermodynamic quantities calculated by Bethe
Ansatz. We show that a good approximation for the shape of the on-shell peak of
S^{zz}(q,omega) in the interacting case is obtained by rescaling the result for
free fermions by certain coefficients extracted from the effective Hamiltonian.
In particular, the width of the on-shell peak is argued to scale like delta
omega_{q} ~ q^2 and this prediction is shown to agree with the width of the
two-particle continuum at finite fields calculated from the Bethe Ansatz
equations. An exception to the q^2 scaling is found at finite field and large
anisotropy parameter (near the isotropic point). We also present the
calculation of the high-frequency tail of S^{zz}(q,\omega) in the region delta
omega_{q}<< omega-vq << J using finite-order perturbation theory in the band
curvature terms. Both the width of the on-shell peak and the high-frequency
tail are compared with S^{zz}(q,omega) calculated by Bethe Ansatz for finite
chains using determinant expressions for the form factors and excellent
agreement is obtained. Finally, the accuracy of the form factors is checked
against the exact first moment sum rule and the static structure factor
calculated by Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG).
