A new idea on electrostatic deviation and capture of back-drifting
avalanche-ions in cascaded gaseous hole-multipliers is presented. It involves a
flipped reversed-bias Micro-Hole & Strip Plate (F-R-MHSP) element, the strips
of which are facing the drift region of the multiplier. The ions, originating
from successive multiplication stages, are efficiently deviated and captured by
such electrode. Experimental results are provided comparing the ion-blocking
capability of the F-R-MHSP to that of the reversed-bias Micro-Hole & Strip
Plate (R-MHSP) and the Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM). Best ion-blocking results
in cascaded hole-multipliers were reached with a detector having the F-R-MHSP
as the first multiplication element. A three-element F-R-MHSP/GEM/MHSP cascaded
multiplier operated in atmospheric-pressure Ar/CH4 (95/5), at total gain of
~10^{5}, yielded ion back-flow fractions of 3*10^{-4} and 1.5*10^{-4}, at drift
fields of 0.5 and 0.2 kV/cm, respectively. We describe the F-R-MHSP concept and
the relevance of the obtained ion back-flow fractions to various applications;
further ideas are also discussed.
