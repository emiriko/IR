This work uses density functional molecular dynamics simulations of fluid
helium at high pressure to examine how shock wave experiments with
precompressed samples can help characterizing the interior of giant planets. In
particular, we analyze how large of a precompression is needed to probe a
certain depth in a planet's gas envelope. We find that precompressions of up to
0.1, 1.0, 10, or 100 GPa are needed to characterized 2.5, 5.9, 18, to 63% of
Jupiter's envelope by mass.
