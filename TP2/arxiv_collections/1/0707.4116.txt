In this note we study the first-order Hawking-Page phase transition of
R-charged black hole in truncated Anti-de Sitter space of various dimensions.
This corresponds to confinement/deconfinement phase transition in the dual
gauge field theory with fixed chemical potential. We demonstrate in general
this critical temperature decreases with increasing charge density but with
decreasing IR cutoff.
