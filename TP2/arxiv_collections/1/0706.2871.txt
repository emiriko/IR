Gaugino masses might provide useful information on the underlying scheme of
supersymmetry breaking as they are least dependent on the unknown physics
between the TeV scale and the high messenger scale of supersymmetry breaking.
We discuss the pattern of low energy gaugino masses in various schemes of
supersymmetry breaking together with the possibility to determine the gaugino
masses at LHC.
