Utilizing the continuous frequency mode quantization scheme, we study from
first principle the efficiency of a feedback scheme that can generate maximally
entangled states of two atoms in an optical cavity through their interactions
with a single input photon. The spectral function of the photon emitted from
the cavity, which will be used as the input of the next round in the feedback
process, is obtained analytically. We find that the spectral function of the
photon is modified in each round and deviates from the original one. The
efficiency of the feedback scheme consequently deteriorates gradually after
several rounds of operation.
