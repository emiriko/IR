We study the Casimir effect at finite temperature for a massless scalar field
in the parallel plates geometry in N spatial dimensions, under various
combinations of Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions on the plates. We
show that in all these cases the entropy, in the limit where energy
equipartitioning applies, is a geometrical factor whose sign determines the
sign of the Casimir force.
