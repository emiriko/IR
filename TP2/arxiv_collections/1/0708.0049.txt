This paper describes the design of near-field focusing plates, which are
grating-like structures that can focus electromagnetic radiation to spots or
lines of arbitrarily small subwavelength dimension. A general procedure is
outlined for designing a near-field plate given a desired image, and its
implementation at microwave frequencies is discussed. Full-wave (method of
moments) simulations clearly demonstrate the near-field plate's ability to
overcome the diffraction limit. Finally, it is shown that the performance of
near-field plates is weakly affected by losses.
