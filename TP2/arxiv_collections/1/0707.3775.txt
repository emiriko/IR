Site-specific recombination on supercoiled circular DNA yields a variety of
knotted or catenated products. We develop a model of this process, and give
extensive experimental evidence that the assumptions of our model are
reasonable. We then characterize all possible knot or catenane products that
arise from the most common substrates. We apply our model to tightly prescribe
the knot or catenane type of previously uncharacterized data.
