The notion of weak measurement provides a formalism for extracting
information from a quantum system in the limit of vanishing disturbance to its
state. Here we extend this formalism to the measurement of sequences of
observables. When these observables do not commute, we may obtain information
about joint properties of a quantum system that would be forbidden in the usual
strong measurement scenario. As an application, we provide a physically
compelling characterisation of the notion of counterfactual quantum
computation.
