In this paper, we propose a THz probe technique to obtain spatially resolved
information about the electronic spectra inside nanowire-based FETs. This
spectroscopic approach employs a segmented multi-gate design for the local
detection of quantum transitions between few-electron states within the FET
channel. We simulate the intra-band THz response of such devices by means of a
many-body quantum approach, taking quantization and Coulomb interaction effects
into account. The obtained simulation results demonstrate the capabilities of
the proposed technique which go beyond the limitations of standard
characterization methods.
