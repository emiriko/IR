A system of partial differential equations describing the spatial
oscillations of an Euler-Bernoulli beam with a tip mass is considered. The
linear system considered is actuated by two independent controls and separated
into a pair of differential equations in a Hilbert space. A feedback control
ensuring strong stability of the equilibrium in the sense of Lyapunov is
proposed. The proof of the main result is based on the theory of strongly
continuous semigroups.
