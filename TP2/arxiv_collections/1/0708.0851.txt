We explore the possibility to manipulate massive, i.e. motional, degrees of
freedom of trapped ions. In particular, we demonstrate that, if local control
of the trapping frequencies is achieved, one can reproduce the full toolbox of
linear optics on radial modes. Furthermore, assuming only global control of the
trapping potential, we show that unprecedented degrees of continuous variable
entanglement can be obtained and that nonlocality tests with massive degrees of
freedom can be carried out.
