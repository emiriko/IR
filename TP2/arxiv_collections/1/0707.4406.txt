We investigate quantum transport in a normal/superconductor graphene
heterostructure, including the possibility of an anisotropic pairing potential
in the superconducting region. We find that under certain circumstances, the
conductance displays an undamped, oscillatory behaviour as a function of
applied bias voltage. Also, we investigate how the conductance spectra are
affected by a d-wave pairing symmetry. These results combine unusual features
of the electronic structure of graphene with the unconventional pairing
symmetry found for instance in high-T_c superconductors.
