Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) calculations on 4-leg t-J and
Hubbard ladders have found a phase exhibiting "stripes" at intermediate doping.
Such behavior can be viewed as generalized Friedel oscillations, with
wavelength equal to the inverse hole density, induced by the open boundary
conditions. So far, this phase has not been understood using the conventional
weak coupling bosonization approach. Based on studies from a general
bosonization proof, finite size spectrum, an improved analysis of weak coupling
renormalization group equations and the decoupled 2-leg ladders limit, we here
find new types of phases of 4-leg ladders which exhibit "stripes". They also
inevitably exhibit "bipairing", meaning that there is a gap to add 1 or 2
electrons (but not 4) and that both single electron and electron pair
correlation functions decay exponentially while correlation functions of charge
4 operators exhibit power-law decay. Whether or not bipairing occurs in the
stripe phase found in DMRG is an important open question.
