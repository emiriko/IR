A review of recent analyses on semileptonic decays of B mesons into charmed
final states is given. |Vcb| is extracted both by the Babar and the Belle
collaboration from their datasets using inclusively and exclusively
reconstructed final states.
  In addition there are recent results on the determination of exclusive
branching fractions to the ground states D and D*, as well as to excited D**
states. Those play an important role in understanding the composition of the
total decay width. They represent also a sizable fraction of the backgrounds
for exclusive analyses and are presented here as well.
