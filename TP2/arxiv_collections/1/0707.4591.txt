In this paper we give an exact analytic solution for tachyon condensation in
the modified (picture 0) cubic superstring field theory. We prove the absence
of cohomology and, crucially, reproduce the correct value for the D-brane
tension. The solution is surprising for two reasons: First, the existence of a
tachyon vacuum in this theory has not been definitively established in the
level expansion. Second, the solution {\it vanishes} in the GSO$(-)$ sector,
implying a ``tachyon vacuum'' solution exists even for a {\it BPS} D-brane.
