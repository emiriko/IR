We study the global dynamical behavior of spatially homogeneous solutions of
the Einstein equations in Bianchi type I symmetry, where we use non-tilted
elastic matter as an anisotropic matter model that naturally generalizes
perfect fluids. Based on our dynamical systems formulation of the equations we
are able to prove that (i) toward the future all solutions isotropize; (ii)
toward the initial singularity all solutions display oscillatory behavior;
solutions do not converge to Kasner solutions but oscillate between different
Kasner states. This behavior is associated with energy condition violation as
the singularity is approached.
