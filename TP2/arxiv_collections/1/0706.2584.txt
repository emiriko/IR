We consider superconductivity nucleation in multiply connected mesoscopic
samples such as thin-walled cylinders or rings placed in electrical contact
with a ferromagnet. The superconducting critical temperature and order
parameter structure are studied on the basis of linearized Usadel equations. We
suggest a mechanism of switching between the superconducting states with
different vorticities caused by the exchange field and associated with the
oscillatory behavior of the Cooper pair wave function in a ferromagnet.
