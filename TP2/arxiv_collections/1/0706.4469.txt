We develop the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) technique for
numerically studying incompressible fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states on the
sphere. We calculate accurate estimates for ground state energies and
excitationgaps at FQH filling fractions \nu=1/3 and \nu=5/2 for systems that
are almost twice as large as the largest ever studied by exact diagonalization.
We establish, by carefully comparing with existing numerical results on smaller
systems, that DMRG is a highly effective numerical tool for studying
incompressible FQH states.
