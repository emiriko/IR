We have measured the low-temperature specific heat of the geometrically
frustrated pyrochlore Heisenberg antiferromagnet Gd2Sn2O7 in zero magnetic
field. The specific heat is found to drop exponentially below approximately 350
mK. This provides evidence for a gapped spin-wave spectrum due to an anisotropy
resulting from single ion effects and long-range dipolar interactions. The data
are well fitted by linear spin-wave theory, ruling out unconventional low
energy magnetic excitations in this system, and allowing a determination of the
pertinent exchange interactions in this material.
