We studied the non-equilibrium dynamics of the q-state Potts model in the
square lattice, after a quench to sub-critical temperatures. By means of a
continuous time Monte Carlo algorithm (non-conserved order parameter dynamics)
we analyzed the long term behavior of the energy and relaxation time for a wide
range of quench temperatures and system sizes. For q>4 we found the existence
of different dynamical regimes, according to quench temperature range. At low
(but finite) temperatures and very long times the Lifshitz-Allen-Cahn domain
growth behavior is interrupted with finite probability when the system stuck in
highly symmetric non-equilibrium metastable states, which induce activation in
the domain growth, in agreement with early predictions of Lifshitz [JETP 42,
1354 (1962)]. Moreover, if the temperature is very low, the system always gets
stuck at short times in a highly disordered metastable states with finite life
time, which have been recently identified as glassy states. The finite size
scaling properties of the different relaxation times involved, as well as their
temperature dependency are analyzed in detail.
