We use recently introduced three-point dynamic susceptibilities to obtain an
experimental determination of the temperature evolution of the number of
molecules, N_corr, that are dynamically correlated during the structural
relaxation of supercooled liquids. We first discuss in detail the physical
content of three-point functions that relate the sensitivity of the averaged
two-time dynamics to external control parameters (such as temperature or
density), as well as their connection to the more standard four-point dynamic
susceptibility associated with dynamical heterogeneities. We then demonstrate
that these functions can be experimentally determined with a good precision. We
gather available data to obtain the temperature dependence of N_corr for a
large number of supercooled liquids over a wide range of relaxation timescales
from the glass transition up to the onset of slow dynamics. We find that N_corr
systematically grows when approaching the glass transition. It does so in a
modest manner close to the glass transition, which is consistent with an
activation-based picture of the dynamics in glassforming materials. For higher
temperatures, there appears to be a regime where N_corr behaves as a power-law
of the relaxation time. Finally, we find that the dynamic response to density,
while being smaller than the dynamic response to temperature, behaves
similarly, in agreement with theoretical expectations.
