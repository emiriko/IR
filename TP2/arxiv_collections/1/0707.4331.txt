Twisted torus links are given by twisting a subset of strands on a closed
braid representative of a torus link. T--links are a natural generalization,
given by repeated positive twisting. We establish a one-to-one correspondence
between positive braid representatives of Lorenz links and T--links, so Lorenz
links and T--links coincide. Using this correspondence, we identify over half
of the simplest hyperbolic knots as Lorenz knots. We show that both hyperbolic
volume and the Mahler measure of Jones polynomials are bounded for infinite
collections of hyperbolic Lorenz links. The correspondence provides unexpected
symmetries for both Lorenz links and T-links, and establishes many new results
for T-links, including new braid index formulas.
