The Euler's equations describe the motion of inviscid fluid. In the case of
shallow water, when a perturbative asymtotic expansion of the Euler's equations
is taken (to a certain order of smallness of the scale parameters), relations
to certain integrable equations emerge. Some recent results concerning the use
of integrable equation in modeling the motion of shallow water waves are
reviewed in this contribution.
