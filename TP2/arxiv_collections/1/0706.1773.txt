In this paper we study the confluence of two regular singular points of the
hypergeometric equation into an irregular one. We study the consequence of the
divergence of solutions at the irregular singular point for the unfolded
system. Our study covers a full neighborhood of the origin in the confluence
parameter space. In particular, we show how the divergence of solutions at the
irregular singular point explains the presence of logarithmic terms in the
solutions at a regular singular point of the unfolded system. For this study,
we consider values of the confluence parameter taken in two sectors covering
the complex plane. In each sector, we study the monodromy of a first integral
of a Riccati system related to the hypergeometric equation. Then, on each
sector, we include the presence of logarithmic terms into a continuous
phenomenon and view a Stokes multiplier related to a 1-summable solution as the
limit of an obstruction that prevents a pair of eigenvectors of the monodromy
operators, one at each singular point, to coincide.
