We propose using semiconductor quantum dots for a simulation of chemical
reactions as electrons are redistributed among such artificial atoms. We show
that it is possible to achieve various reaction regimes and obtain different
reaction products by varying the speed of voltage changes applied to the gates
forming quantum dots. Considering the simplest possible reaction, $H_2+H\to
H+H_2$, we show how the necessary initial state can be obtained and what
voltage pulses should be applied to achieve a desirable final product. Our
calculations have been performed using the Pechukas gas approach, which can be
extended for more complicated reactions.
