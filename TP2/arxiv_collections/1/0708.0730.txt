In this talk, I review the effective theory approach to unstable particle
production and present results of a calculation of the process e- e+ ->mu-
nubar_mu u dbar X near the W-pair production threshold up to next-to-leading
order in GammaW/MW ~ alpha ~ v^2. The remaining theoretical uncertainty and the
impact on the measurement of the W mass is discussed.
