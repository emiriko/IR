We study the entropy of Schwarzschild black holes on DGP brane. The radius of
event horizon on DGP brane is obtained by a numerical method. It is smaller
than that of Einstein gravity in the conventional branch, and is larger in the
accelerated branch. However, the difference is very small. The entropy of the
black hole is calculated by using the improved brick-wall method.
