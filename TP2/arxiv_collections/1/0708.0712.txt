The next generation of virtual environments for training is oriented towards
collaborative aspects. Therefore, we have decided to enhance our platform for
virtual training environments, adding collaboration opportunities and
integrating humanoids. In this paper we put forward a model of humanoid that
suits both virtual humans and representations of real users, according to
collaborative training activities. We suggest adaptations to the scenario model
of our platform making it possible to write collaborative procedures. We
introduce a mechanism of action selection made up of a global repartition and
an individual choice. These models are currently being integrated and validated
in GVT, a virtual training tool for maintenance of military equipments,
developed in collaboration with the French company NEXTER-Group.
