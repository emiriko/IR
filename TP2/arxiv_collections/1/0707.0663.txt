Cobalt nanowires with a diameter in the range between 50 to 100nm can be
prepared as single-crystal wires with the easy axis (the c-axis) perpendicular
to the wire axis. The competition between the crystal anisotropy and
demagnetization energy frustrates the magnetization direction. A periodic
modulation of the angle between M and the wire axis yields a lower energy.
