We demonstrate a simple method to improve the Lewenstein model for the
description of high-order harmonic generation (HHG). It is shown that HHG
spectra can be expressed as the product of a returning electron wave packet and
the photo-recombination cross sections, where the former can be extracted from
the Lewenstein model. By replacing plane waves with scattering waves in the
calculation of recombination matrix elements, we showed that the resulting HHG
spectra agree well with those from solving the time-dependent Schr\"odinger
equation. The improved model can be used for quantitative calculations of high
harmonics generated by molecules.
