We present a model for inclusive electron and neutrino scattering off nuclei
paying special attention to the influence of in-medium effects on the
quasi-elastic scattering and pion-production mechanisms. Our results for
electron scattering off Oxygen are compared to experimental data at beam
energies ranging from 0.7-1.5 GeV. The good description of electron scattering
serves as a benchmark for neutrino scattering.
