Solutions for the amplitudes that give accurate description of pp and p-pbar
scattering at high energies are investigated, with particular attention given
to the properties of their zeros and slopes, whose determination is required
for the study of the Coulomb interference region. Proper extrapolations of
these quantities to the LHC energies are important for the analysis of the
forthcoming experiments.
