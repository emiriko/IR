We demonstrate two patterning techniques based on hydrogen passivation of
Ga1-xMnxAs to produce isolated ferromagnetically active regions embedded
uniformly in a paramagnetic, insulating host. The first method consists of
selective hydrogenation of Ga1-xMnxAs by lithographic masking. Magnetotransport
measurements of Hall-bars made in this manner display the characteristic
properties of the hole-mediated ferromagnetic phase, which result from good
pattern isolation. Arrays of Ga1-xMnxAs dots as small as 250 nm across have
been realized by this process. The second process consists of blanket
hydrogenation of Ga1-xMnxAs followed by local reactivation using confined
low-power pulsed-laser annealing. Conductance imaging reveals local electrical
reactivation of micrometer-sized regions that accompanies the restoration of
ferromagnetism. The spatial resolution achievable with this method can
potentially reach <100 nm by employing near-field laser processing. The high
spatial resolution attainable by hydrogenation patterning enables the
development of systems with novel functionalities such as lateral
spin-injection as well as the exploration of magnetization dynamics in
individual and coupled structures made from this novel class of semiconductors.
