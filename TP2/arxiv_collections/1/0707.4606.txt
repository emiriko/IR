Combining the density functional theory (DFT) and the Gutzwiller variational
approach, a LDA+Gutzwiller method is developed to treat the correlated electron
systems from {\it ab-initio}. All variational parameters are self-consistently
determined from total energy minimization. The method is computationally
cheaper, yet the quasi-particle spectrum is well described through kinetic
energy renormalization. It can be applied equally to the systems from weakly
correlated metals to strongly correlated insulators. The calculated results for
SrVO$_3$, Fe, Ni and NiO, show dramatic improvement over LDA and LDA+U.
