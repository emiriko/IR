We present a second-order accurate method to include arbitrary distributions
of force densities in the lattice Boltzmann formulation of hydrodynamics. Our
method may be used to represent singular force densities arising either from
momentum-conserving internal forces or from external forces which do not
conserve momentum. We validate our method with several examples involving point
forces and find excellent agreement with analytical results. A minimal model
for dilute sedimenting particles is presented using the method which promises a
substantial gain in computational efficiency.
