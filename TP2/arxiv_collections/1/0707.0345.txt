We study thermal effects at the depinning transition by numerical simulations
of driven one-dimensional elastic interfaces in a disordered medium. We find
that the velocity of the interface, evaluated at the critical depinning force,
can be correctly described with the power law $v\sim T^\psi$, where $\psi$ is
the thermal exponent. Using the sample-dependent value of the critical force,
we precisely evaluate the value of $\psi$ directly from the temperature
dependence of the velocity, obtaining the value $\psi = 0.15 \pm 0.01$. By
measuring the structure factor of the interface we show that both the
thermally-rounded and the T=0 depinning, display the same large-scale geometry,
described by an identical divergence of a characteristic length with the
velocity $\xi \propto v^{-\nu/\beta}$, where $\nu$ and $\beta$ are respectively
the T=0 correlation and depinning exponents. We discuss the comparison of our
results with previous estimates of the thermal exponent and the direct
consequences for recent experiments on magnetic domain wall motion in
ferromagnetic thin films.
