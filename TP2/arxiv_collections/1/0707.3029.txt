The thermal expansion of the heavy fermion compound CeRh2Si2 has been
measured under pressure as a function of temperature using strain gages. A
large anomaly associated to the Neel temperature has been detected even above
the suspected critical pressure Pc = 1.05 GPa where no indication of
antiferromagnetism has been observed in calorimetry experiments sensitive to
the entropy change. An unexpected feature is the pressure slowdown of the
antiferromagnetic-paramagnetic transition by comparison to the fast pressure
collapse predicted for homogeneous first order quantum phase transition with
one unique pressure singularity at Pc. A large pressure dependance is observed
in the anisotropy of the thermal expansion measured parallel or perpendicular
to the c axis of this tetragonal crystal. The Fermi surface reconstruction
associated to the first order transition produces quite different pressure
response in the transport scattering measured along different crystallographic
directions. A brief discussion is made on other examples of first order quantum
transitions in strongly correlated electronic systems : MnSi and CeCoIn5.
