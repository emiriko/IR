Consider a three dimensional system which looks like a cross-connected pipe
system, i.e. a small sample coupled to a finite number of leads. We investigate
the current running through this system, in the linear response regime, when we
adiabatically turn on an electrical bias between leads. The main technical tool
is the use of a finite volume regularization, which allows us to define the
current coming out of a lead as the time derivative of its charge. We finally
prove that in virtually all physically interesting situations, the conductivity
tensor is given by a Landauer-B{\"u}ttiker type formula.
