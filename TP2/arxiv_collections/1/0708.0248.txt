In the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, neutralinos lighter than 50 GeV
are compatible with all accelerator, precision, and cosmological bounds. Such
neutralinos might constitute a relevant decay channel for the Higgs boson,
modifying its expected signatures at hadron colliders. We study the branching
ratio h --> \chi\chi and determine the region in the supersymmetric parameter
space where it is sizable. We have found that, in fact, the Higgs may
dominantly decay into neutralino pairs. Besides, as a result of this new
channel, the branching ratio into visible modes, such as h --> \gamma\gamma,
gets suppressed.
