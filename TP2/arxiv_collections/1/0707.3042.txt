In a recent work, factorization breaking interactions and T-odd distributions
have been analyzed from the point of view of statistical mechanics. One of the
central points was the process leading from the coherent initial hadron state
to an incoherent set of short-range parton states, in presence of factorization
breaking interactions. This time evolution was named ``partonization'', or also
``de-correlation'', to distinguish it from an ordinary hadron-quark-spectator
splitting vertex. Here an example is shown for a correlation amplitude
describing an extreme case for such a process, where the initial state phases
are lost, but the probability distributions are perfectly conserved. This
requires introducing degrees of freedom that are not normally considered in a
factorized scheme, and that must disappear at some stage of the calculations
for the factorization scheme to survive. The explicit time-evolution character
of the decorrelation process disappears when these degrees of freedom are
integrated, but the integrated correlator presents modified analytical
properties as a consequence. for the factorization scheme to survive. The
explicit time-evolution character of the de-correlation process disappears when
these degrees of freedom are integrated, but the integrated correlator presents
nontrivial analytic properties as a consequence. At certain conditions,
factorization is preserved, at the price of introducing T-odd contributions.
