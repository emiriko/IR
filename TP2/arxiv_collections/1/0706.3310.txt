This work presents the study of some new anomalous electromagnetic effects in
graphite-like thin carbon films. These are: The fast switching (1nanosecond) of
electrical conductivity The detection of microwave radiation and its
temperature dependence The oscillations of film stack magnetization in the
magnetic field of 1-5 T. The optical radiation under process of spasmodic
switching of conductivity Results of magnetic force microscopy (MFM), DC SQUID
magnetization, reversed Josephson effect (RJE), and resistance measurements in
thin carbon arc (CA) films are presented. The observation of a RJE induced
voltage as well as its rf frequency, input amplitude, and temperature
dependence reveals the existence of Josephson-like Junction arrays. Oscillating
behavior of the DC SQUID magnetization reminiscent of the Fraunhofer-like
behavior of superconducting (SC) critical current in the range of 10000-50000
Oe has been observed. The DC SQUID magnetization measurement indicates a
possible elementary 102 nm SC loop; this is compared to MFM direct observations
of magnetic clusters with a median size of 165 nm. The results obtained
provides a basis for non-cryogenic elecrtonic devices utilizing the Josephson
effect.
