The recent discovery of Spin-ice is a spectacular example of non-coplanar
spin arrangements that can arise in the pyrochlore A2B2O7 structure. We present
magnetic and thermodynamic studies on the metallic-ferromagnet pyrochlore
Sm2Mo2O7. Our studies, carried out on oriented crystals, suggest that the Sm
spins have an ordered spin-ice ground state below about T* = 15 K. The
temperature- and field-evolution of the ordered spin-ice state are governed by
an antiferromagnetic coupling between the Sm and Mo spins. We propose that as a
consequence of a robust feature of this coupling, the tetrahedra aligned with
the external field adopt a "1-in, 3-out" spin structure as opposed to "3-in,
1-out" in dipolar spin ices, as the field exceeds a critical value.
