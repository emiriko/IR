Recently Brian Hartwig and the second author found a presentation for the
three-point $sl_2$ loop algebra by generators and relations. To obtain this
presentation they defined a Lie algebra $\boxtimes$ by generators and
relations, and displayed an isomorphism from $\boxtimes$ to the three-point
$sl_2$ loop algebra. In this paper we describe the finite-dimensional
irreducible $\boxtimes$-modules from multiple points of view.
