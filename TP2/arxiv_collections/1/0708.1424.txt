We derive expressions for the charge and spin response function for the
Tomonaga model with quadratic dispersion and arbitrary (but finite for zero
momentum) interaction. For constant interaction these expressions are analytic
and for other types of interaction only a simple matrix has to be diagonalised.
We use a truncated expansion in particle-hole states with and without inclusion
of correlations in the ground state yielding an exact result for pure
intra-band interaction. We also discuss the possibility of power-laws in the
dynamic structure factor for the spinful and spinless model.
