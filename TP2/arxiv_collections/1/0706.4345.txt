We calculate the temperature dependence of NMR relaxation rate and electrical
resistivity for coupling to a local, strongly anharmonic phonon mode. We argue
that the two-phonon Raman process is dominating NMR relaxation. Due to the
strong anharmonicity of the phonon an unusual temperature dependence is found
having a low temperature peak and becoming constant towards higher
temperatures. The electrical resistivity is found to vary like T^2 at low
temperatures and following a sqrt{T} behavior at high temperatures. Both
results are in qualitative agreement with recent observations on
beta-pyrochlore oxide superconductors.
