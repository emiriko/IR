The status of the use of hard probes in heavy ion collisions at RHIC is
reviewed. The discovery of strong jet quenching at RHIC is a major success.
However, in order to make full use of this new phenomenon for full jet emission
tomography of the properties of the collision zone further development is
needed, both experimentally and theoretically.
