A numerical method to solve time-dependent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov equation
is proposed to treat the case with Gogny effective interaction. To check the
feasibility of the method, it is applied to oxygen isotope O20 and small
amplitude oscillations are calculated. The conservation of the nucleon numbers
as well as energy expectation value is demonstrated. The strength distributions
of the small amplitude quadrupole oscillations are also shown.
