Let f(x) be a continuous function from a compact real interval into itself
with a periodic orbit of minimal period m, where m is not an integral power of
2. Then, by Sharkovsky's theorem, for every positive integer n with m \prec n
in the Sharkovsky's ordering defined below, a lower bound on the number of
periodic orbits of f(x) with minimal period n is 1. Could we improve this lower
bound from 1 to some larger number? In this paper, we give a complete answer to
this question.
