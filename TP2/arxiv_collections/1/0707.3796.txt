Hamiltonian and Schrodinger evolution equations on finite-dimensional
projective space are analyzed in detail. Hartree-Fock (HF) manifold is
introduced as a submanifold of many electron projective space of states.
Evolution equations, exact and linearized, on this manifold are studied.
Comparison of matrices of linearized Schrodinger equations on many electron
projective space and on the corresponding HF manifold reveals the appearance in
the HF case a constraining matrix that involves matrix elements of
many-electron Hamiltonian between HF state and double excited determinants.
Character of dependence of transition energies on the matrix elements of
constraining matrix is established by means of perturbation analysis. It is
demonstrated that success of time-dependent HF theory in calculation of
transition energies is mainly due to the wrong behavior of these energies as
functions of matrix elements of constraining matrix as compared with the exact
transition energies
