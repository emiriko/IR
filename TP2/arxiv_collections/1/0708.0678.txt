The response functions for small spatial perturbations of a homogeneous
granular fluid have been described recently. In appropriate dimensionless
variables, they have the form of stationary state time correlation functions.
Here, these functions are expressed in terms of reduced single particle
functions that are expected to obey a linear kinetic equation. The functional
assumption required for such a kinetic equation, and a Markov approximation for
its implementation are discussed. If, in addition, static velocity correlations
are neglected, a granular fluid version of the linearized Enskog kinetic theory
is obtained. The derivation makes no a priori limitation on the density, space
and time scale, nor degree of inelasticity. As an illustration, recently
derived Helfand and Green-Kubo expressions for the Navier-Stokes order
transport coefficients are evaluated with this kinetic theory. The results are
in agreement with those obtained from the Chapman-Enskog solution to the
nonlinear Enskog kinetic equation.
