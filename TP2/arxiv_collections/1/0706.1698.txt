An explicit formula for the chaotic representation of the powers of
increments, (X_{t+t_0}-X_{t_0})^n, of a Levy process is presented. There are
two different chaos expansions of a square integrable functional of a Levy
process: one with respect to the compensated Poisson random measure and the
other with respect to the orthogonal compensated powers of the jumps of the
Levy process. Computationally explicit formulae for both of these chaos
expansions of (X_{t+t_0}-X_{t_0})^n are given in this paper. Simulation results
verify that the representation is satisfactory. The CRP of a number of
financial derivatives can be found by expressing them in terms of
(X_{t+t_0}-X_{t_0})^n using Taylor's expansion.
