Harvesting condensed atmospheric vapour as dew water can be an alternative or
complementary potable water resource in specific arid or insular areas. Such
radiation-cooled condensing devices use already existing flat surfaces (roofs)
or innovative structures with more complex shapes to enhance the dew yield. The
Computational Fluid Dynamic - CFD - software PHOENICS has been programmed and
applied to such radiation cooled condensers. For this purpose, the sky
radiation is previously integrated and averaged for each structure. The
radiative balance is then included in the CFD simulation tool to compare the
efficiency of the different structures under various meteorological parameters,
for complex or simple shapes and at various scales. It has been used to precise
different structures before construction. (1) a 7.32 m^2 funnel shape was
studied; a 30 degree tilted angle (60 degree cone half-angle) was computed to
be the best compromise for funnel cooling. Compared to a 1 m^2 flat condenser,
the cooling efficiency was expected to be improved by 40%. Seventeen months
measurements in outdoor tests presented a 138 % increased dew yield as compared
to the 1 m^2 flat condenser. (2) The simulation results for 5 various condenser
shapes were also compared with experimental measurement on corresponding pilots
systems: 0.16 m^2 flat planar condenser, 1 m^2 and 30 degree tilted planar
condenser, 30 m^2 and 30 degree tilted planar condenser, 255 m^2 multi ridges,
a preliminary construction of a large scale dew plant being implemented in the
Kutch area (Gujarat, India).
