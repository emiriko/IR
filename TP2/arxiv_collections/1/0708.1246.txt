We prove that the Deligne-Lusztig varieties associated to elements of the
Weyl group which are of minimal length in their twisted class are affine. Our
proof differs from the proof of He and Orlik-Rapoport and it is inspired by the
case of regular elements, which correspond to the varieties involved in
Brou\'e's conjectures.
