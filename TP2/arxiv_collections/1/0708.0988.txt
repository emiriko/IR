Students are often mystified by the reasoning that leads from the postulates
of special relativity to the requirement of covariance. This is partly due to
the lack of transparency resulting from the failure to clearly separate the
roles the postulates of the constancy of the speed of light and of relativity
play. Their roles are elucidated here by mainly geometric means. Finally some
standard derivations found in textbooks are analyzed in order to sort out the
basic physical ingredients.
