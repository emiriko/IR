We have developed an experimental device for studying the main mechanism of
dust formation in electric arc furnace steelmaking: the burst of gas bubbles at
the liquid steel surface. As in the case of the air-water system, the
bubble-burst process takes place in three steps: breaking of the film cap,
projection of film drops, and projection of jet drops. The film break and the
jet drop formation are observed with a high-speed video camera. The film drop
aerosol enters a particle counter, which characterizes the drops in size and
number. Results are presented and discussed. The quantification of both types
of projections leads to the conclusion that the film drop projections represent
the major source of dust. The amount of film drops greatly decreases with the
parent bubble size. Bubbles with diameter under 4mm theoretically do not
produce film drops. Decreasing the CO-bubble size enough would therefore
represent an effective solution for reducing drastically the electric arc
furnace dust emission.
