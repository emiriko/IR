We examine the effects of stochastic input currents on the firing behavior of
two excitable neurons coupled with fast excitatory synapses. In such cells
(models), typified by the quadratic integrate and fire model, mutual synaptic
coupling can cause sustained firing or oscillatory behavior which is
necessarily antiphase. Additive Gaussian white noise can transiently terminate
the oscillations, hence destroying the stable limit cycle. Further application
of the noise may return the system to spiking activity. In a particular noise
range, the transition times between the oscillating and the resting state are
strongly asymmetric. We numerically investigate an approximate basin of
attraction, A, of the periodic orbit and use Markov process theory to explain
the firing behavior in terms of the probability of escape of trajectories from
A
