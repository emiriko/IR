Let f and g be nonconstant polynomials over an arbitrary field K. In this
paper we study the intersection of the polynomial rings K[f] and K[g], and in
particular we ask whether this intersection is larger than K. We completely
resolve this question when K has characteristic zero, and in positive
characteristic we present various results, examples, and algorithms.
