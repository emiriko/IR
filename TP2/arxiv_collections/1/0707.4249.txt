In non-equilibrium steady states (NESS) far from equilibrium, it is known
that the Einstein relation is violated. Then, the ratio of the diffusion
coefficient to the mobility is called an effective temperature, and the
physical relevance of this effective temperature has been studied in several
works. Although the physical relevance is not yet completely clear, it has been
found that the role of an effective temperature in NESS is indeed analogous to
that of the temperature in equilibrium systems in a number of respects. In this
paper, we find further evidence establishing this analogy. We employ a
non-equilibrium Langevin system as a thermostat for a Hamiltonian system and
find that the kinetic temperature of this Hamiltonian system is equal to the
effective temperature of the thermostat.
