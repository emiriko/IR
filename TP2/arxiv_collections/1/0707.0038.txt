We give a criterion allowing to verify whether or not two tilted algebras
have the same relation-extension (thus correspond to the same cluster-tilted
algebra). This criterion is in terms of a combinatorial configuration in the
Auslander-Reiten quiver of the cluster-tilted algebra, which we call local
slice.
