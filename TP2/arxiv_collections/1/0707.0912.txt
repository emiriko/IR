It is proposed that light neutrinos form a triplet in a global SU(3) symmetry
in mass eigenstate basis. Assuming that the SU(3)symmetry is broken in the
direction (-alambda_{3}+frac{b}/{sqrt{3}}lambda_{8}), and after going to the
flavor basis we predict atmospheric mixing angle, sin ^{2}theta_{23}=0.5 and
sin theta_{13}=0 if nu_{mu}-nu_{tau} symmetry is assumed. In the flavor basis
the diagonal part of matrix coefficient of b (dominant part) is found to
transform like (lambda_{3}+frac{1}/{sqrt{3}}lambda_{8}). Imposing the same on
matrix coefficient of $a$ fixes solar mixing angle,sin ^{2}theta
_{12}=frac{1}{3}. Implications for neutrinoless double beta-decay are
discussed.
