We consider an unambiguous identification of an unknown coherent state with
one of two unknown coherent reference states. Specifically, we consider two
modes of an electromagnetic field prepared in unknown coherent states alpha_1
and alpha_2, respectively. The third mode is prepared either in the state
alpha_1 or in the state alpha_2. The task is to identify (unambiguously) which
of the two modes are in the same state. We present a scheme consisting of three
beamsplitters capable to perform this task. Although we don't prove the
optimality, we show that the performance of the proposed setup is better than
the generalization of the optimal measurement known for a finite-dimensional
case. We show that a single beamsplitter is capable to perform an unambiguous
quantum state comparison for coherent states optimally. Finally we propose an
experimental setup consisting of 2N-1 beamsplitters for unambiguous
identification among N unknown coherent states. This setup can be considered as
a search in a quantum database. The elements of the database are unknown
coherent states encoded in different modes of an electromagnetic field. The
task is to specify the two modes that are excited in the same, though unknown,
coherent state.
