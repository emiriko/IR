We examine how the generation and propagation of high-order harmonics in a
partly ionized gas medium affect their strength and synchronization. The
temporal properties of the resulting attosecond pulses generated in long gas
targets can be significantly influenced by macroscopic effects, in particular
by the intensity in the medium and the degree of ionization. Under some
conditions, the use of gas targets longer than the absorption length can lead
to the generation of self-compressed attosecond pulses. We show this effect
experimentally, using long argon-filled gas cells as generating medium.
