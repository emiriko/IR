We study radiative gravitino decay within the framework of R-violating
supersymmetry. For trilinear R-violating couplings that involve the third
generation of fermions, or for light gravitinos, we find that the radiative
loop-decay $\tilde{G} \to \gamma \nu$ dominates over the tree-level ones for a
wide set of parameters. We calculate the gravitino decay width and study its
implications for cosmology and collider physics. Slow-decaying gravitinos are
good dark matter candidates, for a range of parameters that would also predict
observable R-violating signatures in colliders. In general the branching ratios
are very dependent on the relative hierarchies of R-violating operators, and
may provide relevant information on the flavour structure of the underlying
fundamental theory.
