We studied the circular polarization and angular dependences of the
magneto-photoluminescence spectra of the free A-exciton 1S state in wurtzite
ZnO at T = 5 K. The circular polarization properties of the spectra clearly
indicate that the top valence band has Gamma_7 symmetry. The out-of-plane
component of the magnetic field, which is parallel to the sample's c axis,
leads to linear Zeeman splitting of both the dipole-allowed Gamma_5 exciton
state and the weakly allowed Gamma_1/Gamma_2 exciton states. The in-plane
field, which is perpendicular to the c axis, increases the oscillator strength
of the weak Gamma_1/Gamma_2 states by forming a mixed exciton state.
