We study an evolutionary algorithm that locally adapts thresholds and wiring
in Random Threshold Networks, based on measurements of a dynamical order
parameter. A control parameter $p$ determines the probability of threshold
adaptations vs. link rewiring. For any $p < 1$, we find spontaneous symmetry
breaking into a new class of self-organized networks, characterized by a much
higher average connectivity $\bar{K}_{evo}$ than networks without threshold
adaptation ($p =1$). While $\bar{K}_{evo}$ and evolved out-degree distributions
are independent from $p$ for $p <1$, in-degree distributions become broader
when $p \to 1$, approaching a power-law. In this limit, time scale separation
between threshold adaptions and rewiring also leads to strong correlations
between thresholds and in-degree. Finally, evidence is presented that networks
converge to self-organized criticality for large $N$.
