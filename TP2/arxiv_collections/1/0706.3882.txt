We study roughness scaling of the outer surface and the internal porous
structure of deposits generated with the three-dimensional bidisperse ballistic
deposition (BBD), in which particles of two sizes are randomly deposited.
Systematic extrapolation of roughness and dynamical exponents and the
comparison of roughness distributions indicate that the top surface has
Kardar-Parisi-Zhang scaling for any ratio F of the flux between large and small
particles. A scaling theory predicts the characteristic time of the crossover
from random to correlated growth in BBD and provides relations between the
amplitudes of roughness scaling and F in the KPZ regime. The porosity of the
deposits monotonically increases with F and scales as F^{1/2} for small F,
which is also explained by the scaling approach and illustrates the possibility
of connecting surface growth rules and bulk properties. The suppression of
relaxation mechanisms in BBD enhances the connectivity of the deposits when
compared to other ballisticlike models, so that they percolate down to F~0.05.
The fractal dimension of the internal surface of the percolating deposits is
D_F~2.9, which is very close to the values in other ballisticlike models and
suggests universality among these systems.
