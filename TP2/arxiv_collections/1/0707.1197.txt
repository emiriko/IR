We present [1] the first simultaneous extraction of the transversity
distribution and the Collins fragmentation function, obtained through a
combined analysis of experimental data on azimuthal asymmetries in
semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering (SIDIS), from the HERMES and COMPASS
Collaborations, and in e+ e- --> h1 h2 X processes, from the Belle
Collaboration.
