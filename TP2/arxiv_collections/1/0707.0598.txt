The discriminant-analysis method has been applied to optimize the exotic-beam
charge recognition in a projectile fragmentation experiment. The experiment was
carried out at the GSI using the fragment separator (FRS) to produce and select
the relativistic secondary beams, and the ALADIN setup to measure their
fragmentation products following collisions with Sn target nuclei. The beams of
neutron poor isotopes around 124La and 107Sn were selected to study the isospin
dependence of the limiting temperature of heavy nuclei by comparing with
results for stable 124Sn projectiles. A dedicated detector to measure the
projectile charge upstream of the reaction target was not used, and alternative
methods had to be developed. The presented method, based on the multivariate
discriminant analysis, allowed to increase the efficacy of charge recognition
up to about 90%, which was about 20% more than achieved with the simple scalar
methods.
