We show that the recently postulated non-standard definition of work
proportional to force variation rather than to displacement [A. Imparato and L.
Peliti, cond-mat arXiv:0706.1134v1] is thermodynamically inconsistent at both
microscopic and macroscopic scales and leads to non-physical results, including
free energy changes that depend on arbitrary parameters.
