The kinematic properties of mechanisms are well known by the researchers and
teachers. The theory based on the study of Jacobian matrices allows us to
explain, for example, the singular configuration. However, in many cases, the
physical sense of such properties is difficult to explain to students. The aim
of this article is to use haptic feedback to render to the user the
signification of different kinematic indices. The framework uses a Phantom Omni
and a serial and parallel mechanism with two degrees of freedom. The
end-effector of both mechanisms can be moved either by classical mouse, or
Phantom Omni with or without feedback.
