Suitable shaping (in particular, flattening and broadening) of the laser beam
has recently been proposed as an effective device to reduce internal (mirror)
thermal noise in advanced gravitational wave interferometric detectors. Based
on some recently published analytic approximations (valid in the
infinite-test-mass limit) for the Brownian and thermoelastic mirror noises in
the presence of arbitrary-shaped beams, this paper addresses certain
preliminary issues related to the optimal beam-shaping problem. In particular,
with specific reference to the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave
Observatory (LIGO) experiment, absolute and realistic lower-bounds for the
various thermal noise constituents are obtained and compared with the current
status (Gaussian beams) and trends ("mesa" beams), indicating fairly ample
margins for further reduction. In this framework, the effective dimension of
the related optimization problem, and its relationship to the critical design
parameters are identified, physical-feasibility and model-consistency issues
are considered, and possible additional requirements and/or prior information
exploitable to drive the subsequent optimization process are highlighted.
