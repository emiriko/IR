The degeneracy of quarter BPS dyons in N=4 supersymmetric string theories is
known to jump across walls of marginal stability on which a quarter BPS dyon
can decay into a pair of half BPS dyons. We show that as long as the electric
and magnetic charges of the original dyon are primitive elements of the charge
lattice, the subspaces of the moduli space on which a quarter BPS dyon becomes
marginally unstable against decay into a pair of quarter BPS dyons or a half
BPS dyon and a quarter BPS dyon are of codimension two or more. As a result any
pair of generic points in the moduli space can be connected by a path avoiding
these subspaces and there is no jump in the spectrum associated with these
subspaces.
