Chemical reactions in cell are subject to intense stochastic fluctuations. An
important question is how the fundamental physiological behavior of cell is
kept stable against those noisy perturbations. In this paper a stochastic model
of cell cycle of budding yeast is constructed to analyze the effects of noise
on the cell cycle oscillation. The model predicts intense noise in levels of
mRNAs and proteins, and the simulated protein levels explain the observed
statistical tendency of noise in populations of synchronous and asynchronous
cells. In spite of intense noise in levels of proteins and mRNAs, cell cycle is
stable enough to bring the largely perturbed cells back to the physiological
cyclic oscillation. The model shows that consecutively appearing fixed points
are the origin of this stability of cell cycle.
