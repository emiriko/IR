Within constrained minimal-flavor-violation the large destructive
flavor-changing Z-penguin managed to survive eradication so far. We give a
incisive description of how to kill it using the precision measurements of the
Z -> b anti-b pseudo observables. The derived stringent range for the
non-standard contribution to the universal Inami-Lim function C leads to tight
two-sided limits for the branching ratios of all Z-penguin dominated
flavor-changing K- and B-decays.
