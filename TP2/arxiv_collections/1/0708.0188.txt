The electronic structures of CeRhSn and CeRuSn are self-consistently
calculated within density functional theory using the local spin density
approximation for exchange and correlation. In agreement with experimental
findings, the analyses of the electronic structures and of the chemical bonding
properties point to the absence of magnetization within the mixed valent Rh
based system while a finite magnetic moment is observed for trivalent cerium
within the Ru-based stannide, which contains both trivalent and intermediate
valent Ce.
