Given a sample covariance matrix, we examine the problem of maximizing the
variance explained by a linear combination of the input variables while
constraining the number of nonzero coefficients in this combination. This is
known as sparse principal component analysis and has a wide array of
applications in machine learning and engineering. We formulate a new
semidefinite relaxation to this problem and derive a greedy algorithm that
computes a full set of good solutions for all target numbers of non zero
coefficients, with total complexity O(n^3), where n is the number of variables.
We then use the same relaxation to derive sufficient conditions for global
optimality of a solution, which can be tested in O(n^3) per pattern. We discuss
applications in subset selection and sparse recovery and show on artificial
examples and biological data that our algorithm does provide globally optimal
solutions in many cases.
