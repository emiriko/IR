We develop analytical methods for nonlinear Dirac equations. Examples of such
equations include Dirac-harmonic maps with curvature term and the equations
describing the generalized Weierstrass representation of surfaces in
three-manifolds. We provide the key analytical steps, i.e., small energy
regularity and removable singularity theorems and energy identities for
solutions.
