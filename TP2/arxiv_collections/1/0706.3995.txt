We investigate the stability of an attractive Bose-Einstein condensate in a
moving 1D optical lattice in the presence of transverse confinement. By means
of a Bogoliubov linear stability analysis we find that the system is
dynamically unstable for low quasimomenta and becomes stable near the band
edge, in a specular fashion with respect to the repulsive case. For low
interactions the instability occurs via long wavelength excitations that are
not sufficient for spoiling the condensate coherence, producing instead an
oscillating density pattern both in real and momentum space. This behaviour is
illustrated by simulations for the expansion of the condensate in a moving
lattice.
