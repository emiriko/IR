We consider the expectation value of a Polyakov loop in 3d SU(2) lattice
Yang--Mills theory and transform it to the dual representation in terms of sums
over spins. The spin dependence of the amplitudes is computed explicitly by a
graphical method. We also determine the asymptotic (large spin) limit of the
amplitude factors.
