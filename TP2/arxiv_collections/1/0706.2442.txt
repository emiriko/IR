We have prepared magnetic graphite samples bombarded by protons at low
temperatures and low fluences to attenuate the large thermal annealing produced
during irradiation. An overall optimization of sample handling allowed us to
find Curie temperatures $ T_c \gtrsim 350$ K at the used fluences. The
magnetization versus temperature shows unequivocally a linear dependence, which
can be interpreted as due to excitations of spin waves in a two dimensional
Heisenberg model with a weak uniaxial anisotropy.
