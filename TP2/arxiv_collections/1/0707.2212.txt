An all-optically driven strategy to govern a liquid crystalline collective
molecular nonlinear oscillator is discussed. It does not require external
feedbacks of any kind while the oscillator and a time-depending perturbation
both are sustained by incident light. Various dynamical regimes such as
frequency -locked, quasiperiodic, forced and chaotic are observed in agreement
with a theoretical approach developed in the limit of the plane wave
approximation.
