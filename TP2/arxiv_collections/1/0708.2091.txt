We study theoretically electron spins in nanowire quantum dots placed inside
a transmission line resonator. Because of the spin-orbit interaction, the spins
couple to the electric component of the resonator electromagnetic field and
enable coherent manipulation, storage, and read-out of quantum information in
an all-electrical fashion. Coupling between distant quantum-dot spins, in one
and the same or different nanowires, can be efficiently performed via the
resonator mode either in real time or through virtual processes. For the latter
case we derive an effective spin-entangling interaction and suggest means to
turn it on and off. We consider both transverse and longitudinal types of
nanowire quantum-dots and compare their manipulation timescales against the
spin relaxation times. For this, we evaluate the rates for spin relaxation
induced by the nanowire vibrations (phonons) and show that, as a result of
phonon confinement in the nanowire, this rate is a strongly varying function of
the spin operation frequency and thus can be drastically reduced compared to
lateral quantum dots in GaAs. Our scheme is a step forward to the formation of
hybrid structures where qubits of different nature can be integrated in a
single device.
