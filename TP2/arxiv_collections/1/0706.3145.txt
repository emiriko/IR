We revisit phenomenology of the minimal gauge-mediated model. This model is
motivated from the SUSY CP and flavor problems. A specific feature of this
model is that \tan\beta is naturally large, since the B term in the Higgs
potential is zero at the messenger scale. This leads to significant SUSY
contributions to various low-energy observables. We evaluate the anomalous
magnetic moment of the muon and the branching ratio of \bar{B}\to X_s\gamma
taking account of recent theoretical and experimental developments. We find
that the current experimental data prefer a low messenger scale (\sim 100 TeV)
and gluino mass around 1 TeV. We also calculate the branching ratios of
\bar{B}\to X_s l^+l^-, B_s\to \mu^+\mu^-, and B^-\to \tau^- \bar{\nu}, and show
that these observables are strongly correlated with each other in this model.
