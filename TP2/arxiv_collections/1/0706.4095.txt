Motivated by results on generic-case complexity in group theory, we apply the
ideas of effective Baire category and effective measure theory to study
complexity classes of functions which are "fractionally computable" by a
partial algorithm. For this purpose it is crucial to specify an allowable
effective density, $\delta$, of convergence for a partial algorithm. The set
$\mathcal{FC}(\delta)$ consists of all total functions $ f: \Sigma^\ast \to
\{0,1 \}$ where $\Sigma$ is a finite alphabet with $|\Sigma| \ge 2$ which are
"fractionally computable at density $\delta$". The space $\mathcal{FC}(\delta)
$ is effectively of the second category while any fractional complexity class,
defined using $\delta$ and any computable bound $\beta$ with respect to an
abstract Blum complexity measure, is effectively meager. A remarkable result of
Kautz and Miltersen shows that relative to an algorithmically random oracle
$A$, the relativized class $\mathcal{NP}^A$ does not have effective polynomial
measure zero in $\mathcal{E}^A$, the relativization of strict exponential time.
We define the class $\mathcal{UFP}^A$ of all languages which are fractionally
decidable in polynomial time at ``a uniform rate'' by algorithms with an oracle
for $A$. We show that this class does have effective polynomial measure zero in
$\mathcal{E}^A$ for every oracle $A$. Thus relaxing the requirement of
polynomial time decidability to hold only for a fraction of possible inputs
does not compensate for the power of nondeterminism in the case of random
oracles.
