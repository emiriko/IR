The design and characteristics of the new very small angle neutron scattering
spectrometer under construction at the Laboratoire Leon Brillouin is described.
Its goal is to extend the range of scattering vectors magnitudes towards
2x10{-4} /A. The unique feature of this new spectrometer is a high resolution
two dimensional image plate detector sensitive to neutrons. The wavelength
selection is achieved by a double reflection supermirror monochromator and the
collimator uses a novel multibeam design.
