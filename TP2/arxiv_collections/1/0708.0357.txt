Various measurements of the Coulomb breakup of 8B are analyzed within the
dynamical eikonal approximation using a single description of 8B. We obtain a
good agreement with experiment for different observables measured between 40
and 80 MeV per nucleon. A simple 7Be-p potential model description of 8B seems
sufficient to describe all observables. In particular, the asymmetry in
parallel-momentum distributions due to E1-E2 interferences is well reproduced
without any scaling. The projectile-target nuclear interactions seem negligible
if data are selected at forward angles. On the contrary, like in previous
analyzes we observe a significant influence of higher-order effects. The
accuracy of astrophysical S factors for the 7Be(p,gamma)8B reaction at stellar
energies extracted from breakup measurements therefore seems difficult to
evaluate.
