A new nano-cell with smoothly varying longitudinal thickness of the atomic
vapour layer L in the range of 350 - 5100 nm allowing to study the resonant
absorption of D1 and D2 lines of Cs atoms for thicknesses changing from L =
Lambda/2 to L = 6 Lambda with the step of Lambda/2 (Lambda = 852 nm or 894 nm
are the resonant laser wavelengths) and for different intensities is developed.
It is revealed that for low laser intensities there is narrowing of the
resonant absorption spectrum for the thicknesses L = (2n + 1)Lambda/2 (where n
is an integer) up to L = 7Lambda /2 and broadening of the spectrum for L = n
Lambda. For relatively high laser intensity (>1 mW/cm2), velocity selective
optical pumping/saturated resonances of a reduced absorption (with the
line-width close to the natural one), and centred on the hyperfine transitions
occur when L = n Lambda. The possible application of these resonance peaks is
given. The developed theoretical model describes well the experiment.
