We analyze an optical 3-port reflection grating by means of a scattering
matrix formalism. Amplitude and phase relations between the 3 ports, i.e. the 3
orders of diffraction are derived. Such a grating can be used as an
all-reflective, low-loss coupler to Fabry-Perot cavities. We derive the input
output relations of a 3-port grating coupled cavity and find distinct
properties not present in 2-port coupled cavities. The cavity relations further
reveal that the 3-port coupler can be designed such that the additional cavity
port interferes destructively. In this case the all-reflective, low-loss,
single-ended Fabry-Perot cavity becomes equivalent to a standard transmissive,
2-port coupled cavity.
