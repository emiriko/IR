We face the problem of detecting and featuring footprints of quantum
criticality in the finite-temperature behavior of quantum many-body systems.
Our strategy is that of comparing the phase diagram of a system displaying a
T=0 quantum phase transition with that of its classical limit, in order to
single out the genuinely quantum effects. To this aim, we consider the
one-dimensional Ising model in a transverse field: while the quantum S=1/2
Ising chain is exactly solvable and extensively studied, results for the
classical limit (infinite S) of such model are lacking, and we supply them
here. They are obtained numerically, via the Transfer-matrix method, and their
asymptotic low-temperature behavior is also derived analytically by
self-consistent spin-wave theory. We draw the classical phase-diagram according
to the same procedure followed in the quantum analysis, and the two phase
diagrams are found unexpectedly similar: Three regimes are detected also in the
classical case, each characterized by a functional dependence of the
correlation length on temperature and field analogous to that of the quantum
model. What discriminates the classical from the quantum case are the different
values of the exponents entering such dependencies, a consequence of the
different nature of zero-temperature quantum fluctuations with respect to
thermal ones.
