In this paper, ageing behavior of suspensions of laponite with varying salt
concentration is investigated using rheological tools. It is observed that the
ageing is accompanied by an increase in the complex viscosity. The succeeding
creep experiments performed at various ages showed damped oscillations in the
strain. The characteristic time-scale of the damped oscillations, retardation
time, showed a prominent decrease with the age of the system. However, this
dependence weakens with an increase in the salt concentration, which is known
to change microstructure of the system from glass-like to gel-like. We
postulate that a decrease in the retardation time can be represented as a
decrease in the viscosity (friction) of the dissipative environment surrounding
the arrested entities that opposes elastic deformation of the system. We
believe that ageing in colloidal glass leads to a greater ordering that
enhances relative spacing between the constituents thereby reducing the
frictional resistance. However, since a gel state is inherently different in
structure (fractal network) than that of a glass (disordered), ageing in the
same does not induce ordering. Consequently, we observe inverse dependence of
retardation time on age becoming weaker with an increase in the salt
concentration. We analyze these results from a perspective of ageing dynamics
of both glass state and gel state of laponite suspensions.
