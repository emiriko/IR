We apply the configuration-interaction method to calculate the spectra of
two-component Fermi systems in a harmonic trap, studying the convergence of the
method at the unitary interaction limit. We find that for a fixed
regularization of the two-body interaction the convergence is exponential or
better in the truncation parameter of the many-body space. However, the
conventional regularization is found to have poor convergence in the
regularization parameter, with an error that scales as a low negative power of
this parameter. We propose a new regularization of the two-body interaction
that produces exponential convergence for systems of three and four particles.
  From the systematics, we estimate the ground-state energy of the
four-particle system to be (5.05 +- 0.024)hbar omega.
