Relational data model defines a specification of a type "relation". However,
its simplicity does not mean that the system implementing this model must
operate with structures having the same simplicity. We consider two principles
allowing create a system which combines object-oriented paradigm (OOP) and
relational data model (RDM) in one framework. The first principle -- "complex
data in encapsulated domains" -- is well known from The Third Manifesto by Date
and Darwen. The second principle --"data complexity in names"-- is the basis
for a system where data are described as complex objects and uniquely
represented as a set of relations. Names of these relations and names of their
attributes are combinations of names entered in specifications of the complex
objects. Below, we consider the main properties of such a system.
