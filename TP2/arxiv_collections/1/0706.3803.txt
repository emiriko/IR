The influence of an inhomogeneous magnetic field on the magnetoresistance of
thin Al films, used in different superconductor/ferromagnet hybrids, has been
investigated. Two contrasting magnetic textures with out-of-plane magnetization
are explored, namely (i) a plain film in a multidomain state and (ii) an array
of micro-sized dots. The stray fields of the ferromagnetic structures confine
the superconducting condensate and, accordingly, modify the condition for the
nucleation of superconductivity. By switching between different magnetic states
of the ferromagnet, this confinement can be tuned at will, hereby reversibly
changing the dependence of the critical temperature Tc on an external magnetic
field H. In particular, the continuous evolution from a conventional linear
Tc(H) dependence with a single maximum to a reentrant superconducting phase
boundary with multiple Tc peaks has been demonstrated.
