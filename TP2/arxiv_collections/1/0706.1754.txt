We demonstrate a new algorithm for finding protein conformations that
minimize a non-bonded energy function. The new algorithm, called the difference
map, seeks to find an atomic configuration that is simultaneously in two
constraint spaces. The first constraint space is the space of atomic
configurations that have a valid peptide geometry, while the second is the
space of configurations that have a non-bonded energy below a given target.
These two constraint spaces are used to define a deterministic dynamical
system, whose fixed points produce atomic configurations in the intersection of
the two constraint spaces. The rate at which the difference map produces low
energy protein conformations is compared with that of a contemporary search
algorithm, parallel tempering. The results indicate the difference map finds
low energy protein conformations at a significantly higher rate then parallel
tempering.
