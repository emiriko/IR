We study boundary states in (p,q) minimal superstring theory, combining the
explicit form of matter wave functions. Within the modular bootstrap framework,
Cardy states of (p,q) minimal superconformal field theory are completely
determined in both cases of the different supercharge combinations, and the
remaining consistency checks in the super-Liouville case are also performed.
Using these boundary states, we determine the explicit form of FZZT- and
ZZ-brane boundary states both in type 0A and 0B GSO projections. Annulus
mplitudes of FZZT branes are evaluated and principal FZZT branes are
identified. In particular, we found that these principal FZZT branes do not
satisfy Cardy's consistency conditions for each other and play a role of
order/disorder parameters of the Kramers-Wannier duality in spacetime of this
superstring theory.
