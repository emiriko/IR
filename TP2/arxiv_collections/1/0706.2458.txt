We report model calculations on DNA single strands which describe the
equilibrium dynamics and kinetics of hairpin formation and melting. Modeling is
at the level of single bases. Strand rigidity is described in terms of simple
polymer models; alternative calculations performed using the freely rotating
chain and the discrete Kratky-Porod models are reported. Stem formation is
modeled according to the Peyrard-Bishop-Dauxois Hamiltonian. The kinetics of
opening and closing is described in terms of a diffusion-controlled motion in
an effective free energy landscape. Melting profiles, dependence of melting
temperature on loop length, and kinetic time scales are in semiquantitative
agreement with experimental data obtained from fluorescent DNA beacons forming
poly(T) loops. Variation in strand rigidity is not sufficient to account for
the large activation enthalpy of closing and the strong loop length dependence
observed in hairpins forming poly(A) loops. Implications for modeling single
strands of DNA or RNA are discussed.
