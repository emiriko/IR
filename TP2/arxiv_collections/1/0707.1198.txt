Computing the trajectories of particles in generic beamlines is an important
ingredient of experimental particle physics, in particular regarding near-beam
detectors. A new tool, Hector, has been built for such calculations, using the
transfer matrix approach and energy corrections. The limiting aperture effects
are also taken into account. As an illustration, the tool was used to simulate
the LHC beamlines, in particular around the high luminosity interaction points
(IPs), and validated with results of the Mad-X simulator. The LHC beam
profiles, trajectories and beta functions are presented. Assuming certain
forward proton detector scenarios around the IP5, acceptance plots, irradiation
doses and chromaticity grids are produced. Furthermore, the reconstruction of
proton kinematic variables at the IP (energy and angle) is studied as well as
the impact of the misalignment of beamline elements.
