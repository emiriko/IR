We study real-space condensation phenomena in a type of classical stochastic
processes (site-particle system), such as zero-range processes and urn models.
We here study a stochastic process in the Ehrenfest class, i.e., particles in a
site are distinguishable. In terms of the statistical mechanical analogue, the
Ehrenfest class obeys the Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics. We analytically clarify
conditions for condensation phenomena in disordered cases in the Ehrenfest
class. In addition, we discuss the preferential urn model as an example of the
disordered urn model. It becomes clear that the quenched disorder property
plays an important role in the occurrence of the condensation phenomenon in the
preferential urn model. It is revealed that the preferential urn model shows
three types of condensation depending on the disorder parameters.
