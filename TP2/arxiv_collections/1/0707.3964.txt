We adapt the one parameter scaling theory (OPT) to the context of quantum
chaos. As a result we propose a more precise characterization of the
universality classes associated to Wigner-Dyson and Poisson statistics which
takes into account Anderson localization effects. Based also on the OPT we
predict a new universality class in quantum chaos related to the
metal-insulator transition and provide several examples. In low dimensions it
is characterized by classical superdiffusion or a fractal spectrum, in higher
dimensions it can also have a purely quantum origin as in the case of
disordered systems. Our findings open the possibility of studying the metal
insulator transition experimentally in a much broader type of systems.
