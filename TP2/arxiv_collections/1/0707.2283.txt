The cosmological constant problem and the compatibility of gravity with
quantum mechanics are the two most pressing problems in all of gravitational
theory. While string theory nicely addresses the latter, it has so far failed
to provide any compelling solution to the former. On the other hand, while
conformal gravity nicely addresses the cosmological constant problem (by
naturally quenching the amount by which the cosmological constant gravitates
rather than by quenching the cosmological constant itself), the fourth order
derivative conformal theory has long been thought to possess a ghost when
quantized. However, it has recently been shown by Bender and Mannheim that not
only do theories based on fourth order derivative equations of motion not have
ghosts, they actually never had any to begin with, with the apparent presence
of ghosts being due entirely to treating operators which were not Hermitian on
the real axis as though they were. When this is taken care of via an underlying
$\cal P$$\cal T$ symmetry that such theories are found to possess, there are
then no ghosts at all and the $S$-matrix is fully unitary. Conformal gravity is
thus advanced as a fully consistent four-dimensional alternative to
ten-dimensional string theory.
