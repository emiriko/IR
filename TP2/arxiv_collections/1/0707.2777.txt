We report the successful passivation of the Mn acceptors in GaMnP upon
exposure to a remote dc hydrogen plasma. The as-grown films are non-metallic
and ferromagnetic with a Curie temperature of T_C=55K. After hydrogenation the
sample resistivity increases by approximately three orders of magnitude at room
temperature and six orders of magnitude at 25 K. Furthermore, the hydrogenated
samples are paramagnetic, which is evidenced by a magnetization curve at 5 K
that is best described by a Brillouin function with g=2 and J=5/2 expected for
Mn atoms in the 3d^5 configuration. These observations unambiguously proof that
the ferromagnetism is carrier-mediated also in GaMnP.
