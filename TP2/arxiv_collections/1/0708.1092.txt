Strong correlation effects in a capacitively coupled double quantum-dot setup
were previously shown to provide the possibility of both entangling spin-charge
degrees of freedom and realizing efficient spin-filtering operations by static
gate-voltage manipulations. Motivated by the use of such a device for quantum
computing, we study the influence of electromagnetic noise on a general
spin-orbital Kondo model, and investigate the conditions for observing
coherent, unitary transport, crucial to warrant efficient spin manipulations.
We find a rich phase diagram, where low-energy properties sensitively depend on
the impedance of the external environment and geometric parameters of the
system. Relevant energy scales related to the Kondo temperature are also
computed in a renormalization-group treatment, allowing to assess the
robustness of the device against environmental effects.
