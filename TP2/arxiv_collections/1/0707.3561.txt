Vector and axial form factors in the quark resonance model are analyzed with
a combination of theoretical and phenomenological arguments. The new form of
form factors is deduced from $\Delta$(1232) excitation models and available
data. The vector part is shown to agree with the resonant contribution to
electron-proton inclusive $F_2$ data. The axial part is obtained by finding a
simultaneous fit to ANL and BNL $\frac{d \sigma}{d Q^2}$ neutrino scattering
data. The best fit corresponds to $C_5^A(0)=0.88$ in the Rarita Schwinger
formalism.
