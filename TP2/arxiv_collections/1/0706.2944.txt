In this paper we argue that in the kinematic range given by $ 1 \ll
\ln(1/\as^2) \ll \as Y \ll \frac{1}{\as}$, we can reduce the Pomeron calculus
to the exchange of non-interacting Pomerons with the renormalized amplitude of
their interaction with the target. Therefore, the summation of the Pomeron
loops can be performed using the improved Mueller, Patel, Salam and Iancu
approximation and this leads to the geometrical scaling solution. This solution
is found for the simplified BFKL kernel. We reproduce the findings of Hatta and
Mueller that there are overlapping singularities. We suggest a way of dealing
with these singularities.
