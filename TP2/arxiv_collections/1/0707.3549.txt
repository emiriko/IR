Computation of superstring partition function for the non-linear sigma model
on the product of a two-torus and its dual within the scope of the doubled
formalism is presented. We verify that it reproduces the partition functions of
the toroidally compactified type--IIA and type--IIB theories for appropriate
choices of the GSO projection.
