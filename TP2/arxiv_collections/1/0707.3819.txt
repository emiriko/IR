We report the existence of zero energy surface states localized at zigzag
edges of bilayer graphene. Working within the tight-binding approximation we
derive the analytic solution for the wavefunctions of these peculiar surface
states. It is shown that zero energy edge states in bilayer graphene can be
divided into two families: (i) states living only on a single plane, equivalent
to surface states in monolayer graphene; (ii) states with finite amplitude over
the two layers, with an enhanced penetration into the bulk. The bulk and
surface (edge) electronic structure of bilayer graphene nanoribbons is also
studied, both in the absence and in the presence of a bias voltage between
planes.
