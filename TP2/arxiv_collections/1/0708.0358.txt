A system of two interacting photon modes, without constraints on the photon
number, in the presence of a Kerr nonlinearity, exhibits BEC if the transfer
amplitude is greater than the mode frequency. A symmetry-breaking field (SBF)
can be introduced by taking into account a classical electron current. The
ground state, in the limit of small nonlinearity, becomes a squeezed state, and
thus the modes become entangled. The smaller is the SBF, the greater is
entanglement. Superfluid-like behavior is observed in the study of entanglement
growth from an initial coherent state, since in the short-time range the growth
does not depend on the SBF amplitude, and on the initial state amplitude. On
the other hand, the latter is the only parameter which determines entanglement
in the absence of the SBF.
