A rigid loop is a for-loop with a counter not accessible to the loop body or
any other part of a program. Special instructions for rigid loops are
introduced on top of the syntax of the program algebra PGA. Two different
semantic projections are provided and proven equivalent. One of these is taken
to have definitional status on the basis of two criteria: `normative semantic
adequacy' and `indicative algorithmic adequacy'.
