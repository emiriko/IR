The complex elastic compliance s11(w,T) of SrTiO3-d has been measured as a
function of the O deficiency d < 0.01. The two main relaxation peaks in the
absorption are identified with hopping of isolated O vacancies over a barrier
of 0.60 eV and reorientation of pairs of vacancies involving a barrier of 1 eV.
The pair binding energy is ~0.2 eV and indications for additional clustering,
possibly into chains, is found already at d ~0.004. The anistropic component of
the elastic dipole of an O vacancy is Deltalambda = 0.026.
