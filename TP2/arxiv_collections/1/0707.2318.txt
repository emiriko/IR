What are gravitational waves? How do they propagate? and what is their energy
content? These questions are addressed in the first two chapters. In the third
chapter the pseudo-Newtonian formalism and its extension is reviewed in general
and the formula for the momentum imparted to test particles in arbitrary
spacetimes is reviewed in particular. In chapter four the analysis of a paper
claiming to determine the spin for gravitational waves is given, and compared
with the spin given by a geodesic analysis. It is demonstrated that the other
claim is inconsistent. Finally in chapter five a summary of the work is given
with the conclusion.
