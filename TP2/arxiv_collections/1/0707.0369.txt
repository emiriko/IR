In this work we study numerically the influence of a homogeneous electrical
field on the fluid and heat transfer phenomena at macroscale and mesoscale
during unidirectional solidification of a binary metal alloy. The numerical
results showed that a pulse electric discharging applied perpendicularly to the
solidification front leads to a much stronger Joule heating of the liquid phase
in comparison to the solid phase. It was found that on the mesoscopic scale the
electric current density is not homogeneous due to the complex shape of the
dendrite and the difference between electrical conductivities of the solid and
liquid phases. This inhomogeneity of the electrical current density in the
mushy zone leads to the increase of the Joule heating of the dendrite in
comparison to the interdendritic liquid and induces a pinch force
(electromagnetic Lorentz force). The main features of the resulting convection
in the interdendritic liquid are discussed.
