Neural networks are used extensively in classification problems in particle
physics research. Since the training of neural networks can be viewed as a
problem of inference, Bayesian learning of neural networks can provide more
optimal and robust results than conventional learning methods. We have
investigated the use of Bayesian neural networks for signal/background
discrimination in the search for second generation leptoquarks at the Tevatron,
as an example. We present a comparison of the results obtained from the
conventional training of feedforward neural networks and networks trained with
Bayesian methods.
