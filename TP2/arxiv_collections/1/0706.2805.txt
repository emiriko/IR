We study the semileptonic decays of the lowest-lying bc baryons to the
lowest-lying cc baryons (Xi_{bc}^{(\prime*)}--> Xi_{cc}^{(*)} and
Omega_{bc}^{(\prime*)}--> Omega_{cc}^{(*)}), in the limit m_b, m_c >>
Lambda_{QCD} and close to the zero recoil point. The separate heavy quark spin
symmetries make it possible to describe all these decays using a single form
factor. We recover results derived previously by White and Savage in a manner
which we think is more straightforward and parallels the method applied later
to study Bc semileptonic decays. We further discuss the resemblance between the
bc baryon decays and those of Bc mesons to eta_c and J/\psi mesons and comment
on the relation between the slopes of the single functions describing each set
of decays. Our results can straightforwardly be applied to the decays of bb
baryons to bc baryons.
