We present a detailed description on how to build a Thin WIre electroStatic
Trap (TWIST) for ultracold polar molecules. It is the first design of an
electrostatic trap that can be superimposed directly onto a magneto optical
trap (MOT). We can thus continuously produce ultracold polar molecules via
photoassociation from a two species MOT and instantaneously trap them in the
TWIST without the need for complex transfer schemes. Despite the spatial
overlap of the TWIST and the MOT, the two traps can be operated and optimized
completely independently due to the complementary nature of the utilized
trapping mechanisms.
