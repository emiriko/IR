The scalar potential of recombination fields of magnetized branes in Type IIB
orientifold compactifications is analyzed in the absence of any closed string
fluxes. Considering its perturbative F and D-term contributions in a quadratic
approximation, we present the conditions for which its minima are
supersymmetric. We show that for reasonable conditions on the spectrum, both
metric moduli and recombination fields can be stabilized. We then provide
explicit examples of compact manifolds where a Minkowski vacuum is realized in
a Higgs phase. The vacuum energy is zero and some charged scalars acquire a
vev. We then address the question of supersymmetry breaking. The scalar
potential for recombination fields is analyzed when supersymmetry is broken by
F and D-term. We show that locally stable vacua can exist at the classical
level. These are formed by a hidden supersymmetric sector that fixes metric
moduli and recombination fields and a visible sector where supersymmetry is
spontaneously broken.
