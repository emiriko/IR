The information rates achievable by using electromagnetic radiation affected
by thermal noise and signal decoherence are studied. The standard coherent
Gaussian model is compared with an alternative photon gas model which
represents lack of a shared phase reference between transmitter and receiver.
At any frequency, information rates over the photon gas model essentially
coincide with those over the Gaussian model when the signal-to-noise ratio is
below a threshold. Only above the threshold does decoherence cause a loss in
information rates; the loss can amount to half of the capacity. The threshold
exceeds 40 dB for radio frequencies and vanishes at optical frequencies.
