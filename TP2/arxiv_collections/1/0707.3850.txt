We present spin wave dispersions in MnO, NiO, and $\alpha$-MnAs based on the
quasiparticle self-consistent $GW$ method (\qsgw), which determines an optimum
quasiparticle picture. For MnO and NiO, \qsgw results are in rather good
agreement with experiments, in contrast to the LDA and LDA+U description. For
$\alpha$-MnAs, we find a collinear ferromagnetic ground state in \qsgw, while
this phase is unstable in the LDA.
