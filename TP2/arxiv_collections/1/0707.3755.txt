It is shown how the pre-exponential factor of the Feynman propagator for a
large class of potentials can be computed using contour integrals. This is of
direct relevance in the context of tunnelling processes in quantum theories.
The prerequisites for this analysis are accessible to advanced undergraduate
students and involve only introductory courses in ordinary differential
equations and complex variables.
