Using unitarized Chiral Perturbation Theory methods, we perform a detailed
analysis of the $\pi\pi$ scattering poles $f_0(600)$ and $\rho(770)$ behaviour
when medium effects such as temperature or density drive the system towards
Chiral Symmetry Restoration. In the analysis of real poles below threshold, we
show that it is crucial to extend properly the unitarized amplitudes so that
they match the perturbative Adler zeros. Our results do not show threshold
enhancement effects at finite temperature in the $f_0(600)$ channel, which
remains as a pole of broad nature. We also implement T=0 finite density effects
related to chiral symmetry restoration, by varying the pole position with the
pion decay constant. Although this approach takes into account only a limited
class of contributions, we reproduce the expected finite density restoration
behaviour, which drives the poles towards the real axis, producing threshold
enhancement and $\pi\pi$ bound states. We compare our results with several
model approaches and discuss the experimental consequences, both in
Relativistic Heavy Ion Collisions and in $\pi\to \pi\pi$ and $\gamma\to \pi\pi$
reactions in nuclei.
