Compton scattering is one of the dominant interaction processes in germanium
for photons with an energy of around two MeV. If a photon scatters only once
inside a germanium detector, the resulting event contains only one electron
which normally deposits its energy within a mm range. Such events are similar
to Ge-76 neutrinoless double beta-decay events with just two electrons in the
final state. Other photon interactions like pair production or multiple
scattering can result in events composed of separated energy deposits. One
method to identify the multiple energy deposits is the use of timing
information contained in the electrical response of a detector or a segment of
a detector.
  The procedures developed to separate single- and multiple-site events are
tested with specially selected event samples provided by an 18-fold segmented
prototype germanium detector for Phase II of the GERmanium Detector Array,
GERDA. The single Compton scattering, i.e. single-site, events are tagged by
coincidently detecting the scattered photon with a second detector positioned
at a defined angle. A neural network is trained to separate such events from
events which come from multi-site dominated samples. Identification
efficiencies of ~80% are achieved for both single- and multi-site events.
