Highly disordered magnetism confined to individual weakly interacting
vortices is detected by muon spin rotation in two different families of
high-transition-temperature superconductors, but only in samples on the
low-doping side of the low-temperature normal state metal-to-insulator
crossover (MIC). The results support an extended quantum phase transition (QPT)
theory of competing magnetic and superconducting orders that incorporates the
coupling between CuO2 planes. Contrary to what has been inferred from previous
experiments, the static magnetism that coexists with superconductivity near the
field-induced QPT is not ordered. Our findings unravel the mystery of the MIC
and establish that the normal state of high-temperature superconductors is
ubiquitously governed by a magnetic quantum critical point in the
superconducting phase.
