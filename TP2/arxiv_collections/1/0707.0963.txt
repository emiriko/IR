A key requirement for scalable quantum computing is that elementary quantum
gates can be implemented with sufficiently low error. One method for
determining the error behavior of a gate implementation is to perform process
tomography. However, standard process tomography is limited by errors in state
preparation, measurement and one-qubit gates. It suffers from inefficient
scaling with number of qubits and does not detect adverse error-compounding
when gates are composed in long sequences. An additional problem is due to the
fact that desirable error probabilities for scalable quantum computing are of
the order of 0.0001 or lower. Experimentally proving such low errors is
challenging. We describe a randomized benchmarking method that yields estimates
of the computationally relevant errors without relying on accurate state
preparation and measurement. Since it involves long sequences of randomly
chosen gates, it also verifies that error behavior is stable when used in long
computations. We implemented randomized benchmarking on trapped atomic ion
qubits, establishing a one-qubit error probability per randomized pi/2 pulse of
0.00482(17) in a particular experiment. We expect this error probability to be
readily improved with straightforward technical modifications.
