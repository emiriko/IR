We report the prediction of quasi-bound states (resonant states with very
long lifetimes) that occur in the eigenvalue continuum of propagating states
for a wide region of parameter space. These quasi-bound states are generated in
a quantum wire with two channels and an adatom, when the energy bands of the
two channels overlap. A would-be bound state that lays just below the upper
energy band is slightly destabilized by the lower energy band and thereby
becomes a resonant state with a very long lifetime (a second QBIC lays above
the lower energy band).
