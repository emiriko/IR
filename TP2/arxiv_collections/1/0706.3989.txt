In the year 1957, when interest in Einstein's unified field theory was fading
away for lack of understanding of its physical content, Treder performed a
momentous critical analysis of the possible definitions of the electric
four-current in the theory. As an outcome of this scrutiny he was able to prove
by the E.I.H. method that properly defined point charges, appended at the
right-hand side of the field equation $R_{[[\mu\nu],\lambda]}=0$, interact
mutually with Coulomb-like forces, provided that a mutual force independent of
distance is present too. This unwanted, but unavoidable addition, could not but
lay further disbelief on the efforts initiated by Einstein and Schroedinger one
decade earlier. However in 1980 Treder himself recalled that the potential
$\phi=a/r+cr$, found by him in 1957, was the one used by particle physicists to
account phenomenologically for the spectrum of bound quark systems like mesons.
Exact solutions have later confirmed beyond any doubt that Einstein's unified
field theory does account in a simple way, already in classical form, for the
confinement of pole charges defined by the four-current first availed of by
Treder. In the present paper it is proposed, ad memoriam, a thorough
recollection of the article published by Treder in 1957, showing the way kept
by him to find what would have been later recognized as confinement in
Einstein's unified field theory.
