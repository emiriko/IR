XML data warehouses form an interesting basis for decision-support
applications that exploit heterogeneous data from multiple sources. However,
XML-native database systems currently bear limited performances and it is
necessary to research ways to optimize them. In this paper, we propose a new
index that is specifically adapted to the multidimensional architecture of XML
warehouses and eliminates join operations, while preserving the information
contained in the original warehouse. A theoretical study and experimental
results demonstrate the efficiency of our index, even when queries are complex.
