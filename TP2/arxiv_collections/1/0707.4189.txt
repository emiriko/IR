It is well known that bosons on an optical lattice undergo a second-order
superfluid-insulator transition (SIT) when the lattice potential increases. In
this paper we study SIT when fermions coexist with the bosons. We find that the
critical properties of particle-hole symmetric SIT with dynamical exponent z=1
is modified when fermions are present; it either becomes a fluctuation-driven
first order transition or a different second-order transition. On the other
hand the more generic particle-hole asymmetric (with z=2) SIT is stable against
coupling with fermions. We also discuss pairing interaction between fermions
mediated by quantum critical fluctuations near SIT.
