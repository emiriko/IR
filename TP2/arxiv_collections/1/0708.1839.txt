This paper describes a design of a molecular propagation system in molecular
communication. Molecular communication is a new communication paradigm where
biological and artificially-created nanomachines communicate over a short
distance using molecules. A molecular propagation system in molecular
communication directionally transports molecules from a sender to a receiver.
In the design described in this paper, protein filaments glide over immobilized
motor proteins along preconfigured microlithographic tracks, and the gliding
protein filaments carry and transport molecules from a sender to a receiver. In
the design, DNA hybridization is used to load and unload the molecules onto and
from the carriers at a sender and a receiver. In the design,
loading/transporting/unloading processes are autonomous and require no external
control.
