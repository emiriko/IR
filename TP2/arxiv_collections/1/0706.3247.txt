Relativistic rapidity is usually presented as a computational device. As
Levy-Leblond has shown, it is also the velocity that would be imputed by an
ideal Newtonian inertial guidance system, taking c=1*neper=1. Here, we show
that it can also be interpreted as the change in musical pitch of radiation
fore and aft along the direction of motion.
