The energy relaxation in the spin-polarized disordered electron systems is
studied in the diffusive regime. We derived the quantum kinetic equation in
which the kernel of electron-electron collision integral explicitly depends on
the electron magnetization. As the consequence, the inelastic scattering rate
is found to have non-monotonic dependence on the spin polarization of the
electron system.
