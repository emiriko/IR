Rankine vortex charateristics of a partially coherent optical vortex are
explored using classical and physical optics. Unlike a perfectly coherent
vortex mode, the circulation is not quantized. Excess circulation is predicted
owing to the wave nature of the composite vortex fields. Based on these
findings we propose a vortex stellar interferometer.
