Over the last 25 years, a lot of work has been done on seeking for decidable
non-regular extensions of Propositional Dynamic Logic (PDL). Only recently, an
expressive extension of PDL, allowing visibly pushdown automata (VPAs) as a
formalism to describe programs, was introduced and proven to have a
satisfiability problem complete for deterministic double exponential time.
Lately, the VPA formalism was extended to so called k-phase multi-stack visibly
pushdown automata (k-MVPAs). Similarly to VPAs, it has been shown that the
language of k-MVPAs have desirable effective closure properties and that the
emptiness problem is decidable. On the occasion of introducing k-MVPAs, it has
been asked whether the extension of PDL with k-MVPAs still leads to a decidable
logic. This question is answered negatively here. We prove that already for the
extension of PDL with 2-phase MVPAs with two stacks satisfiability becomes
\Sigma_1^1-complete.
