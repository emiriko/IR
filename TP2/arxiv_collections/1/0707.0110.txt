In this paper is discussed a class of static spherically symmetric solutions
of the general relativistic elasticity equations. The main point of discussion
is the comparison of two matter models given in terms of their stored energy
functionals, i.e., the rule which gives the amount of energy stored in the
system when it is deformed. Both functionals mimic (and for small deformations
approximate) the classical Kirchhoff-St.Venant materials but differ in the
strain variable used. We discuss the behavior of the systems for large
deformations.
