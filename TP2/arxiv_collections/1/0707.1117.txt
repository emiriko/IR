Let $T_1, ..., T_l: X \to X$ be commuting measure-preserving transformations
on a probability space $(X, \X, \mu)$. We show that the multiple ergodic
averages $\frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} f_1(T_1^n x) ... f_l(T_l^n x)$ are
convergent in $L^2(X,\X,\mu)$ as $N \to \infty$ for all $f_1,...,f_l \in
L^\infty(X,\X,\mu)$; this was previously established for $l=2$ by Conze and
Lesigne and for general $l$ assuming some additional ergodicity hypotheses on
the maps $T_i$ and $T_i T_j^{-1}$ by Frantzikinakis and Kra (with the $l=3$
case of this result established earlier by Zhang). Our approach is
combinatorial and finitary in nature, inspired by recent developments regarding
the hypergraph regularity and removal lemmas, although we will not need the
full strength of those lemmas. In particular, the $l=2$ case of our arguments
are a finitary analogue of those of Conze and Lesigne.
