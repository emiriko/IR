Coupled backward and forward wave amplitudes of an electromagnetic field
propagating in a periodic and nonlinear medium at Bragg resonance are governed
by the nonlinear coupled mode equations (NLCME). This system of PDEs, similar
in structure to the Dirac equations, has gap soliton solutions that travel at
any speed between 0 and the speed of light. A recently considered strategy for
spatial trapping or capture of gap optical soliton light pulses is based on the
appropriate design of localized defects in the periodic structure. Localized
defects in the periodic structure give rise to defect modes, which persist as
{\it nonlinear defect modes} as the amplitude is increased. Soliton trapping is
the transfer of incoming soliton energy to {\it nonlinear} defect modes. To
serve as targets for such energy transfer, nonlinear defect modes must be
stable. We therefore investigate the stability of nonlinear defect modes.
Resonance among discrete localized modes and radiation modes plays a role in
the mechanism for stability and instability, in a manner analogous to the
nonlinear Schr\"odinger / Gross-Pitaevskii (NLS/GP) equation. However, the
nature of instabilities and how energy is exchanged among modes is considerably
more complicated than for NLS/GP due, in part, to a continuous spectrum of
radiation modes which is unbounded above and below. In this paper we (a)
establish the instability of branches of nonlinear defect states which, for
vanishing amplitude, have a linearization with eigenvalue embedded within the
continuous spectrum, (b) numerically compute, using Evans function, the
linearized spectrum of nonlinear defect states of an interesting multiparameter
family of defects, and (c) perform direct time-dependent numerical simulations
in which we observe the exchange of energy among discrete and continuum modes.
