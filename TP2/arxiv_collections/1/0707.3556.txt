We study the effect of the exciton fine-structure splitting on the
polarisation-entanglement of photon pairs produced by the biexciton cascade in
a single quantum dot. The entanglement is found to persist despite separations
between the intermediate energy levels of up to 4 micro-eV. Measurements
demonstrate that entanglement of the photon pair is robust to the dephasing of
the intermediate exciton state responsible for the first order coherence time
of either single photon. We present a theoretical framework taking into account
the effects of spin-scattering, background light and dephasing. We distinguish
between the first-order coherence time, and a parameter which we measure for
the first time and define as the cross-coherence time.
