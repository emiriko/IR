Several studies suggest that cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 plays a pivotal role in
the progression of ischaemic brain damage. In the present study, we
investigated the effects of selective inhibition of COX-2 with nimesulide (12
mg/kg) and selective inhibition of COX-1 with valeryl salicylate (VAS, 12-120
mg/kg) on prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, Evans
blue (EB) extravasation and infarct volume in a standardized model of transient
focal cerebral ischaemia in the rat. Post-ischaemic treatment with nimesulide
markedly reduced the increase in PGE2 levels in the ischaemic cerebral cortex
24 h after stroke and diminished infarct size by 48% with respect to
vehicle-treated animals after 3 days of reperfusion. Furthermore, nimesulide
significantly attenuated the blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage and leukocyte
infiltration (as measured by EB leakage and MPO activity, respectively) seen at
48 h after the initial ischaemic episode. These studies provide the first
experimental evidence that COX-2 inhibition with nimesulide is able to limit
BBB disruption and leukocyte infiltration following transient focal cerebral
ischaemia. Neuroprotection afforded by nimesulide is observed even when the
treatment is delayed until 6 h after the onset of ischaemia, confirming a wide
therapeutic window of COX-2 inhibitors in experimental stroke. On the contrary,
selective inhibition of COX-1 with VAS had no significant effect on the
evaluated parameters. These data suggest that COX-2 activity, but not COX-1
activity, contributes to the progression of focal ischaemic brain injury, and
that the beneficial effects observed with non-selective COX inhibitors are
probably associated to COX-2 rather than to COX-1 inhibition.
