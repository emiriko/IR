We find membrane configurations in AdS_4 x S^7, which correspond to the
continuous limit of the SU(2) integrable spin chain, considered as a limit of
the SU(3) spin chain, arising in N=4 SYM in four dimensions, dual to strings in
AdS_5 x S^5. We also discuss the relationship with the Neumann-Rosochatius
integrable system at the level of Lagrangians, comparing the string and
membrane cases.
