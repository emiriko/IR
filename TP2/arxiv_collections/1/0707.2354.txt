Critical velocities have been observed in an ultracold superfluid Fermi gas
throughout the BEC-BCS crossover. A pronounced peak of the critical velocity at
unitarity demonstrates that superfluidity is most robust for resonant atomic
interactions. Critical velocities were determined from the abrupt onset of
dissipation when the velocity of a moving one dimensional optical lattice was
varied. The dependence of the critical velocity on lattice depth and on the
inhomogeneous density profile was studied.
