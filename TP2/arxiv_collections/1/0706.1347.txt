The two-state vector formalism (TSVF), the time-symmetric description of the
standard quantum mechanics originated by Aharonov, Bergmann and Lebowitz is
reviewed. The TSVF describes a quantum system at a particular time by two
quantum states: the usual one, evolving forward in time, defined by the results
of a complete measurement at the earlier time, and by the quantum state
evolving backward in time, defined by the results of a complete measurement at
a later time.
