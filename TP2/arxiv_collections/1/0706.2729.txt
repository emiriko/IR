We have investigated the polarization dependence of the emission spectra of
p-shell multiexcitons of a quantum dot when the single particle level spacing
is larger than the characteristic energy of the Coulomb interactions. We find
that there are many degenerate multiexciton states. The emission intensities
depend on the number of degenerate initial and final states of the optical
transitions. However, unlike the transition energies, they are essentially
independent of the strength of the Coulomb interactions. In the presence of
electron-hole symmetry the independence is exact.
