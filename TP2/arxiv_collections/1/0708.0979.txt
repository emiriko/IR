Modelling incompressible ideal fluids as a finite collection of vortex
filaments is important in physics (super-fluidity, models for the onset of
turbulence) as well as for numerical algorithms used in computer graphics for
the real time simulation of smoke. Here we introduce a time-discrete evolution
equation for arbitrary closed polygons in 3-space that is a discretisation of
the localised induction approximation of filament motion. This discretisation
shares with its continuum limit the property that it is a completely integrable
system. We apply this polygon evolution to a significant improvement of the
numerical algorithms used in Computer Graphics.
