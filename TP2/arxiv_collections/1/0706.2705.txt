We derive exact solitonic solutions of the one-dimensional time-dependent
Gross-Pitaevskii equation with time-dependent strengths of the harmonic
external potential and the interatomic interaction. The time-dependence of the
external potential and interatomic interaction are given in terms of a general
function of time. For an oscillating strength of the external potential, the
solutions correspond to breathing single and multiple solitons. The amplitude
and frequency of the oscillating potential can be used to control the dynamics
of the center of mass of the solitons. For certain values of these parameters,
the solitons can be {\it trapped} at the center of the harmonic potential.
