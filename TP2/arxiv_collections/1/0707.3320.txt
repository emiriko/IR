We produce the discontinuity in the specific heat of a homogeneous, dilute,
and weakly interacting Bose gas in a short-wavelength range with a simple
statistical method. The magnitude of the discontinuity at the phase transition
temperature is obtained as a function of the density and scattering length of
the Bose particles.
