Entanglement characteristics of a pair coherent state is studied using
entanglement of superposition. It is demonstrated only few states in the
expansion of a pair coherent state, in a harmonic oscillator basis, contribute
significantly to the entanglement. We also study a case of two superposed pair
coherent states
