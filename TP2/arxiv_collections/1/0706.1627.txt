We report the experimental observation of rectified momentum transport for a
Bose-Einstein Condensate kicked at the Talbot time (quantum resonance) by an
optical standing wave. Atoms are initially prepared in a superposition of the 0
and -2*hbar*kl momentum states using an optical pi/2 pulse. By changing the
relative phase of the superposed states, a momentum current in either direction
along the standing wave may be produced. We offer an interpretation based on
matter wave interference, showing that the observed effect is uniquely quantum.
