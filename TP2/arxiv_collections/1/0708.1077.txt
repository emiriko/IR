We construct Green-Schwarz (GS) light-cone closed superstring theory from
type IIB matrix model. A GS light-cone string action is derived from two
dimensional N=8 U(n) noncommutative Yang-Mills (NCYM) by identifying
noncommutative scale with string scale. Supersymmetry transformation for the
light-cone gauge action is also derived from supersymmetry transformation for
IIB matrix model. By identifying the physical states and interaction vertices,
string theory is perturbatively reproduced.
