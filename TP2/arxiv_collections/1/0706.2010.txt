We present six multiparty protocols with information-theoretic security that
tolerate an arbitrary number of corrupt participants. All protocols assume
pairwise authentic private channels and a broadcast channel (in a single case,
we require a simultaneous broadcast channel). We give protocols for veto, vote,
anonymous bit transmission, collision detection, notification and anonymous
message transmission. Not assuming an honest majority, in most cases, a single
corrupt participant can make the protocol abort. All protocols achieve
functionality never obtained before without the use of either computational
assumptions or of an honest majority.
