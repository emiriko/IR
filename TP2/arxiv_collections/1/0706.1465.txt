Atom and molecule currents in a Fermi gas in the neighborhood of a Feshbach
resonance are studied in a one-dimensional optical ring lattice by directly
diagonalizing small models. A rotational analogy of flux quantization is used
to show that fraction of the current is carried by particles with twice the
mass of an atom, which suggests pairing and superfluidity.
