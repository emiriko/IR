C Croke and B Kleiner have constructed an example of a CAT(0) group with more
than one visual boundary. J Wilson has proven that this same group has
uncountably many distinct boundaries. In this article we prove that the knot
group of any connected sum of two non-trivial torus knots also has uncountably
many distinct CAT(0) boundaries.
