We describe human-subject laboratory experiments on probabilistic auctions
based on previously proposed auction protocols involving the simulated
manipulation and communication of quantum states. These auctions are
probabilistic in determining which bidder wins, or having no winner, rather
than always having the highest bidder win. Comparing two quantum protocols in
the context of first-price sealed bid auctions, we find the one predicted to be
superior by game theory also performs better experimentally. We also compare
with a conventional first price auction, which gives higher performance. Thus
to provide benefits, the quantum protocol requires more complex economic
scenarios such as maintaining privacy of bids over a series of related auctions
or involving allocative externalities.
