We propose a closed expression for the three loop anomalous dimension of a
class of twist-3 operators built with gauge fields and covariant derivatives.
To this aim, we solve the long-range Bethe Ansatz equations at finite spin and
provide a consistent analytical formula obtained assuming maximal
transcendentality violation as suggested by the known one-loop anomalous
dimension. The final result reproduces the universal cusp anomalous dimension
and obeys recursion relations inspired by the principle of reciprocity
invariance.
