The three-nucleon (NNN) interaction derived within the chiral effective field
theory at the next-to-next-to-leading order (N2LO) is regulated with a function
depending on the magnitude of the momentum transfer. The regulated NNN
interaction is then local in the coordinate space, which is advantages for some
many-body techniques. Matrix elements of the local chiral NNN interaction are
evaluated in a three-nucleon basis. Using the ab initio no-core shell model
(NCSM) the NNN matrix elements are employed in 3H and 4He bound-state
calculations.
