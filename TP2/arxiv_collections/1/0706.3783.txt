We have studied the behavior of the S-matrix poles near threshold for quantum
waveguides coupled to a cavity with a defect. We emphasize the occurrence of
both dominant and shadow poles on the various sheets of the energy Riemann
surface, and show that the changes of the total conductivity near threshold as
the cavity's width changes can be explained in terms of dominant to shadow pole
transitions.
