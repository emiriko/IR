We propose a possible setup of testing the Bell's inequality in mesoscopic
conductors. The particular implementation uses two coupled electronic
Mach-Zehnder interferometers in which electrons are injected into the
conductors in the quantum Hall regime. It is shown that the Bell's inequality
is violated for an arbitrary coupling strength between the two interferometers.
