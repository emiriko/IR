There has been much recent research into polarizing an antiproton beam,
instigated by the recent proposal from the PAX (Polarized Antiproton
eXperiment) project at GSI Darmstadt. It plans to polarize an antiproton beam
by repeated interaction with a polarized internal target in a storage ring. The
method of polarization by spin filtering requires many of the beam particles to
remain within the ring after scattering off the polarized internal target via
electromagnetic and hadronic interactions. We present and solve sets of
differential equations which describe the buildup of polarization by spin
filtering in many different scenarios of interest to projects planning to
produce high intensity polarized beams. These scenarios are: 1) spin filtering
of a fully stored beam, 2) spin filtering while the beam is being accumulated,
i.e. unpolarized particles are continuously being fed into the beam, 3) the
particle input rate is equal to the rate at which particles are being lost due
to scattering beyond ring acceptance angle, the beam intensity remaining
constant, 4) increasing the initial polarization of a stored beam by spin
filtering, 5) the input of particles into the beam is stopped after a certain
amount of time, but spin filtering continues. The rate of depolarization of a
stored polarized beam on passing through an electron cooler is also shown to be
negligible.
