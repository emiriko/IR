We study the dynamics of the critical two-dimensional fully-frustrated Ising
model by means of Monte Carlo simulations. The dynamical exponent is estimated
at equilibrium and is shown to be compatible with the value $z_c=2$. In a
second step, the system is prepared in the paramagnetic phase and then quenched
at its critical temperature $T_c=0$. Numerical evidences for the existence of
logarithmic corrections in the aging regime are presented. These corrections
may be related to the topological defects observed in other fully-frustrated
models. The autocorrelation exponent is estimated to be $\lambda=d$ as for the
Ising chain quenched at $T_c=0$.
