Forward jet and multijet production has been measured at low Bjorken x at
HERA. The measured cross sections and correlations were compared to predictions
from DGLAP-based fixed-order calculations. Further comparisons were made to
DGLAP-based and CCFM-based leading-order Monte Carlo predictions, as well as to
Colour-Dipole model predictions. For the majority of the phase space covered in
the HERA kinematic region, fixed-order calculations describe the data well,
while the leading-order models provide an inconsistent description of the data.
