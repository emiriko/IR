We investigate the influence of a deterministic but non-synchronous update on
Random Boolean Networks, with a focus on critical networks. Knowing that
``relevant components'' determine the number and length of attractors, we focus
on such relevant components and calculate how the length and number of
attractors on these components are modified by delays at one or more nodes. The
main findings are that attractors decrease in number when there are more
delays, and that periods may become very long when delays are not integer
multiples of the basic update step.
