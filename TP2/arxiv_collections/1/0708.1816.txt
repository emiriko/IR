It is proposed that fragmentation functions should be used to identify exotic
hadrons. As an example, fragmentation functions of the scalar meson f_0(980)
are investigated. It is pointed out that the second moments and functional
forms of the u- and s-quark fragmentation functions can distinguish the
tetraquark structure from $q\bar q$. By the global analysis of f_0 (980)
production data in electron-positron annihilation, its fragmentation functions
and their uncertainties are determined. It is found that the current available
data are not sufficient to determine its internal structure, while precise data
in future should be able to identify exotic quark configurations.
