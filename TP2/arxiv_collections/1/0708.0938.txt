We present detailed calculations at the basis of our recent proposal for
simultaneous cooling the rotational, vibrational and external molecular degrees
of freedom. In this method, the molecular rovibronic states are coupled by an
intense laser and an optical cavity via coherent Raman processes enhanced by
the strong coupling with the cavity modes. For a prototype system, OH, we
showed that the translational motion is cooled to few micro Kelvin and the
molecule is brought to the internal ground state in about a second. Here, we
investigate numerically the dependence of the cooling scheme on the molecular
polarizability, selecting NO as a second example. Furthermore, we demonstrate
the general applicability of the proposed cooling scheme to initially
vibrationally and rotationally hot molecular systems.
