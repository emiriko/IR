We study the possibility of Wigner crystallization in both single- and and
bi-layer graphene using a real space tight binding model. In addition to
verifying our earlier prediction for single layer graphene, we predict that the
bilayer graphene can undergo a Wigner crystal transition at low enough carrier
density thus offering a possibility of tunable and bipolar Wigner crystal. We
find that aside from the Coulomb interaction of the carriers of two layers that
stabilizes the charge ordered state, so does the inter layer coupling.
