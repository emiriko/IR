We describe an occupation-number-like picture of Fractional Quantum Hall
(FQH) states in terms of polynomial wavefunctions characterized by a dominant
occupation-number configuration. The bosonic variants of single-component
abelian and non-abelian FQH states are modeled by Jacks (Jack symmetric
polynomials), characterized by dominant occupation-number configurations
satisfying a generalized Pauli principle. In a series of well-known Quantum
Hall states, including the Laughlin, Read-Moore, and Read-Rezayi, the Jack
polynomials naturally implement a ``squeezing rule'' that constrains allowed
configurations to be restricted to those obtained by squeezing the dominant
configuration. The Jacks describing uniform FQH states satisfy a highest-weight
condition, and a clustering condition which can be generalized to describe
quasiparticle states.
