I present further analytic time symmetric initial data for five dimensions
describing ``bubbles of nothing'' which have no Kaluza-Klein circle
asymptotically. The new solutions consist of a large family of single bubbles
in both asymptotically flat and asymptotically AdS space. I also numerically
construct gravitational solitons in AdS where the usual boundary conditions are
modified geometrically but not topologically. Furthermore I point out there are
both regular AdS bubbles and topologically trivial metrics in asymptotically
global AdS dual to matter which violates all the usual energy conditions, both
classical and quantum. I inquire as to the existence of a dual gravitational
instability.
