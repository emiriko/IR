This review is focused on the borderline region of theoretical physics and
mathematics. First, we describe numerical methods for the acceleration of the
convergence of series. These provide a useful toolbox for theoretical physics
which has hitherto not received the attention it actually deserves. The
unifying concept for convergence acceleration methods is that in many cases,
one can reach much faster convergence than by adding a particular series term
by term. In some cases, it is even possible to use a divergent input series,
together with a suitable sequence transformation, for the construction of
numerical methods that can be applied to the calculation of special functions.
This review both aims to provide some practical guidance as well as a
groundwork for the study of specialized literature. As a second topic, we
review some recent developments in the field of Borel resummation, which is
generally recognized as one of the most versatile methods for the summation of
factorially divergent (perturbation) series. Here, the focus is on algorithms
which make optimal use of all information contained in a finite set of
perturbative coefficients. The unifying concept for the various aspects of the
Borel method investigated here is given by the singularities of the Borel
transform, which introduce ambiguities from a mathematical point of view and
lead to different possible physical interpretations. The two most important
cases are: (i) the residues at the singularities correspond to the decay width
of a resonance, and (ii) the presence of the singularities indicates the
existence of nonperturbative contributions which cannot be accounted for on the
basis of a Borel resummation and require generalizations toward resurgent
expansions. Both of these cases are illustrated by examples.
