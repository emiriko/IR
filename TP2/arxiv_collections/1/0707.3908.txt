We discuss the quasiclassical Green function method for a two-dimensional
electron gas in the presence of spin-orbit coupling, with emphasis on the
meaning of the $\xi$-integration procedure. As an application of our approach,
we demonstrate how the spin-Hall conductivity, in the presence of spin-flip
scattering, can be easily obtained from the spin-density continuity equation.
