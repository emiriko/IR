The I=2 pipi scattering length is calculated in fully-dynamical lattice QCD
with domain-wall valence quarks on the asqtad-improved coarse MILC
configurations (with fourth-rooted staggered sea quarks) at four light-quark
masses. Two- and three-flavor mixed-action chiral perturbation theory at
next-to-leading order is used to perform the chiral and continuum
extrapolations. At the physical charged pion mass, we find m_pi a_pipi(I=2) =
-0.04330 +- 0.00042, where the error bar combines the statistical and
systematic uncertainties in quadrature.
