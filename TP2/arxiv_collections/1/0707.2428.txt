The distribution of genetic polymorphisms in a population contains
information about the mutation rate and the strength of natural selection at a
locus. Here, we show that the Poisson Random Field (PRF) method of
population-genetic inference suffers from systematic biases that tend to
underestimate selection pressures and mutation rates, and that erroneously
infer positive selection. These problems arise from the infinite-sites
approximation inherent in the PRF method. We introduce three new inference
techniques that correct these problems. We present a finite-site modification
of the PRF method, as well as two new methods for inferring selection pressures
and mutation rates based on diffusion models. Our methods can be used to infer
not only a "weighted average" of selection pressures acting on a gene sequence,
but also the distribution of selection pressures across sites. We evaluate the
accuracy of our methods, as well that of the original PRF approach, by
comparison with Wright-Fisher simulations.
