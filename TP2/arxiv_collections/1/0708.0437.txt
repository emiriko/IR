We introduce an algorithm based on a method of snapshots for computing
approximate balanced truncations for discrete-time, stable, linear
time-periodic systems. By construction, this algorithm is applicable to very
high-dimensional systems, even with very high-dimensional outputs (or,
alternatively, very high-dimensional inputs). An example is shown to validate
the method.
