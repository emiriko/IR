We show that there exists a deep link between the two disciplines of
information theory and spectral geometry. This allows us to obtain new results
on a well known quantum gravity motivated natural ultraviolet cutoff which
describes an upper bound on the spatial density of information. Concretely, we
show that, together with an infrared cutoff, this natural ultraviolet cutoff
beautifully reduces the path integral of quantum field theory on curved space
to a finite number of ordinary integrations. We then show, in particular, that
the subsequent removal of the infrared cutoff is safe.
