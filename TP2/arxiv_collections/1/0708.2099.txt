We report extensive simulations of the relaxation dynamics of a self-avoiding
polymer confined inside a cylindrical pore. In particular, we concentrate on
examining how confinement influences the scaling behavior of the global
relaxation time of the chain, t, with the chain length N and pore diameter D.
An earlier scaling analysis based on the de Gennes blob picture led to t ~
N^2D^(1/3). Our numerical effort that combines molecular dynamics and Monte
Carlo simulations, however, consistently produces different t-results for N up
to 2000. We argue that the previous scaling prediction is only asymptotically
valid in the limit N >> D^(5/3) >> 1, which is currently inaccessible to
computer simulations and, more interestingly, is also difficult to reach in
experiments. Our results are thus relevant for the interpretation of recent
experiments with DNA in nano- and micro-channels.
