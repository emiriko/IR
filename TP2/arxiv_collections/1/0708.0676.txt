We study a class of two-dimensional spin models with the Kitaev-type
couplings in mosaic structure lattices to implement topological orders. We show
that they are exactly solvable by reducing them to some free Majorana fermion
models with gauge symmetries. The typical case with a 4-8-8 close packing is
investigated in detail to display the quantum phases with Abelian and
non-Abelian anyons. Its topological properties characterized by Chern numbers
are revealed through the edge modes of its spectrum.
