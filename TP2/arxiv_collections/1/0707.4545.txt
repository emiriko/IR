New physics beyond the Standard Model can lead to extra matter effects on
neutrino oscillation if the new interactions distinguish among the three
flavors of neutrino. In a previous paper, we argued that a long-baseline
neutrino oscillation experiment in which the Fermilab-NUMI beam in its
high-energy mode is aimed at the planned Hyper-Kamiokande detector would be
capable of constraining the size of those extra effects, provided the vacuum
value of \sin^2 2\theta_{23} is not too close to one. In this paper, we discuss
how such a constraint would translate into limits on the coupling constants and
masses of new particles in various models. The models we consider are: models
with generation distinguishing Z's such as topcolor assisted technicolor,
models containing various types of leptoquarks, R-parity violating SUSY, and
extended Higgs sector models. In several cases, we find that the limits thus
obtained could be competitive with those expected from direct searches at the
LHC. In the event that any of the particles discussed here are discovered at
the LHC, then the observation, or non-observation, of their matter effects
could help in identifying what type of particle had been observed.
