The efficiency of acoustooptic (AO) diffraction in a-BaB2O4 and Li2B4O7
crystals is studied experimentally. The crystals are shown to be quite good AO
materials. The efficiency of AO diffraction in a-BaB2O4 reaches h=30% at the
electric signal power of P=0.7W for the transverse acoustic wave and 15% at the
power of P=0.56W for the longitudinal wave. The same parameter for Li2B4O7
reaches h=21% at P=0,81W for the longitudinal acoustic wave.
