Effects of disorder and valley polarization in graphene are investigated in
the quantum Hall regime. We find anomalous localization properties for the
lowest Landau level (LL), where disorder can induce wavefunction delocalization
(instead of localization), both for white-noise and gaussian-correlated
disorder. We quantitatively identify the contribution of each sublattice to
wavefunction amplitudes. Following the valley (sublattice) polarization of
states within LLs for increasing disorder we show: (i) valley mixing in the
lowest LL is the main effect behind the observed anomalous localization
properties, (ii) the polarization suppression with increasing disorder depends
on the localization for the white-noise model, while, (iii) the disorder
induces a partial polarization in the higher Landau levels for both disorder
models.
