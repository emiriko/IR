Quantum dynamical lower bounds for continuous and discrete one-dimensional
Dirac operators are established in terms of transfer matrices. Then such
results are applied to various models, including the Bernoulli-Dirac one and,
in contrast to the discrete case, critical energies are also found for the
continuous Dirac case with positive mass.
