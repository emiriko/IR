We introduce an optimization algorithm for resource allocation in the LIPI
Public Cluster to optimize its usage according to incoming requests from users.
The tool is an extended and modified genetic algorithm developed to match
specific natures of public cluster. We present a detail analysis of
optimization, and compare the results with the exact calculation. We show that
it would be very useful and could realize an automatic decision making system
for public clusters.
