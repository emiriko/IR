We use the, covariant and gauge-invariant, 1+1+2 formalism developed by
Clarkson and Barrett, and develop new techniques, to decouple electromagnetic
(EM) perturbations on arbitrary locally rotationally symmetric (LRS)
space-times. Ultimately, we derive 3 decoupled complex equations governing 3
complex scalars. One of these is a new Regge-Wheeler (RW) equation generalized
for LRS space-times, whereas the remaining two are new generalizations of the
Bardeen-Press (BP) equations. This is achieved by first using linear algebra
techniques to rewrite the first-order Maxwell equations in a new complex 1+1+2
form which is conducive to decoupling. This new complex system immediately
yields the generalized RW equation, and furthermore, we also derive a decoupled
equation governing a newly defined complex EM 2-vector. Subsequently, a further
decomposition of the 1+1+2 formalism into a 1+1+1+1 formalism is developed,
allowing us to decompose the complex EM 2-vector, and its governing equations,
into spin-weighted scalars, giving rise to the generalized BP equations.
