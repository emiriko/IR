We study theoretically the (K^-,N) reactions for the formation of the deeply
bound kaonic atoms, which were predicted to be quasi--stable with narrow
widths, using the Green function method. We consider various cases with
different target nuclei and energies systematically and find the clear signals
in the theoretical spectra for all cases considered in this article. The
signals show very interesting structures, such as the $RESONANCE DIP$ instead
of the resonance peak. We discuss the origins of the interesting structures and
possibilities to get new information on the existence of the kaonic nuclei from
the spectra of the atomic state formations.
