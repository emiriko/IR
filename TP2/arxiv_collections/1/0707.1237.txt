Quantum Antidot (AD) structures have remarkable properties in the integer
quantum Hall regime, exhibiting Coulomb-blockade charging and the Kondo effect
despite their open geometry. In some regimes a simple single-particle (SP)
model suffices to describe experimental observations while in others
interaction effects are clearly important, although exactly how and why
interactions emerge is unclear. We present a combination of experimental data
and the results of new calculations concerning SP orbital states which show how
the observed suppression of the energy spacing between states can be explained
through a full consideration of the AD potential, without requiring any effects
due to electron interactions such as the formation of compressible regions
composed of multiple states, which may occur at higher magnetic fields. A full
understanding of the regimes in which these effects occur is important for the
design of devices to coherently manipulate electrons in edge states using AD
resonances.
