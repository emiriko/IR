We report the results of a search for a narrow resonance in electron-positron
events in the invariant mass range of 150-950 GeV/c^2 using 1.3 fb^-1 of ppbar
collision data at sqrt(s) = 1.96 TeV collected by the CDF II detector at
Fermilab. No significant evidence of such a resonance is observed and we
interpret the results to exclude the standard model-like Z' with a mass below
923 GeV/c^2 and the Randall-Sundrum graviton with a mass below 807 GeV/c^2 for
k/M_pl=0.1, both at the 95% confidence level. Combining with di-photon data
excludes the Randall-Sundrum graviton for masses below 889 GeV/c^2 for
k/M_pl=0.1.
