We summarize the experimental observations of three case studies on the
long-lived rhodium Mossbauer Effect. Extraordinary observations reported in
this work manifest the open-up of photonic band gap in analogy to the
superconducting gap. Observable gravitational effect is manifested by the
superradiance of different sample orientations corresponding to the earth
gravity. These observations are of potential importance for detecting
gravitational waves and development of the two-photon gamma laser.
