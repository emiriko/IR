A numerical hydrodynamic study of femtosecond laser ablation is presented. A
detailed analysis of material decomposition is performed using a
thermodynamically complete equation of state with separate stable and
metastable phase states and phase boundaries. The lifetime of the metastable
liquid state is estimated based on the classical theory of homogeneous
nucleation. In addition, mechanical fragmentation of the target material is
controlled based on available criteria. As a result, several ablation
mechanisms are observed. A major fraction of the ablated material, however, is
found to originate from the metastable liquid region, which is decomposed
either thermally in the vicinity of the critical point into a liquid-gas
mixture, or mechanically at high strain rate and negative pressure into liquid
droplets and chunks. The calculation results explain available experimental
findings.
