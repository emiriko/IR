In this follow-up of the article: Quantum Group of Isometries in Classical
and Noncommutative Geometry(arXiv:0704.0041) by Goswami, where quantum isometry
group of a noncommutative manifold has been defined, we explicitly compute such
quantum groups for a number of classical as well as noncommutative manifolds
including the spheres and the tori. It is also proved that the quantum isometry
group of an isospectral deformation of a (classical or noncommutative) manifold
is a suitable deformation of the quantum isometry group of the original
(undeformed) manifold.
