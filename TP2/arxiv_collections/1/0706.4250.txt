We calculate n alpha phase-shifts and scattering observables in the
resonating-group method, using the nuclear-matter G-matrix of an SU_6
quark-model NN interaction. The G-matrix is generated in the recent
energy-independent procedure of the quark-model NN interaction with the
continuous prescription for intermediate spectra, by assuming an appropriate
Fermi momentum k_F=1.2 fm^-1. The n alpha RGM interaction kernels are evaluated
with explicit treatments of the nonlocality and momentum dependence of
partial-wave G-matrix components. The momentum dependence of the G-matrix
components is different for each of the nucleon-exchange and interaction types.
Without introducing any artificial parameters except for k_F, the central and
spin-orbit components of the n alpha Born kernel are found to have reasonable
strengths under the assumption of a rigid translationally invariant shell-model
wave function of the alpha-cluster. The characteristic behaviors of three
different exchange terms, corresponding to knockout, heavy-particle pickup and
nucleon-rearrangement processes, are essentially the same between the case of
previous local effective NN forces and the case of nonlocal G-matrix NN
interactions.
