We present new muon spectroscopy data on a Fe$_3$O$_4$ single crystal,
revealing different spin precession patterns in five distinct temperature
ranges. A careful analysis of the local field and its straightforward modeling
obtains surprisingly good agreement with experiments only if a very specific
model of localized charges violating Anderson condition, and a correlated muon
local dynamics are implemented. Muon evidence for fluctuations just above the
Verwey temperature, precursor of the low temperature charge localized state, is
provided.
