Motivated by a question of Hirzebruch on the possible topological types of
cusp cross-sections of Hilbert modular varieties, we give a necessary and
sufficient condition for a manifold M to be diffeomorphic to a cusp
cross-section of a Hilbert modular variety. Specialized to Hilbert modular
surfaces, this proves that every Sol 3-manifold is diffeomorphic to a cusp
cross-section of a (generalized) Hilbert modular surface. We also deduce an
obstruction to geometric bounding in this setting. Consequently, there exist
Sol 3-manifolds that cannot arise as a cusp cross-section of a 1-cusped
nonsingular Hilbert modular surface.
