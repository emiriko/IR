We discuss (im)possibility of the exact cloning of orthogonal but genuinely
entangled three qubit states aided with entangled ancila under local operation
and classical communication. Whereas any two orthogonal GHZ states taken from
the canonical GHZ basis, can be cloned with the help of a known GHZ state,
surprisingly we find that no two W states can be cloned by using any known
three qubit (possibly entangled) state as blank copy.
