The physics of vortex lines in dipolar condensates is studied. Due to the
nonlocality of the dipolar interaction, the 3D character of the vortex plays a
more important role in dipolar gases than in typical short-range interacting
ones. In particular, the dipolar interaction significantly affects the
stability of the transverse modes of the vortex line. Remarkably, in the
presence of a periodic potential along the vortex line, a roton minimum may
develop in the spectrum of transverse modes. We discuss the appropriate
conditions at which this roton minimum may eventually lead to an instability of
the straight vortex line, opening new scenarios for vortices in dipolar gases.
