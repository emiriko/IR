We calculate the exchange coupling J between electrons in a double-well
potential in a two-dimensional semiconductor environment within the
Heitler-London (HL) approach. Two functional forms are considered for the
double-well potential. We show that by choosing an appropriate and relatively
simple single-electron variational wave function it is possible, within the HL
approach, to significantly improve the estimates for J. In all cases the
present scheme overcomes the artifacts and limitations at short interdot
distances, previously attributed to the HL method, where unphysical triplet
ground states have been found, and leads to an overall agreement with analytic
interpolated expressions for J obtained for a donor-type model potential.
