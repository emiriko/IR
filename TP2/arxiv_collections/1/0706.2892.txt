We study the voter model with a finite density of zealots--voters than never
change opinion. For equal numbers of zealots of each species, the distribution
of magnetization (opinions) is Gaussian in the mean-field limit as well as in
one and two dimensions, with a width that is proportional to 1/sqrt{Z}, where Z
is the number of zealots, independent of the total number of voters. Thus just
a few zealots can prevent consensus or even the formation of a robust majority.
