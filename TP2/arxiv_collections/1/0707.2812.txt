Top squark-mediated annihilation of bino-like neutralinos to top-antitop
pairs can play the dominant role in obtaining a thermal relic dark matter
abundance in agreement with observations. In a previous paper, it was argued
that this can occur naturally in models of compressed supersymmetry, which
feature a running gluino mass parameter that is substantially smaller than the
wino mass parameter at the scale of apparent gauge coupling unification. Here I
study in some more detail the parameter space in which this is viable, and
compare to other scenarios for obtaining the observed dark matter density. I
then study the possibility of detecting the dark matter directly in future
experiments. The prospects are consistently very promising for a wide variety
of model parameters within this scenario.
