The large data samples of thousands of top events collected at the Tevatron
experiments CDF and D0 allow for a variety of measurements to analyze the
properties of the top quark. Guided by the question "Is the top quark observed
at the Tevatron really the top quark of the standard model,'' we present
Tevatron analyses studying the top production mechanism including resonant
$t\bar{t}$ production, the V-A structure of the $t\to Wb$ decay vertex, the
charge of the top quark, and single-top production via flavor-changing neutral
currents.
