This study of corrections to the canonical picture of black hole decay in
large extra dimensions examines the effects of back-reaction corrected and
microcanonical emission at the LHC. We provide statistical interpretations of
the different multiparticle number densities in terms of black hole decay to
standard model particles. Provided new heavy particles of mass near the
fundamental Planck scale are not discovered, differences between these
corrections and thermal decay will be insignificant at the LHC.
