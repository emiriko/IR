The calculation of massive 2--loop operator matrix elements, required for the
higher order Wilson coefficients for heavy flavor production in deeply
inelastic scattering, leads to new types of multiple infinite sums over
harmonic sums and related functions, which depend on the Mellin parameter $N$.
We report on the solution of these sums through higher order difference
equations using the summation package {\tt Sigma}.
