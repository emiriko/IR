We calculate meson correlators in the epsilon-regime within partially
quenched chiral perturbation theory. The valence quark masses and sea quark
masses can be chosen arbitrary and all non-degenerate. Taking some of the sea
quark masses to infinity, one obtains a smooth connection among the theories
with different number of flavors, as well as the quenched theory. These results
can be directly compared with lattice QCD simulations.
