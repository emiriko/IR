Let G be a connected reductive group (over $\mathbb{C}$) and H a connected
semisimple subgroup. The dimension data of H (realative to its given embedding
in G) is the collection of the numbers $\{{\rm dim} V^{H}\}$, where V runs over
all the finite dimensional representations of G. By a Theorem of Larsen-Pink
([L-P90]), the dimension data determines H up to isomorphism, and if G = GL (n)
even up to conjugacy. Professor Langlands raised the question as to whether the
strong (conjugacy) result holds for arbitrary G. In this paper We provided the
following (negative) answer: If H is simple of type A_{4 n}, $B_{2 n} (n \geq
2)$, $C_{2 n} (n \geq 2)$, E_{6}, E_{8}, F_{4} and G_{2}, then there exist (for
suitable $N$) pairs of embeddings i and i' of H into $G = SO (2 N)$ such that
there image i (H) and i' (H) have the same dimension data but are not
conjugate. In fact we have shown that i (H) and i' (H) are \emph{locally
conjugate}, i.e., that i (h) and i' (h) are conjugate in G for all semisimple
$h \in H$. If one assumes functoriality, this result will furnish the failure
of multiplicity one for automorphic forms on such G over global fields. Such
things are known in the disconnected cases, especially when H is finite, as in
the works of Blasius [Blasius94] for $SL (n) (n \geq 3)$ and
Gan-Gurevich-Jiang2002 ([Gan]) for G_{2}.
