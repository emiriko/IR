The impact of the recent very precise CLAS and COMPASS g_1/F_1 data on
polarized parton densities and higher twist effects is discussed. We
demonstrate that the low Q^2 CLAS data improve essentially our knowledge of
higher twist corrections to the spin structure function g1, while the large Q^2
COMPASS data influence mainly the strange quark and gluon polarizations which
slightly decrease. We find also that the present inclusive DIS data cannot rule
out a negative polarized and changing in sign gluon densities.
