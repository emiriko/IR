Under the assumption of Minimal Flavour Violation (MFV), the Unitarity
Triangle (UT) can be determined by using only angle measurements and tree-level
observables. In this respect, the most accurate quantities today available are
sin 2 beta_{psi Ks}, |Vcb| and |Vub|. Among the latter, |Vub| is at present the
quantity suffering from largest systematic uncertainties, given the discrepancy
between the inclusive and the exclusive determinations.
  We show with a numerical fit how sensitively the MFV-UT determination depends
on the choice of |Vub|. In addition, we focus on the implications of the
inclusive value for |Vub|, which favors two non-SM like solutions in the rhobar
- etabar plane. We study in detail the possibility of reproducing such
solutions within the MFV MSSM. Our findings indicate that the case for the MFV
MSSM is in this respect quite problematic, unless the non-perturbative
parameters xi and BK are significantly different from those obtained by lattice
methods. As a byproduct, we point out that scenarios with 200 GeV <~ MA <~ 500
GeV and tan beta =~ 50 that predict a significant suppression for Delta Ms in
correlation with an enhancement for BR(Bs --> mu^+ mu^-) have to be fine-tuned
in order not to violate the new combined bound on the latter decay mode from
the CDF and D0 collaborations. Relatively large correlated effects can however
still occur for negative values of mu and large values for MA >~ 500 GeV,
increasing with increasing tan beta >~ 30.
