We study the onset of synchronous states in realistic chaotic neurons coupled
by mutually inhibitory chemical synapses. For the realistic parameters, namely
the synaptic strength and the intrinsic current, this synapse introduces
non-coherences in the neuronal dynamics, yet allowing for chaotic phase
synchronization in a large range of parameters. As we increase the synaptic
strength, the neurons undergo to a periodic state, and no chaotic complete
synchronization is found.
