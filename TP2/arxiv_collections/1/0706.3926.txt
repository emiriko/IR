Reporting about the formalism with the Dirac equation we describe the
dynamics of chiral oscillations for a fermionic particle non-minimally coupling
with an external magnetic field. For massive particles, the chirality and
helicity quantum numbers represent different physical quantities of
representative importance in the study of chiral interactions, in particular,
in the context of neutrino physics. After solving the interacting Hamiltonian
(Dirac) equation for the corresponding {\em fermionic} Dirac-{\em type}
particle (neutrino) and quantifying chiral oscillations in the Dirac wave
packet framework, we avail the possibility of determining realistic neutrino
chirality conversion rates by means of (helicity) polarization measurements. We
notice that it can become feasible for some particular magnetic field
configurations with large values of {\boldmath$B$} orthogonal to the direction
of the propagating particle.
