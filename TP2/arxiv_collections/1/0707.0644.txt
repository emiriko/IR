We introduce here a rewrite system in the group of unimodular matrices,
\emph{i.e.}, matrices with integer entries and with determinant equal to $\pm
1$. We use this rewrite system to precisely characterize the mechanism of the
Gaussian algorithm, that finds shortest vectors in a two--dimensional lattice
given by any basis. Putting together the algorithmic of lattice reduction and
the rewrite system theory, we propose a new worst--case analysis of the
Gaussian algorithm. There is already an optimal worst--case bound for some
variant of the Gaussian algorithm due to Vall\'ee \cite {ValGaussRevisit}. She
used essentially geometric considerations. Our analysis generalizes her result
to the case of the usual Gaussian algorithm. An interesting point in our work
is its possible (but not easy) generalization to the same problem in higher
dimensions, in order to exhibit a tight upper-bound for the number of
iterations of LLL--like reduction algorithms in the worst case. Moreover, our
method seems to work for analyzing other families of algorithms. As an
illustration, the analysis of sorting algorithms are briefly developed in the
last section of the paper.
