A special test electromagnetic field in the spacetime of the
higher-dimensional generally rotating NUT-(A)dS black hole is found. It is
adjusted to the hidden symmetries of the background represented by the
principal Killing-Yano tensor. Such electromagnetic field generalizes the field
of charged black hole in four dimensions. In higher dimensions, however, the
gravitational back reaction of such a field cannot be consistently solved.
