We have revisited data in the literature and find compelling reasons for
believing that enhanced superconductivity occurs in Sr2CuO3+delta when about
one third of the oxygen sites in the CuO2 layers are vacant, contrary to the
almost universally accepted assumption that superconducting interactions in the
high Tc cuprates occur in stoichiometric CuO2 layers.
