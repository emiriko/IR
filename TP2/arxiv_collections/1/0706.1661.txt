In quantum electrodynamics, the quantitatively most successful theory in the
history of science, intercharge forces obeying the inverse square law are due
to the exchange of space-like virtual photons. The fundamental quantum process
underlying applications as diverse as the gyromagnetic ratio of the electron
and electrical machinery is then M{\o}ller scattering $ee \to ee$. Analysis of
the quantum amplitude for this process shows that the corresponding intercharge
force acts instantaneously. This prediction has been verified in a recent
experiment.
