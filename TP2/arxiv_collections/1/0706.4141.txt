We outline some features of higher dimensional models possessing a
Quark-Lepton (QL) symmetry. The QL symmetric model in five dimensions is
discussed, with particular emphasis on the use of split fermions. An
interesting fermionic geography which utilises the QL symmetry to suppress the
proton decay rate and to motivate the flavor differences in the quark and
leptonic sectors is considered. We discuss the quartification model in five
dimensions and contrast the features of this model with traditional four
dimensional constructs.
