We construct the scalar and graviton propagator in quasi de Sitter space up
to first order in the slow roll parameter $\epsilon\equiv -\dot{H}/H^2$. After
a rescaling, the propagators are similar to those in de Sitter space with an
$\epsilon$ correction to the effective mass. The limit $\epsilon\to 0$
corresponds to the E(3) vacuum that breaks de Sitter symmetry, but does not
break spatial isotropy and homogeneity. The new propagators allow for a
self-consistent, dynamical study of quantum back-reaction effects during
inflation.
