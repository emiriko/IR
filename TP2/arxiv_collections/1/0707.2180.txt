We present studies of the thermal, magnetic and electrical transport
properties of reduced polycrystalline Pr_2Ba_4Cu_7O_{15-\delta} (Pr247) showing
a superconducting transition at Tc = 10 - 16 K and compare them with those of
as-sintered non-superconducting Pr247. The electrical resistivity in the normal
state exhibited T2 dependence up to approximately 150 K. A clear specific heat
anomaly was observed at Tc for Pr247 reduced in a vacuum for 24 hrs, proving
the bulk nature of the superconducting state. By the reduction treatment, the
magnetic ordering temperature TN of Pr moments decreased from 16 to 11 K, and
the entropy associated with the ordering increased, while the effective
paramagnetic moments obtained from the DC magnetic susceptibility varied from
2.72 to 3.13 mB. The sign of Hall coefficient changed from positive to negative
with decreasing temperature in the normal state of a superconducting Pr247,
while that of as-sintered one was positive down to 5 K. The electrical
resistivity under high magnetic fields was found to exhibit T^a dependence (a =
0.08 - 0.4) at low temperatures. A possibility of superconductivity in the
so-called CuO double chains is discussed.
