The coalescence of three levels has particular attractive features. Even
though it may be difficult to realise such event in the laboratory (three
additional real parameters must be adjusted), to take up the challenge seems
worthwhile. In the same way as the chiral behaviour of a usual EP can give a
direction on a line, the state vectors in the vicinity of an EP3 provide an
orientation in the plane. The distinction between left and right handedness
depends on the distribution of the widths of the three levels in the vicinity
of the point of coalescence.
