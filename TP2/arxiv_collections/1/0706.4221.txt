We present an analysis of radiation induced instabilities in an expanding
plasma with considerable presence of dust particles and equilibrium cooling. We
have shown that the equilibrium expansion and cooling destabilize the radiation
condensation modes and the presence of dust particles enhances this effect. We
have examined our results in the context of ionized, dusty-plasma environments
such as those found in planetary nebulae (PNe). We show that due to the
non-static equilibrium and finite equilibrium cooling, small-scale localized
structures formed out of thermal instability, become transient, which agrees
with the observational results. The dust-charge fluctuation is found to heavily
suppress these instabilities, though in view of non-availability of convincing
experimental data, a definitive conclusion could not be made.
