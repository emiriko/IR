We consider what the implications would be if there were a discrete
fundamental model of physics based on locally-finite self-interacting
information, in which there is no presumption of the familiar space and laws of
physics, but from which such space and laws can nevertheless be shown to be
able to emerge stably from such a fundamental model. We argue that if there is
such a model, then the familiar laws of physics, including Standard Model
constants, etc., must be encodable by a finite quantity C, called the
complexity, of self-interacting information I, called a Space-Cell. Copies of
Space-Cell I must be distributed throughout space, at a roughly constant and
near-Planck density, and copies must be created or destroyed as space expands
or contracts. We then argue that each Space-Cell is a self-replicator that can
duplicate in times ranging from as fast as near-Planck-times to as slow as
Cosmological-Constant-time which is 10^{61} Planck-times. From standard
considerations of computation, we argue this slowest duplication rate just
requires that 10^{61} is less than about 2^C, the number of length-C binary
strings, hence requiring only the modest complexity C at least 203, and at most
a few thousand. We claim this provides a reasonable explanation for a
dimensionless constant being as large as 10^{61}, and hence for the
Cosmological Constant being a tiny positive 10^{-122}. We also discuss a
separate conjecture on entropy flow in Hole-Bang Transitions. We then present
Cosmological Natural Selection II.
