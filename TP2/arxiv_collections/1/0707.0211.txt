We study how iterated convolutions of probability measures compare under
stochastic domination. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for the
existence of an integer $n$ such that $\mu^{*n}$ is stochastically dominated by
$\nu^{*n}$ for two given probability measures $\mu$ and $\nu$. As a consequence
we obtain a similar theorem on the majorization order for vectors in $\R^d$. In
particular we prove results about catalysis in quantum information theory.
