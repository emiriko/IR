On a planet without atmosphere, sustaining human life is very difficult and
dangerous, especially during short sunlit period when low temperature prevails.
To counter these environmental stresses, the author offer an innovative
artificial "Evergreen" dome, an inflated hemisphere with interiors continuously
providing a climate like that of Florida, Italy and Spain. The "Evergreen" dome
theory is developed, substantiated by computations that show it is possible for
current technology to construct and heat large enclosed volumes inexpensively.
Specifically, a satisfactory result is reached by using magnetic suspended at
high altitude sunlight reflectors and a special double thin film as a skin,
which concentrates solar energy inside the dome while, at the same time,
markedly decreasing the heat loss to exterior space. Offered design may be
employed for settlements on the Moon, Mars, asteroids and satellites.
