CDF and DO detectors have already collected 1.3 fb^{-1} of data delivered by
the Tevatron collider at 1.96 TeV center-of-mass energy. We present here the
various analyses that are currently testing the possibility of a supersymmetric
extension of the Standard Model. No evidence for such processes have been found
in luminosities that range from 300 to 800 pb^{-1} and different limits on the
different supersymmetric models are set. Constraints coming from indirect
searches are also presented.
