Magnetotransport measurements on the overdoped cuprate La_{1.7}Sr_{0.3}CuO_4
are fitted using the Ong construction and band parameters inferred from
angle-resolved photoemission. Within a band picture, the low temperature Hall
data can only be fitted satisfactorily by invoking strong basal-plane
anisotropy in the mean-free-path $\ell$. This violation of the isotropic-$\ell$
approximation supports a picture of dominant small-angle elastic scattering in
cuprates due to out-of-plane substitutional disorder. We show that both band
anisotropy and anisotropy in the elastic scattering channel strongly
renormalize the Hall coefficient in overdoped La_{2-x}Sr_xCuO_4 over a wide
doping and temperature range.
