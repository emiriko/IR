A diagram is introduced for visualizing matrix product states which makes
transparent a connection between matrix product factorizations of states and
operators, and complex weighted finite state automata. It is then shown how one
can proceed in the opposite direction: writing an automaton that ``generates''
an operator gives one an immediate matrix product factorization of it. Matrix
product factorizations have the advantage of reducing the cost of computing
expectation values by facilitating caching of intermediate calculations. Thus
our connection to complex weighted finite state automata yields insight into
what allows for efficient caching in matrix product algorithms. Finally, these
techniques are generalized to the case of multiple dimensions.
