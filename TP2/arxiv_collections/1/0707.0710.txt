A remarkably simple dependence of fragmentation cross-section on average
binding energy has been established in experimental data. This dependence was
empirically parametrised leading to a very useful formula for extrapolation. We
find that the canonical thermodynamic model, which has been used in the past
for successful computations of many observables resulting from
multifragmentation, reproduces the salient fetures of fragmentation
cross-sections of very neutron rich nuclei very well. This helps towards a
theoretical understanding of the observed data.
