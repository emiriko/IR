The CELSIUS/WASA setup is used to measure the 3pi0 decay of eta mesons
produced in pp interactions with beam kinetic energies of 1.36 and 1.45 GeV.
The efficiency-corrected Dalitz plot and density distributions for this decay
are shown, together with a fit of the quadratic slope parameter alpha yielding
alpha = -0.026 +/- 0.010(stat) +/- 0.010(syst). This value is compared to
recent experimental results and theoretical predictions.
