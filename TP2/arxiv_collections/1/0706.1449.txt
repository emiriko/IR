Recent advances in quantum key distribution (QKD) have given rise to systems
that operate at transmission periods significantly shorter than the dead times
of their component single-photon detectors. As systems continue to increase in
transmission rate, security concerns associated with detector dead times can
limit the production rate of sifted bits. We present a model of high-speed QKD
in this limit that identifies an optimum transmission rate for a system with
given link loss and detector response characteristics.
