The effect of Zn substitution on the superconducting transition temperature,
Tc, was investigated for the sintered Y1-xCaxBa2(Cu1-yZny)3O7-delta compounds
over a wide range of hole concentration per CuO2 plane, p. Ca substitution
enabled us to study the deeply overdoped region. p was changed by changing the
oxygen deficiency (delta). A strongly p-dependent rate of suppression of Tc
with Zn (dTc/dy) was found. From the analysis of the dTc(p)/dy and Tc(p,y)
data, we found that the optimum hole content, popt, shifts to higher values
with increasing Zn and superconductivity is at its strongest when p = 0.185 +/-
0.005. Various complementary experiments have identified this as the hole
content where the pseudogap vanishes quite abruptly. We have discussed the
possible relevance to these ideas with our findings.
