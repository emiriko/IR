We determine the superfluid transition temperatures $T_c$ and the ground
states of the attractive Hubbard model and find new insulating phases
associated with non-integer filling at sufficiently strong pairing attraction
$|U|$. These states, distinct from band and Mott insulating phases, derive from
pair localization; pair hopping at large $|U|$ and high densities is impeded by
inter-site, inter-pair repulsive interactions. The best way to detect the
breakdown of superfluidity is using fermionic optical lattices which should
reveal new forms of ``bosonic'' order, reflecting ground state pairing without
condensation.
