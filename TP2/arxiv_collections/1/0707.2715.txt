We set up recursion relations for the partition function and the ground-state
occupancy for a fixed number of non-interacting bosons confined in a square box
potential and determine the temperature dependence of the specific heat and the
particle number in the ground state. A proper semiclassical treatment is set up
which yields the correct small-T-behavior in contrast to an earlier theory in
Feynman's textbook on Statistical Mechanics, in which the special role of the
ground state was ignored. The results are compared with an exact quantum
mechanical treatment. Furthermore, we derive the finite-size effect of the
system.
