Recently it was discovered that non-Gaussian decoherence processes, such as
phase-diffusion, can be counteracted by purification and distillation protocols
that are solely built on Gaussian operations. Here, we make use of this
experimentally highly accessible regime, and provide a detailed experimental
and theoretical analysis of several strategies for purification/distillation
protocols on phase-diffused squeezed states. Our results provide valuable
information for the optimization of such protocols with respect to the choice
of the trigger quadrature, the trigger threshold value and the probability of
generating a distilled state.
