We point out some properties of the amplitude of the dipion transition
$\Upsilon(3S) \to \Upsilon(1S) \pi \pi$ in relation to the recently reported
results of a CLEO analysis of form factors in this amplitude. We find that the
reported significant complex phase between two of the form factors under the
assumption that the third form factor is zero, is not consistent with the
picture where the phase shifts arise due to the final state interaction in the
$\pi \pi$ channel. It is also shown that in an analysis that uses no
information on the polarization of both the initial and the final $\Upsilon$
resonances it is impossible in principle to determine all the relevant terms.
We suggest that a study of a simple correlation between the direction of the
total momentum of the two pions and the axis of the initial beams is sufficient
to resolve the ambiguity in the fit for the form factors.
