A recent experiment by Brida et al. (arXiv:0705.0439 [quant-ph]) is analyzed
with the conclusion that is shows a violation of standard quantum predictions.
A simple local hidden variables model is studied which is compatible with the
empirical results and fits fairly well the deviation from the quantum
predictions.
