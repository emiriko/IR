Recently proposed theories based on the cosmic presence of a vectorial field
are compared and contrasted. In particular the so called Einstein aether theory
is discussed in parallel with a recent proposal of a strained space-time theory
(Cosmic Defect theory). We show that the latter fits reasonably well the cosmic
observed data with only one, or at most two, adjustable parameters, whilst
other vector theories use much more. The Newtonian limits are also compared.
Finally we show that the CD theory may be considered as a special case of the
aether theories, corresponding to a more compact and consistent paradigm.
