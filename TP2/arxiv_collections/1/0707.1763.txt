Violation of Bell's Inequalities gives experimental evidence for the
existence of a spin 1/2 which has two simultaneous axes of spin quantization
rather than one. These couple to form a resonance state, called the spin
fringe, and this quantum effect is solely responsible for violation of Bell's
Inequalities within this model. The Bell states can be represented by products
of these spin states and leads to the intuitive concept that as entangled
states decompose they form biparticles that are not entangled. In EPR
coincidence experiments filter settings for both the Bell and CHSH forms of
Bell's Inequalities are rationalized in terms of the correlation between
biparticles.
