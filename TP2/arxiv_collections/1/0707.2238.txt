This paper proposes a method to calculate the largest Regular Dextrous
Workspace (RDW) of some types of three-revolute orthogonal manipulators that
have at least one of their DH parameters equal to zero. Then a new performance
index based on the RDW is introduced, the isocontours of this index are plotted
in the parameter space of the interesting types of manipulators and finally an
inspection of the domains of the parameter spaces is conducted in order to
identify the better manipulator architectures. The RDW is a part of the
workspace whose shape is regular (cube, cylinder) and the performances
(conditioning index) are bounded inside. The groups of 3R orthogonal
manipulators studied have interesting kinematic properties such as, a
well-connected workspace that is fully reachable with four inverse kinematic
solutions and that does not contain any void. This study is of high interest
for the design of alternative manipulator geometries.
