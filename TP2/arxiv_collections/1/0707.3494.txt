Jets produced in nucleus-nucleus collisions at the LHC are expected to be
strongly modified due to the interaction of the parton shower with the dense
QCD matter. Here, we point out that jet quenching can leave signatures not only
in the longitudinal and transverse jet energy and multiplicity distributions,
but also in the hadrochemical composition of the jet fragments. In particular,
we show that even in the absence of medium effects at or after hadronization,
the medium-modification of the parton shower can result in significant changes
in jet hadrochemistry. We discuss how jet hadrochemistry can be studied within
the high-multiplicity environment of nucleus-nucleus collisions at the LHC.
