We present a brief review of the cohomological solutions of self-coupling
interactions of the fields in the free Yang-Mills theory. All consistent
interactions among the fields have been obtained using the antifield formalism
through several order BRST deformations of the master equation. It is found
that the coupling deformations halt exclusively at the second order, whereas
higher order deformations are obstructed due to non-local interactions. The
results demonstrate the BRST cohomological derivation of the interacting
Yang-Mills theory.
