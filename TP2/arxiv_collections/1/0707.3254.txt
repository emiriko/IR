Using the same induction on energy argument in both frequency space and
spatial space simultaneously as in \cite{CKSTT07}, \cite{RyV05} and
\cite{Vi05}, we obtain global well-posedness and scattering of energy solutions
of defocusing energy-critical nonlinear Hartree equation in $\mathbb{R}\times
\mathbb{R}^n$($n\geq 5$), which removes the radial assumption on the data in
\cite{MiXZ07a}. The new ingredients are that we use a modified long time
perturbation theory to obtain the frequency localization (Proposition
\ref{freqdelocaimplystbound} and Corollary \ref{frequencylocalization}) of the
minimal energy blow up solutions, which can not be obtained from the classical
long time perturbation and bilinear estimate and that we obtain the spatial
concentration of minimal energy blow up solution after proving that
$L^{\frac{2n}{n-2}}_x$-norm of minimal energy blow up solutions is bounded from
below, the $L^{\frac{2n}{n-2}}_x$-norm is larger than the potential energy.
