This report is a brief review of the recent work on architectures for the
prospective hybrid CMOS/nanowire/ nanodevice ("CMOL") circuits including
digital memories, reconfigurable Boolean-logic circuits, and mixed-signal
neuromorphic networks. The basic idea of CMOL circuits is to combine the
advantages of CMOS technology (including its flexibility and high fabrication
yield) with the extremely high potential density of molecular-scale
two-terminal nanodevices. Relatively large critical dimensions of CMOS
components and the "bottom-up" approach to nanodevice fabrication may keep CMOL
fabrication costs at affordable level. At the same time, the density of active
devices in CMOL circuits may be as high as 1012 cm2 and that they may provide
an unparalleled information processing performance, up to 1020 operations per
cm2 per second, at manageable power consumption.
