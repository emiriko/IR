The Nash Equilibrium is a much discussed, deceptively complex, method for the
analysis of non-cooperative games. If one reads many of the commonly available
definitions the description of the Nash Equilibrium is deceptively simple in
appearance. Modern research has discovered a number of new and important
complex properties of the Nash Equilibrium, some of which remain as
contemporary conundrums of extraordinary difficulty and complexity. Among the
recently discovered features which the Nash Equilibrium exhibits under various
conditions are heteroclinic Hamiltonian dynamics, a very complex asymptotic
structure in the context of two-player bi-matrix games and a number of
computationally complex or computationally intractable features in other
settings. This paper reviews those findings and then suggests how they may
inform various market prediction strategies.
