Using the methods of Kang et al. and recent results on the characters of
Kirillov-Reshetikhin modules by Nakajima and Hernandez, the existence of
Kirillov-Reshetikhin crystals B^{r,s} is established for all nonexceptional
affine types. We also prove that the crystals B^{r,s} of type B_n^{(1)},
D_n^{(1)}, and A_{2n-1}^{(2)} are isomorphic to recently constructed
combinatorial crystals for r not a spin node.
