We describe the thermal and electrical conductivities of quasi-one
dimensional wires, across a quantum phase transition from a superconductor to a
metal induced by pairbreaking perturbations. Fluctuation corrections to BCS
theory motivate a field theory for quantum criticality. We describe deviations
in the Wiedemann-Franz ratio from the Lorenz number, which can act as sensitive
tests of the theory. We also describe the crossovers out of the quantum
critical region into the metallic and superconducting phases.
