The identification of jets resulting from the fragmentation and hadronization
of b quarks is an important part of high-pT collider physics. The methods used
by the CDF and DO collaborations to perform this identification are described,
including the calibration of the efficiencies and fake rates. Some thoughts on
the application of these methods in the LHC environment are also presented.
