The basic building blocks for Resonant Tunnelling Diode (RTD) logic circuits
are Threshold Gates (TGs) instead of the conventional Boolean gates (AND, OR,
NAND, NOR) due to the fact that, when designing with RTDs, threshold gates can
be implemented as efficiently as conventional ones, but realize more complex
functions. Recently, RTD structures implementing Multi-Threshold Threshold
Gates (MTTGs) have been proposed which further increase the functionality of
the original TGs while maintaining their operating principle and allowing also
the implementation of nanopipelining at the gate level. This paper describes
the design of n-bit adders using these MTTGs. A comparison with a design based
on TGs is carried out showing advantages in terms of latency, device counts and
power consumption.
