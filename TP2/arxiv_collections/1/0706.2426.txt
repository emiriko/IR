Multiply nested finite harmonic sums $S_{a_1 ... a_n}(N)$ occur in many
single scale higher order calculations in Quantum Field Theory. We discuss
their algebraic and structural relations to weight {\sf w=6}. As an example, we
consider the application of these relations to the soft and virtual corrections
for Bhabha-scattering to $O(\alpha^2)$.
