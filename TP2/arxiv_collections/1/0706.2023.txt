Electric fields in a plasma that conducts a high-current pulse are measured
as a function of time and space. The experiment is performed using a coaxial
configuration, in which a current rising to 160 kA in 100 ns is conducted
through a plasma that prefills the region between two coaxial electrodes. The
electric field is determined using laser spectroscopy and line-shape analysis.
Plasma doping allows for 3D spatially resolved measurements. The measured peak
magnitude and propagation velocity of the electric field is found to match
those of the Hall electric field, inferred from the magnetic-field front
propagation measured previously.
