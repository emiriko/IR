A self-trapped Bose-Einstein condensate is shown to be stabilized in
two-dimensional free space by Rabi oscillations between two hyperfine states
which make an effective interatomic interaction oscillate in time. The
stabilization mechanism is elucidated by using a two-component Gross-Pitaevskii
equation combined with a variational analysis. The parameter regime of
stability is investigated.
