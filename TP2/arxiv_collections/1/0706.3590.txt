Recent experiments have revealed the role of staggered Dzialoshinskii-Moriya
interaction in the magnetized phase of an antiferromagnetic spin 1/2 two-leg
ladder compound under a uniform magnetic field. We derive a low energy
effective field theory describing a magnetized two-leg ladder with a weak
staggered Dzialoshinskii-Moriya interaction. This theory predicts the
persistence of the spin gap in the magnetized phase, in contrast to standard
two-leg ladders, and the presence of bound states in the excitation spectrum.
Such bound states are observable in Raman scattering measurements. These
results are then extended to intermediate Dzialoshinskii-Moriya interaction
using Exact Diagonalizations.
