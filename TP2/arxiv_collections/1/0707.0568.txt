In this two-parts paper we propose a decentralized strategy, based on a
game-theoretic formulation, to find out the optimal precoding/multiplexing
matrices for a multipoint-to-multipoint communication system composed of a set
of wideband links sharing the same physical resources, i.e., time and
bandwidth. We assume, as optimality criterion, the achievement of a Nash
equilibrium and consider two alternative optimization problems: 1) the
competitive maximization of mutual information on each link, given constraints
on the transmit power and on the spectral mask imposed by the radio spectrum
regulatory bodies; and 2) the competitive maximization of the transmission
rate, using finite order constellations, under the same constraints as above,
plus a constraint on the average error probability. In Part I of the paper, we
start by showing that the solution set of both noncooperative games is always
nonempty and contains only pure strategies. Then, we prove that the optimal
precoding/multiplexing scheme for both games leads to a channel diagonalizing
structure, so that both matrix-valued problems can be recast in a simpler
unified vector power control game, with no performance penalty. Thus, we study
this simpler game and derive sufficient conditions ensuring the uniqueness of
the Nash equilibrium. Interestingly, although derived under stronger
constraints, incorporating for example spectral mask constraints, our
uniqueness conditions have broader validity than previously known conditions.
Finally, we assess the goodness of the proposed decentralized strategy by
comparing its performance with the performance of a Pareto-optimal centralized
scheme. To reach the Nash equilibria of the game, in Part II, we propose
alternative distributed algorithms, along with their convergence conditions.
