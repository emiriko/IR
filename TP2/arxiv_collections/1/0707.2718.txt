In order to optimize the costs and time of design of the new products while
improving their quality, concurrent engineering is based on the digital model
of these products, the numerical model. However, in order to be able to avoid
definitively physical model, old support of the design, without loss of
information, new tools must be available. Especially, a tool making it possible
to check simply and quickly the maintainability of complex mechanical sets
using the numerical model is necessary. Since one decade, our team works on the
creation of tool for the generation and the analysis of trajectories of virtual
mannequins. The simulation of human tasks can be carried out either by
robot-like simulation or by simulation by motion capture. This paper presents
some results on the both two methods. The first method is based on a
multi-agent system and on a digital mock-up technology, to assess an efficient
path planner for a manikin or a robot for access and visibility task taking
into account ergonomic constraints or joint and mechanical limits. In order to
solve this problem, the human operator is integrated in the process
optimization to contribute to a global perception of the environment. This
operator cooperates, in real-time, with several automatic local elementary
agents. In the case of the second approach, we worked with the CEA and EADS/CCR
to solve the constraints related to the evolution of human virtual in its
environment on the basis of data resulting from motion capture system. An
approach using of the virtual guides was developed to allow to the user the
realization of precise trajectory in absence of force feedback. The result of
this work validates solutions through the digital mock-up; it can be applied to
simulate maintenability and mountability tasks.
