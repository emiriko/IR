The cross section for e+e- to pi+ pi- psi(2S) between threshold and
\sqrt{s}=5.5 GeV is measured using 673 fb^{-1} of data on and off the
\Upsilon(4S) resonance collected with the Belle detector at KEKB. Two resonant
structures are observed in the pi+ pi- psi(2S) invariant mass distribution, one
at 4361\pm 9\pm 9 MeV/c2 with a width of 74\pm 15\pm 10 MeV/c2, and another at
4664\pm 11\pm 5 MeV/c2 with a width of 48\pm 15\pm 3 MeV/c2, if the mass
spectrum is parameterized with the coherent sum of two Breit-Wigner functions.
These values do not match those of any of the known charmonium states.
