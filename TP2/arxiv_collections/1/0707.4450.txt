The Landau-Pollak uncertainty relation treats a pair of rank one projection
valued measures and imposes a restriction on their probability distributions.
It gives a nontrivial bound for summation of their maximum values. We give a
generalization of this bound (weak version of the Landau-Pollak uncertainty
relation). Our generalization covers a pair of positive operator valued
measures. A nontrivial but slightly weak inequality that can treat an arbitrary
number of positive operator valued measures is also presented.
