We propose to revisit the diffusion of atoms in the Knudsen regime in terms
of a complex dynamical reflection process. By means of molecular dynamics
simulation we emphasize the asymptotic nature of the cosine law of reflection
at the atomic scale, and carefully analyze the resulting strong correlations in
the reflection events. A dynamical interpretation of the accomodation
coefficient associated to the slip at the wall interface is also proposed.
Finally, we show that the first two moments of the stochastic process of
reflection non uniformly depend on the incident angle.
