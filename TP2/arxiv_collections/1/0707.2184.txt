Recent reports on intense-field pump-probe experiments for high harmonic
generation from coherently rotating linear molecules, have revealed remarkable
characteristic effects of the simultaneous variation of the polarization
geometry and the time delay on the high harmonic signals. We analyze the
effects and give a unified theoretical account of the experimental observations
