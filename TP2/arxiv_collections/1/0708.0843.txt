We obtain analytical expressions for the eigenstates and the Landau level
spectrum of biased graphene bilayers in a magnetic field. The calculations are
performed in the context of a four-band continuum model and generalize previous
approximate results. Solutions are presented for the spectrum as a function of
interlayer coupling, the potential difference between the layers and the
magnetic field. The explicit expressions allow us to calculate the oscillator
strength and the selection rules for electric dipole transitions between the
Landau states. Some transitions are significantly shifted in energy relative to
those in an unbiased bialyer and exhibit a very different magnetic field
dependence.
