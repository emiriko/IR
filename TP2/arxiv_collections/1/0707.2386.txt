Using the first-principles spin density functional approach, we have studied
magnetism of a new type of all-carbon nanomaterials, i.e., the carbon nanowires
inserted into the single-walled carbon nanotubes. It is found that if the 1D
carbon nanowire density is not too higher, the ferromagnetic ground state will
be more stable than the antiferromagnetic one, which is caused by weak coupling
between the 1D carbon nanowire and the single-walled carbon nanotube. Also,
both dimerization of the carbon nanowire and carbon vacancy on the tube-wall
are found to enhance the magnetic moment of the composite.
