Within the concept of the dinuclear system (DNS), a dynamical model is
proposed for describing the formation of superheavy nuclei in complete fusion
reactions by incorporating the coupling of the relative motion to the nucleon
transfer process. The capture of two heavy colliding nuclei, the formation of
the compound nucleus and the de-excitation process are calculated by using an
empirical coupled channel model, solving a master equation numerically and
applying statistical theory, respectively. Evaporation residue excitation
functions in cold fusion reactions are investigated systematically and compared
with available experimental data. Maximal production cross sections of
superheavy nuclei in cold fusion reactions with stable neutron-rich projectiles
are obtained. Isotopic trends in the production of the superheavy elements
Z=110, 112, 114, 116, 118 and 120 are analyzed systematically. Optimal
combinations and the corresponding excitation energies are proposed.
