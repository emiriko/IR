Microscopic state counting for a black hole in Loop Quantum Gravity yields a
result proportional to horizon area, and inversely proportional to Newton's
constant and the Immirzi parameter. It is argued here that before this result
can be compared to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of a macroscopic black hole,
the scale dependence of both Newton's constant and the area must be accounted
for. The two entropies could then agree for any value of the Immirzi parameter,
if a certain renormalization property holds.
