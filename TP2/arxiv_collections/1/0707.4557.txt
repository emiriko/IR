Usually it is supposed that Majorana neutrino produced in the superposition
state $\chi_L = \nu_L + (\nu_L)^c$ and then follows the neutrinoless double
beta decay. But since weak interactions are chiral invariant then the neutrino
at production has definite helicity (i.e., $\nu_L$ and $(\nu_L)^c$ neutrinos
are separately produced and then neutrino is not in the superposition state).
This helicity cannot change after production without any external interactions.
Thus we see that for unsuitable helicity the neutrinoless double $\beta$ decay
is not possible even if neutrino is a Majorana particle. Also transition of
Majorana neutrino into antineutrino at their oscillations is forbidden since
helicity in vacuum holds. Then only possibility to prove that neutrino is a
Dirac but not Majorana particle is detection transition of $\nu_L$ neutrino
into (sterile) antineutrino $\bar\nu_R$ (i.e., $\nu_L \to \bar\nu_R$) at
neutrino oscillations. Transition Majora neutrino $\nu_L$ into $(\nu_R)^c$
(i.e., $\nu_L \to (\nu_R)^c$) at oscillations is unobserved since it is
supposed that mass of $(\nu_R)^c$ is very big.
