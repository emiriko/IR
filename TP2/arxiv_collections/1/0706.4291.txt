Icosahedral shells undergo a buckling transition as the ratio of Young's
modulus to bending stiffness increases. Strong bending stiffness favors smooth,
nearly spherical shapes, while weak bending stiffness leads to a sharply
faceted icosahedral shape. Based on the phonon spectrum of a simplified
mass-and-spring model of the shell, we interpret the transition from smooth to
faceted as a soft-mode transition. In contrast to the case of a disclinated
planar network where the transition is sharply defined, the mean curvature of
the sphere smooths the transitition. We define elastic susceptibilities as the
response to forces applied at vertices, edges and faces of an icosahedron. At
the soft-mode transition the vertex susceptibility is the largest, but as the
shell becomes more faceted the edge and face susceptibilities greatly exceed
the vertex susceptibility. Limiting behaviors of the susceptibilities are
analyzed and related to the ridge-scaling behavior of elastic sheets. Our
results apply to virus capsids, liposomes with crystalline order and other
shell-like structures with icosahedral symmetry.
