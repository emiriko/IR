The Hamiltonian Mean-Field model has been investigated, since its
introduction about a decade ago, to study the equilibrium and dynamical
properties of long-range interacting systems. Here we study the long-time
behavior of long-lived, out-of-equilibrium, quasi-stationary dynamical states,
whose lifetime diverges in the thermodynamic limit. The nature of these states
has been the object of a lively debate, in the recent past. We introduce a new
numerical tool, based on the fluctuations of the phase of the instantaneous
magnetization of the system. Using this tool, we study the quasi-stationary
states that arise when the system is started from different classes of initial
conditions, showing that the new observable can be exploited to compute the
lifetime of these states. We also show that quasi-stationary states are present
not only below, but also above the critical temperature of the second order
magnetic phase transition of the model. We find that at supercritical
temperatures the lifetime is much larger than at subcritical temperatures.
