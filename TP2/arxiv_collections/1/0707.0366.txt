Let $ X: M \hook S^5$ be a compact Legendrian surface in pseudoconformal(CR)
5-sphere. We introduce a pseudoconformally invariant Willmore type second order
functional $ \W(X)$, and study its critical points called Willmore Legendrian
surfaces. The fifth order structure equations show that Willmore dual can be
defined for a class of Willmore Legendrian surfaces. Moreover when this dual is
constant, Willmore Legendrian surface admits a Weierstra\ss type representation
in terms of immersed meromorphic curve in $ \C^2$ satisfying an appropriate
real period condition via pseudoconformal stereographic projection. We show
that every compact Riemann surface admits a generally one to one, conformal,
Willmore Legendrian immersion in $ S^5$ with constant Willmore dual. As a
corollary, every compact Riemann surface can be conformally immersed in $ \C^2$
as an exact, algebraic Lagrangian surface.
