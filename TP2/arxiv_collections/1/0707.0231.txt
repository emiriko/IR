We investigate the shot noise limited sensitivity of a four-mirror cavity
enhanced Michelson interferometer. The intention of this interferometer
topology is the reduction of thermal lensing and the impact of the
interferometers contrast although transmissive optics are used with high
circulating powers. The analytical expressions describing the light fields and
the frequency response are derived. Although the parameter space has 11
dimensions, a detailed analysis of the resonance feature gives boundary
conditions allowing systematic parameter studies.
