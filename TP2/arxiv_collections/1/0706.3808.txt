Birefringence phenomenon for deuteron with energy up 20 MeV in carbon target
is considered. The estimation for spin dichroism and for angle of rotation of
polarization plane of deuterons is presented. It is shown that magnitude of the
phenomenon strongly depends on behavior of the deuteron wave functions on small
distance between nucleon in deuteron.
