A charged Higgs boson is a clear signal for an extended Higgs sector, as for
example predicted by supersymmetry. Squark mixing can significantly change the
pattern of charged-Higgs production and most notably circumvent the chiral
suppression for single Higgs production. We evaluate the LHC discovery
potential in the light of flavor physics, in the single-Higgs production
channel and in association with a hard jet for small and moderate values of tan
beta. Thoroughly examining current flavor constraints we find that non-minimal
flavor structures can have a sizeable impact, but tend to predict moderate
production rates. Nevertheless, charged-Higgs searches will probe flavor
structures not accessible to rare kaon, bottom, or charm experiments, and can
invalidate the assumption of minimal flavor violation.
