In this paper I show how the second law of thermodynamics, generalized to
include event horizon area, places interesting constraints on the value of the
fine structure constant. A simple analysis leads to the conclusion that
classical Dirac and point-like magnetic monopoles could be used to violate the
second law, and that GUT monopoles are inconsistent with minicharged particles.
