Controlled charge pumping in an AlGaAs/GaAs gated nanowire by
single-parameter modulation is studied experimentally and theoretically.
Transfer of integral multiples of the elementary charge per modulation cycle is
clearly demonstrated. A simple theoretical model shows that such a quantized
current can be generated via loading and unloading of a dynamic quasi-bound
state. It demonstrates that non-adiabatic blockade of unwanted tunnel events
can obliterate the requirement of having at least two phase-shifted periodic
signals to realize quantized pumping. The simple configuration without multiple
pumping signals might find wide application in metrological experiments and
quantum electronics.
