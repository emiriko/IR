We investigate theoretically the magnetic spin-flip transitions of neutral
atoms trapped near a superconducting slab. Our calculations are based on a
quantum-theoretical treatment of electromagnetic radiation near dielectric and
metallic bodies. Specific results are given for rubidium atoms near a niobium
superconductor. At the low frequencies typical of the atomic transitions, we
find that BCS theory greatly overestimates coherence effects, which are much
less pronounced when quasiparticle lifetime effects are included through
Eliashberg theory. At 4.2 K, the typical atomic spin lifetime is found to be
larger than a thousand seconds, even for atom-superconductor distances of one
micrometer. This constitutes a large enhancement in comparison with normal
metals.
