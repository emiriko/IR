By applying the standard adiabatic approximation and using the accurate
analytical expression for the corresponding local chemical potential obtained
in our previous work [Phys. Rev. A \textbf{75}, 063610 (2007)] we derive an
effective 1D equation that governs the axial dynamics of mean-field
cigar-shaped condensates with repulsive interatomic interactions, accounting
accurately for the contribution from the transverse degrees of freedom. This
equation, which is more simple than previous proposals, is also more accurate.
Moreover, it allows treating condensates containing an axisymmetric vortex with
no additional cost. Our effective equation also has the correct limit in both
the quasi-1D mean-field regime and the Thomas-Fermi regime and permits one to
derive fully analytical expressions for ground-state properties such as the
chemical potential, axial length, axial density profile, and local sound
velocity. These analytical expressions remain valid and accurate in between the
above two extreme regimes. Following the same procedure we also derive an
effective 2D equation that governs the transverse dynamics of mean-field
disk-shaped condensates. This equation, which also has the correct limit in
both the quasi-2D and the Thomas-Fermi regime, is again more simple and
accurate than previous proposals. We have checked the validity of our equations
by numerically solving the full 3D Gross-Pitaevskii equation.
