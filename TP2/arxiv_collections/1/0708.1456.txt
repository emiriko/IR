A novel nanostructured electrochemical immunsensor for the determination of
progesterone is reported. The approach combines the properties of gold
nanoparticles with the use of a graphite-Teflon composite electrode matrix,
into which gold nanoparticles are incorporated by simple physical inclusion.
The antibody anti-progesterone was directly attached to the electrode surface.
The immunosensor functioning is based on competitive assay between progesterone
and alkaline phosphatase-labelled progesterone. Monitoring of the affinity
reaction was accomplished by the electrochemical oxidation of 1-naphtol.
Modification of the graphite -Teflon electrode matrix with gold nanoparticles
improves substantially the electrooxidation response of 1-naphtol. Using a
detection potential of +0.3V, a detection limit for progesterone of 0.84 ng
ml-1 was obtained. Analysis of seven milk samples spiked at a 3.5 ng ml-1
progesterone concentration level yielded a mean recovery of 101+6%. Detection
of the antigen-antibody reaction with a graphite - Teflon - colloidal - gold -
Tyrosinase electrode, using phenylphosphate as alkaline phosphatase substrate
to generate phenol, which is subsequently reduced at -0.1 V at the composite
electrode, produced a high improvement in the sensitivity for progesterone
