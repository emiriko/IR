We consider a physical system with a coupling to bosonic reservoirs via a
quantum stochastic differential equation. We study the limit of this model as
the coupling strength tends to infinity. We show that in this limit the
solution to the quantum stochastic differential equation converges strongly to
the solution of a limit quantum stochastic differential equation. In the
limiting dynamics the excited states are removed and the ground states couple
directly to the reservoirs.
