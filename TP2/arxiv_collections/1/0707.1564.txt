We investigated the electronic response of the quasi-two-dimensional spin gap
compound La4Ru2O10 using optical spectroscopy. We observed drastic changes in
the optical spectra as the temperature decreased, resulting in anisotropy in
the electronic structure of the spin-singlet ground state. Using the
orbital-dependent hopping analysis, we found that orbital ordering plays a
crucial role in forming the spin gap state in the non-one-dimensional material.
