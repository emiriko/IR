The ground state entanglement entropy between block of sites in the random
Ising chain is studied by means of the Von Neumann entropy. We show that in
presence of strong correlations between the disordered couplings and local
magnetic fields the entanglement increases and becomes larger than in the
ordered case. The different behavior with respect to the uncorrelated
disordered model is due to the drastic change of the ground state properties.
The same result holds also for the random 3-state quantum Potts model.
