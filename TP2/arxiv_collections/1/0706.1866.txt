Recent theoretical progress in understanding high-energy scattering beyond
the mean field approximation is reviewed. The role of Lorentz invariance and
pomeron loops in the evolution, the relation between high-energy QCD and
statistical physics and results for the saturation momentum and the scattering
amplitude are discussed.
