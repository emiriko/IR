Viewing Dehn's algorithm as a rewriting system, we generalise to allow an
alphabet containing letters which do not necessarily represent group elements.
This extends the class of groups for which the algorithm solves the word
problem to include nilpotent groups, many relatively hyperbolic groups
including geometrically finite groups and fundamental groups of certain
geometrically decomposable manifolds. The class has several nice closure
properties. We also show that if a group has an infinite subgroup and one of
exponential growth, and they commute, then it does not admit such an algorithm.
We dub these Cannon's algorithms.
