Fluctuation and dissipation dynamics is examined at all temperature ranges
for the general case of a background time evolving scalar field coupled to
heavy intermediate quantum fields which in turn are coupled to light quantum
fields. The evolution of the background field induces particle production from
the light fields through the action of the intermediate catalyzing heavy
fields. Such field configurations are generically present in most particle
physics models, including Grand Unified and Supersymmetry theories, with
application of this mechanism possible in inflation, heavy ion collision and
phase transition dynamics. The effective evolution equation for the background
field is obtained and a fluctuation-dissipation theorem is derived for this
system. The effective evolution in general is nonlocal in time. Appropriate
conditions are found for when these time nonlocal effects can be approximated
by local terms. Here careful distinction is made between a local expansion and
the special case of a derivative expansion to all orders, which requires
analytic behavior of the evolution equation in Fourier space.
