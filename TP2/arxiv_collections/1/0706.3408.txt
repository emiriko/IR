For finite volume field theories with discrete translational invariance,
conserved currents can be additively renormalized by infrared effects. We
demonstrate this for pions using chiral perturbation theory coupled to
electromagnetism in a periodic box. Gauge invariant single particle effective
theories are constructed to explain these results. In such theories, current
renormalization arises from operators involving the zero mode of the gauge
field. No contradictions with Ward identities, or low-energy theorems are
encountered.
