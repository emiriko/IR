The Critical Pomeron solution of high-energy unitarity leads to a unique
underlying massless field theory that might be the origin of the Standard
Model. A color sextet quark sector - producing both electroweak symmetry
breaking and dark matter - is added to QCD to saturate asymptotic freedom. The
sextet sector is then embedded uniquely in ``QUD'' - an anomaly free, just
asymptotically free, massless SU(5) theory with elementary lepton and triplet
quark sectors very close to the Standard Model. A multi-regge bound-state
S-Matrix is constructed using infra-red divergent scaling reggeon interactions
that couple via massless fermion chiral anomalies. Within the QCD sub-sector
there is an ``anomalous wee gluon'' critical phenomenon that produces a
spectrum with confinement and chiral symmetry breaking. The exponentiation of
left-handed gauge boson divergences implies that the full set of composite
interactions and the low-mass spectrum of QUD could be just those of the
Standard Model. All particles, including neutrinos, appear as massive,
Goldstone boson related, bound-states and there is no Higgs field. The
different coupling strengths, multiple mass scales, and multigenerational
structure should also appear. The Critical Pomeron may be the S-Matrix
manifestation of the underlying fixed-point field theory.
  If QUD underlies the Standard Model as described, the sextet sector should
produce new, unmistakeable, large cross-sections at the LHC, for which the
pomeron could be the main diagnostic!
