We study the dynamics of periodic arrays of micrometer-sized liquid-gas
menisci formed at superhydrophobic surfaces immersed into water. By measuring
the intensity of optical diffraction peaks in real time we are able to resolve
nanometer scale oscillations of the menisci with sub-microsecond time
resolution. Upon driving the system with an ultrasound field at variable
frequency we observe a pronounced resonance at a few hundred kHz, depending on
the exact geometry. Modeling the system using the unsteady Stokes equation, we
find that this low resonance frequency is caused by a collective mode of the
acoustically coupled oscillating menisci.
