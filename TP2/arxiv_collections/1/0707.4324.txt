The additivity principle of the extreme shell model stipulates that an
average value of a one-body operator be equal to the sum of the core
contribution and effective contributions of valence (particle or hole)
nucleons. For quadrupole moment and angular momentum operators, we test this
principle for highly and superdeformed rotational bands in the A~130 nuclei.
Calculations are done in the self-consistent cranked non-relativistic
Hartree-Fock and relativistic Hartree mean-field approaches. Results indicate
that the additivity principle is a valid concept that justifies the use of an
extreme single-particle model in an unpaired regime typical of high angular
momenta.
