Phase slips creation in the thin film in perpendicular magnetic filed with
edge superconductivity is studied. These centers are due to thermal activation
of the order parameter below superconducting temperature transition leading to
the suppression of the superconductivity. The corresponding resistance is
calculated. The Alsamazov- Larkin correction to the conductivity above the
critical magnetic field destroying the surface superconductivity is studied.
Such structures could be applied as a new system for the study of the phase
slip phenomenon in one- dimensional superconducting wires.
