The design of a spherical wrist with parallel architecture is the object of
this article. This study is part of a larger project, which aims to design and
to build an eel robot for inspection of immersed piping. The kinematic analysis
of the mechanism is presented first to characterize the singular configurations
as well as the isotropic configurations. We add the design constraints related
to the application, such as (i) the compactness of the mechanism, (ii) the
symmetry of the elements in order to ensure static and dynamic balance and
(iii) the possibility of the mechanism to fill the elliptic form of the ell
sections.
