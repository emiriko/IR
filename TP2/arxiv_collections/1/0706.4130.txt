In recent years, advances in computational power and spatial data analysis
(GIS, remote sensing, etc) have led to an increase in attempts to model the
spread and behvaiour of wildland fires across the landscape. This series of
review papers endeavours to critically and comprehensively review all types of
surface fire spread models developed since 1990. This paper reviews models of a
simulation or mathematical analogue nature. Most simulation models are
implementations of existing empirical or quasi-empirical models and their
primary function is to convert these generally one dimensional models to two
dimensions and then propagate a fire perimeter across a modelled landscape.
Mathematical analogue models are those that are based on some mathematical
conceit (rather than a physical representation of fire spread) that
coincidentally simulates the spread of fire. Other papers in the series review
models of an physical or quasi-physical nature and empirical or quasi-empirical
nature. Many models are extensions or refinements of models developed before
1990. Where this is the case, these models are also discussed but much less
comprehensively.
