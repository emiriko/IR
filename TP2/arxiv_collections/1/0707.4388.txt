We report the observation of superstructures associated with the oxygen
2p-states in two prototypical manganites using x-ray diffraction at the oxygen
K-edge. We determine the nature of the orderings and discuss our picture with
respect to novel theoretical models. In the stripe order system Bi0.31 Ca0.69
MnO3, hole-doped O states are found to be orbitally ordered, at the same
propagation vector as the Mn orbital ordering, but no evidence is found to
support a picture of oxygen charge stripes at this periodicity. In La 7/8 Sr
1/8 MnO3, we observe a 2p charge ordering described by alternating hole-poor
and hole-rich MnO planes that is consistent with recent predictions.
