We examine the relation between the recently proposed time-dependent quantum
Monte Carlo (TDQMC) method and the principles of stochastic quantization. In
both TDQMC and stochastic quantization particle motion obeys stochastic
guidance equations to preserve quantum equilibrium. In this way the probability
density of the Monte Carlo particles corresponds to the modulus square of the
many-body wave function at all times. However, in TDQMC the motion of particles
and guide waves occurs in physical space unlike in stochastic quantization
where it occurs in configuration space. Hence the practical calculation of time
evolution of many-body fully correlated quantum systems becomes feasible within
the TDQMC methodology. We illustrate the TDQMC technique by calculating the
symmetric and antisymmetric ground state of a model one-dimensional Helium
atom, and the time evolution of the dipole moment when the atom is irradiated
by a strong ultrashort laser pulse.
