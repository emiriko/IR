We present experimental results attempting to fingerprint nonanalyticities in
the magnetization curves of spin glasses found by Katzgraber et al. [Phys. Rev.
Lett. 89, 257202 (2002)] via zero-temperature Monte Carlo simulations of the
Edwards-Anderson Ising spin glass. Our results show that the singularities at
zero temperature due to the reversal-field memory effect are washed out by the
finite temperatures of the experiments. The data are analyzed via the first
order reversal curve (FORC) magnetic fingerprinting method. The experimental
results are supported by Monte Carlo simulations of the Edwards-Anderson Ising
spin glass at finite temperatures which agree qualitatively very well with the
experimental results. This suggests that the hysteretic behavior of real Ising
spin-glass materials is well described by the Edwards-Anderson Ising spin
glass. Furthermore, reversal-field memory is a purely zero-temperature effect.
