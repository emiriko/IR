The littlest Higgs model with T-parity predicts the existence of the T-odd
particles, which can only be produced in pair. We consider pair production of
the T-odd leptons in future high energy linear $e^{+}e^{-}$ collider ($ILC$).
Our numerical results show that, as long as the T-odd leptons are not too
heavy, they can be copiously produced and their possible signals might be
detected via the processes $e^{+}e^{-}\to \bar{L}_{i}L_{j}$ in future $ILC$
experiments.
