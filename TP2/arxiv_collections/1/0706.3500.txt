We introduce some applications of Stein's method in the high temperature
analysis of spin glasses. Stein's method allows the direct analysis of the
Gibbs measure without having to create a cavity. Another advantage is that it
gives limit theorems with total variation error bounds, although the bounds can
be suboptimal. A surprising byproduct of our analysis is a relatively
transparent explanation of the Thouless-Anderson-Palmer system of equations.
Along the way, we develop Stein's method for mixtures of two Gaussian
densities.
