The self-organized growth of Co nanoparticles with 10 nm periodicity was
achieved at room temperature on a Ag(001) surface patterned by an underlying
dislocation network, as shown by real time, in situ Grazing Incidence Small and
Wide Angle X-ray Scattering. The misfit dislocation network, buried at the
interface between a 5nm-thick Ag thin film and a MgO(001) substrate, induces a
periodic strain field on top of the surface. Nucleation and growth of Co on
tensile areas are found as the most favorable sites as highlighted by Molecular
Dynamic simulations.
