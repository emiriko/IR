The CHORUS experiment, designed to search for $\nu_{\mu}\to\nu_{\tau}$
oscillations, consists of a nuclear emulsion target and electronic detectors.
In this paper, results on the production of charged particles in a small sample
of charged-current neutrino-- and anti-neutrino--nucleus interactions at high
energy are presented. For each event, the emission angle and the ionization
features of the charged particles produced in the interaction are recorded,
while the standard kinematic variables are reconstructed using the electronic
detectors. The average multiplicities for charged tracks, the pseudo-rapidity
distributions, the dispersion in the multiplicity of charged particles and the
KNO scaling are studied in different kinematical regions. A study of
quasi-elastic topologies performed for the first time in nuclear emulsions is
also reported. The results are presented in a form suitable for use in the
validation of Monte Carlo generators of neutrino--nucleus interactions.
