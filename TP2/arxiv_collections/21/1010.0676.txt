We apply novel jet techniques to investigate the spin and CP quantum numbers
of a heavy resonance X, singly produced in pp -> X -> ZZ -> l(+)l(-)jj at the
LHC. We take into account all dominant background processes to show that this
channel, which has been considered unobservable until now, can qualify under
realistic conditions to supplement measurements of the purely leptonic decay
channels X -> ZZ -> 4l. We perform a detailed investigation of spin- and
CP-sensitive angular observables on the fully-simulated final state for various
spin and CP quantum numbers of the state X, tracing how potential sensitivity
communicates through all the steps of a subjet analysis. This allows us to
elaborate on the prospects and limitations of performing such measurements with
the semihadronic final state. We find our analysis particularly sensitive to a
CP-even or CP-odd scalar resonance, while, for tensorial and vectorial
resonances, discriminative features are diminished in the boosted kinematical
regime.
