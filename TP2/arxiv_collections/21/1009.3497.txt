These lecture notes are devoted to formal and phenomenological aspects of
F-theory. We begin with a pedagogical introduction to the general concepts of
F-theory, covering classic topics such as the connection to Type IIB
orientifolds, the geometry of elliptic fibrations and the emergence of gauge
groups, matter and Yukawa couplings. As a suitable framework for the
construction of compact F-theory vacua we describe a special class of
Weierstrass models called Tate models, whose local properties are captured by
the spectral cover construction. Armed with this technology we proceed with a
survey of F-theory GUT models, aiming at an overview of basic conceptual and
phenomenological aspects, in particular in connection with GUT breaking via
hypercharge flux.
