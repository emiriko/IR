Radio astronomy has benefited greatly from advances in technology and will
continue to do so in the future. In fact, we are experiencing a revolution in
the way radio astronomy is conducted as our instruments allow us now to
directly "digitize" our photons. This has enormous consequences, since we can
greatly benefit from the continuing advances in digital electronics,
telecommunication and computing. The results are dramatic increase in
observable bandwidths, FoVs, frequency coverage and collecting area. The global
efforts will culminate in the construction of the SKA as the world's largest
and most powerful telescope. On the way projects like LOFAR, LEAP and others
will revolutionize many areas of astrophysics and fundamental physics.
Observations of pulsars will play a central role in these scientific
endeavours. We briefly summarize here some recent scientific developments that
help us in defining our expectations for the the new generation of radio
telescopes for pulsar astrophysics.
