We have studied the fragment production mechanism in the set of four
reactions 197Au79+12C6, 197Au79+26Al13, 197Au79+63Cu29 and 197Au79+208Pb82. The
reactions are simulated at an energy 600 MeV/nucleon and collision geometry is
varied from central to peripheral (= b/bmax = 0 to 1). A theoretical
investigation has been carried out on the study of mass dependence of
intermediate mass fragments (5\leqA\leqAtot/6) and other fragments. It is
observed that multiplicity shows a good agreement for low Zbound, but it fails
for high Zbound. This failure is due the method of analysis MST which we had
used in our analysis, because MST method gives one heavy cluster at the time of
high density. The discrepancy between theory and experiments can be removed by
using reduced isospin dependent NN cross section and sophisticated
clustrization algorithm SACA.
