We present an update on our on-going project to compute hadronic observables
for Nf=2 flavours of O(a) improved Wilson fermions at small lattice spacings.
The procedure to determine the lattice scale via the mass of the Omega baryon
is described. Furthermore we present preliminary results for the pion form
factor computed using twisted boundary conditions, and report on the
implementation of a novel approach to determine the contribution of the
hadronic vacuum polarisation to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon.
