Recently it has been suggested that an enhancement in the visibility of ghost
images obtained with thermal light can be achieved exploiting higher order
correlations [3]. This paper reports on the status of an higher order ghost
imaging experiment carried on at INRIM labs exploiting a pseudo-thermal source
and a CCD camera.
