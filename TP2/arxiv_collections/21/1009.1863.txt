We consider the asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) on the integers in
which the initial density at a site (the probability that it is occupied) is
given by a periodic function on the positive integers. (When the function is
constant this is the step Bernoulli initial condition.) Starting with a result
in earlier work we find a formula for the probability distribution for a given
particle at a given time which is a sum over positive integers k of integrals
of order k.
