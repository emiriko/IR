We show the detector blinding attack by Lydersen et al [1] will be
ineffective on most single photon avalanche photodiodes (APDs) and certainly
ineffective on any detectors that are operated correctly. The attack is only
successful if a redundant resistor is included in series with the APD, or if
the detector discrimination levels are set inappropriately.
