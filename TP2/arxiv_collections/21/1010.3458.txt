In this paper it is shown that a CR embedding from one strictly pseudoconvex
hypersurface into another (of strictly larger dimension) sends chains on the
source to chains on the target if and only if the embedding has a lift to a
conformal isometry of the associated Fefferman bundles with vanishing
pseudo-Riemannian second fundamental form. When the target is a sphere these
conditions simplify nicely.
