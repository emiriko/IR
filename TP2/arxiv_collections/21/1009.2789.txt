In this paper, we present an explicit substitution calculus which
distinguishes between ordinary bound variables and meta-variables. Its typing
discipline is derived from contextual modal type theory. We first present a
dependently typed lambda calculus with explicit substitutions for ordinary
variables and explicit meta-substitutions for meta-variables. We then present a
weak head normalization procedure which performs both substitutions lazily and
in a single pass thereby combining substitution walks for the two different
classes of variables. Finally, we describe a bidirectional type checking
algorithm which uses weak head normalization and prove soundness.
