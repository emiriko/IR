We study the thermodynamic properties of the 3D Hubbard model for
temperatures down to the Neel temperature using cluster dynamical mean-field
theory. In particular we calculate the energy, entropy, density, double
occupancy and nearest-neighbor spin correlations as a function of chemical
potential, temperature and repulsion strength. To make contact with cold-gas
experiments, we also compute properties of the system subject to an external
trap in the local density approximation. We find that an entropy per particle
$S/N \approx 0.65(6)$ at $U/t=8$ is sufficient to achieve a Neel state in the
center of the trap, substantially higher than the entropy required in a
homogeneous system. Precursors to antiferromagnetism can clearly be observed in
nearest-neighbor spin correlators.
