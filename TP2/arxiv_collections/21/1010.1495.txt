In this comment we show that the avian compass entanglement considerations of
J. Cai, G. G. Guerreschi and H. J. Briegel (Phys. Rev. Lett. 104, 220502
(2010)) result in unphysical predictions on the magnetic sensitivity of this
biochemical sensor. As well known from a series of papers on precision
measurements and detailed derivations of standard quantum limits, not taking
into account decoherence results in an overestimate of the entanglement
lifetime, and this is the case at hand. The entanglement lifetime is wrongly
assumed by the authors to be independent of the reaction time (the inverse of
the recombination rate) and hence it is grossly overestimated. This is so
because the spin coherence lifetime is limited by the reaction time, and the
entanglement lifetime cannot be any longer.
