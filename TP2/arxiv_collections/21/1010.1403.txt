We use data from the SDSS to investigate the evolution of the large-scale
galaxy bias as a function of luminosity for red galaxies. We carefully consider
correlation functions of galaxies selected from both photometric and
spectroscopic data, and cross-correlations between them, to obtain multiple
measurements of the large-scale bias. We find, for our most robust analyses, a
strong increase in bias with luminosity for the most luminous galaxies, an
intermediate regime where bias does not evolve strongly over a range of two
magnitudes in galaxy luminosity, and no evidence for an upturn in bias for
fainter red galaxies. Previous work has found an increase in bias to low
luminosities that has been widely interpreted as being caused by a strong
preference for red dwarf galaxies to be satellites in the most massive halos.
We can recover such an upturn in bias to faint luminosities if we push our
measurements to small scales, and include galaxy clustering measurements along
the line-of-sight, where we expect non-linear effects to be the strongest. The
results that we expect to be most robust suggest that the low luminosity
population of red galaxies is not dominated by satellite galaxies occupying the
most massive haloes.
