We study the post-main sequence stars in NGC 604, the most luminous HII
region in M33. Previously, a number of Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars and one red
supergiant (RSG) have been discovered. Based on broadband photometry of the
region, we present evidence that is consistent with the presence of this RSG
and with three more RSG candidates. Using SED fitting based on HST UVIJHK
photometry we estimate the ages of the WR stars and RSGs finding that the two
populations are from distinct formation episodes with ages 3.2$\pm%1.0Myrs and
12.4$\pm$2.1Myrs, respectively. The RSGs have greater extinctions towards their
line of sight than the WR stars consistent with the RSGs producing large amount
of dust. Using the WR and RSG populations and similar SED fits to the most
massive O stars we estimate that the total stellar mass is (3.8 $\pm$ 0.6) x
10^5Msun. We find a large discrepancy between the expected H{\alpha} flux from
such a massive cluster and that one observed. This suggests that 49 (+16,-19)
percent of the ionizing photons produced by massive stars in NGC 604 is leaking
from this HII region. We also suggest that the implications of an old RSG
population mean that if NGC 604 was more distant and only observed in the
infrared (IR) it would be difficult to study the youngest burst of star
formation due to the contamination of RSGs.
