In recent years, ideas from statistics and scientific computing have begun to
interact in increasingly sophisticated and fruitful ways with ideas from
computer science and the theory of algorithms to aid in the development of
improved worst-case algorithms that are useful for large-scale scientific and
Internet data analysis problems. In this chapter, I will describe two recent
examples---one having to do with selecting good columns or features from a (DNA
Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) data matrix, and the other having to do with
selecting good clusters or communities from a data graph (representing a social
or information network)---that drew on ideas from both areas and that may serve
as a model for exploiting complementary algorithmic and statistical
perspectives in order to solve applied large-scale data analysis problems.
