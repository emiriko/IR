In this paper, we attempt to give a sufficient condition of guaranteeing the
validity of the proof of the quantum adiabatic theorem. The new sufficient
condition can clearly remove the inconsistency and the counterexample of the
quantum adiabatic theorem pointed out by Marzlin and Sanders [Phys. Rev. Lett.
93, 160408, (2004)].
