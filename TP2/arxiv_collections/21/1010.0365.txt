Experiments in superfluid 4He show that at low temperatures, energy
dissipation from moving vortices is many orders of magnitude larger than
expected from mutual friction. Here we investigate other mechanisms for energy
loss by a computational study of a vortex that moves through and reconnects
with a mesh of small vortices pinned to the container wall. We find that such
reconnections enhance energy loss from the moving vortex by a factor of up to
100 beyond that with no mesh. The enhancement occurs through two different
mechanisms, both involving the Kelvin oscillations generated along the vortex
by the reconnections. At relatively high temperatures the Kelvin waves increase
the vortex motion, leading to more energy loss through mutual friction. As the
temperature decreases, the vortex oscillations generate additional reconnection
events between the moving vortex and the wall, which decrease the energy of the
moving vortex by transfering portions of its length to the pinned mesh on the
wall.
