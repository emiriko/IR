The Spectral and Photometric Imaging Receiver (SPIRE) on Herschel has been
carrying out deep extragalactic surveys, one of whose aims is to establish
spectral energy distributions (SED)s of individual galaxies spanning the
infrared/submillimeter (IR/SMM) wavelength region. We report observations of
the (IR/SMM) emission from the Lockman North field (LN) and Great Observatories
Origins Deep Survey field North (GOODS-N). Because galaxy images in the
wavelength range covered by Herschel generally represent a blend with
contributions from neighboring galaxies, we present sets of galaxies in each
field especially free of blending at 250, 350, and 500 microns. We identify the
cumulative emission of these galaxies and the fraction of the far infrared
cosmic background radiation they contribute. Our surveys reveal a number of
highly luminous galaxies at redshift z ~< 3 and a novel relationship between
infrared and visible emission that shows a dependence on luminosity and
redshift.
