Ionization fronts, the sharp radiation fronts behind which H/He ionizing
photons from massive stars and galaxies propagate through space, were
ubiquitous in the universe from its earliest times. The cosmic dark ages ended
with the formation of the first primeval stars and galaxies a few hundred Myr
after the Big Bang. Numerical simulations suggest that stars in this era were
very massive, 25 - 500 solar masses, with H II regions of up to 30,000
light-years in diameter. We present three-dimensional radiation hydrodynamical
calculations that reveal that the I-fronts of the first stars and galaxies were
prone to violent instabilities, enhancing the escape of UV photons into the
early intergalactic medium (IGM) and forming clumpy media in which supernovae
later exploded. The enrichment of such clumps with metals by the first
supernovae may have led to the prompt formation of a second generation of
low-mass stars, profoundly transforming the nature of the first protogalaxies.
Cosmological radiation hydrodynamics is unique because ionizing photons coupled
strongly to both gas flows and primordial chemistry at early epochs,
introducing a hierarchy of disparate characteristic timescales whose relative
magnitudes can vary greatly throughout a given calculation. We describe the
adaptive multistep integration scheme we have developed for the self-consistent
transport of both cosmological and galactic ionization fronts.
