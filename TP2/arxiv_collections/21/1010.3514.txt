Computer experiments concerning interactions between a graphite surface and
the rigid pyramidal nanoasperity of a friction force microscope tip when it is
brought close to and retracted from the graphitic sample are presented.
Covalent atomic bonds in graphene layers are described using a Brenner
potential and tip-carbon forces are derived from the Lennard-Jones potential.
For interlayer interactions a registry-dependent potential with local normals
is used. The behavior of the system is investigated under conditions of
different magnitudes of tip-sample interaction and indentation rates. Strong
forces between the nanoasperity and carbon atoms facilitate the cleavage of the
graphite surface. Exfoliation, i. e. total removal of the upper graphitic
layer, is observed when a highly adhesive tip is moved relative to the surface
at low rates, while high rates cause the formation of a small flake attached to
the tip. The results obtained may be valuable for enhancing our understanding
of the superlubricity of graphite.
