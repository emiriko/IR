Two competing theories posit that Ultra Compact Dwarfs (UCDs) form either as
the stripped nuclei of dwarf galaxies or as giant globular clusters (GGCs)
associated with the largest globular cluster (GC) systems. By focussing on the
field and group environments where young UCDs may be most common, we have
discovered the first UCD that is clearly the result of recent (<4 Gyr ago)
stripping of a companion galaxy. However, we have also found a definitive case
of a multiple-UCD system created via GC formation processes, which are likely
associated with major galaxy mergers. We demonstrate that it is possible to
reliably distinguish the two types of UCD, thereby probing both the major and
minor merger histories of individual galaxies.
