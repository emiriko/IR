We calculate the ground--state energy and other physical properties of the
hydrogen atom inside a spherical box with an impenetrable wall. We apply the
variational method and perturbation theory and compare both approximate
results. We show that the total, kinetic and potential energies for the
moving--nucleus model are greater than those for the case in which the nucleus
is clamped at the box center.
