In this paper, we discuss the large--time behavior of solution of a simple
kinetic model of Boltzmann--Maxwell type, such that the temperature is time
decreasing and/or time increasing. We show that, under the combined effects of
the nonlinearity and of the time--monotonicity of the temperature, the kinetic
model has non trivial quasi-stationary states with power law tails. In order to
do this we consider a suitable asymptotic limit of the model yielding a
Fokker-Planck equation for the distribution. The same idea is applied to
investigate the large-time behavior of an elementary kinetic model of economy
involving both exchanges between agents and increasing and/or decreasing of the
mean wealth. In this last case, the large-time behavior of the solution shows a
Pareto power law tail. Numerical results confirm the previous analysis.
