Two-dimensional statistically stationary isotropic turbulence with an imposed
uniform scalar gradient is investigated. Dimensional arguments are presented to
predict the inertial range scaling of the turbulent scalar flux spectrum in
both the inverse cascade range and the enstrophy cascade range for small and
unity Schmidt numbers. The scaling predictions are checked by direct numerical
simulations and good agreement is observed.
