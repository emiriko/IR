With the exceptional progress e-VLBI has achieved over the last three years,
the VLBI of the future has already started. At least for the EVN, it is argued
that at some point all VLBI operations should be done in e-VLBI mode. This
ambition is based on the scientific case that is described in the EVN2015
science vision. At the same time, it should be taken into account that the
long-term future of radio astronomy is connected to the development of the SKA.
The consensus in the community is that there is a scientific case for Very Long
Baseline Interferometry in the next decade, and synergy with the technology
development for the SKA and its pathfinders should be explored to enhance the
VLBI capabilities. It is noteworthy that e- VLBI has been recognised as a SKA
pathfinder. Here, I review the progress with e-VLBI, and the options to enhance
the sensitivity and operational efficiency of the EVN and global VLBI arrays,
including the options for future correlators. In the coming years, through the
new NEXPReS effort, new ways are about to get introduced to enhance e-VLBI
operations further to the level that all experiments can benefit from an e-VLBI
component.
