We present observations of high temperature emission in the core of a solar
active region using instruments on Hinode and SDO. These multi-instrument
observations allow us to determine the distribution of plasma temperatures and
follow the evolution of emission at different temperatures. We find that at the
apex of the high temperature loops the emission measure distribution is
strongly peaked near 4 MK and falls off sharply at both higher and lower
temperatures. Perhaps most significantly, the emission measure at 0.5 MK is
reduced by more than two orders of magnitude from the peak at 4 MK. We also
find that the temporal evolution in broad-band soft X-ray images is relatively
constant over about 6 hours of observing. Observations in the cooler SDO/AIA
bandpasses generally do not show cooling loops in the core of the active
region, consistent with the steady emission observed at high temperatures.
These observations suggest that the high temperature loops observed in the core
of an active region are close to equilibrium. We find that it is possible to
reproduce the relative intensities of high temperature emission lines with a
simple, high-frequency heating scenario where heating events occur on time
scales much less than a cooling time. In contrast, low-frequency heating
scenarios, which are commonly invoked to describe nanoflare models of coronal
heating, do not reproduce the relative intensities of high temperature emission
lines and predict low-temperature emission that is approximately an order of
magnitude too large. We also present an initial look at images from the SDO/AIA
94 A channel, which is sensitive to Fe XVIII.
