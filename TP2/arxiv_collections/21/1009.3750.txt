We present the IACOB spectroscopic database, the largest homogeneous database
of high-resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio spectra of Northern Galactic
OB-type stars compiled up to date. The spectra were obtained with the FIES
spectrograph attached to the Nordic Optical Telescope. We briefly summarize the
main characeristics and present status of the IACOB, first scientific results,
and some future plans for its extension and scientific exploitation.
