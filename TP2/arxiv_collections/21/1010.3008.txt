The apparent presence of large core radii in Low Surface Brightness galaxies
has been claimed as evidence in favor of warm dark matter. Here we show that
WDM halos do not have cores that are large fractions of the halo size:
typically, r_core/r_200 < 0.001. This suggests an astrophysical origin for the
large cores observed in these galaxies, as has been argued by other authors.
