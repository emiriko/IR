We consider the radial migration of vortices in two-dimensional isothermal
gaseous disks. We find that a vortex core, orbiting at the local gas velocity,
induces velocity perturbations that propagate away from the vortex as density
waves. The resulting spiral wave pattern is reminiscent of an embedded planet.
There are two main causes for asymmetries in these wakes: geometrical effects
tend to favor the outer wave, while a radial vortensity gradient leads to an
asymmetric vortex core, which favors the wave at the side that has the lowest
density. In the case of asymmetric waves, which we always find except for a
disk of constant pressure, there is a net exchange of angular momentum between
the vortex and the surrounding disk, which leads to orbital migration of the
vortex. Numerical hydrodynamical simulations show that this migration can be
very rapid, on a time scale of a few thousand orbits, for vortices with a size
comparable to the scale height of the disk. We discuss the possible effects of
vortex migration on planet formation scenarios.
