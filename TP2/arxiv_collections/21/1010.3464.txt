We discover weak antilocalization effect of two-dimensional electron gas with
one electric subband occupied in the inversion layer on p-type HgCdTe crystal.
By fitting the model of Iordanskii, Lyanda-Geller and Pikus to data at varies
temperatures and gate voltages, we extract phase coherence and spin-orbit
scattering times as functions of temperature and carrier density. We find that
Elliot-Yafet mechanism and Nyquist mechanism are the dominating spin
decoherence and dephasing mechanisms, respectively. We also find that the
Rashba parameter is relatively large and the dependence of Rashba parameter
upon carrier density is not monotonic and an optimal carrier density exists for
the maximization of spin-orbit coupling.
