We invoke the time-dependent non-crossing approximation in order to study the
effects of the density of states of gold contacts on the instantaneous
conductance of a single electron transistor which is abruply moved into the
Kondo regime by means of a gate voltage. For an asymmetrically coupled system,
we observe that the instantaneous conductance in the Kondo timescale exhibits
beating with distinct frequencies, which are proportional to the separation
between the Fermi level and the sharp features in the density of states of
gold. Increasing the ambient temperature or bias quenches the amplitude of the
oscillations. We attribute the oscillations to interference between the
emerging Kondo resonance and van-Hove singularities in the density of state. In
addition, we propose an experimental realization of this model.
