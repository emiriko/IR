The total reaction cross section $\sigma_{\rm{reac}}$ is a valuable measure
for the prediction of $\alpha$-induced reaction cross sections within the
statistical model and for the comparison of scattering of tightly bound
projectiles to weakly bound and exotic projectiles. Here we provide the total
reaction cross sections $\sigma_{\rm{reac}}$ derived from our previously
published angular distributions of $\alpha$-elastic scattering on $^{89}$Y,
$^{92}$Mo, $^{112,124}$Sn, and $^{144}$Sm at energies around the Coulomb
barrier.
