Experimental results of direct measurement of resonant monochromatic
terahertz emission optically excited in InGaAs transistor channels are
presented. The emission is attributed to two-dimensional plasma waves excited
by photogeneration of electron-hole pairs in the channel at the frequency $f_0$
of the beating of two cw-laser sources. The presence of resonances for the
radiation emission in the range of $f_0\pm 10$ GHz (with $f_0$ from 0.3 up to
0.5 THz) detected by a Si-bolometer is found. Numerical results support that
such a high quality of the emission resonances can be explained by the approach
of an instability in the transistor channel.
