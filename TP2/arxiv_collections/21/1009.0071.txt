We present Ks, H & J-band photometry of the very highly irradiated hot
Jupiter WASP-12b using the Wide-field Infrared Camera on the
Canada-France-Hawaii telescope. Our photometry brackets the secondary eclipse
of WASP-12b in the Ks and H-bands, and in J-band starts in mid-eclipse and
continues until well after the end of the eclipse. We detect its thermal
emission in all three near-infrared bands. Our secondary eclipse depths are
0.309 +/- 0.013% in Ks-band (24-sigma), 0.176 +/- 0.020% in H-band (9-sigma)
and 0.131 +/- 0.028% in J-band (4-sigma). All three secondary eclipses are
best-fit with a consistent phase that is compatible with a circular orbit. By
combining our secondary eclipse times with others published in the literature,
as well as the radial velocity and transit timing data for this system, we show
that there is no evidence that WASP-12b is precessing at a detectable rate, and
show that its orbital eccentricity is likely zero. Our thermal emission
measurements also allow us to constrain the characteristics of the planet's
atmosphere; our Ks-band eclipse depth argues in favour of inefficient day to
nightside redistribution of heat and a low Bond albedo for this very highly
irradiated hot Jupiter. The J and H-band brightness temperatures are slightly
cooler than the Ks-band brightness temperature, and thus hint at the
possibility of a modest temperature inversion deep in the atmosphere of
WASP-12b; the high pressure, deep atmospheric layers probed by our J and H-band
observations are likely more homogenized than the higher altitude layer.
Lastly, our best-fit Ks-band eclipse has a marginally longer duration than
would otherwise be expected; this may be tentative evidence for material being
tidally stripped from the planet - as was predicted for this system by Li &
collaborators, and for which observational confirmation was recently arguably
provided by Fossati & collaborators.
