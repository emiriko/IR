We present a study of the bar fraction in the Coma cluster galaxies based on
a sample of ~190 galaxies selected from the SDSS-DR6 and observed with the
Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Advanced Camera for Survey (ACS). The
unprecedented resolution of the HST-ACS images allows us to explore the
presence of bars, detected by visual classification, throughout a luminosity
range of 9 mag (-23 < M_r < -14), permitting us to study the poor known region
of dwarf galaxies. We find that bars are hosted by galaxies in a tight range of
both luminosities (-22 < M_r < -17) and masses (10^9 < M*/Msun < 10^11). In
addition, we find that the bar fraction does not vary significantly when going
from the center to the cluster outskirts, implying that cluster environment
plays a second-order role in bar formation/evolution. The shape of the bar
fraction distribution with respect to both luminosity and mass is well matched
by the luminosity distribution of disk galaxies in Coma, indicating that bars
are good tracers of cold stellar disks.
