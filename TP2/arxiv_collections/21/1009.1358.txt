We use two-laser optical pumping on a continuous atomic fountain in order to
prepare cold cesium atoms in the same quantum ground state. A first laser
excites the F=4 ground state to pump the atoms toward F=3 while a second
pi-polarized laser excites the F=3 -> F'=3 transition of the D2 line to produce
Zeeman pumping toward m=0. To avoid trap states, we implement the first laser
in a 2D optical lattice geometry, thereby creating polarization gradients. This
configuration has the advantage of simultaneously producing Sisyphus cooling
when the optical lattice laser is tuned between the F=4 -> F'=4 and F=4 -> F'=5
transitions of the D2 line, which is important to remove the heat produced by
optical pumping. Detuning the frequency of the second pi-polarized laser
reveals the action of a new mechanism improving both laser cooling and state
preparation efficiency. A physical interpretation of this mechanism is
discussed.
