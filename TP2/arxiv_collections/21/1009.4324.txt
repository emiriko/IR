The integral expression for gravitational potential of a homogeneous circular
torus composed of infinitely thin rings is obtained. Approximate expressions
for torus potential in the outer and inner regions are found. In the outer
region a torus potential is shown to be approximately equal to that of an
infinitely thin ring of the same mass; it is valid up to the surface of the
torus. It is shown in a first approximation, that the inner potential of the
torus (inside a torus body) is a quadratic function of coordinates. The method
of sewing together the inner and outer potentials is proposed. This method
provided a continuous approximate solution for the potential and its
derivatives, working throughout the region.
