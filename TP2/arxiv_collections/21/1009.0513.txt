We have studied the impact of time-dependent learning capacities of players
in the framework of spatial prisoner's dilemma game. In our model, this
capacity of players may decrease or increase in time after strategy adoption
according to a step-like function. We investigated both possibilities
separately and observed significantly different mechanisms that form the
stationary pattern of the system. The time decreasing learning activity helps
cooperator domains to recover the possible intrude of defectors hence supports
cooperation. In the other case the temporary restrained learning activity
generates a cyclic dominance between defector and cooperator strategies, which
helps to maintain the diversity of strategies via propagating waves. The
results are robust and remain valid by changing payoff values, interaction
graphs or functions characterizing time-dependence of learning activity. Our
observations suggest that dynamically generated mechanisms may offer
alternative ways to keep cooperators alive even at very larger temptation to
defect.
