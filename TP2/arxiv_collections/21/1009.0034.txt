We consider the ordered and disordered dynamics for monolayers of rolling
self-interacting particles with an offset center of mass and a non-isotropic
inertia tensor. The rolling constraint is considered as a simplified model of a
very strong, but rapidly decaying bond with the surface, preventing application
of the standard tools of statistical mechanics. We show the existence and
nonlinear stability of ordered lattice states, as well as disturbance
propagation through and chaotic vibrations of these states. We also investigate
the dynamics of disordered gas states and show that there is a surprising and
robust linear connection between distributions of angular and linear velocity
for both lattice and gas states, allowing to define the concept of temperature.
