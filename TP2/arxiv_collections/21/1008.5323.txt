The results of DFT GGA calculations on oxygen molecules adsorbed upon the
(001) surface of uranium mononitride (UN) are presented and discussed. We
demonstrate that O2 molecules oriented parallel to the substrate can dissociate
either (i) spontaneously when the molecular center lies above the surface
hollow site or atop N ion, (ii) with the activation barrier when a molecule
sits atop the surface U ion. This explains fast UN oxidation in air.
