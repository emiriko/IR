We suggest and demonstrate an all-optical experimental setup to observe and
engineer entanglement oscillations of a pair of polarization qubits in a
non-Markovian channel. We generate entangled photon pairs by spontaneous
parametric downconversion (SPDC), and then insert a programmable spatial light
modulator in order to impose a polarization dependent phase-shift on the
spatial domain of the SPDC output and to create an effective non-Markovian
environment. Modulation of the enviroment spectrum is obtained by inserting a
spatial grating on the signal arm. In our experiment, programmable oscillations
of entanglement are achieved, with the maximally revived state that violates
Bell's inequality by 17 standard deviations.
