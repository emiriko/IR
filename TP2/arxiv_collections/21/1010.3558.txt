The CDF PYTHIA 6.2 Tune DW predictions of the LHC underlying event (UE) data
at 900 GeV and 7 TeV are examined in detail. The behavior of the UE at the LHC
is roughly what we expected. The new LHC PYTHIA 6.4 Tune Z1 does an even better
job describing the UE data at 900 GeV and 7 TeV. However, the modeling of
"min-bias" at the LHC (i.e. the overall inelastic cross section) is a very
different story. No model describes all the features of "min-bias" collisions
at 900 GeV and 7 TeV.
