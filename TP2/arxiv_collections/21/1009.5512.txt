We study the propagation of waves from the photosphere to the chromosphere of
sunspots. From time series of cospatial Ca II H (including its line blends)
intensity spectra and polarimetric spectra of Si I 1082.7 nm and He I 1083.0 nm
we retrieve the line-of-sight velocity at several heights. The analysis of the
phase difference and amplification spectra shows standing waves for frequencies
below 4 mHz and propagating waves for higher frequencies, and allows us to
infer the temperature and height where the lines are formed. Using these
observational data, we have constructed a model of sunspot, and we have
introduced the velocity measured with the photospheric Si I 1082.7 nm line as a
driver. The numerically propagated wave pattern fits reasonably well with the
observed using the lines formed at higher layers, and the simulations reproduce
many of the observed features. The observed waves are slow MHD waves
propagating longitudinally along field lines.
