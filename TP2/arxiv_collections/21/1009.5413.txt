We discuss a phenomenological model that describes results on diffractive pp
and pbar-p cross sections and event final states up to the Fermilab Tevatron
collider energy of 1.96 TeV and use it to make predictions for Large Hadron
Collider (LHC) collision energies up to 14 TeV and asymptotically as the pp
collision energy goes to infinity. The model is anchored in a saturation effect
observed in single diffraction dissociation that explains quantitatively the
factorization breaking observed in soft and hard pp and pbar-p diffractive
processes and in diffractive photoproduction and low Q-square deep inelastic
scattering.
