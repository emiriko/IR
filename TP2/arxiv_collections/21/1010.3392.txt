Structural behavior and equation of state of atomic and molecular crystal
phases of dense hydrogen at pressures up to 3.5 TPa are systematically
investigated with density functional theory. The results indicate that the
Vinet EOS model that fitted to low-pressure experimental data overestimates the
compressibility of dense hydrogen drastically when beyond 500 GPa. Metastable
multi-atomic molecular phases with weak covalent bonds are observed. When
compressed beyond about 2.8 TPa, these exotic low-coordinated phases become
competitive with the groundstate and other high-symmetry atomic phases. Using
nudged elastic band method, the transition path and the associated energy
barrier between these high-pressure phases are evaluated. In particular for the
case of dissociation of diatomic molecular phase into the atomic metallic Cs-IV
phase, the existent barrier might raise the transition pressure about 200 GPa
at low temperatures. Plenty of flat and broad basins on the energy surface of
dense hydrogen have been discovered, which should take a major responsibility
for the highly anharmonic zero point vibrations of the lattice, as well as the
quantum structure fluctuations in some extreme cases. At zero pressure, our
analysis demonstrates that all of these atomic phases of dense hydrogen known
so far are unquenchable.
  NOTE: In the previous version of this paper (1010.3392v1) we made a mistake
when evaluating the enthalpy of Cs-IV phase, which misled us to a conclusion
that taking the multi-atomic molecular phases as the ground-state. After
corrected this error, however, the atomic phase of Cs-IV becomes the static
structure with the lowest enthalpy. Current version not only includes a
substantial improvement of the previous one, but also contains many NEW
interesting topics that were not touched before.
