The adsorption of a bottle-brush polymer end-grafted with one chain end of
its backbone to a flat substrate surface is studied by Monte Carlo simulation
of a coarse-grained model, that previously has been characterized in the bulk,
assuming a dilute solution under good solvent conditions. Applying the bond
fluctuation model on the simple cubic lattice, we vary the backbone chain
length $N_b$ from $N_b=67$ to $N_b = 259$ effective monomeric units, the side
chain length $N$ from N=6 to N=48, and the grafting density $\sigma=1$, i.e.,
parameters that correspond well to the experimentally accessible range. When
the adsorption energy strength $\epsilon$ is varied, we find that the
adsorption transition (which becomes well-defined in the limit $N_b \rightarrow
\infty$, for arbitrary finite $N$) roughly occurs at the same value
$\epsilon_c$ as for ordinary linear chains (N=0), at least within our
statistical errors. Mean square end-to-end distances and gyration radii of the
side chains are obtained, as well as the monomer density profile in the
direction perpendicular to the adsorbing surface. We show that for longer side
chains the adsorption of bottle-brushes is a two step process, the decrease of
the perpendicular linear dimension of side chains with adsorption energy
strength can even be non-monotonic. Also the behavior of the static structure
factor $S(q)$ is analyzed, evidence for a quasi-two-dimensional scaling is
presented, and consequences for the interpretation of experiments are
discussed.
