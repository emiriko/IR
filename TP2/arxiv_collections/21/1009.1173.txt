As a continuation of our previous studies in 2007 and 2008, new photometric
observations of the T Tauri star TW Hya obtained by the MOST satellite and the
ASAS project over 40 days in 2009 with temporal resolution of 0.2 days are
presented. A wavelet analysis of the combined MOST-ASAS data provides a rich
picture of coherent, intermittent, variable-period oscillations, similarly as
discovered in the 2008 data. The periods (1.3 - 10 days) and systematic period
shortening on time scales of weeks can be interpreted within the model of
magneto-rotationally controlled accretion processes in the inner accretion disk
around the star. Within this model and depending on the assumed visibility of
plasma parcels causing the oscillations, the observed shortest-period
oscillation period may indicate the stellar rotation period of 1.3 or 2.6 d,
synchronized with the disk at 4.5 or 7.1 solar radii, respectively.
