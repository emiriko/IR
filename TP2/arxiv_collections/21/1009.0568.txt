Let S be a connected, compact and orientable surface of genus two having
exactly one boundary component. We study automorphisms of the Torelli complex
for S, and describe any isomorphism between finite index subgroups of the
Torelli group for S. More generally, we study superinjective maps from the
Torelli complex for S into itself, and show that any finite index subgroup of
the Torelli group for S is co-Hopfian.
