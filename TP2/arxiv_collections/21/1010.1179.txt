We report observation of the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) in high
mobility multi-terminal graphene devices, fabricated on a single crystal boron
nitride substrate. We observe an unexpected hierarchy in the emergent FQHE
states that may be explained by strongly interacting composite Fermions with
full SU(4) symmetric underlying degrees of freedom. The FQHE gaps are measured
from temperature dependent transport to be up 10 times larger than in any other
semiconductor system. The remarkable strength and unusual hierarcy of the FQHE
described here provides a unique opportunity to probe correlated behavior in
the presence of expanded quantum degrees of freedom.
