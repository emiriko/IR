Given a morphism from an affine semigroup Q to an arbitrary commutative
monoid, it is shown that every fiber possesses an affine stratification: a
partition into a finite disjoint union of translates of normal affine
semigroups. The proof rests on mesoprimary decomposition of monoid congruences
[arXiv:1107.4699] and a novel list of equivalent conditions characterizing the
existence of an affine stratification. The motivating consequence of the main
result is a special case of a conjecture due to Guo and the author
[arXiv:0908.3473, arXiv:1105.5420] on the existence of affine stratifications
for (the set of winning positions of) any lattice game. The special case proved
here assumes that the lattice game has finite mis\'ere quotient, in the sense
of Plambeck and Siegel [arXiv:math/0501315, arXiv:math/0609825v5].
