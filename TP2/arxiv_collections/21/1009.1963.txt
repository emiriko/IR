The LHCb Muon system performance is presented using cosmic ray events
collected in 2009. These events allowed to test and optimize the detector
configuration before the LHC start. The space and time alignment and the
measurement of chamber efficiency, time resolution and cluster size are
described in detail. The results are in agreement with the expected detector
performance.
