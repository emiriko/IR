We consider the problem of utility optimal scheduling in general
\emph{processing networks} with random arrivals and network conditions. These
are generalizations of traditional data networks where commodities in one or
more queues can be combined to produce new commodities that are delivered to
other parts of the network. This can be used to model problems such as
in-network data fusion, stream processing, and grid computing. Scheduling
actions are complicated by the \emph{underflow problem} that arises when some
queues with required components go empty. In this paper, we develop the
Perturbed Max-Weight algorithm (PMW) to achieve optimal utility. The idea of
PMW is to perturb the weights used by the usual Max-Weight algorithm to
``push'' queue levels towards non-zero values (avoiding underflows). We show
that when the perturbations are carefully chosen, PMW is able to achieve a
utility that is within $O(1/V)$ of the optimal value for any $V\geq1$, while
ensuring an average network backlog of $O(V)$.
