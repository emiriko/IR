First, we review existing attenuation models and discuss their causality
properties, which we believe to be essential for algorithms for inversion with
attenuated data. Then, we survey causality properties of common attenuation
models. We also derive integro-differential equations which the attenuated
waves are satisfying. In addition we discuss the ill--conditionness of the
inverse problem for calculating the unattenuated wave from the attenuated one.
