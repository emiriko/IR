We propose a scheme to couple NV centers in diamond through coplanar
waveguide resonators. The central conductor of the resonator is split into
several pieces which are coupled strongly with each other via simple capacitive
junctions or superconducting Josephson junctions. The NV centers are then put
at the junctions. The discontinuity at the junctions induces a large local
magnetic field, with which the NV centers are strongly coupled to the circuit
resonator. The coupling strength $g$ between the resonator and the NV center is
of order of $g/2\pi\sim 1$--$30\unit{MHz}$.
