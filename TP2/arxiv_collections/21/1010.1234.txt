The LR(1) Parser Generation System generates full LR(1) parsers that are
comparable in speed and size to those generated by LALR(1) parser generators,
such as yacc [5]. LR contains a number of novel feature. This paper discusses
three of them in detail: an LR(1) grammar specified automatic error recovery
algorithm, oracles, and generic tokens.
