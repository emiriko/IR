Searches for new physics by experimental collaborations represent a
significant investment in time and resources. Often these searches are
sensitive to a broader class of models than they were originally designed to
test. We aim to extend the impact of existing searches through a technique we
call 'recasting'. After considering several examples, which illustrate the
issues and subtleties involved, we present RECAST, a framework designed to
facilitate the usage of this technique.
