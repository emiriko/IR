When magnetic monopoles are introduced in plasma equations, the propagation
of electromagnetic waves is modified. In this work is shown that this
modification leads to the emergence of a ponderomotive force which induces a
magnetization of the plasma. As a result, a cyclotron frequency is induced in
electrons. This frequency is proportional to the square of the magnetic charge.
