Phase transitions with spontaneous symmetry breaking and vector order
parameter are considered in multidimensional theory of general relativity.
Covariant equations, describing the gravitational properties of topological
defects, are derived. The topological defects are classified in accordance with
the symmetry of the covariant derivative of the vector order parameter. The
abilities of the derived equations are demonstrated in application to the brane
world concept. New solutions of the Einstein equations with a transverse vector
order parameter are presented. In the vicinity of phase transition the
solutions are found analytically. Comparison with the commonly used scalar
multiplet approach demonstrates the advantages of the vector order parameter.
