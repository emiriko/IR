Several approaches have been used to search for dark matter in our galactic
disk, but with mixed results: {\em maybe yes and maybe no}. The prevailing
approach, integrating the Poisson-Boltzmann equation for tracer stars, has led
to more definitive results: {\em yes and no}. The touchstone {\em yes} analysis
of Bahcall et al. (1992) has subsequently been confirmed or refuted by various
other investigators. This has been our motivation for approaching the search
from a different direction: applying the Virial Theorem to extant data. We
conclude that the vertical density profile of the disk is not in a state of
equilbrium and, therefore, that the Poisson-Boltzmann approach is inappropriate
and it thereby leads to indefensible conclusions.
