The magnetocaloric effect or "magnetic Gr\"uneisen ratio"
$\Gamma_H=T^{-1}(dT/dH)_S$ quantifies the cooling or heating of a material when
an applied magnetic field is changed under adiabatic conditions. Recently this
property has attracted considerable interest in the field of quantum
criticality. Here we report the development of a low-frequency alternating
field technique which allows to perform continuous temperature scans of
$\Gamma_H(T)$ on small single crystals with very high precision and down to
very low temperatures. Measurements on doped YbRh$_2$Si$_2$ show that
$\Gamma_H(T)$ can be determined with this technique in a faster and much more
accurate way than by calculation from magnetization and specific heat
measurements.
