We consider the valence-bond-solid ground state of the q-deformed higher-spin
AKLT model (q-VBS state). We investigate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a
matrix (G matrix), which is constructed from the matrix product representation
of the q-VBS state. We compute the longitudinal and transverse spin-spin
correlation functions, and determine the correlation amplitudes and correlation
lengths for real q.
