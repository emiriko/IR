We present multidimensional simulations of the post-explosion hydrodynamics
in three different 15 solar mass supernova models with zero, 10^{-4} solar
metallicity, and solar metallicities. We follow the growth of the
Rayleigh-Taylor instability that mixes together the stellar layers in the wake
of the explosion. Models are initialized with spherically symmetric explosions
and perturbations are seeded by the grid. Calculations are performed in
two-dimensional axisymmetric and three-dimensional Cartesian coordinates using
the new Eulerian hydrodynamics code, CASTRO. We find as in previous work, that
Rayleigh-Taylor perturbations initially grow faster in 3D than in 2D. As the
Rayleigh-Taylor fingers interact with one another, mixing proceeds to a greater
degree in 3D than in 2D, reducing the local Atwood number and slowing the
growth rate of the instability in 3D relative to 2D. By the time mixing has
stopped, the width of the mixed region is similar in 2D and 3D simulations
provided the Rayleigh-Taylor fingers show significant interaction. Our results
imply that 2D simulations of light curves and nucleosynthesis in supernovae
(SNe) that die as red giants may capture the features of an initially
spherically symmetric explosion in far less computational time than required by
a full 3D simulation. However, capturing large departures from spherical
symmetry requires a significantly perturbed explosion. Large scale asymmetries
cannot develop through an inverse cascade of merging Rayleigh-Taylor
structures; they must arise from asymmetries in the initial explosion.
