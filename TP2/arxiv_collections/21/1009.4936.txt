If the present dark matter in the Universe annihilates into Standard Model
particles, it must contribute to the fluxes of cosmic rays that are detected on
the Earth, and in particular, to the observed gamma ray fluxes. The magnitude
of such contribution depends on the particular dark matter candidate, but
certain features of the produced photon spectra may be analyzed in a rather
model-independent fashion. In this work we provide the complete photon spectra
coming from WIMP annihilation into Standard Model particle-antiparticle pairs
obtained by extensive Monte Carlo simulations. We present results for each
individual annihilation channel and provide analytical fitting formulae for the
different spectra for a wide range of WIMP masses.
