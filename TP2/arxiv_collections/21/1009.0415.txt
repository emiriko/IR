We show that when photons in N-particle path entangled |N,0> + |0,N> state
undergo Bloch oscillations, they exhibit a periodic transition between
spatially bunched and antibunched states. The transition occurs even when the
photons are well separated in space. We study the scaling of the
bunching-antibunching period, and show it is proportional to 1/N.
