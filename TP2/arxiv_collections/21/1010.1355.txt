We present photometric and spectroscopic analysis of the bright detached
eclipsing binary BG Ind. The masses of the components are found to be 1.428 +-
0.008 and 1.293 +- 0.008 Msun and the radii to be 2.290+-0.017 and 1.680+-0.038
Rsun for primary and secondary stars, respectively. Spectra- and
isochrone-fitting coupled with color indices calibration yield
[Fe/H]=-0.2+-0.1. At an age of 2.65+-0.20 Gyr BG Ind is well advanced in the
main-sequence evolutionary phase - in fact, its primary is at TAMS or just
beyond it. Together with three similar systems (BK Peg, BW Aqr and GX Gem) it
offers an interesting opportunity to test the theoretical description of
overshooting in the critical mass range 1.2-1.5 Msun.
