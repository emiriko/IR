Our aim in this proposal is by using the Faraday's law of induction as a
simple lecture demonstration to measure the Earth's magnetic field (B). This
will also enable the students to learn about how electric power is generated
from the rotational motion. Obviously the idea is not original, yet it may be
attractive in the sense that no sophisticated devices are used.
