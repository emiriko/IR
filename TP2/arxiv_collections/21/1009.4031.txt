The analytical relations in position, momentum and four-dimensional spaces
are established for the expansion and one-range addition theorems of
relativistic complete orthonormal sets of exponential type spinor wave
functions and Slater spinor orbitals of arbitrary half-integral spin. These
theorems are expressed through the corresponding nonrelativistic expansion and
one-range addition theorems of the spin-0 particles introduced by the author.
The expansion and one-range addition theorems derived are especially useful for
the computation of multicenter integrals over exponential type spinor orbitals
arising in the generalized relativistic Dirac-Hartree-Fock-Roothaan theory when
the position, momentum and four-dimensional spaces are employed.
