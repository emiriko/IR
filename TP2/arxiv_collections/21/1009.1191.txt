We have studied the kinetics of cluster formation for dynamical systems of
dimensions up to $n=8$ interacting through elastic collisions or coalescence.
These systems could serve as possible models for gas kinetics, polymerization
and self-assembly. In the case of elastic collisions, we found that the cluster
size probability distribution undergoes a phase transition at a critical time
which can be predicted from the average time between collisions. This enables
forecasting of rare events based on limited statistical sampling of the
collision dynamics over short time windows. The analysis was extended to
L$^p$-normed spaces ($p=1,...,\infty$) to allow for some amount of
interpenetration or volume exclusion. The results for the elastic collisions
are consistent with previously published low-dimensional results in that a
power law is observed for the empirical cluster size distribution at the
critical time. We found that the same power law also exists for all dimensions
$n=2,...,8$, 2D L$^p$ norms, and even for coalescing collisions in 2D. This
broad universality in behavior may be indicative of a more fundamental process
governing the growth of clusters.
