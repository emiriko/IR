In the paper we present results based on the description of complex systems
in terms of self-organization processes of prime integer relations. Realized
through the unity of two equivalent forms, i.e., arithmetical and geometrical,
the description allows to transform the laws of a complex system in terms of
arithmetic into the laws of the system in terms of space and time. Possible
implications of the results are discussed.
