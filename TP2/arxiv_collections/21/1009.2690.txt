In the present universe visible and dark matter contribute comparable energy
density although they have different properties. This coincidence can be
elegantly explained if the dark matter relic density, originating from a dark
matter asymmetry, is fully determined by the baryon asymmetry. Thus the dark
matter mass is not arbitrary, rather becomes predictive. We realize this
scenario in baryon(lepton) number conserving models where two or more neutral
singlet scalars decay into two or three baryonic(leptonic) dark matter scalars,
and also decay into quarks(leptons) through other on-shell and/or off-shell
exotic scalar bilinears. The produced baryon(lepton) asymmetries in the dark
matter scalar and in the standard model quarks(leptons) are thus equal and
opposite. The dark matter mass can be predicted in a range from a few GeV to a
few TeV depending on the baryon(lepton) numbers of the decaying scalars and the
dark matter scalar. The dark matter scalar can interact with the visible matter
through the exchange of the standard model Higgs boson, opening a window for
the dark matter direct detection experiments. These models also provide
testable predictions in the searches for the exotic scalar bilinears at LHC.
