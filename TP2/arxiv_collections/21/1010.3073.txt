We analyze the electrical characteristics of a circuit consisting of a free
thin-film magnetic layer and source and drain electrodes that have opposite
magnetization orientations along the free magnet's two hard directions. We find
that when the circuit's current exceeds a critical value there is a sudden
resistance increase which can be large in relative terms if the currents to
source or drain are strongly spin polarized and the free magnet is thin. This
behavior can be partly understood in terms of a close analogy between the
magnetic circuit and a Josephson junction.
