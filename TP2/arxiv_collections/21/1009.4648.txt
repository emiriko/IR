Decades of improving data and extensive theoretical research have led to a
popular model of gamma-ray bursts. According to this model, a catastrophic
event in a stellar system results in the formation of a compact central engine,
which releases a fraction of a solar rest-mass energy within seconds in the
form of ultra-relativistic jets. Dissipation of the jets energy leads first to
prompt gamma-ray emission and later to a long lasting afterglow. Here I
summarize the introduction that I gave to the debate "where do we stand?" in
the conference "The Shocking Universe" held in Venice. This is a very brief
summary of my view of the facts that we are (almost) certain about, models that
are popular but may need rethinking, and main open questions.
