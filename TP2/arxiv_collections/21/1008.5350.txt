The well-known von Bahr--Esseen bound on the absolute $p$th moments of
martingales with $p\in(1,2]$ is extended to a large class of moment functions,
and now with a best possible constant factor (which depends on the moment
function). This result appears to be new even for the power moments. As an
application, measure concentration inequalities for separately Lipschitz
functions on product spaces are obtained. Relations with $p$-uniformly smooth
and $q$-uniformly convex normed spaces are discussed.
