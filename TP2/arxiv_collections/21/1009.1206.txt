Properties of proton resonances in $^{18}$Ne have been investigated
efficiently by utilizing a technique of proton resonant elastic scattering with
a $^{17}$F radioactive ion (RI) beam and a thick proton target. A
4.22~MeV/nucleon $^{17}$F RI beam was produced via a projectile-fragmentation
reaction, and subsequently separated by a Radioactive Ion Beam Line in Lanzhou
({\tt RIBLL}). Energy spectra of the recoiled protons were measured by two sets
of $\Delta$E-E silicon telescope at center-of-mass scattering angles of
$\theta_{c.m.}$$\approx$175${^\circ}$$\pm$5${^\circ}$,
$\theta_{c.m.}$$\approx$152${^\circ}$$\pm$8${^\circ}$, respectively. Several
proton resonances in $^{18}$Ne were observed, and their resonant parameters
have been determined by an $R$-matrix analysis of the differential cross
sections in combination with the previous results. The resonant parameters are
related to the reaction-rate calculation of the stellar
$^{14}$O($\alpha$,$p$)$^{17}$F reaction, which was thought to be the breakout
reaction from the hot CNO cycles into the $rp$-process in x-ray bursters. Here,
$J^\pi$=(3$^-$, 2$^-$) are tentatively assigned to the 6.15-MeV state which was
thought the key 1$^-$ state previously. In addition, a doublet structure at
7.05 MeV are tentatively identified, and its contribution to the resonant
reaction rate of $^{14}$O($\alpha$,$p$)$^{17}$F could be enhanced by at least
factors of about 4$\sim$6 in comparison with the previous estimation involving
only a singlet. The present calculated resonant rates are much larger than
those previous values, and it may imply that this breakout reaction could play
a crucial role under x-ray bursters conditions.
