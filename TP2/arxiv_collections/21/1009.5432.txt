Fractal structures emerge from statistical and hierarchical processes in
urban development or network evolution. In a class of efficient and robust
geographical networks, we derive the size distribution of layered areas, and
estimate the fractal dimension by using the distribution without huge
computations. This method can be applied to self-similar tilings based on a
stochastic process.
