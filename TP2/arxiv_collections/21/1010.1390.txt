The standard approach to determine the parameters of a resonance is based on
the study of the volume dependence of the energy spectrum. In this work we
study a non-linear sigma model coupled to a scalar field in which a resonance
emerges. Using an analysis method introduced recently, based on the concept of
probability distribution, it is possible to determine the mass and the width of
the resonance.
