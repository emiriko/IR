Epitaxial graphene on SiC possesses, quite remarkably, an electron spectrum
similar to that of freestanding samples. Yet, the coupling to the substrate,
albeit small, affects the quasiparticle properties. Combining \emph{ab initio}
calculations with symmetry analysis, we derive a modified Dirac-Weyl
Hamiltonian for graphene epilayers. While for the epilayer on the C-face the
Dirac cone remains almost intact, for epilayers on the Si-face the band
splitting is about 30\,meV. At certain energies, the Dirac bands are
significantly distorted by the resonant interaction with interface states,
which should lead to mobility suppression, especially on the Si-face.
