Modeling and analysis of interactions among services is a crucial issue in
Service-Oriented Computing. Composing Web services is a complicated task which
requires techniques and tools to verify that the new system will behave
correctly. In this paper, we first overview some formal models proposed in the
literature to describe services. Second, we give a brief survey of verification
techniques that can be used to analyse services and their interaction. Last, we
focus on the realizability and conformance of choreographies.
