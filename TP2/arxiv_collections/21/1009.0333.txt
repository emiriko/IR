Existence of a stationary mode for a Hamiltonian dynamic system of two point
vortexes with different signs on different latitudes of a uniform rotating
sphere complying with observed data is stated. It is shown that such mode
realization is possible only in the case when the more intensive cyclonic
vortex has greater latitude than that of the anticyclonic vortex. A criterion
of exponential instability of the stationary vortex mode taken into account
impact of the polar vortexes is obtained. Compliance of the theory to observed
data and reanalysis for coupled quasi-stationary systems of cyclonic and
anticyclonic atmosphere action centers above oceans in the Northern Hemisphere
is considered.
