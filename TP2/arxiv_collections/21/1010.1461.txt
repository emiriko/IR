[Abridged] Classical novae (CNe) represent the major class of supersoft X-ray
sources (SSSs) in the central region of our neighbouring galaxy M 31. We
performed a dedicated monitoring of the M 31 central region with XMM-Newton and
Chandra between Nov 2007 and Feb 2008 and between Nov 2008 and Feb 2009
respectively, in order to find SSS counterparts of CNe, determine the duration
of their SSS phase and derive physical outburst parameters. We systematically
searched our data for X-ray counterparts of CNe and determined their X-ray
light curves and spectral properties. We detected in total 17 X-ray
counterparts of CNe in M 31, only four of which were known previously. These
latter sources are still active 12.5, 11.0, 7.4 and 4.8 years after the optical
outburst. From the 17 X-ray counterparts 13 were classified as SSSs. Four novae
displayed short SSS phases (< 100 d). Based on these results and previous
studies we compiled a catalogue of all novae with SSS counterparts in M 31
known so far. We used this catalogue to derive correlations between the
following X-ray and optical nova parameters: turn-on time, turn-off time,
effective temperature (X-ray), t2 decay time and expansion velocity of the
ejected envelope (optical). Furthermore, we found a first hint for the
existence of a difference between SSS parameters of novae associated with the
stellar populations of the M 31 bulge and disk. Additionally, we conducted a
Monte Carlo Markov Chain simulation on the intrinsic fraction of novae with SSS
phase. This simulation showed that the relatively high fraction of novae
without detected SSS emission might be explained by the inevitably incomplete
coverage with X-ray observations in combination with a large fraction of novae
with short SSS states, as expected from the WD mass distribution. In order to
verify our results with an increased sample further monitoring observations are
needed.
