We extract the pole positions, hadronic and gamma-gamma widths of sigma and
f_0(980, from pi-pi and gamma-gamma scattering data using an improved analytic
K-matrix model. Our results favour a large gluon component for the sigma and a
\bar ss or/and gluon component for the f_0(980) but neither a large four-quark
nor a molecule component. Gluonium sigma_B production from J/psi, phi radiative
and D_s semi-leptonic decays are also discussed.
