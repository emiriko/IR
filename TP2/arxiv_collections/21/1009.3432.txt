We present new photometry for 323 of the globular clusters in NGC 5128
(Centaurus A), measured for the first time in the $g'r'i'z'$ filter system. The
color indices are calibrated directly to standard stars in the $g'r'i'z'$
system and are used to establish the fiducial mean colors for the blue and red
(low and high metallicity) globular cluster sequences. We also use
spectroscopically measured abundances to establish the conversion between the
most metallicity-sensitive colors ($(g'-r')_0$, $(g'-i')_0$) and metallicity,
[Fe/H].
