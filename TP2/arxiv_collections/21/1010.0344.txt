This paper tackles the problem of how two selfish users jointly determine the
operating point in the achievable rate region of a two-user Gaussian
interference channel through bargaining. In previous work, incentive conditions
for two users to cooperate using a simple version of Han-Kobayashi scheme was
studied and the Nash bargaining solution (NBS) was used to obtain a fair
operating point. Here a noncooperative bargaining game of alternating offers is
adopted to model the bargaining process and rates resulting from the
equilibrium outcome are analyzed. In particular, it is shown that the operating
point resulting from the formulated bargaining game depends on the cost of
delay in bargaining and how bargaining proceeds. If the associated bargaining
problem is regular, a unique perfect equilibrium exists and lies on the
individual rational efficient frontier of the achievable rate region. Besides,
the equilibrium outcome approaches the NBS if the bargaining costs of both
users are negligible.
