Graphane is a semiconductor with an energy gap, obtained from hydrogenation
of the two-dimensional grapheme sheet. Together with the two-dimensional
geometry, unique transport features of graphene, and possibility of doping
graphane, p and n regions can be defined so that p-n junctions become feasible
with small reverse currents. Our recent analysis has shown that an ideal I-V
characteristic for this type of junctions may be expected. Here, we predict the
behavior of bipolar juncrion transistors based on graphane. Profiles of
carriers and intrinsic parameters of the graphane transistor are calculated and
discussed.
