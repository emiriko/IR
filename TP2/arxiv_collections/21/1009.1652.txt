We have been carrying out a study of stellar magnetic activity, dynamos,
atmospheric physics, and spectral irradiances from a sample of solar-type G0-5
V stars with different ages. One of the major goals of this program is to study
the evolution of the Sun's X-ray through NUV spectral irradiances with age. Of
particular interest is the determination of the young Sun's elevated levels of
high-energy fluxes because of the critical roles that X-ray through FUV
emissions play on the photochemical and photoionization evolution of early,
young planetary atmospheres and ionospheres. Motivated by the current
exoplanetary search missions that are hunting for earth-size planets in the
habitable zones of nearby main-sequence G-M stars, we are expanding our program
to cooler, less luminous, but much more numerous main-sequence K-type stars,
such as alpha Centauri B. The long life (2-3x longer than our Sun) and slow
evolution of K stars provide nearly constant energy sources for possible hosted
planets. Presented here are X-ray, UV, and recently acquired FUV observations
of the K1 V star alpha Cen B. These combined high-energy measures provide a
more complete look into the nature of alpha Cen B's magnetic activity and X-UV
radiances. We find that alpha Cen B has exhibited significant long-term
variability in X-ray through NUV emission fluxes, indicating a solar-like
long-term activity cycle of P_cycle = 8.84 years. In addition, analysis of the
short-term rotational modulation of mean light due to the effects of
magnetically active regions has yielded a well-determined rotation period of
P_rotation = 36.2 days. alpha Cen B is the only old main-sequence K star with a
reliably determined age and rotation period, and for early K-stars, is an
important calibrator for stellar age/rotation/activity relations.
