We analyse the coarse-grained phase-space structure of the six Galaxy-scale
dark matter haloes of the Aquarius Project using a state-of-the-art 6D
substructure finder. Within r_50, we find that about 35% of the mass is in
identifiable substructures, predominantly tidal streams, but including about
14% in self-bound subhaloes. The slope of the differential substructure mass
function is close to -2, which should be compared to around -1.9 for the
population of self-bound subhaloes. Near r_50 about 60% of the mass is in
substructures, with about 30% in self-bound subhaloes. The inner 35 kpc of the
highest resolution simulation has only 0.5% of its mass in self-bound
subhaloes, but 3.3% in detected substructure, again primarily tidal streams.
The densest tidal streams near the solar position have a 3-D mass density about
1% of the local mean, and populate the high velocity tail of the velocity
distribution.
