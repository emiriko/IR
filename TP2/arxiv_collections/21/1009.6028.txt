Josephson current of spin-entangled electrons through the two branches of a
SQUID-like structure with two quantum dots exhibits a magnetic-flux response
different from the conventional Josephson current. Due to their interference,
the period of maximum Josephson current changes from $h/2e$ to $h/e$, which can
be used for detecting the Cooper-pair splitting efficiency. The nonlocal spin
entanglement provides a quantum mechanical functionale for switching on and off
this novel Josephson current, and explicitly a switch is formulated by
including a pilot junction. It is shown that the device can be used to measure
the magnitude of split-tunneling Josephson current.
