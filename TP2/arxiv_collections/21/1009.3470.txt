We present SuperWASP observations of HAT-P-14b, a hot Jupiter discovered by
Torres et al. The planet was found independently by the SuperWASP team and
named WASP-27b after follow-up observations had secured the discovery, but
prior to the publication by Torres et al. Our analysis of HAT-P-14/WASP-27 is
in good agreement with the values found by Torres et al. and we refine the
parameters by combining our datasets. We also provide additional evidence
against astronomical false positives. Due to the brightness of the host star, V
= 10, HAT-P-14 is an attractive candidate for further characterisation
observations. The planet has a high impact parameter, b = 0.907 +/- 0.004, and
the primary transit is close to grazing. This could readily reveal small
deviations in the orbital parameters indicating the presence of a third body in
the system, which may be causing the small but significant orbital
eccentricity, e = 0.095 +/- 0.011. The system geometry suggests that the planet
narrowly fails to undergo a secondary eclipse. However, even a non-detection
would tightly constrain the system parameters.
