A four-dimensional asymptotic expansion scheme is used to study the next
order effects of the nonlinearity near a spinning dynamical black hole. The
angular momentum flux and energy flux formula are then obtained by constructing
the reference frame in terms of the compatible constant spinors and the
compatibility of the coupling leading order Newman-Penrose equations. By using
the slow rotation and small-tide approximation for a spinning black hole, we
chose the horizon cross-section is spherical symmetric. It turns out the flux
formula is rather simple and can be compared with the known results. Directly
from the energy flux formula of the slow rotating dynamical horizon, we find
that the physically reasonable condition on the positivity of the gravitational
energy flux yields that the shear will monotonically decrease with time. Thus a
slow rotating dynamical horizon will asymptotically approaches an isolated
horizon during late time.
