Based on recent work by Adams, I construct a lattice fermion operator that
fully lifts the staggered flavor degeneracy. The resulting operator is of
Wilson type but smaller by a factor of 4, better conditioned and contains 3
instead of 15 doublers. It is further suggested that this operator may be used
as a candidate kernel operator to an overlap construction. Prospects for
practical applications and potential problems of the new discretizations are
briefly discussed.
