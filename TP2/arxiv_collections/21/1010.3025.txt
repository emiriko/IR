Using first-principles electronic structure calculations, we have studied the
dependence of the Curie temperature on external hydrostatic pressure for random
Ni2MnSn Heusler alloys doped with Cu and Pd atoms, over the entire range of
dopant concentrations. The Curie temperatures are calculated by applying
random-phase approximation to the Heisenberg Hamiltonian whose parameters are
determined using the linear response and multiple scattering methods, based on
density-functional theory. In (Ni1-x,Pdx)2MnSn alloys, the Curie temperature is
found to increase with applied pressure over the whole concentration range. The
crossover from the increase to the decrease of the Curie temperature with
pressure takes place for Cu concentrations larger than about 70% in
(Ni1-x,Cux)2MnSn Heusler alloys. The results for the reference Ni2MnSn Heusler
alloy agree well with a previous theoretical study of E. Sasioglu, L. M.
Sandratskii and P. Bruno Phys. Rev. B 71 214412 (2005) and also reasonably well
with available experimental data. Results for the spin-disorder-induced part of
the resistivity in (Ni1-x,Pdx)2MnSn Heusler alloys, calculated by using the
disordered local moment model, are also presented. Finally, a qualitative
understanding of the results, based on Anderson's superexchange interaction and
Stearn's model of the indirect exchange interaction between localized and
itinerant d electrons, is provided.
