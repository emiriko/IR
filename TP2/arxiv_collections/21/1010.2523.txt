Coherent interactions between spins in quantum dots are a key requirement for
quantum gates. We have performed pump-probe experiments in which pulsed lasers
emitting at different photon energies manipulate two distinct subsets of
electron spins within an inhomogeneous InGaAs quantum dot ensemble. The spin
dynamics are monitored through their precession about an external magnetic
field. These measurements demonstrate spin precession phase shifts and
modulations of the magnitude of one subset of oriented spins after optical
orientation of the second subset. The observations are consistent with results
from a model using a Heisenberg-like interaction with microeV-strength.
