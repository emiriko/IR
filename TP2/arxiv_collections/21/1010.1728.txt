We study the interplay between charge symmetry breaking and renormalization
in the NN system for s-waves. We find a set of universality relations which
disentangle explicitly the known long distance dynamics from low energy
parameters and extend them to the Coulomb case. We analyze within such an
approach the One-Boson-Exchange potential and the theoretical conditions which
allow to relate the proton-neutron, proton-proton and neutron-neutron
scattering observables without the introduction of extra new parameters and
providing good phenomenological success.
