It is not currently clear how important it will be to include conservative
self-force (SF) corrections in the models for extreme-mass-ratio inspiral
(EMRI) waveforms that will be used to detect such signals in LISA (Laser
Interferometer Space Antenna) data. These proceedings will address this issue
for circular-equatorial inspirals using an approximate EMRI model that includes
conservative corrections at leading post-Newtonian order. We will present
estimates of the magnitude of the parameter estimation errors that would result
from omitting conservative corrections, and compare these to the errors that
will arise from noise fluctuations in the detector. We will also use this model
to explore the relative importance of the second-order radiative piece of the
SF, which is not presently known.
