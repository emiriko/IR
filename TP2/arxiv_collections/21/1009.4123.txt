We present a theoretical framework to understand a modified
fluctuation-dissipation theorem valid for systems close to non-equilibrium
steady-states and obeying markovian dynamics. We discuss the interpretation of
this result in terms of trajectory entropy excess. The framework is illustrated
on a simple pedagogical example of a molecular motor. We also derive in this
context generalized Green-Kubo relations similar to the ones derived recently
by Seifert., Phys. Rev. Lett., 104, 138101 (2010) for more general networks of
biomolecular states.
