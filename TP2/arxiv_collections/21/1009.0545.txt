We calculate running coupling corrections for the lowest-order gluon
production cross section in high energy hadronic and nuclear scattering using
the BLM scale-setting prescription. In the final answer for the cross section
the three powers of fixed coupling are replaced by seven factors of running
coupling, five in the numerator and two in the denominator, forming a
'septumvirate' of running couplings, analogous to the 'triumvirate' of running
couplings found earlier for the small-x BFKL/BK/JIMWLK evolution equations. It
is interesting to note that the two running couplings in the denominator of the
'septumvirate' run with complex-valued momentum scales, which are complex
conjugates of each other, such that the production cross section is indeed
real. We use our lowest-order result to conjecture how running coupling
corrections may enter the full fixed-coupling kT-factorization formula for
gluon production which includes non-linear small-x evolution.
