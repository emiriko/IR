Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is the problem of approximating a
nonnegative matrix with the product of two low-rank nonnegative matrices and
has been shown to be particularly useful in many applications, e.g., in text
mining, image processing, computational biology, etc. In this paper, we explain
how algorithms for NMF can be embedded into the framework of multilevel methods
in order to accelerate their convergence. This technique can be applied in
situations where data admit a good approximate representation in a lower
dimensional space through linear transformations preserving nonnegativity. A
simple multilevel strategy is described and is experimentally shown to speed up
significantly three popular NMF algorithms (alternating nonnegative least
squares, multiplicative updates and hierarchical alternating least squares) on
several standard image datasets.
