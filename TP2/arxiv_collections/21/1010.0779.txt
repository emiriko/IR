We present both theoretical and experimental results on fluorescence of
single defect centers in diamond nanocrystals embedded in a planar dielectric
microcavity. From a theoretical point of view, we show that the overall
fluorescence collection efficiency using moderate numerical aperture microscope
objective can be enhanced by using a low quality factor microcavity. This could
be used in particular for low temperature applications where the numerical
aperture of collection microscope objectives is limited due to the experimental
constraints. We experimentally investigate the control of the fluorescence
spectrum of the emitted light from a single center. We show the simultaneous
narrowing of the room temperature broadband emission spectrum and the increase
of the fluorescence spectral density.
