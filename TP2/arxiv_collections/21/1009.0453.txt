Outflows and jets are intimately related to the formation of stars, and play
an important role in redistributing mass, energy and angular momentum within
the dense core and parent cloud. The interplay between magnetic field and
rotation is responsible for launching these outflows, whose formation has been
generally carried out for idealized systems where the angle $\alpha$ between
the rotation axis and large-scale magnetic field is zero. Here we explore,
through three-dimensional ideal magneto-hydrodynamic simulations, the effects
of a non-zero $\alpha$ on the formation of outflows during the collapse of
dense pre-stellar cores. We find that mass ejection is less efficient for
increasing angle $\alpha$, and that outflows are essentially suppressed for
$\alpha\sim90^{\circ}$. An important consequence is a corresponding increase of
the mass accreted onto the adiabatic (first) core. In addition, mean flow
velocities tend to increase with $\alpha$, and misaligned configurations
produce clumpy, heterogeneous outflows that undergo precession, and are more
prone to instabilities.
