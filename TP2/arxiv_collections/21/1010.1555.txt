We investigated the electronic properties of strained Si/Ge core-shell
nanowires along the [110] direction using first principles calculations based
on density-functional theory. The diameter of the studied core-shell wire is up
to 5 nm. We found the band gap of the core-shell wire is smaller than that of
both pure Si and Ge wires with the same diameter. This reduced band gap is
ascribed to the intrinsic strain between Ge and Si layers, which partially
counters the quantum confinement effect. The external strain is further applied
to the nanowires for tuning the band structure and band gap. By applying
sufficient tensile strain, we found the band gap of Si-core/Ge-shell nanowire
with diameter larger than ~3 nm experiences a transition from direct to
indirect gap.
