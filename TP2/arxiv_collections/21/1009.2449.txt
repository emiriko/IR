We study here the existence of solitary wave solutions of a generalized
two-component Camassa-Holm system. In addition to those smooth solitary-wave
solutions, we show that there are solitary waves with singularities: peaked and
cusped solitary waves. We also demonstrate that all smooth solitary waves are
orbitally stable in the energy space. We finally give a sufficient condition
for global strong solutions to the equation without certain parameters.
