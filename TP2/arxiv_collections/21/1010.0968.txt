Using Andreev and Lifshitz's supersolid hydrodynamics, we obtain the
propagating longitudinal modes at non-zero applied pressure $P_{a}$ (necessary
for solid 4He), and their generation efficiencies by heaters and transducers.
For small $P_{a}$, a solid develops an internal pressure $P \sim P_{a}^2$. This
theory has stress contributions both from the lattice and an internal pressure
$P$. Because both types of stress are included, the normal mode analysis
differs from previous works. Not surprisingly, transducers are significantly
more efficient at producing elastic waves and heaters are significantly more
efficient at producing fourth sound waves. We take the system to be isotropic,
which should apply to systems that are glassy or consist of many crystallites;
the results should also apply, at least qualitatively, to single-crystal hcp
4He.
