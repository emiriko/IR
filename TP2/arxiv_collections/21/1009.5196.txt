Here we are comparing our results with experimental data of reactions
57La124+50Sn124, 50Sn124+50Sn124 and 50Sn107+50Sn124 at energy 600 MeV/nucleon.
It is observed that IMF's shows the agreement with data at low impact
parameters but fails at intermediate impact parameters. We shall try to
reproduce the result with reduced cross-section in future.
