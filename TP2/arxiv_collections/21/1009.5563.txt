We present 27 binary lens candidates from OGLE-III Early Warning System
database for the seasons 2006--2008. The candidates have been selected by
visual light curves inspection. Our sample of binary lens events consists now
of 78 stellar systems and 7 extrasolar planets of OGLE-III published elsewhere.
Examining the distribution of stellar binaries we find that the number of
systems per logarithmic mass ratio interval increases with mass ratio q, in
contradiction with our previous findings. Stellar binaries belong to the region
0.03<q<1 and there is a gap between them and a separate population of planets.
