Gamma-ray telescopes in orbit around the Earth are searching for evidence of
the elusive radionuclide 22Na produced in novae. Previously published
uncertainties in the dominant destructive reaction, 22Na(p,g)23Mg, indicated
new measurements in the proton energy range of 150 to 300 keV were needed to
constrain predictions. We have measured the resonance strengths, energies, and
branches directly and absolutely by using protons from the University of
Washington accelerator with a specially designed beamline, which included beam
rastering and cold vacuum protection of the 22Na implanted targets. The
targets, fabricated at TRIUMF-ISAC, displayed minimal degradation over a ~ 20 C
bombardment as a result of protective layers. We avoided the need to know the
stopping power, and hence the target composition, by extracting resonance
strengths from excitation functions integrated over proton energy. Our
measurements revealed that resonance strengths for E_p = 213, 288, 454, and 610
keV are stronger by factors of 2.4 to 3.2 than previously reported. Upper
limits have been placed on proposed resonances at 198-, 209-, and 232-keV. We
have re-evaluated the 22Na(p,g) reaction rate, and our measurements indicate
the resonance at 213 keV makes the most significant contribution to 22Na
destruction in novae. Hydrodynamic simulations including our rate indicate that
the expected abundance of 22Na ejecta from a classical nova is reduced by
factors between 1.5 and 2, depending on the mass of the white-dwarf star
hosting the nova explosion.
