The kinematics of the diffuse light in the densest regions of the nearby
clusters can be unmasked using the planetary nebulae (PNs) as probes of the
stellar motions. The position-velocity diagrams around the brightest cluster
galaxies (BCGs) identify the relative contributions from the outer halos and
the intracluster light (ICL), defined as the light radiated by the stars
floating in the cluster potential. The kinematics of the ICL can then be used
to asses the dynamical status of the nearby cluster cores and to infer their
formation histories. The cores of the Virgo and Coma are observed to be far
from equilibrium, with mergers currently on-going, while the ICL properties in
the Fornax and Hydra clusters show the presence of sub-components being
accreted in their cores, but superposed to an otherwise relaxed population of
stars. Finally the comparison of the observed ICL properties with those
predicted from Lambda-CDM simulations indicates a qualitative agreement and
provides insights on the ICL formation. Both observations and simulations
indicate that BCG halos and ICL are physically distinct components, with the
``hotter" ICL dominating at large radial distances from the BCGs halos as the
latter become progressively fainter.
