Nonequilibrium Green's function methods allow for an intrinsically consistent
description of the evolution of quantal many-body body systems, with inclusion
of different types of correlations. In this paper, we focus on the practical
developments needed to build a Green's function methodology for nuclear
reactions. We start out by considering symmetric collisions of slabs in one
dimension within the mean-field approximation. We concentrate on two issues of
importance for actual reaction simulations. First, the preparation of the
initial state within the same methodology as for the reaction dynamics is
demonstrated by an adiabatic switching on of the mean-field interaction, which
leads to the mean-field ground state. Second, the importance of the Green's
function matrix-elements far away from the spatial diagonal is analyzed by a
suitable suppression process that does not significantly affect the evolution
of the elements close to the diagonal. The relative lack of importance of the
far-away elements is tied to system expansion. We also examine the evolution of
the Wigner function and verify quantitatively that erasing of the off-diagonal
elements corresponds to averaging out of the momentum-space details in the
Wigner function.
