Characteristics of the muon component in EAS are analyzed together with their
fluctuations. The aim of this analysis -- a comparison of experimental data
with computational results obtained within frameworks of various hadron
interaction models for protons and iron nuclei and an estimation of cosmic ray
mass composition in the ultra-high energy region.
