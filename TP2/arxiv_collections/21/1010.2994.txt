The top quark sector is almost decoupled from lighter quark generations due
to the fact that $V_{tb}\approx$~1. The current experimental measurements of
$V_{tb}$ are compatible with the Standard Model expectations but are still
dominated by experimental uncertainties. In this manuscript, a revision of the
experimental methods used to measure $V_{tb}$ is given, and a simple method to
probe heavy flavor content fraction of top quark events, $R=B(t\rightarrow
Wb)/B(t\rightarrow Wq)$, is presented and discussed. Prospects for the
measurements at the Large Hadron Collider based on generator level simulations
are outlined.
