The Pipe Nebula is a massive, nearby dark molecular cloud with a low
star-formation efficiency which makes it a good laboratory to study the very
early stages of the star formation process. The Pipe Nebula is largely
filamentary, and appears to be threaded by a uniform magnetic field at scales
of few parsecs, perpendicular to its main axis. The field is only locally
perturbed in a few regions, such as the only active cluster forming core B59.
The aim of this study is to investigate primordial conditions in low-mass
pre-stellar cores and how they relate to the local magnetic field in the cloud.
We used the IRAM 30-m telescope to carry out a continuum and molecular survey
at 3 and 1 mm of early- and late-time molecules toward four selected starless
cores inside the Pipe Nebula. We found that the dust continuum emission maps
trace better the densest regions than previous 2MASS extinction maps, while
2MASS extinction maps trace better the diffuse gas. The properties of the cores
derived from dust emission show average radii of ~0.09 pc, densities of
~1.3x10^5 cm^-3, and core masses of ~2.5 M_sun. Our results confirm that the
Pipe Nebula starless cores studied are in a very early evolutionary stage, and
present a very young chemistry with different properties that allow us to
propose an evolutionary sequence. All of the cores present early-time molecular
emission, with CS detections toward all the sample. Two of them, Cores 40 and
109, present strong late-time molecular emission. There seems to be a
correlation between the chemical evolutionary stage of the cores and the local
magnetic properties that suggests that the evolution of the cores is ruled by a
local competition between the magnetic energy and other mechanisms, such as
turbulence.
