We investigate spin transport in quasi 2DEG formed by III-V semiconductor
heterojunctions using the Monte Carlo method. The results obtained with and
without electron-electron scattering are compared and appreciable difference
between the two is found. The electron-electron scattering leads to suppression
of Dyakonov-Perel mechanism (DP) and enhancement of Elliott-Yafet mechanism
(EY). Finally, spin transport in InSb and GaAs heterostructures is investigated
considering both DP and EY mechanisms. While DP mechanism dominates spin
decoherence in GaAs, EY mechanism is found to dominate in high mobility InSb.
Our simulations predict a lower spin relaxation/decoherence rate in wide gap
semiconductors which is desirable for spin transport.
