In this article we review the discovery of the accelerating universe using
type Ia supernovae. We then outline ways in which dark energy - component that
causes the acceleration - is phenomenologically described. We finally describe
principal cosmological techniques to measure large-scale properties of dark
energy. This chapter complements other articles in this book that describe
theoretical understanding (or lack thereof) of the cause for the accelerating
universe.
