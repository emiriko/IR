Pervasive user-centric applications are systems which are meant to sense the
presence, mood, and intentions of users in order to optimize user comfort and
performance. Building such applications requires not only state-of-the art
techniques from artificial intelligence but also sound software engineering
methods for facilitating modular design, runtime adaptation and verification of
critical system requirements.
  In this paper we focus on high-level design and analysis, and use the
algebraic rewriting language Real-Time Maude for specifying applications in a
real-time setting. We propose a generic component-based approach for modeling
pervasive user-centric systems and we show how to analyze and prove crucial
properties of the system architecture through model checking and simulation.
For proving time-dependent properties we use Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) and
present analysis algorithms for model checking two subclasses of MTL formulas:
time-bounded response and time-bounded safety MTL formulas. The underlying idea
is to extend the Real-Time Maude model with suitable clocks, to transform the
MTL formulas into LTL formulas over the extended specification, and then to use
the LTL model checker of Maude. It is shown that these analyses are sound and
complete for maximal time sampling. The approach is illustrated by a simple
adaptive advertising scenario in which an adaptive advertisement display can
react to actions of the users in front of the display.
