In this research endeavor, some Sequence Alignment Algorithms are detailed
that are useful for finding or comparing 1 dimensional (1-D), 2 dimensional
(2-D), 3 dimensional (3-D) sequences in or against a parent or mother database
which is 1 dimensional (1-D), 2 dimensional (2-D), 3 dimensional (3-D)
sequence. Inner Product [1], [2] based schemes are used to lay down such
algorithms. Also,in this research, a Sequence Alignment Algorithms is detailed
that is useful for finding or comparing an N-Dimensional (N-D) sequence in or
against a parent or mother database which N-Dimensional (N-D) sequence. Inner
Product [1], [2] based schemes are used to lay down such an algorithm.
