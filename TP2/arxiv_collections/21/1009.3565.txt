We report recent observations of the sharp-lined magnetic beta Cep pulsator
xi 1 CMa (= HD 46328). The longitudinal magnetic field of this star is detected
consistently, but it is not observed to vary strongly, during nearly 5 years of
observation. In this poster we evaluate whether the nearly constant
longitudinal field is due to intrinsically slow rotation, or rather if the
stellar or magnetic geometry is responsible.
