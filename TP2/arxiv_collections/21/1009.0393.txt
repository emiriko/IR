Changes in the mean-square nuclear charge radii along the lithium isotopic
chain were determined using a combination of precise isotope shift measurements
and theoretical atomic structure calculations. Nuclear charge radii of light
elements are of high interest due to the appearance of the nuclear halo
phenomenon in this region of the nuclear chart. During the past years we have
developed a new laser spectroscopic approach to determine the charge radii of
lithium isotopes which combines high sensitivity, speed, and accuracy to
measure the extremely small field shift of an 8 ms lifetime isotope with
production rates on the order of only 10,000 atoms/s. The method was applied to
all bound isotopes of lithium including the two-neutron halo isotope Li-11 at
the on-line isotope separators at GSI, Darmstadt, Germany and at TRIUMF,
Vancouver, Canada. We describe the laser spectroscopic method in detail,
present updated and improved values from theory and experiment, and discuss the
results.
