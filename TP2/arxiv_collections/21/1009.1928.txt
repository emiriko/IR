We explore the influence of in-medium nucleon-nucleon cross section, symmetry
potential and impact parameter on isospin sensitive observables in
intermediate-energy heavy-ion collisions with the ImQMD05 code, a modified
version of Quantum Molecular Dynamics model. At incident velocities above the
Fermi velocity, we find that the density dependence of symmetry potential plays
a more important role on the double neutron to proton ratio $DR(n/p)$ and the
isospin transport ratio $R_i$ than the in-medium nucleon-nucleon cross
sections, provided that the latter are constrained to a fixed total NN
collision rate. We also explore both $DR(n/p)$ and $R_i$ as a function of the
impact parameter. Since the copious production of intermediate mass fragments
is a distinguishing feature of intermediate-energy heavy-ion collisions, we
examine the isospin transport ratios constructed from different groups of
fragments. We find that the values of the isospin transport ratios for
projectile rapidity fragments with $Z\ge20$ are greater than those constructed
from the entire projectile rapidity source. We believe experimental
investigations of this phenomenon can be performed. These may provide
significant tests of fragmentation time scales predicted by ImQMD calculations.
