CeCoIn5 is a heavy fermion Type-II superconductor which exhibits clear
indications of Pauli-limited superconductivity. A variety of measurements give
evidence for a transition at high magnetic fields inside the superconducting
state, when the field is applied either parallel to or perpendicular to the c
axis. When the field is perpendicular to the c axis, antiferromagnetic order is
observed on the high-field side of the transition, with a magnetic wavevector
of (q q 0.5), where q = 0.44 reciprocal lattice units. We show that this order
remains as the magnetic field is rotated out of the basal plane, but the
associated moment eventually disappears above 17 degrees, indicating that the
anomalies seen with the field parallel to the c axis are not related to this
magnetic order. We discuss the implications of this finding.
