By integrating heterogeneous functional genomic datasets, we have developed a
new framework for detecting combinatorial control of gene expression, which
includes estimating transcription factor activities using a singular value
decomposition method and reducing high-dimensional input gene space by
considering genomic properties of gene clusters. The prediction of cooperative
gene regulation is accomplished by either Gaussian Graphical Models or Pairwise
Mixed Graphical Models. The proposed framework was tested on yeast cell cycle
datasets: (1) 54 known yeast cell cycle genes with 9 cell cycle regulators and
(2) 676 putative yeast cell cycle genes with 9 cell cycle regulators. The new
framework gave promising results on inferring TF-TF and TF-gene interactions.
It also revealed several interesting mechanisms such as negatively correlated
protein-protein interactions and low affinity protein-DNA interactions that may
be important during the yeast cell cycle. The new framework may easily be
extended to study other higher eukaryotes.
