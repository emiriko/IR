Context: There is considerable interest in the helium variable a Cen as a
bridge between helium-weak and helium-strong CP stars. Aims: We investigate Ce
III and other possible lanthanides in the spectrum the of hottest chemically
peculiar (CP) star in which these elements have been found. A {Kr II line
appears within a broad absorption which we suggest may be due to a high-level
transition in C II. Methods: Wavelengths and equivalent widths are measured on
high-resolution UVES spectra, analyzed, and their phase-variations
investigated. Results: New, robust identifications of Ce III and Kr II are
demonstrated. Nd III is likely present. A broad absorption near 4619[A] is
present at all phases of a Cen, and in some other early B stars. Conclusions:
The presence of lanthanides in a Cen strengthens the view that this star is a
significant link between the cooler CP stars and the hotter helium-peculiar
stars. Broad absorptions in a Cen are not well explained.
