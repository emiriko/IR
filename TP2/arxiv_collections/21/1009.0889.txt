The basic principles of classical and semi-classical theories of molecular
optical activity are discussed. These theories are valid for dilute solutions
of optically active organic molecules. It is shown that all phenomena known in
the classical theory of molecular optical activity can be described with the
use of one pseudo-scalar which is a uniform function of the incident light
frequency $\omega$. The relation between optical rotation and circular
dichroism is derived from the basic Kramers-Kronig relations. In our discussion
of the general theory of molecular optical activity we introduce the tensor of
molecular optical activity. It is shown that to evaluate the optical rotation
and circular dichroism at arbitrary frequencies one needs to know only nine (3
+ 6) molecular tensors. The quantum (or semi-classical) theory of molecular
optical activity is also briefly discussed. We also raise the possibility of
measuring the optical rotation and circular dichroism at wavelengths which
correspond to the vacuum ultraviolet region, i.e. for $\lambda \le 150$ $nm$.
