In the context of the Galactic Emission Mapping, a new receiver at 5GHz was
developed to characterize the galactic foreground to the Cosmic Microwave
Background Radiation. This is a 5GHz super heterodyne polarimeter with double
down conversion, with a high gain IF chain using the latest RF technology
working at 600MHz central frequency that feeds a four channel digital
correlator. This paper describes the receiver and its current status. Design
options and constraints are presented with some simulations and experimental
results of a circuit prototype.
