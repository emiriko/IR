In this paper we address two questions: how energy conservation affects the
solution to the non-linear equation, and how impact parameter dependence
influences the inclusive production. Answering the first question we solve the
modified BK equation which takes into account energy conservation. In spite of
the fact that we used the simplified kernel, we believe that the main result of
the paper: the small ($\leq 40%$) suppression of the inclusive productiondue to
energy conservation, reflects a general feature. This result leads us to
believe that the small value of the nuclear modification factor is of a
non-perturbative nature. In the solution a new scale appears $Q_{fr} = Q_s
\exp(-1/(2 \bas))$ and the production of dipoles with the size larger than
$2/Q_{fr}$ is suppressed. Therefore, we can expect that the typical temperature
for hadron production is about $Q_{fr}$ ($ T \approx Q_{fr}$). The simplified
equation allows us to obtain a solution to Balitsky-Kovchegov equation taking
into account the impact parameter dependence. We show that the impact parameter
($b$) dependence can be absorbed into the non-perturbative $b$ dependence of
the saturation scale. The solution of the BK equation, as well as of the
modified BK equation without $b$ dependence, is only accurate up to $\pm 25%$.
