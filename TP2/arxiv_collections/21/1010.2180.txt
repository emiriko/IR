The recently discovered enhancement of eta photoproduction on the quasi-free
neutron at energies around s^1/2 ~ 1.67 GeV is addressed within an SU(3)
coupled channels model. The K Sigma threshold plays a significant role and the
quasi-free cross sections on proton and neutron, sigma_n and sigma_p, can be
quantitatively explained. For the reaction gamma p --> pi^0 eta p, we evaluate
the polarization observables I^S and I^C from a chiral unitary amplitude
developed earlier. The I^S and I^C observables have been recently measured for
the first time by the CBELSA/TAPS collaboration. We show the significance of
the Delta(1700)D33 resonance and its S-wave decay into eta Delta(1232) which
further confirms the dynamical nature of this resonance.
