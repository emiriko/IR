The thermal transport measurements have been made on the Fe-based
superconductor Lu2Fe3Si5 (Tc ~ 6 K) down to a very low temperature Tc/120. The
field and temperature dependences of the thermal conductivity confirm the
multigap superconductivity with fully opened gaps on the whole Fermi surfaces.
In comparison to MgB2 as a typical example of the multigap superconductor in a
p-electron system, Lu2Fe3Si5 reveals a remarkably enhanced quasiparticle heat
conduction in the mixed state. The results can be interpreted as a consequence
of the electronic correlations derived from Fe 3d-electrons.
