We analyse of a set of radio rich (accompanied by type IV or II bursts) solar
flares and their association with SOHO/LASCO Coronal Mass Ejections in the
period 1998 2000. The intensity, impulsiveness and energetics of these events
are investigated. We find that, on the average, flares associated both with
type IIs and CMEs are more impulsive and more energetic than flares associated
with type IIs only (without CME reported), as well as flares accompanied by
type IV continua but not type II shocks. From the last two classes, flares with
type II bursts (without CMEs reported) are the shortest in duration and the
most impulsive.
