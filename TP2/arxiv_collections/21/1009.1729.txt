In this paper we show how to construct the coupled (multicomponent) Harry Dym
(cHD) hierarchy from classical St\"ackel separable systems. Both nonlocal and
purely differential parts of hierarchies are obtained. We also construct
various classes of solutions of cHD hierarchy from solutions of corresponding
St\"ackel systems.
