We present self-consistent star formation rates derived through pan-spectral
analysis of galaxies drawn from the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey. We
determine the most appropriate form of dust obscuration correction via
application of a range of extinction laws drawn from the literature as applied
to Halpha, [O{II}] and UV luminosities. These corrections are applied to a
sample of 31,508 galaxies from the GAMA survey at z < 0.35. We consider several
different obscuration curves, including those of Milky Way, Calzetti (2001) and
Fischera and Dopita (2005) curves and their effects on the observed
luminosities. At the core of this technique is the observed Balmer decrement,
and we provide a prescription to apply optimal obscuration corrections using
the Balmer decrement. We carry out an analysis of the star formation history
(SFH) using stellar population synthesis tools to investigate the evolutionary
history of our sample of galaxies as well as to understand the effects of
variation in the Initial Mass Function (IMF) and the effects this has on the
evolutionary history of galaxies. We find that the Fischera and Dopita (2005)
obscuration curve with an R_{v} value of 4.5 gives the best agreement between
the different SFR indicators. The 2200A feature needed to be removed from this
curve to obtain complete consistency between all SFR indicators suggesting that
this feature may not be common in the average integrated attenuation of galaxy
emission. We also find that the UV dust obscuration is strongly dependent on
the SFR.
