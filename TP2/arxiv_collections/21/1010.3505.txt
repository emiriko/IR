We introduce an adiabatic quantum state transfer scheme in a non-uniform
coupled triple-quantum-dot system. By adiabatically varying the external gate
voltage applied on the sender and receiver, the electron can be transferred
between them with high fidelity. By numerically solving the master equation for
a system with always-on interaction, it is indicated that the transfer fidelity
depends on the ration between the peak voltage and the maximum coupling
constants. The effect of coupling mismatch on the transfer fidelity is also
investigated and it is shown that there is a relatively large tolerance range
to permit high fidelity quantum state transfer.
