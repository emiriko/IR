We derive a general capacitive interaction model for an antidot-based
interferometer in the integer quantum Hall regime, and study Aharonov-Bohm
resonances in a single antidot with multiple bound modes, as a function of the
external magnetic field or the gate voltage applied to the antidot. The pattern
of Aharonov-Bohm resonances is significantly different from the case of
noninteracting electrons. The origin of the difference includes charging
effects of excess charges, charge relaxation between the bound modes, the
capacitive interaction between the bound modes and the extended edge channels
nearby the antidot, and the competition between the single-particle level
spacing and the charging energy of the antidot. We analyze the patterns for the
case that the number of the bound modes is 2, 3, or 4. The results agree with
recent experimental data.
