Until today, the small size of magnetic elements in quiet Sun areas has
required the application of indirect methods, such as the line-ratio technique
or multi-component inversions, to infer their physical properties. A consistent
match to the observed Stokes profiles could only be obtained by introducing a
magnetic filling factor that specifies the fraction of the observed pixel
filled with magnetic field. Here, we investigate the properties of a small
magnetic patch in the quiet Sun observed with the IMaX magnetograph on board
the balloon-borne telescope Sunrise with unprecedented spatial resolution and
low instrumental stray light. We apply an inversion technique based on the
numerical solution of the radiative transfer equation to retrieve the
temperature stratification and the field strength in the magnetic patch. The
observations can be well reproduced with a one-component, fully magnetized
atmosphere with a field strength exceeding 1 kG and a significantly enhanced
temperature in the mid- to upper photosphere with respect to its surroundings,
consistent with semi-empirical flux tube models for plage regions. We therefore
conclude that, within the framework of a simple atmospheric model, the IMaX
measurements resolve the observed quiet-Sun flux tube.
