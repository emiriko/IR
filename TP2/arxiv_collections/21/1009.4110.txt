The growth of structure in the universe begins at the time of
radiation-matter equality, which corresponds to energy scales of $\sim 0.4 eV$.
All tracers of dark matter evolution are expected to be sensitive to neutrino
masses on this and smaller scales. Here we explore the possibility of using
cluster number counts and power spectrum obtained from ongoing SZ surveys to
constrain neutrino masses. Specifically, we forecast the capability of ongoing
measurements with the PLANCK satellite and the ground-based SPT experiment, as
well as measurements with the proposed EPIC satellite, to set interesting
bounds on neutrino masses from their respective SZ surveys. We also consider an
ACT-like CMB experiment that covers only a few hundred ${\rm deg^{2}}$ also to
explore the tradeoff between the survey area and sensitivity and what effect
this may have on inferred neutrino masses. We find that for such an experiment
a shallow survey is preferable over a deep and low-noise scanning scheme. We
also find that projected results from the PLANCK SZ survey can, in principle,
be used to determine the total neutrino mass with a ($1\sigma$) uncertainty of
$0.28 eV$, if the detection limit of a cluster is set at the $5\sigma$
significance level. This is twice as large as the limits expected from PLANCK
CMB lensing measurements. The corresponding limits from the SPT and EPIC
surveys are $\sim 0.44 eV$ and $\sim 0.12 eV$, respectively. Mapping an area of
200 deg$^{2}$, ACT measurements are predicted to attain a $1\sigma$ uncertainty
of 0.61 eV; expanding the observed area to 4,000 deg$^{2}$ will decrease the
uncertainty to 0.36 eV.
