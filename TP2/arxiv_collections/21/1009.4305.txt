In this paper we study nonnegative, measure valued solutions of the initial
value problem for one-dimensional drift-diffusion equations when the nonlinear
diffusion is governed by an increasing $C^1$ function $\beta$ with $\lim_{r\to
+\infty} \beta(r)<+\infty$. By using tools of optimal transport, we will show
that this kind of problems is well posed in the class of nonnegative Borel
measures with finite mass $m$ and finite quadratic momentum and it is the
gradient flow of a suitable entropy functional with respect to the so called
$L^2$-Wasserstein distance. Due to the degeneracy of diffusion for large
densities, concentration of masses can occur, whose support is transported by
the drift. We shall show that the large-time behavior of solutions depends on a
critical mass ${m}_{\rm c}$, which can be explicitely characterized in terms of
$\beta$ and of the drift term. If the initial mass is less then ${m}_{\rm c}$,
the entropy has a unique minimizer which is absolutely continuous with respect
to the Lebesgue measure. Conversely, when the total mass $m$ of the solutions
is greater than the critical one, the steady state has a singular part in which
the exceeding mass ${m} - {m}_{\rm c}$ is accumulated.
