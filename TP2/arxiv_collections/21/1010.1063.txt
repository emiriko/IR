Over the past decade, the number of planetary nebula central stars (CSPN)
known to exhibit the Wolf-Rayet (WR) phenomenon has grown substantially. Many
of these discoveries have resulted from the Macquarie/AAO/Strasbourg Ha (MASH)
PN Survey. While WR CSPN constitute a relatively rare stellar type (<10% of
CS), there are indications that the proportion of PN harbouring them may
increase as spectroscopy of more central stars is carried out. In addition,
with new and better distances from the Ha surface brightness-radius
relationship of Frew (2008), we can attempt a dynamical age sequence which may
provide insight into the evolution of these stars.
