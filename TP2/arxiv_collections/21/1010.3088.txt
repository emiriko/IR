The spacing of the \{220\} lattice planes of a $^{28}$Si crystal was measured
by combined x-ray and optical interferometry to a $3.5\times 10^{-9}$ relative
accuracy. The result is $d_{220}=(192014712.67 \pm 0.67)$ am, at 20.0 $^\circ$C
and 0 Pa. This value is greater by $(1.9464 \pm 0.0067)\times 10^{-9} d_{220}$
than the spacing in natural Si, a difference which confirms quantum mechanics
calculations. Subsequently, this crystal has been used to determine the
Avogadro constant by counting the Si atoms, a key step towards a realization of
the mass unit based on a conventional value of the Planck or the Avogadro
constants.
