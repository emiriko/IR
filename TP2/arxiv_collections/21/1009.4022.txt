We report the detection of short period variations in the stars HD69013 and
HD96237. These stars possess large overabundances of rare earth elements and
global magnetic fields, thus belong to the class of chemically peculiar Ap
stars of the main sequence. Pulsations were found from analysis of high time
resolution spectra obtained with the ESO Very Large Telescope using a cross
correlation method for wide spectral bands, from lines belonging to rare earth
elements and from the H alpha core. Pulsation amplitudes reach more than 200
m/s for some lines in HD69013 with a period of 11.4 min and about 100m/s in
HD96237 with periods near 13.6 min. The pulsations have also been detected in
photometric observations obtained at the South African Astronomical
Observatory.
