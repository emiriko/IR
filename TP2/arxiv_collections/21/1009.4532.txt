Theoretical predictions for the dynamic structure factor of a harmonically
trapped Fermi superfluid near the BEC-BCS crossover are compared with recent
Bragg spectroscopy measurements at large transferred momenta. The calculations
are based on a random-phase (or time-dependent Hartree-Fock-Gorkov)
approximation generalized to the strongly interacting regime. Excellent
agreement with experimental spectra at low temperatures is obtained, with no
free parameters. Theoretical predictions for zero-temperature static structure
factor are also found to agree well with the experimental results and
independent theoretical calculations based on the exact Tan relations. The
temperature dependence of the structure factors at unitarity is predicted.
