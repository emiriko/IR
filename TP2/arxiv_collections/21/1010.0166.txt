Dynamics of hot carriers confined in Si nanocrystals is studied theoretically
using atomistic tight binding approach. Radiative, Auger-like and
phonon-assisted processes are considered. The Auger-like energy exchange
between electrons and holes is found to be the fastest process in the system.
However the energy relaxation of hot electron-hole pair is governed by the
single optical phonon emission. For a considerable number of states in small
nanocrystals single-phonon processes are ruled out by energy conservation law.
