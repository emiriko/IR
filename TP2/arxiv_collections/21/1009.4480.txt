We explore in detail the structural, mechanical and thermodynamic properties
of a coarse-grained model of DNA similar to that introduced in Thomas E.
Ouldridge, Ard A. Louis, Jonathan P.K. Doye, Phys. Rev. Lett. 104 178101
(2010). Effective interactions are used to represent chain connectivity,
excluded volume, base stacking and hydrogen bonding, naturally reproducing a
range of DNA behaviour. We quantify the relation to experiment of the
thermodynamics of single-stranded stacking, duplex hybridization and hairpin
formation, as well as structural properties such as the persistence length of
single strands and duplexes, and the torsional and stretching stiffness of
double helices. We also explore the model's representation of more complex
motifs involving dangling ends, bulged bases and internal loops, and the effect
of stacking and fraying on the thermodynamics of the duplex formation
transition.
