The generating function for all antisymmetric characters of a Wilson loop
matrix in SU(N) Yang Mills theory is the partition function of a fermion living
on the curve describing the loop. This generalizes to fermion subsystems living
on higher dimensional submanifolds, for example, surfaces. This write-up also
contains some extra background, in response to some questions raised during the
oral presentation.
