The paper by Leiva et al. (2010) introduced a skewed version of the
sinh-normal distribution, discussed some of its properties and characterized an
extension of the Birnbaum-Saunders distribution associated with this
distribution. In this paper, we introduce a skewed log-Birnbaum-Saunders
regression model based on the skewed sinh-normal distribution. Some influence
methods, such as the local influence and generalized leverage are presented.
Additionally, we derived the normal curvatures of local influence under some
perturbation schemes. An empirical application to a real data set is presented
in order to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed model.
