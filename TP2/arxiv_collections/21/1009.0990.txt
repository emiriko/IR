The nonlinear propagation of electromagnetic (EM) electron-cyclotron waves
(whistlers) along an external magnetic field, and their modulation by
electrostatic small but finite amplitude ion-acoustic density perturbations are
investigated in a uniform quantum plasma with intrinsic spin of electrons. The
effects of the quantum force associated with the Bohm potential and the
combined effects of the classical as well as the spin-induced ponderomotive
forces (CPF and SPF respectively) are taken into consideration. The latter
modify the local plasma density in a self-consistent manner. The coupled modes
of wave propagation is shown to be governed by a modified set of nonlinear
Schr\"{o}dinger-Boussinesq-like equations which admit exact solutions in form
of stationary localized envelopes. Numerical simulation reveals the existence
of large-scale density fluctuations that are self-consistently created by the
localized whistlers in a strongly magnetized high density plasma. The
conditions for the modulational instability (MI) and the value of its growth
rate are obtained. Possible applications of our results, e.g., in strongly
magnetized dense plasmas and in the next generation laser-solid density plasma
interaction experiments are discussed.
