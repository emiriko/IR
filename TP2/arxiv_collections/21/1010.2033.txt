We report on a high precision measurement of gravitational acceleration using
ultracold strontium atoms trapped in a vertical optical lattice. Using
amplitude modulation of the lattice intensity, an uncertainty $\Delta g /g
\approx 10^{-7}$ was reached by measuring at the 5$^{th}$ harmonic of the Bloch
oscillation frequency. After a careful analysis of systematic effects, the
value obtained with this microscopic quantum system is consistent with the one
we measured with a classical absolute gravimeter at the same location. This
result is of relevance for the recent interpretation of related experiments as
tests of gravitational redshift and opens the way to new tests of gravity at
micrometer scale.
