In this paper we study the homogeneous Kaehler manifolds (h.K.m.) which can
be Kaehler immersed into finite or infinite dimensional complex space forms. On
one hand we completely classify the h.K.m. which can be Kaehler immersed into a
finite or infinite dimensional complex Euclidean or hyperbolic space. Moreover,
we extend known results about Kaehler immersions into the finite dimensional
complex projective space to the infinite dimensional setting.
