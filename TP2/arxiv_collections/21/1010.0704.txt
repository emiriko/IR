Stellar spectropolarimetry is a relatively new remote sensing tool for
exploring stellar atmospheres and circumstellar environments. We present the
results of our HiVIS survey and a multi-wavelength ESPaDOnS follow-up campaign
showing detectable linear polarization signatures in many lines for most
obscured stars. This survey shows polarization at and below 0.1% across many
lines are common in stars with often much larger H-alpha signatures. These
smaller signatures are near the limit of typical systematic errors in most
night-time spectropolarimeters. In an effort to increase our precision and
efficiency for detecting small signals we designed and implemented the new
HiVIS bi-directionally clocked detector synchronized with the new
liquid-crystal polarimeter package. We can now record multiple independent
polarized spectra in a single exposure on identical pixels and have
demonstrated 10^-4 relative polarimetric precision. The new detector allows for
the movement of charge on the device to be synchronized with phase changes in
the liquid-crystal variable retarders at rates of >5Hz. It also allows for more
efficient observing on bright targets by effectively increasing the pixel well
depth. With the new detector, low and high resolution modes and polarization
calibrations for the instrument and telescope, we substantially reduce
limitations to the precision and accuracy of this new spectropolarimetric tool.
