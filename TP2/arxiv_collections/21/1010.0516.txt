The existence of a natural and projectively invariant quantization in the
sense of P. Lecomte [Progr. Theoret. Phys. Suppl. (2001), no. 144, 125-132] was
proved by M. Bordemann [math.DG/0208171], using the framework of
Thomas-Whitehead connections. We extend the problem to the context of
supermanifolds and adapt M. Bordemann's method in order to solve it. The
obtained quantization appears as the natural globalization of the
$\mathfrak{pgl}({n+1|m})$-equivariant quantization on ${\mathbb{R}}^{n|m}$
constructed by P. Mathonet and F. Radoux in [arXiv:1003.3320]. Our quantization
is also a prolongation to arbitrary degree symbols of the projectively
invariant quantization constructed by J. George in [arXiv:0909.5419] for
symbols of degree two.
