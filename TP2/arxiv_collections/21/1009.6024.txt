In this paper, we study the laser cooling mechanisms with a new quantum
theory approach by applying a new Schrodinger equation, which can describe a
particle in conservative and non-conservative force field. With the new theory,
we prove the atom in laser field can be cooled, and give the atom cooling
temperature, which is accordance with experiment result. Otherwise, we give new
prediction that the atom cooling temperature is directly proportional to the
atom vibration frequency. By calculation, we find they are: $T=0.4334\omega$.
