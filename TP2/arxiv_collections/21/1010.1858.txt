Recent theory and experiment have suggested that space-charge-limited
transport should be prevalent in high aspect-ratio semiconducting nanowires. We
report on InAs nanowires exhibiting this mode of transport and utilize the
underlying theory to determine the mobility and effective carrier concentration
of individual nanowires, both of which are found to be diameter-dependent.
Intentionally induced failure by Joule heating supports the notion of
space-charge-limited transport and proposes reduced thermal conductivity due to
the nanowires polymorphism.
