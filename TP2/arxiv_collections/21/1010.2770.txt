Despite the recent progress towards efficient multiple kernel learning (MKL),
the structured output case remains an open research front. Current approaches
involve repeatedly solving a batch learning problem, which makes them
inadequate for large scale scenarios. We propose a new family of online
proximal algorithms for MKL (as well as for group-lasso and variants thereof),
which overcomes that drawback. We show regret, convergence, and generalization
bounds for the proposed method. Experiments on handwriting recognition and
dependency parsing testify for the successfulness of the approach.
