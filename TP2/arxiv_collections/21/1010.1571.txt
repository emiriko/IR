Using the transfer matrix method, we study the conductance of the chiral
particles through a monolayer graphene superlattice with long-range correlated
disorder distributed on the potential of the barriers. Even though the
transmission of the particles through graphene superlattice with white noise
potentials is suppressed, the transmission is revived in a wide range of angles
when the potential heights are long-range correlated with a power spectrum
$S(k)\sim1/k^{\beta}$. As a result, the conductance increases with increasing
the correlation exponent values gives rise a metallic phase. We obtain a phase
transition diagram in which a critical correlation exponent depends strongly on
disorder strength and slightly on the energy of the incident particles. The
phase transition, on the other hand, appears in all ranges of the energy from
propagating to evanescent mode regimes.
