We present a study of the Seebeck and Nernst coefficients of
Fe$_{1+y}$Te$_{1-x}$Se$_{x}$ extended up to 28 T. The large magnitude of the
Seebeck coefficient in the optimally doped sample tracks a remarkably low
normalized Fermi temperature, which, like other correlated superconductors, is
only one order of magnitude larger than T$_c$. We combine our data with other
experimentally measured coefficients of the system to extract a set of
self-consistent parameters, which identify Fe$_{1+y}$Te$_{0.6}$Se$_{0.4}$ as a
low-density correlated superconductor barely in the clean limit. The system is
subject to strong superconducting fluctuations with a sizeable vortex Nernst
signal in a wide temperature window.
