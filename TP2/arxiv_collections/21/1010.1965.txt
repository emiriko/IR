Multicellular tumor spheroids are an important {\it in vitro} model of the
pre-vascular phase of solid tumors, for sizes well below the diagnostic limit:
therefore a biophysical model of spheroids has the ability to shed light on the
internal workings and organization of tumors at a critical phase of their
development. To this end, we have developed a computer program that integrates
the behavior of individual cells and their interactions with other cells and
the surrounding environment. It is based on a quantitative description of
metabolism, growth, proliferation and death of single tumor cells, and on
equations that model biochemical and mechanical cell-cell and cell-environment
interactions. The program reproduces existing experimental data on spheroids,
and yields unique views of their microenvironment. Simulations show complex
internal flows and motions of nutrients, metabolites and cells, that are
otherwise unobservable with current experimental techniques, and give novel
clues on tumor development and strong hints for future therapies.
