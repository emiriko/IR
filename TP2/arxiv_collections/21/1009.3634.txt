We derive the spin-atomic vibration interaction $V_{\rm SA}$ and the
spin-flip Hamiltonian $V_{\rm SF}$ of a single atomic spin in a crystal field.
We here apply the perturbation theory to a model with the spin-orbit
interaction and the kinetic and potential energies of electrons. The model also
takes into account the difference in vibration displacement between an
effective nucleus and electrons, $\Delta {{\boldmath $r$}}$. Examining the
coefficients of $V_{\rm SA}$ and $V_{\rm SF}$, we first show that $V_{\rm SA}$
appears for $\Delta {{\boldmath $r$}}$$\ne$0, while $V_{\rm SF}$ is present
independently of $\Delta {{\boldmath $r$}}$. As an application, we next obtain
$V_{\rm SA}$ and $V_{\rm SF}$ of an Fe ion in a crystal field of tetragonal
symmetry. It is found that the magnitudes of the coefficients of $V_{\rm SA}$
can be larger than those of the conventional spin-phonon interaction depending
on vibration frequency. In addition, transition probabilities per unit time due
to $V_{\rm SA}$ and $V_{\rm SF}$ are investigated for the Fe ion with an
anisotropy energy of $-|D|S_Z^2$, where $D$ is an anisotropy constant and $S_Z$
is the $Z$ component of a spin operator.
