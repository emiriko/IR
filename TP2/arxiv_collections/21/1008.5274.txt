We provide a scheme for exploring the reconstruction limit of compressed
sensing by minimizing the general cost function under the random measurement
constraints for generic correlated signal sources. Our scheme is based on the
statistical mechanical replica method for dealing with random systems. As a
simple but non-trivial example, we apply the scheme to a sparse autoregressive
model, where the first differences in the input signals of the correlated time
series are sparse, and evaluate the critical compression rate for a perfect
reconstruction. The results are in good agreement with a numerical experiment
for a signal reconstruction.
