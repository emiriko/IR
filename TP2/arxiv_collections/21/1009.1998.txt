Scalar leptoquarks, with baryon and lepton number conserving interactions,
could have TeV scale masses, and be produced at colliders or contribute to a
wide variety of rare decays. In pursuit of some insight as to the most
sensitive search channels, We assume that the leptoquark-lepton-quark coupling
can be constructed from the known mass matrices. We estimate the rates for
selected rare processes in three cases: leptoquarks carrying lepton and quark
flavour, leptoquarks with quark flavour only, and unflavoured leptoquarks. We
find that leptoquark decay to top quarks is an interesting search channel.
