Great efficiency to penetrate into living cells is attributed to carbon
nanotubes due to a number of direct and indirect observations of carbon
nanotubes inside the cells. However, a direct evidence of physical
translocation of nanotubes through phospholipid bilayers and the exact
microscopic mechanism of their penetration into cells are still lacking. In
order to test one of the inferred translocation mechanisms, namely the
spontaneous piercing through the membrane induced only by thermal motion, we
calculate the energy cost associated with the insertion of a carbon nanotube
into a model phospholipid bilayer using the Single Chain Mean Field theory
which is particularly suitable for the accurate measurements of equilibrium
free energies. We find that the energy cost of the bilayer rupture is quite
high compared to the energy of thermal motion. This conclusion may indirectly
support other energy dependent translocation mechanisms such as, for example,
endocytosis.
