Let $\Omega$ be an open subset of $\Ri^d$ with $0\in \Omega$.
  Further let $H_\Omega=-\sum^d_{i,j=1}\partial_i\,c_{ij}\,\partial_j$ be a
second-order partial differential operator with domain $C_c^\infty(\Omega)$
where the coefficients $c_{ij}\in W^{1,\infty}_{\rm loc}(\bar\Omega)$ are real,
$c_{ij}=c_{ji}$ and the coefficient matrix $C=(c_{ij})$ satisfies bounds
$0<C(x)\leq c(|x|) I$ for all $x\in \Omega$. If \[
\int^\infty_0ds\,s^{d/2}\,e^{-\lambda\,\mu(s)^2}<\infty \] for some $\lambda>0$
where $\mu(s)=\int^s_0dt\,c(t)^{-1/2}$ then we establish that $H_\Omega$ is
$L_1$-unique, i.e.\ it has a unique $L_1$-extension which generates a
continuous semigroup, if and only if it is Markov unique, i.e.\ it has a unique
$L_2$-extension which generates a submarkovian semigroup. Moreover these
uniqueness conditions are equivalent with the capacity of the boundary of
$\Omega$, measured with respect to $H_\Omega$, being zero. We also demonstrate
that the capacity depends on two gross features, the Hausdorff dimension of
subsets $A$ of the boundary the set and the order of degeneracy of $H_\Omega$
at $A$.
