We examine the parametrization of the e+e- -> omega pi0 cross section in the
vicinity of the phi resonance and the extraction of the branching fraction of
the isospin violating process phi -> omega pi0 from experimental data. We found
that there are two possible solutions of the branching fraction, one is 4 times
10^{-5}, and the other is 7 times 10^{-3}. The latter is two orders of
magnitude higher than the former, which is the commonly accepted one.
