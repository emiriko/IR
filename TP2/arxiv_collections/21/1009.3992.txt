A recent letter [H. Zhu et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 105, 126803 (2010)] reports
the first measurements of a pinned mode in a Wigner solid at the (electronic)
nu = 1/3 fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) filling. The authors suggest
that an interpretation of their findings may be found within the interacting
composite fermion (ICF) theory. However, to date there is no record reporting
crystalline correlations for nu ~ 1/3 obtained from ICF theory, or related
theories. We argue that an appropriate interpretation of these findings follows
naturally from the rotating-Wigner-molecule approach, which (with inclusion of
the rovibrational spectrum of the molecule) encompasses both the crystalline
and liquid aspects in the FQHE regime (in particular for nu=1/3, as well as in
its neighborhood created by deviations of nu from 1/3, as revealed
experimentally).
