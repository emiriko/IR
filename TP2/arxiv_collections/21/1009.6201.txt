This is a brief summary of topics that were presented as lectures within the
programme "New Frontiers in QCD 2010" at the Yukawa Institute of Theoretical
Physics in Kyoto. The basic subject is phases and symmetry breaking patterns as
they emerge from the approximate chiral symmetry of QCD. Part I focuses on the
QCD interface with nuclear physics via chiral effective field theory. This
includes nuclear thermodynamics and, in particular, constraints for compressed
and hot baryonic matter provided by the density and temperature dependence of
the chiral condensate. Part II explores aspects of the QCD phase diagram using
a non-local improved version of the Polyakov - Nambu - Jona-Lasinio (PNJL)
model. A prominent feature of such an approach is the occurence of a dynamical
entanglement between chiral and deconfinement crossover transitions.
Comparisons with available results from lattice QCD thermodynamics will be
made.
