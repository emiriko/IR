For the last decade quantum memories have been intensively studied for
potential applications to quantum information and communications using atomic
and ionic ensembles. With the importance of a multimode storage capability in
quantum memories, on-demand control of reversible inhomogeneous broadening of
an optical medium has been broadly investigated recently. However, the photon
storage time in these researches is still too short to apply for long-distance
quantum communications. In this paper, we demonstrate new physics of spin
population decay dependent ultralong photon storage method, where spin
population decay time is several orders of magnitude longer than the
conventional constraint of spin phase decay time.
