A new preliminary result of a gluon polarisation \Delta G/G obtained
selecting high transverse momentum hadron pairs in DIS events with Q^2>1
(GeV/c)^2 is presented. Data has been collected by COMPASS at CERN during the
2002-2004 years. In the extraction of $\Delta G/G$ contributions coming from
the leading order $\gamma q$ and QCD processes are taken into account. A new
weighting method based on a neural network approach is used. Also a preliminary
result of \Delta G/G for events with Q^2<1 (GeV/c)^2 is presented.
