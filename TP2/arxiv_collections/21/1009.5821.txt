We present a summary of main results from the studies performed in the series
of papers "The chemical composition of the Orion star forming region". We
reinvestigate the chemical composition of B-type stars in the Orion OB1
association by means of state-of-the-art stellar atmosphere codes, atomic
models and techniques, and compare the resulting abundances with those obtained
from the emission line spectra of the Orion nebula (M42), and recent
determinations of the Solar chemical composition.
