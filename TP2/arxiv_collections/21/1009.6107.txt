We describe a geometric-combinatorial algorithm that allows one, using solely
the system of weights and roots, to determine the Hesselink strata of the
null-cone of a linear representation of a reductive algebraic group and
calculate their dimensions. In particular, it provides a constructive approach
to calculating the dimension of the null-cone and determining all its
irreducible components of maximal dimension. In the case of the adjoint
representation (and, more generally, a $\theta$-representation), the algorithm
turns into the classification algorithm for the conjugacy classes of nilpotent
elements in a semisimple Lie algebra (respectively, homogeneous nilpotent
elements in a cyclically graded semisimple Lie algebra).
