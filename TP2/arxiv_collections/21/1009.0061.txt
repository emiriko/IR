Numerical simulations of HH jets never show side-entrainment of environmental
material into the jet beam. This is because the bow shock associated with the
jet head pushes the surrounding environment into a dense shell, which is never
in direct contact with the sides of the jet beam. We present 3D simulations in
which a side-streaming motion (representing the motion of the outflow source
through the surrounding medium) pushes the post-bow shock shell into direct
contact with the jet beam. This is a possible mechanism for modelling well
collimated "molecular jets" as an atomic/ionic flow which entrains molecules
initially present only in the surrounding environment.
