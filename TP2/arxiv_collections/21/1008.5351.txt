Event by event EPOS calculations in which the expansion of the system is
described by {\it ideal} hydrodynamics reproduce well the measured centrality
dependence of $v_2/\epsilon_{part}$, although it has been claimed that only
viscous hydrodynamics can reproduce these data. This is due to the core -
corona effect which manifests itself in the initial condition of the
hydrodynamical expansion. The centrality dependence of $v_2/\epsilon_{part}$
can be understood in the recently advanced core-corona model, a simple
parameter free EPOS inspired model to describe the centrality dependence of
different observables from SPS to RHIC energies. This model has already been
successfully applied to understand the centrality dependence of multiplicities
and of the average transverse momentum of identified particles.
