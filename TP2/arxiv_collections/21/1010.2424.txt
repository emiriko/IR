In this dissertation, we review the study of quark and monopole bound-state
potentials within the gauge/gravity correspondence. Their behaviors often
differ from what is expected on general physical grounds and field-theory
considerations. We identify the configurations of physical interest by
examining the stability of the string (brane) solutions dual to the flux tubes
between the bound states. In particular, we formulate and prove several general
statements concerning the perturbative stability of such string (brane)
solutions, relevant for these configurations in a general class of backgrounds.
We apply the results to N = 4 SYM and N = 1 at finite temperature and at
generic points of the Coulomb branch. In all cases, the problematic regions are
found to be unstable and hence physically irrelevant.
