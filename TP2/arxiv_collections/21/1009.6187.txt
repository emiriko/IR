We examine the long-term asymptotic behavior of dissipating solutions to
aggregation equations and Patlak-Keller-Segel models with degenerate power-law
and linear diffusion. The purpose of this work is to identify when solutions
decay to the self-similar spreading solutions of the homogeneous diffusion
equations. Combined with strong decay estimates, entropy-entropy dissipation
methods provide a natural solution to this question and make it possible to
derive quantitative convergence rates in $L^1$. The estimated rate depends only
on the nonlinearity of the diffusion and the strength of the interaction kernel
at long range.
