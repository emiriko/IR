We review progress made over the past couple of years in the field of Swiss
Cheese Phenomenology involving a mobile space-time filling D3-brane and
stack(s) of fluxed D7-branes wrapping the "big" (as opposed to the "small")
divisor in (the orientifold of a) Swiss-Cheese Calabi-Yau. The topics reviewed
include reconciliation of large volume cosmology and phenomenology, evaluation
of soft supersymmetry breaking parameters, one-loop RG-flow equations'
solutions for scalar masses, obtaining fermionic (possibly first two
generations' quarks/leptons) mass scales in the O(MeV-GeV)-regime as well as
(first two generations') neutrino masses (and their one-loop RG flow) of around
an eV. The heavy sparticles and the light fermions indicate the possibility of
"split SUSY" large volume scenario.
