We describe Laplacian operators on the quantum group SUq (2) equipped with
the four dimensional bicovariant differential calculus of Woronowicz as well as
on the quantum homogeneous space S2q with the restricted left covariant three
dimensional differential calculus. This is done by giving a family of Hodge
dualities on both the exterior algebras of SUq (2) and S2q . We also study
gauged Laplacian operators acting on sections of line bundles over the quantum
sphere.
