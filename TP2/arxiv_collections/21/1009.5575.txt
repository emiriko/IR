Sensitive transduction of the motion of a microscale cantilever is central to
many applications in mass, force, magnetic resonance, and displacement sensing.
Reducing cantilever size to nanoscale dimensions can improve the bandwidth and
sensitivity of techniques like atomic force microscopy, but current optical
transduction methods suffer when the cantilever is small compared to the
achievable spot size. Here, we demonstrate sensitive optical transduction in a
monolithic cavity-optomechanical system in which a sub-picogram silicon
cantilever with a sharp probe tip is separated from a microdisk optical
resonator by a nanoscale gap. High quality factor (Q ~ 10^5) microdisk optical
modes transduce the cantilever's MHz frequency thermally-driven vibrations with
a displacement sensitivity of ~ 4.4x10^-16 m\sqrt[2]{Hz} and bandwidth > 1 GHz,
and a dynamic range > 10^6 is estimated for a 1 s measurement.
Optically-induced stiffening due to the strong optomechanical interaction is
observed, and engineering of probe dynamics through cantilever design and
electrostatic actuation is illustrated.
