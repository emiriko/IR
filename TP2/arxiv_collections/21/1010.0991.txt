We report a measurement of the positive muon lifetime to a precision of 1.0
parts per million (ppm); it is the most precise particle lifetime ever
measured. The experiment used a time-structured, low-energy muon beam and a
segmented plastic scintillator array to record more than 2 x 10^{12} decays.
Two different stopping target configurations were employed in independent
data-taking periods. The combined results give tau_{mu^+}(MuLan) =
2196980.3(2.2) ps, more than 15 times as precise as any previous experiment.
The muon lifetime gives the most precise value for the Fermi constant:
G_F(MuLan) = 1.1663788 (7) x 10^-5 GeV^-2 (0.6 ppm). It is also used to extract
the mu^-p singlet capture rate, which determines the proton's weak induced
pseudoscalar coupling g_P.
