In this work a supersymmetric cosmological model is analyzed in which we
consider a general superfield action of a homogeneous scalar field
supermultiplet interacting with the scale factor in a supersymmetric FRW model.
There appear fermionic superpartners associated with both the scale factor and
the scalar field, and classical equations of motion are obtained from the
super-Wheeler-DeWitt equation through the usual WKB method. The resulting
supersymmetric Einstein-Klein-Gordon equations contain extra radiation and
stiff matter terms, and we study their solutions in flat space for different
scalar field potentials. The solutions are compared to the standard case, in
particular those corresponding to the exponential potential, and their
implications for the dynamics of the early Universe are discussed in turn.
