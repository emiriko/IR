Through a simple and exact analytical derivation, we show that for a particle
on a lattice, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the spectra in the
presence of an attractive potential $\hat{V}$ and its repulsive counterpart
$-\hat{V}$. For a Hermitian potential, this result implies that the number of
localized states is the same in both, attractive and repulsive, cases although
these states occur above (below) the band-continnum for the repulsive
(attractive) case. For a $\mP\mT$-symmetric potential that is odd under parity,
our result implies that in the $\mP\mT$-unbroken phase, the energy eigenvalues
are symmetric around zero, and that the corresponding eigenfunctions are
closely related to each other.
