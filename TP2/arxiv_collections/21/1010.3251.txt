While Monte Carlo event generators like WHIZARD have become indispensable
tools in studying the impact of new physics on collider observables over the
last decades, the implementation of new models in such packages has remained a
rather awkward and error-prone process. Recently, the FeynRules package was
introduced which greatly simplifies this process by providing a single unified
model format from which model implementations for many different Monte Carlo
codes can be derived automatically. In this note, we present an interface which
extends FeynRules to provide this functionality also for the WHIZARD package,
thus making WHIZARD's strengths and performance easily available to model
builders.
