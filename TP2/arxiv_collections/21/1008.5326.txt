We calculate the $B_{u,d,s}\to T$ form factors within the framework of the
perturbative QCD approach, where $T$ denotes a light tensor meson with
$J^P=2^+$. Due to the similarities between the wave functions of a vector and a
tensor meson, the factorization formulas of $B\to T$ form factors can be
obtained from the $B\to V$ transition through a replacement rule. As a
consequence, we find that these two sets of form factors have the same signs
and correlated $q^2$-dependence behaviors. At $q^2=0$ point, the $B\to T$ form
factors are smaller than the $B\to V$ ones, in accordance with the experimental
data of radiative B decays. In addition, we use our results for the form
factors to explore semilteptonic $B\to Tl\bar \nu_l$ decays and the branching
fractions can reach the order $10^{-4}$.
