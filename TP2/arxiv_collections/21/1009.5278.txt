The adsorption of carbon monoxide on neutral iridium clusters in the size
range of n = 3 to 21 atoms is investigated with infrared multiple photon
dissociation spectroscopy. For each cluster size only a single v(CO) band is
present with frequencies in the range between 1962 cm-1 (n = 8) and 1985 cm-1
(n = 18) which can be attributed to an atop binding geometry. This behaviour is
compared to the CO binding geometries on clusters of other group 9 and 10
transition metals as well as to that on extended surfaces. The preference of Ir
for atop binding is rationalized by relativistic effects on the electronic
structure of the later 5d metals.
