A main scientific output of the LISA Pathfinder mission is to provide a noise
model that can be extended to the future gravitational wave observatory, LISA.
The success of the mission depends thus upon a deep understanding of the
instrument, especially the ability to correctly determine the parameters of the
underlying noise model. In this work we estimate the parameters of a simplified
model of the LISA Technology Package (LTP) instrument. We describe the LTP by
means of a closed-loop model that is used to generate the data, both injected
signals and noise. Then, parameters are estimated using a Bayesian framework
and it is shown that this method reaches the optimal attainable error, the
Cramer-Rao bound. We also address an important issue for the mission: how to
efficiently combine the results of different experiments to obtain a unique set
of parameters describing the instrument.
