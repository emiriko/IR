We present a general scheme for treating particle beams as many particle
systems. This includes the full counting statistics and the requirements of
Bose/Fermi symmetry. In the stationary limit, i.e., for longer and longer
beams, the total particle number diverges, and a description in Fock space is
no longer possible. We therefore extend the formalism to include stationary
beams. These beams exhibit a well-defined "local" counting statistics, by which
we mean the full counting statistics of all clicks falling into any given
finite interval. We treat in detail a model of a source, creating particles in
a fixed state, which then evolve under the free time evolution, and we
determine the resulting stationary beam in the far field. In comparison to the
one-particle picture we obtain a correction due to Bose/Fermi statistics, which
depends on the emission rate. We also consider plane waves as stationary many
particle states, and determine the distribution of intervals between successive
clicks in such a beam.
