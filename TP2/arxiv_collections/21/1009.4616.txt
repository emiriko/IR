We study the peculiarities of stretching of globular polymer macromolecules
in a disordered (crowded) environment, using the model of self-attracting
self-avoiding walks on site-diluted percolative lattices in space dimensions
d=3. Applying the pruned-enriched Rosenbluth chain-growth method (PERM), we
construct the phase diagram of collapsed-extended state coexistence when
varying temperature and stretching force. The change in shape characteristics
of globular polymers under stretching is analyzed as well.
