We present a study of the $D^+\pi^-$, $D^0\pi^+$, and $D^{*+}\pi^-$ systems
in inclusive $e^+e^- \rightarrow c\bar{c}$ interactions in a search for new
excited $D$ meson states. We use a dataset, consisting of $\sim$454 fb$^{-1}$,
collected at center-of-mass energies near 10.58 GeV by the BABAR detector at
the SLAC PEP-II asymmetric-energy collider. We observe, for the first time,
candidates for the radial excitations of the $D^0$, $D^{*0}$, and $D^{*+}$, as
well as the L=2 excited states of the $D^0$ and $D^+$, where $L$ is the orbital
angular momentum of the quarks.
