We analyse the conformational behaviour of a linear semiflexible homo-polymer
chain confined by two geometrical constraints under a good solvent condition in
two dimensions. The constraints are stair shaped impenetrable surfaces. The
impenetrable surfaces are lines in a two dimensional space. The infinitely long
polymer chain is confined in between such two (A and B) surfaces. A lattice
model of a fully directed self-avoiding walk is used to calculate the exact
expression of the partition function, when the chain has attractive interaction
with one or both the constraints. It has been found that under the proposed
model, the chain shows only a bulk behaviour. In other words, there is no
possibility of adsorption of the chain due to restrictions imposed on the walks
of the chain.
