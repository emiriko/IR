These notes constitute a sort of Crash Course in Optimal Transport Theory.
The different features of the problem of Monge-Kantorovitch are treated,
starting from convex duality issues. The main properties of space of
probability measures endowed with the distances $W_p$ induced by optimal
transport are detailed. The key tools to put in relation optimal transport and
PDEs are provided.
