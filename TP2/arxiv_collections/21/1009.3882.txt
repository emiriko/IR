We study the five-orbital Hubbard-Holstein model for iron pnictides with
small electron-phonon interaction due to Fe-ion Einstein oscillators. Using the
fluctuation-exchange (FLEX) approximation, orbital fluctuations evolve
inversely proportional to the temperature, and therefore the resistivity shows
linear or convex T-dependence for wide range of temperatures. We also analyze
the Eliashberg gap equation, and show that s-wave superconducting state without
sign reversal (s_{++}-wave state) emerges when the orbital fluctuations
dominate the spin fluctuations. When both fluctuations are comparable, their
competition gives rise to a nodal s-wave state. The present study offers us a
unified explanation for both the normal and superconducting states.
