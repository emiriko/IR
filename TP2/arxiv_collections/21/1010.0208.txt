A step by step procedure to derive analytically the exact dynamical evolution
equations of the probability density functions (PDF) of well known kinetic
wealth exchange economic models is shown. This technique gives a dynamical
insight into the evolution of the PDF, e.g., allowing the calculation of its
relaxation times. Their equilibrium PDFs can also be calculated by finding its
stationary solutions. This gives as a result an integro-differential equation,
which can be solved analytically in some cases and numerically in others. This
should provide some guidance into the type of probability density functions
that can be derived from particular economic agent exchange rules, or for that
matter, any other kinetic model of gases with particular collision physics.
