Wave-front sensing from focal plane multiple images is a promising technique
for high-contrast imaging systems. However, the wave-front error of an optics
system can be properly reconstructed only when it is very small. This paper
presents an iterative optimization algorithm for the measurement of large
static wave-front errors directly from only one focal plane image. We firstly
measure the intensity of the pupil image to get the pupil function of the
system and acquire the aberrated image on the focal plane with a phase error
that is to be measured. Then we induce a dynamic phase to the tested pupil
function and calculate the associated intensity of the reconstructed image on
the focal plane. The algorithm is to minimize the intensity difference between
the reconstructed image and the tested aberrated image on the focal plane,
where the induced phase is as the variable of the optimization algorithm. The
simulation shows that the wave-front of an optics system can be theoretically
reconstructed with a high precision, which indicates that such an iterative
algorithm may be an effective way for the wave-front sensing for high-contrast
imaging systems.
