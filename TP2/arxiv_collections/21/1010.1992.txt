We use exact diagonalization to explore the many-body localization transition
in a random-field spin-1/2 chain. We examine the correlations within each
many-body eigenstate, looking at all high-energy states and thus effectively
working at infinite temperature. For weak random field the eigenstates are
thermal, as expected in this nonlocalized, "ergodic" phase. For strong random
field the eigenstates are localized, with only short-range entanglement. We
roughly locate the localization transition and examine some of its finite-size
scaling, finding that this quantum phase transition at nonzero temperature
might be showing infinite-randomness scaling with a dynamic critical exponent
$z\rightarrow\infty$.
