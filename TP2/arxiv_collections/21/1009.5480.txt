Cooling antihydrogen atoms is important for future experiments both to test
the fundamental CPT symmetry by high-resolution laser spectroscopy and also to
measure the gravitational acceleration of antimatter. Laser-cooling of
antihydrogen can be done on the strong 1S-2P transition at the wavelength of
Lyman-alpha (121.6nm). A continuous-wave laser at the Lyman-alpha wavelength
based on solid-state fundamental lasers is described. By using a two-photon and
a near one photon resonance a scan across the whole phasematching curve of the
four-wave mixing process is possible. Furthermore the influence of the beam
profile of one fundamental beam on the four-wave mixing process is studied.
