Using a recently developed technique to solve Schr\"odinger equation for
constant mass, we studied the regime in which mass varies with position i.e
position dependent mass Schr\"odinger equation(PDMSE). We obtained an
analytical solution for the PDMSE and applied our approach to study a position
dependent mass $m(x)$ particle scattered by a potential $\mathcal{V}(x)$. We
also studied the structural analogy between PDMSE and two-level atomic system
interacting with a classical field.
