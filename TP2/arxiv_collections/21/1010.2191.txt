We study the propagation of surface waves on a current in the presence of an
electromagnetic field. A horizontal (vertical) field strengthens (weakens) the
counter-current which blocks the waves. We compute the phase space diagrams
(blocking velocities versus period of the waves) with and without surface
tension. Three new dimensionless numbers are introduced to compare the relative
strengths of gravity, surface tension and field effects. This work shows the
importance of an electromagnetic field in order to design wave-breakers or in
microfluidics applications.
