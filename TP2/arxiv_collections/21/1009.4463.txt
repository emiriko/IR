Adaptive optics workbenches are fully functional optical systems that can be
used to illustrate and teach a variety of concepts and cognitive processes.
Four systems have been funded, designed and constructed by various institutions
and people as part of education programs associated with the Center for
Adaptive Optics, the Professional Development Program and the Institute for
Science and Engineer Educators. Activities can range from first-year
undergraduate explorations to professional level training. These workbenches
have been used in many venues including the Center for Adaptive Optics AO
Summer School, the Maui Community College hosted Akamai Maui Short Course,
classrooms, training of new staff in laboratories and other venues. The
activity content has focused on various elements of systems thinking,
characterization, feedback and system control, basic optics and optical
alignment as well as advanced topics such as phase conjugation, wave-front
sensing and correction concepts and system design. The workbenches have
slightly different designs and performance capabilities. We describe here
outlines for several activities utilizing these different designs and some
examples of common student learner outcomes and experiences.
