We consider asymptotically flat Riemannian manifolds with nonnegative scalar
curvature that are conformal to $\R^{n}\setminus \Omega, n\ge 3$, and so that
their boundary is a minimal hypersurface. (Here, $\Omega\subset \R^{n}$ is open
bounded with smooth mean-convex boundary.) We prove that the ADM mass of any
such manifold is bounded below by $(V/\beta_{n})^{(n-2)/n}$, where $V$ is the
Euclidean volume of $\Omega$ and $\beta_{n}$ is the volume of the Euclidean
unit $n$-ball. This gives a partial proof to a conjecture of Bray and Iga
\cite{brayiga}. Surprisingly, we do not require the boundary to be outermost.
