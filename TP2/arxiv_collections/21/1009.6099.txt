For nuclei near a maximum of the neutron strength function, the secular
dependence on energy E of s-wave partial neutron widths differs from the
canonical form given by the square root of E. We derive the universal form of
that dependence and show that it is expected to significantly influence the
analysis of neutron resonance data.
