Consider that an incident plane wave is scattered by a homogeneous and
isotropic magnetic sphere of finite radius. We determine, by means of the
rigorous Mie theory, an exact expression for the time-averaged electromagnetic
energy within this particle. For magnetic scatterers, we find that the value of
the average internal energy in the resonance picks is much larger than the one
associated with a scatterer with the same nonmagnetic medium properties. This
result is valid even, and specially, for low size parameter values. Expressions
for the contributions of the radial and angular field components to the
internal energy are determined. For the analytical study of the weak absorption
regime, we derive an exact expression for the absorption cross section in terms
of the magnetic Mie internal coefficients. We stress that although the
electromagnetic scattering by particles is a well-documented topic, almost no
attention has been devoted to magnetic scatterers. Our aim is to provide some
new analytical results, which can be used for magnetic particles, and empha-
size the unusual properties of the magnetic scatters, which could be important
in some applications.
