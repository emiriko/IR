We consider a straight one-dimensional potential step created across a
graphene flake. Charge and spin transport through such a potential step are
studied in the presence of both intrinsic and extrinsic (Rashba) spin-orbit
coupling (SOC). At normal incidence electrons are completely reflected when the
Rashba interaction (with strength $\lambda_R$) is dominant whereas they are
perfectly transmitted if the two types of SOC are exactly balanced. At normal
incidence, the transmission probability of the step is thus controlled
continuously from 0 to 1 by tuning the ratio of the two types of SOC. Besides
the transport of charge in the direction normal to the barrier, we show the
existence of a spin transport along the barrier. The magnitude of the spin Hall
current is determined by a subtle interplay between the height of the potential
step and the position of Fermi energy. It is demonstrated that contributions
from inter-band matrix elements and evanescent modes are dominant in spin
transport. Moreover, in the case of vanishing extrinsic SOC ($\lambda_R =0$),
each channel carries a conserved spin current, in contrast to the general case
of a finite $\lambda_R$, in which only integrated spin current is a conserved
quantity. Finally, we provide a quasi-classical picture of the charge and spin
transport by imaging flow lines over the entire sample and Veselago lensing
(negative refraction) in the case of a $p-n$ junction.
