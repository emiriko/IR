Among the 100 strong lens candidates found in the COSMOS field, 20 with
redshifts in the range [0.34,1.13], feature multiple images of background
sources. Using the multi-wavelength coverage of the field and its spectroscopic
follow-up, we characterize the evolution with redshift of the environment and
of the dark-matter (DM) fraction of the lens galaxies. We present new redshift
of the strong lens candidates. The lens environment is characterized by the
projected 10 closest galaxies around each lens and by the number of galaxies
with a projected distance less than 1Mpc at the lens galaxy redshift. In both
cases, we perform similar measurements on a control sample of twin non-lens
early type galaxies (ETGs). In addition, we identify group members and field
galaxies in the X-ray and optical catalogs of galaxy groups. From those
catalogs, we measure the external shear contribution at the lens galaxy
positions. The systems are then modeled using a SIE plus the external shear due
to the groups. We observe that the average stellar mass of lens galaxies
increases with z and that the environment of lens galaxies is compatible with
that of the twins. During the lens modeling, we notice that, when let free, the
external shear points in a direction which is the mean direction of the
external shear due to groups and of the closest galaxy to the lens. We notice
that the DM fraction of the lens galaxies within the Einstein radius decreases
as the redshift increases. Given these, we conclude that, while the environment
of lens galaxies is compatible with that of non-lens ETGS, their mass
properties evolves significantly with redshift: it is still not clear whether
this advocates in favor of a stronger lensing bias toward massive objects at
high redshift or is simply representative of the high proportion of massive and
high stellar density galaxies at high redshift.
