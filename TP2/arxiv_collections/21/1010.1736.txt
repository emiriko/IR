Reactive cross-sections for the collision of open shell S(^1D) atoms with
ortho- and para-hydrogen, in the kinetic energy range 1-120 K, have been
calculated using the hyperspherical quantum reactive scattering method
developed by Launay et al. [Chem. Phys. Lett. 169, 473 (1990)]. Short-range
interactions, described using the {\em ab initio} potential energy surface by
Ho et al. were complemented with an accurate description of the long-range
interactions, where the main electrostatic (~R^{-5}) and dispersion (~ R^{-6})
contributions were considered. This allows the comparison with recent
experimental measurements of rate constants and excitation functions for the
title reaction at low temperatures [Berteloite et al., Phys. Rev. Lett., 2010].
The agreement is fairly good. The behavior in the considered energy range can
be understood on the average in terms of a classical Langevin (capture) model,
where the centrifugal barriers determine the amount of reactive flux which
reaches the barrierless transition state. Additionally, the structure of the
van der Waals well provides temporal trapping at short distances thus allowing
the system to find its way to the reaction at some classically-forbidden
energies. Interestingly, the cross-section for para-hydrogen shows clearly
oscillating features associated to the opening of new partial waves and to
shape resonances which may be amenable to experimental detection.
