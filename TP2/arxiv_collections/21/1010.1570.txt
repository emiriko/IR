We study dynamics of a test charged particle moving in a weakly charged
extreme Kerr throat. Dynamical equations of the particle motion are solved in
quadratures. We show explicitly that the Killing tensor of the Kerr spacetime
becomes reducible in the extreme Kerr throat geometry. Special types of motion
of particles and light are discussed.
