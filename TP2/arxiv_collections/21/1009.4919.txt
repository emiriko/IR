We consider tidal coupling in a binary stellar system to first-post-Newtonian
order. We derive the orbital equations of motion for bodies with spins and mass
quadrupole moments and show that they conserve the total linear momentum of the
binary. We note that spin-orbit coupling must be included in a 1PN treatment of
tidal interactions in order to maintain consistency (except in the special case
of adiabatically induced quadrupoles); inclusion of 1PN quadrupolar tidal
effects while omitting spin effects would lead to a failure of momentum
conservation for generic evolution of the quadrupoles. We use momentum
conservation to specialize our analysis to the system's center-of-mass-energy
frame; we find the binary's relative equation of motion in this frame and also
present a generalized Lagrangian from which it can be derived. We then
specialize to the case in which the quadrupole moment is adiabatically induced
by the tidal field (in which case it is consistent to ignore spin effects). We
show how the adiabatic dynamics for the quadrupole can be incorporated into our
action principle and present the simplified orbital equations of motion and
conserved energy for the adiabatic case. These results are relevant to
gravitational wave signals from inspiralling binary neutron stars.
