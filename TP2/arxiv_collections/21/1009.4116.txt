Magnetization dynamics in nanomagnets has attracted broad interest since it
was predicted that a dc-current flowing through a thin magnetic layer can
create spin-wave excitations. These excitations are due to spin-momentum
transfer, a transfer of spin angular momentum between conduction electrons and
the background magnetization, that enables new types of information processing.
Here we show how arrays of spin-torque nano-oscillators (STNO) can create
propagating spin-wave interference patterns of use for memory and computation.
Memristic transponders distributed on the thin film respond to threshold tunnel
magnetoresistance (TMR) values thereby detecting the spin-waves and creating
new excitation patterns. We show how groups of transponders create resonant
(reverberating) spin-wave interference patterns that may be used for
polychronous wave computation of arithmetic and boolean functions and
information storage.
