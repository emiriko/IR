Purpose: Iterative projection reconstruction algorithms are currently the
preferred reconstruction method in proton computed tomography (pCT). However,
due to inconsistencies in the measured data arising from proton energy
straggling and multiple Coulomb scattering, noise in the reconstructed image
increases with successive iterations. In the current work, we investigated the
use of total variation superiorization (TVS) schemes that can be applied as an
algorithmic add-on to perturbation-resilient iterative projection algorithms
for pCT image reconstruction. Methods: The block-iterative diagonally relaxed
orthogonal projections (DROP) algorithm was used for reconstructing Geant4
Monte Carlo simulated pCT data sets. Two TVS schemes added on to DROP were
investigated; the first carried out the superiorization steps once per cycle
and the second once per block. Simplifications of these schemes, involving the
elimination of the computationally expensive feasibility proximity checking
step of the TVS framework, were also investigated. The modulation transfer
function and contrast discrimination function were used to quantify spatial and
density resolution, respectively. Results: With both TVS schemes, superior
spatial and density resolution was achieved compared to the standard DROP
algorithm. Eliminating the feasibility proximity check improved the image
quality, in particular image noise, in the once-per-block superiorization,
while also halving image reconstruction time. Overall, the greatest image
quality was observed when carrying out the superiorization once-per-block and
eliminating the feasibility proximity check. Conclusions: The low contrast
imaging made possible with TVS holds a promise for its incorporation into our
future pCT studies.
