The chemical and physical evolution of primitive materials in protoplanetary
disks are determined by the types of environments they are exposed to and their
residence times within each environment. Here a method for calculating
representative paths of materials in diffusive protoplanetary disks is
developed and applied to understanding how the vertical trajectories that
particles take impact their overall evolution. The methods are general enough
to be applied to disks with uniform diffusivity, the so-called
"constant-$\alpha$" cases, and disks with a spatially varying diffusivity, such
as expected in "layered-disks." The average long-term dynamical evolution of
small particles and gaseous molecules is independent of the specific form of
the diffusivity in that they spend comparable fractions of their lifetimes at
different heights in the disk. However, the paths that individual particles and
molecules take depend strongly on the form of the diffusivity leading to a
different range of behavior of particles in terms of deviations from the mean.
As temperatures, gas densities, chemical abundances, and photon fluxes will
vary with height in protoplanetary disks, the different paths taken by
primitive materials will lead to differences in their chemical and physical
evolution. Examples of differences in gas phase chemistry and photochemistry
are explored here. The methods outlined here provide a means of integrating
particle dynamics with chemical models to understand the formation and
evolution of primitive materials in protoplanetary disks over timescales of
$10^5$-$10^6$ years.
