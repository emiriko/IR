This paper investigates compression of data encrypted with block ciphers,
such as the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). It is shown that such data can
be feasibly compressed without knowledge of the secret key. Block ciphers
operating in various chaining modes are considered and it is shown how
compression can be achieved without compromising security of the encryption
scheme. Further, it is shown that there exists a fundamental limitation to the
practical compressibility of block ciphers when no chaining is used between
blocks. Some performance results for practical code constructions used to
compress binary sources are presented.
