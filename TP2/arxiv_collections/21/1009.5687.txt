The aim of this work is to study the global existence of solutions for some
coupled systems of reaction diffusion which describe the spread within a
population of infectious disease. We consider a triangular matrix diffusion and
we show that we can prove global existence of classical solutions for the
nonlinearities of weakly exponential growth.
