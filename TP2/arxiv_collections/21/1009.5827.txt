We present some results about dissipative processes in fermionic superfluids
that are relevant for compact stars. At sufficiently low temperatures the
transport properties of a superfluid are dominated by phonons. We report the
values of the bulk viscosity, shear viscosity and thermal conductivity of
phonons in quark matter at extremely high density and low temperature. Then, we
present a new dissipative mechanism that can operate in compact stars and that
is named "rocket term". The effect of this dissipative mechanism on superfluid
r-mode oscillations is sketched.
