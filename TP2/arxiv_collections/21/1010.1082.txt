We have observed formation of penumbrae on a pore in the active region
NOAA10838 using Dunn Solar Telescope at NSO,Sunpot,USA. Simultaneous
observations using different instruments (DLSP,UBF,Gband and CaK) provide us
with vector magnetic field at photosphere, intensity images and Doppler
velocity at different heights from photosphere to chromosphere. Results from
our analysis of this particular data-set suggests that penumbrae are formed as
a result of relaxation of magnetic field due to a flare happening at the same
time. Images in \Halpha\ show the flare (C 2.9 as per GOES) and vector magnetic
fields show a re-orientation and reduction in the global $\alpha$ value (a
measure of twist). We feel such relaxation of loop structures due to
reconnections or flare could be one of the way by which field lines fall back
to the photosphere to form penumbrae.
