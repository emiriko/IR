We present the analysis of temperature variations in Portugal for 140 years
(from 1865 to 2005). The two stations with the longest time series of
temperature measurements (Lisbon and Coimbra) have been used to study the
dependence of the portuguese climate variations on the changes of both global
circulation and solar activity. Monthly averaged temperature series have been
analyzed together with monthly North-Atlantic Oscillation index data, sunspot
numbers and cosmic ray flux intensity. Different statistical methods (the
correlation analysis and the multiple regression analysis) were used. Our
results show that the temperature in Portugal depends not only on the
atmospheric variations in the studied region but also on the variations of the
solar parameters such as sunspot numbers and the cosmic rays flux intensity.
Also, the dependence of temperature on solar parameters is strong during the
cold season (November to February), while much weaker during the warm season.
For some months, strong correlations between the temperature variations of the
current month and the North-Atlantic Oscillation index values of the previous
month have been found. The correlation between climatic and solar parameters
shows up best on the decadal and decadal-to-centennial timescale. It is found
that the temperature correlates positively with the sunspot numbers and
negatively with the CR flux intensity throughout the year. Besides, the
absolute values of the correlation coefficients between the temperature and the
CR are higher than those between the temperature and the sunspot numbers. Our
results are consistent with some of the proposed mechanisms that relate solar
activity to Earth climate and could be explained through the effect of the
solar UV radiation and stratosphere-troposphere coupling or/and through the
effect of the CR particles on clouds and stratospheric and tropospheric
conditions.
