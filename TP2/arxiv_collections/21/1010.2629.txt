Using a dynamical density functional theory we analyze the density profile of
a colloidal liquid near a wall under shear flow. Due to the symmetries of the
system considered, the naive application of dynamical density functional theory
does not lead to a shear induced modification of the equilibrium density
profile, which would be expected on physical grounds. By introducing a
physically motivated dynamic mean field correction we incorporate the missing
shear induced interparticle forces into the theory. We find that the shear flow
tends to enhance the oscillations in the density profile of hard-spheres at a
hard-wall and, at sufficiently high shear rates, induces a nonequilibrium
transition to a steady state characterized by planes of particles parallel to
the wall. Under gravity, we find that the center-of-mass of the density
distribution increases with shear rate, i.e., shear increases the potential
energy of the particles.
