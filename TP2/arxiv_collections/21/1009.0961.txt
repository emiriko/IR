In this paper, we present a fast switching filter for impulsive noise removal
from color images. The filter exploits the HSL color space, and is based on the
peer group concept, which allows for the fast detection of noise in a
neighborhood without resorting to pairwise distance computations between each
pixel. Experiments on large set of diverse images demonstrate that the proposed
approach is not only extremely fast, but also gives excellent results in
comparison to various state-of-the-art filters.
