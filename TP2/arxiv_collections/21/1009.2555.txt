We assess the extent to which the NMSSM can allow for light dark matter in
the $2\gev\lsim \mcnone\lsim 12\gev$ mass range with correct relic density and
large spin-independent direct-detection cross section, $\sigsi$, in the range
suggested by \cogent\ and DAMA. For standard assumptions regarding nucleon
$s$-quark content and cosmological relic density, $\rho$, we find that the
NMSSM falls short by a factor of about 10 to 15 (3 to 5) without (with)
significant violation of the current $(g-2)_\mu$ constraints.
