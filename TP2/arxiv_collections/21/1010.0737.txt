The binding of polarons, or its absence, is an old and subtle topic. After
defining the model we state some recent theorems of ours. First, the transition
from many-body collapse to the existence of a thermodynamic limit for N
polarons occurs precisely at U=2\alpha, where U is the electronic Coulomb
repulsion and \alpha is the polaron coupling constant. Second, if U is large
enough, there is no multi-polaron binding of any kind. We also discuss the
Pekar-Tomasevich approximation to the ground state energy, which is valid for
large \alpha. Finally, we derive exact results, not reported before, about the
one-dimensional toy model introduced by E. P. Gross.
