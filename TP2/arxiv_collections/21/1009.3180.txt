This is a survey of results obtained jointly with E. Aljadeff and published
in Adv. Math. 218 (2008), 1453-1495. We explain how to set up a theory of
polynomial identities for comodule algebras over a Hopf algebra, and
concentrate on the universal comodule algebra constructed from the identities
satisfied by a given comodule algebra. All concepts are illustrated with
various examples.
