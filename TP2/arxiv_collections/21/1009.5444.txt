As an extension of the project in Kato et al. (2009, arXiv:0905.1757), we
collected times of superhump maxima for 61 SU UMa-type dwarf novae mainly
observed during the 2009-2010 season. The newly obtained data confirmed the
basic findings reported in Kato et al. (2009): the presence of stages A-C, as
well as the predominance of positive period derivatives during stage B in
systems with superhump periods shorter than 0.07 d. There was a systematic
difference in period derivatives for systems with superhump periods longer than
0.075 d between this study and Kato et al. (2009). We suggest that this
difference is possibly caused by the relative lack of frequently outbursting SU
UMa-type dwarf novae in this period regime in the present study. We recorded a
strong beat phenomenon during the 2009 superoutburst of IY UMa. The close
correlation between the beat period and superhump period suggests that the
changing angular velocity of the apsidal motion of the elliptical disk is
responsible for the variation of superhump periods. We also described three new
WZ Sge-type objects with established early superhumps and one with likely early
superhumps. We also suggest that two systems, VX For and EL UMa, are WZ
Sge-type dwarf novae with multiple rebrightenings. The O-C variation in OT
J213806.6+261957 suggests that the frequent absence of rebrightenings in very
short-Porb objects can be a result of sustained superoutburst plateau at the
epoch when usual SU UMa-type dwarf novae return to quiescence preceding a
rebrightening. We also present a formulation for a variety of Bayesian
extension to traditional period analyses.
