We present an algorithm for the explicit numerical calculation of SU(N) and
SL(N,C) Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, based on the Gelfand-Tsetlin pattern
calculus. Our algorithm is well-suited for numerical implementation; we include
a computer code in an appendix. Our exposition presumes only familiarity with
the representation theory of SU(2).
