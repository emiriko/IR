We study a distinct supersymmetric signal of multi-photons in association
with jets and missing transverse energy. At least one of these photons has the
origin in displaced vertex, thus delayed and non-pointing. We consider a
supersymmetric scenario in which the gravitino is the lightest supersymmetric
particle (LSP) (with a mass $\sim 1~{keV}$) and the lightest neutralino is the
next-to-lightest supersymmetric particle (NLSP). The NLSP decays dominantly
into a photon and a gravitino within the detector with a decay length ranging
from $c\tau_{\tilde{\chi}}\sim$ 50-100 cm. In addition, we assume that the
second lightest neutralino and the lightest neutralino are nearly degenerate
and this leads to a prompt radiative decay of the next-to-lightest neutralino
into a photon and a lightest neutralino with a large branching ratio. Such
degenerate neutralinos can be realised in various representations of the
$SU(5)$, $SO(10)$, and $E(6)$ Grand Unified Theories (GUTs). The non-pointing
photons can be reconstructed at the electromagnetic calorimeter of the ATLAS
inner-detector, which have been designed with good timing and directional
resolution. We find that with a centre-of-mass energy $E_{cm}=14 ~{TeV}$ at an
integrated luminosity of 100 $fb^{-1}$ one may see evidence of hundreds of
tri-photon events and a few four-photons events at the LHC, in addition to
several thousands di-photon events. We also predict the event rates even at the
early phase of LHC run.
