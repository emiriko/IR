While sharing resources the efficiency is substantially degraded as a result
of the scarceness of availability of the requested resources in a multiclient
support manner. These resources are often aggravated by many factors like the
temporal constraints for availability or node flooding by the requested
replicated file chunks. Thus replicated file chunks should be efficiently
disseminated in order to enable resource availability on-demand by the mobile
users. This work considers a cross layered middleware support system for
efficient delay-sensitive streaming by using each device's connectivity and
social interactions in a cross layered manner. The collaborative streaming is
achieved through the epidemically replicated file chunk policy which uses a
transition-based approach of a chained model of an infectious disease with
susceptible, infected, recovered and death states. The Gossip-based stateful
model enforces the mobile nodes whether to host a file chunk or not or, when no
longer a chunk is needed, to purge it. The proposed model is thoroughly
evaluated through experimental simulation taking measures for the effective
throughput Eff as a function of the packet loss parameter in contrast with the
effectiveness of the replication Gossip-based policy.
