We have measured the neutron electric dipole moment using spin rotation in a
non-centrosymmetric crystal. Our result is d_n = (2.5 +- 6.5(stat) +-
5.5(syst)) 10^{-24} e cm. The dominating contribution to the systematic
uncertainty is statistical in nature and will reduce with improved statistics.
The statistical sensitivity can be increased to 2 10^{-26} e cm in 100 days
data taking with an improved setup. We state technical requirements for a
systematic uncertainty at the same level.
