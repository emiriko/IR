In the present work a new method for studying porous media by nuclear
magnetic resonance of liquid 3He has been proposed. This method has been
demonstrated in an example of a clay mineral sample. For the first time the
integral porosity of clay sample has been measured. For investigated samples
the value of integral porosity is in the range of 10-30%. Inverse Laplace
transform of 3He longitudinal magnetization recovery curve has been carried
out, thus distribution of relaxation times T1 has been obtained.
