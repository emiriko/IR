Subtle quantum properties offer exciting new prospects in optical
communications. Quantum entanglement enables the secure exchange of
cryptographic keys and the distribution of quantum information by
teleportation. Entangled bright beams of light attract increasing interest for
such tasks, since they enable the employment of well-established classical
communications techniques. However, quantum resources are fragile and undergo
decoherence by interaction with the environment. The unavoidable losses in the
communication channel can lead to a complete destruction of useful quantum
properties -- the so-called "entanglement sudden death". We investigate the
precise conditions under which this phenomenon takes place for the simplest
case of two light beams and demonstrate how to produce states which are robust
against losses. Our study sheds new light on the intriguing properties of
quantum entanglement and how they may be tamed for future applications.
