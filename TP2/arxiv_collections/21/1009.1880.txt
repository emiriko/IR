We consider a U(2) Yang-Mills theory on M x S_F^2 where M is an arbitrary
noncommutative manifold and S_F^2 is a fuzzy sphere spontaneously generated
from a noncommutative U(N) Yang-Mills theory on M, coupled to a triplet of
scalars in the adjoint of U(N). Employing the SU(2)-equivariant gauge field
constructed in arXiv:0905.2338, we perform the dimensional reduction of the
theory over the fuzzy sphere. The emergent model is a noncommutative U(1) gauge
theory coupled adjointly to a set of scalar fields. We study this model on the
Groenewald-Moyal plane and find that, in certain limits, it admits
noncommutative, non-BPS vortex as well as flux-tube (fluxon) solutions and
discuss some of their properties.
