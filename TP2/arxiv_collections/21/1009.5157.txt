Bernstein et al. (2004) found that the population of faint (R>26)
trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) known at that time was dominated by "Classical"
objects, which have low inclinations (i<5 degrees) and distances 40--45 AU.
Since those observations, the number of faint TNOs whose orbits are
sufficiently well known to be classified as "Classical" or "Excited" has grown
from seven to 39. We analyze the dynamical classifications of faint TNOs known
today and find that this population is dominated by Excited objects. We discuss
some implications of this result.
