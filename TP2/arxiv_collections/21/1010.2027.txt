High-resolution HST imaging of the compact planetary nebula NGC 6644 has
revealed two pairs of bipolar lobes and a central ring lying close to the plane
of the sky. From mid-infrared imaging obtained with the Gemini Telescope, we
have found a dust torus which is oriented nearly perpendicular to one pair of
the lobes. We suggest that NGC 6644 is a multipolar nebula and have constructed
a 3-D model which allows the visualization of the object from different lines
of sight. These results suggest that NGC 6644 may have similar intrinsic
structures as other multipolar nebulae and the phenomenon of multipolar
nebulosity may be more common than previously believed.
