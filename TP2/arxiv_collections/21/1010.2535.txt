It has been argued that holography in gravitational theories is related to
the existence of a particularly useful Gauss Law that allows energy to be
measured at the boundary. The present work investigates the extent to which
such Gauss Laws follow from diffeomorphism invariance. We study parametrized
field theories, which are a class of diffeomorphism-invariant theories without
gravity. We find that the Hamiltonian for parametrized field theories vanishes
on shell even in the presence of a boundary and under a variety of boundary
conditions. We conclude that parametrized theories have no useful Gauss Law,
consistent with the absence of holography in these theories.
