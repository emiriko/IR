Due to the honey bee's importance as a simple neural model, there is a great
need for new functional imaging modalities. Herein we report on the use of
two-photon microscopy for in-vivo functional and morphological imaging of the
honey bee's olfactory system focusing on its primary centers, the antennal
lobes (ALs). Our imaging platform allows for simultaneously obtaining both
morphological measurements of the AL and in-vivo calcium recording of neural
activities. By applying external odor stimuli to the bee's antennas, we were
able to record the characteristic odor response maps. Compared to previous
works where conventional fluorescence microscopy is used, our approach offers
all the typical advantages of multi-photon imaging, providing substantial
enhancement in both spatial and temporal resolutions while minimizing
photo-damages and autofluorescence contribution with a four-fold improvement in
the functional signal. Moreover, the multi-photon associated extended
penetration depth allows for functional imaging within profound glomeruli.
