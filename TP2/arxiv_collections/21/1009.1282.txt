We propose and solve a simple but very general quantum model of an SU(2) spin
interacting with a large external system with N states. The coupling is
described by a random hamiltonian in a new general gaussian SU(2)xU(N) random
matrix ensemble, that we introduce in this paper. We solve the model in the
large N limit, for any value of the spin j and for any choice of the coupling
matrix element distributions in the different possible angular momentum
channels l (and provided that the internal dynamics of the spin is slow).
Besides its mathematical interest as a non-trivial random matrix model, it
allows to study and illustrate in a simple framework various phenomena: the
decoherence dynamics, the conditions of emergence of the classical phase space
for the spin, the properties quantum diffusion in phase space. The large time
evolution for the spin is shown to be non-Markovian in general, the Markov
property emerging in some specific case for the dynamics and the initial
conditions.
