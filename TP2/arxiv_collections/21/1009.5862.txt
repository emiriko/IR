Over 60 authors have worked on various versions of self-creation cosmology
(SCC) since the original paper in 1982. These papers adapted the Brans Dicke
theory to create mass out of the universe's self contained scalar,
gravitational and matter fields. The most recent 2002 version of the theory was
concordant with all previous standard tests of GR but was falsified by the
Gravity Probe B geodetic precession experiment. Here the different versions of
the theory are reviewed and it is noted that the 2002 theory not only reduces
to the second 1982 theory when cast into a the 'true' form of the scalar field
stress-energy tensor but also in that form it passes the GP-B test. Further
experiments are able to resolve the SCC-GR degeneracy, one of which is briefly
described. SCC may be able to explain some intriguing anomalies also, in the
spherically symmetric One-Body problem, it transpires that the temporal
Newtonian potential is three times larger than the spatial one. Cosmological
solutions to the field equations, which have been published elsewhere, are
extended to show that the cosmological density parameter Omega =1.
