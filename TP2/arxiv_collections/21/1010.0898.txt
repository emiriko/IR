We prove a CLT for spectra of submatrices of real symmetric and Hermitian
Wigner matrices. We show that if in the standard normalization the fourth
moment of the off-digonal entries is GOE/GUE-like then the limiting Gaussian
process can be viewed as a collection of simply yet nontrivially correlated
two-dimensional Gaussian Free Fields.
