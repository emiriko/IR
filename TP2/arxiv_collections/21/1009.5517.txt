The tensor renormalization-group method, developed by Levin and Nave, brings
systematic improvability to the position-space renormalization-group method and
yields essentially exact results for phase diagrams and entire thermodynamic
functions. The method, previously used on systems with no quenched randomness,
is extended in this study to systems with quenched randomness. Local
magnetizations and correlation functions as a function of spin separation are
calculated as tensor products subject to renormalization-group transformation.
Phase diagrams are extracted from the long-distance behavior of the correlation
functions. The approach is illustrated with the quenched bond-diluted Ising
model on the triangular lattice. An accurate phase diagram is obtained in
temperature and bond-dilution probability, for the entire temperature range
down to the percolation threshold at zero temperature.
