In this paper we present an equilibrium value based framework for solving
SDPs via the multiplicative weight update method which is different from the
one in Kale's thesis \cite{Kale07}. One of the main advantages of the new
framework is that we can guarantee the convertibility from approximate to exact
feasibility in a much more general class of SDPs than previous result. Another
advantage is the design of the oracle which is necessary for applying the
multiplicative weight update method is much simplified in general cases. This
leads to an alternative and easier solutions to the SDPs used in the previous
results \class{QIP(2)}$\subseteq$\class{PSPACE} \cite{JainUW09} and
\class{QMAM}=\class{PSPACE} \cite{JainJUW09}. Furthermore, we provide a generic
form of SDPs which can be solved in the similar way. By parallelizing every
step in our solution, we are able to solve a class of SDPs in \class{NC}.
Although our motivation is from quantum computing, our result will also apply
directly to any SDP which satisfies our conditions. In addition to the new
framework for solving SDPs, we also provide a novel framework which improves
the range of equilibrium value problems that can be solved via the
multiplicative weight update method. Before this work we are only able to
calculate the equilibrium value where one of the two convex sets needs to be
the set of density operators. Our work demonstrates that in the case when one
set is the set of density operators with further linear constraints, we are
still able to approximate the equilibrium value to high precision via the
multiplicative weight update method.
