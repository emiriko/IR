In the last years, experiments have shown that collisions above the
fragmentation threshold velocity are a potentially important growth process for
protoplanatary dust aggregates. To obtain deeper understanding of this process,
we performed laboratory and drop-tower experiments to study multiple impacts of
small, porous dust-aggregate projectiles onto sintered dust targets. Projectile
and target consisted of 1.5 micron monodisperse, spherical SiO2 monomers with
volume filling factors of 0.15 (projectiles) and 0.45 (targets). The
projectiles were accelerated by a solenoid magnet and combined with a magazine
with which 25 impacts onto the same spot on the target could be performed in
vacuum. We measured the mass-accretion efficiency and the volume filling factor
for different impact velocities between 1.5 and 6.0 m/s. The experiments at the
lowest impact speeds were performed in the Bremen drop-tower under microgravity
conditions. Within this velocity range we found a linear increase of the
accretion efficiency with increasing velocity. In the laboratory experiments,
the accretion efficiency increases from 0.12 to 0.21 in units of the projectile
mass. The recorded images of the impacts showed that the mass transfer from the
projectile to the target leads to the growth of a conical structure on the
target. From the images we also measured the volume filling factors of the
grown structures, which ranged from 0.15 (uncompacted) to 0.40 (significantly
compacted) with increasing impact speed. These results augment our knowledge of
the aggregate growth in protoplanetary disks and should be taken into account
for future models of protoplanetary dust growth.
