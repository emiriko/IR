We report the results of a Suzaku observation of the anomalous X-ray pulsar
(AXP) 1E 1841-045 at a center of the supernova remnant Kes 73. We confirmed
that the energy-dependent spectral models obtained by the previous separate
observations were also satisfied over a wide energy range from 0.4 to ~70 keV,
simultaneously. Here, the models below ~10 keV were a combination of blackbody
(BB) and power-law (PL) functions or of two BBs wit h different temperatures at
0.6 - 7.0 keV (Morii et al. 2003), and that above ~20 keV was a PL function
(Kuiper Hermsen Mendez 2004). The combination BB + PL + PL was found to best
represent the phase-averaged spectrum. Phase-resolved spectroscopy indicated
the existence of two emission regions, one with a thermal and the other with a
non-thermal nature. The combination BB + BB + PL was also found to represent
the phase-averaged spectrum well. However, we found that this model is
physically unacceptable due to an excessively large area of the emission region
of the blackbody. Nonetheless, we found that the temperatures and radii of the
two blackbody components showed moderate correlations in the phase-resolved
spectra. The fact that the same correlations have been observed between the
phase-averaged spectra of various magnetars (Nakagawa et al. 2009) suggests
that a self-similar function can approximate the intrinsic energy spectra of
magnetars below ~10 keV.
