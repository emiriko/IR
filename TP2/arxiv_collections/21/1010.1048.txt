We study quantum fidelity, the overlap between two ground states of a
many-body system, focusing on the thermodynamic regime. We show how drop of
fidelity near a critical point encodes universal information about a quantum
phase transition. Our general scaling results are illustrated in the quantum
Ising chain for which a remarkably simple expression for fidelity is found.
