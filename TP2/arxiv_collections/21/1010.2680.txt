We clarify the applicability of the quasistatic approximation used in Ref.
[\onlinecite{VE}], where coupled spin and Josephson plasma waves have been
predicted to exist in SIFS Josephson junctions. We show, contrary to the claim
of the authors of Ref. [\onlinecite{Maekawa}], that this approximation is very
accurate in realistic systems studied experimentally.
