Let $k$ be a field of characteristic different from 2. Let $G$ be a simply
connected or adjoint semisimple algebraic $k$-group which does not contain a
simple factor of type $E_8$ and such that every exceptional simple factor of
type other than $G_2$ is quasisplit. We show that if a principal homogeneous
space under $G$ over $k$ admits a zero cycle of degree 1 then it has a
$k$-rational point.
