We explore the robust quantization of the Hall resistance in epitaxial
graphene grown on Si-terminated SiC. Uniquely to this system, the dominance of
quantum over classical capacitance in the charge transfer between the substrate
and graphene is such that Landau levels (in particular, the one at exactly zero
energy) remain completely filled over an extraordinarily broad range of
magnetic fields. One important implication of this pinning of the filling
factor is that the system can sustain a very high nondissipative current. This
makes epitaxial graphene ideally suited for quantum resistance metrology, and
we have achieved a precision of 3 parts in 10^10 in the Hall resistance
quantization measurements.
