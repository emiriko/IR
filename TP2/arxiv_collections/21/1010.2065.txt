Solar system bodies that lack a significant atmosphere and significant
internal magnetic fields, such as the Moon and asteroids, have been considered
as passive absorbers of the solar wind. However, ion observations near the Moon
by the SELENE spacecraft show that a fraction of the impacting solar wind
protons are reflected by the surface of the Moon. Using new observations of the
velocity spectrum of these reflected protons by the SARA experiment on-board
the Chandrayaan-1 spacecraft at the Moon, we show by modeling that the
reflection of solar wind protons will affect the global plasma environment.
These global perturbations of the ion fluxes and the magnetic fields will
depend on microscopic properties of the object's reflecting surface. This solar
wind reflection process could explain past ion observations at the Moon, and
the process should occur universally at all atmosphereless non-magnetized
objects.
