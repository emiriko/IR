We define and study the category $Coh_n(\Pone)$ of normal coherent sheaves on
the monoid scheme $\Pone$ (equivalently, the $\mathfrak{M}_0$-scheme $\Pone /
\fun$ in the sense of Connes-Consani-Marcolli \cite{CCM}). This category
resembles in most ways a finitary abelian category, but is not additive. As an
application, we define and study the Hall algebra of $Coh_n(\Pone)$. We show
that it is isomorphic as a Hopf algebra to the enveloping algebra of the
product of a non-standard Borel in the loop algebra $L {\mathfrak{gl}}_2$ and
an abelian Lie algebra on infinitely many generators. This should be viewed as
a $(q=1)$ version of Kapranov's result relating (a certain subalgebra of) the
Ringel-Hall algebra of $\mathbb{P}^1$ over $\mathbb{F}_q$ to a non-standard
quantum Borel inside the quantum loop algebra $\mathbb{U}_{\nu} (\slthat)$,
where $\nu^2=q$.
