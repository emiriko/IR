I define a statistical model of graphs in which 2-dimensional spaces arise at
low temperature. The configurations are given by graphs with a fixed number of
edges and the Hamiltonian is a simple, local function of the graphs.
Simulations show that there is a transition between a low-temperature regime in
which the graphs form triangulations of 2-dimensional surfaces and a
high-temperature regime, where the surfaces disappear. I use data for the
specific heat and other observables to discuss whether this is a phase
transition. The surface states are analyzed with regard to topology and
defects.
