The electromagnetic form factors are the most fundamental quantities to
describe the internal structure of the nucleon and are related to the charge
radii of the baryons. We have calculated the charge radii of octet baryons in
the framework of chiral constituent quark model with the inclusion of the
spin-spin generated configuration mixing. This model is quite successful in
predicting the low energy hadron matrix elements. The results obtained in the
case of charge radii are also comparable to the latest experimental studies and
show improvement over some theoretical interpretations.
