The seesaw mechanism is the most popular explanation for the smallness of
neutrino masses. However, its high scale makes direct tests impossible and only
indirect signals at low energies are reachable for collider experiments. One of
these indirect links with the high scale is lepton flavor violation (LFV). We
discuss LFV decays of sleptons in the context of a SUSY left-right symmetric
model that naturally incorporates the seesaw mechanism. This non-minimal
embedding of the seesaw leads to observable LFV effects in the right-handed
sleptons sector, contrary to minimal models where these are found to be totally
negligible. Therefore, LFV observables can be used as a powerful tool to study
physics right below the GUT scale.
