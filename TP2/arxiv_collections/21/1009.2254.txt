Verlinde presents the gravitational force as due to gradients of entropy, an
emergent force, with far reaching consequences. Using the Hawking-Bekenstein
entropy formulation, we arrive at the conclusion that the Mass-Boom effect,
presented elsewhere, forces the entropy of the universe to increase. Then the
Mass-Boom is directly related to the existence of gravity. The principle of
Mach implies that the Mass-Boom is responsible for the expansion of the
universe. Thus, the Mass-Boom effect is a necessary condition for: 1) the
increase of entropy with time, 2) the existence of gravity, and 3) for the
expansion of the universe. The universe seems to initially appear and grow out
of polarization: positive mass-boom (energy) versus negative gravitational
potential energy boom, adding both always to zero. Polarization is then the
cause of creation and evolution of the universe.
