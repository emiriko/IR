Propagation of arbitrary-amplitude ion-acoustic solitary (IASWs) as well as
periodic waves (IAPWs) is investigated in a fully degenerate quantum
electron-ion plasma consisting of isothermal- or adiabatic-ion species. It is
shown that the system dimensionality and degrees of freedom play critical roles
in matching criteria for propagation of such waves. Furthermore, it is revealed
that for the case of adiabatic-ion unlike isothermal one, in some cases, there
exists an upper fractional ion-temperature limit for the existence of IAPWs. It
is also shown that, the variations of wave-amplitude with respect to the change
in fractional ion-temperature is quite different for the cases of isothermal
and adiabatic-ion plasmas.
