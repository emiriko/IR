Using archival Spitzer Space Telescope data, we identified for the first time
a dozen runaway OB stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) through the
detection of their bow shocks. The geometry of detected bow shocks allows us to
infer the direction of motion of the associated stars and to determine their
possible parent clusters and associations. One of the identified runaway stars,
AzV 471, was already known as a high-velocity star on the basis of its high
peculiar radial velocity, which is offset by ~40 km/s from the local systemic
velocity. We discuss implications of our findings for the problem of the origin
of field OB stars. Several of the bow shock-producing stars are found in the
confines of associations, suggesting that these may be "alien" stars
contributing to the age spread observed for some young stellar systems. We also
report the discovery of a kidney-shaped nebula attached to the early WN-type
star SMC-WR3 (AzV 60a). We interpreted this nebula as an interstellar structure
created owing to the interaction between the stellar wind and the ambient
interstellar medium.
