We study magnetic susceptibilities of two-dimensional itinerant electron
systems exhibiting symmetry-breaking Fermi surface distortions, the so-called
d-wave Pomeranchuk instability, in a magnetic field. In a pure forward
scattering model, the longitudinal susceptibility chi^{zz} is found to exhibit
a jump at a critical point. The magnitude of this jump diverges at a
tricritical point. When scattering processes involving finite momentum
transfers are allowed for, chi^{zz} is expected to diverge also at a critical
point. The system displays multiple critical fluctuations. We argue that the
features of chi^{zz} are general properties associated with singularities of a
non-ordering susceptibility, leading to implications for a variety of materials
including Sr_3Ru_2O_7.
