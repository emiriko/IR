Recently, the spinor helicity formalism and on-shell superspace were
developed for six-dimensional gauge theories with (1,1) supersymmetry. We
combine these two techniques with (generalised) unitarity, which is a powerful
technique to calculate scattering amplitudes in any massless theory. As an
application we calculate one-loop superamplitudes with four and five external
particles in the (1,1) theory and perform several consistency checks on our
results.
