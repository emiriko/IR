We present a novel canonical description of the incompressible fluid
dynamics. This description uses the dynamical constraints, in our case
reflecting "incompressibility" assumption, and leads to replacement of usual
hydrodynamical Poisson brackets for density and velocity fields with Dirac
brackets. The resulting equations are then known nonlinear, and non-local in
space, equations for incompressible fluid velocity.
