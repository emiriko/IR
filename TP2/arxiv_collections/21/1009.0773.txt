We present low-resolution, rest-frame ~ 5 - 12 micron Spitzer/IRS spectra of
two lensed z ~ 2 UV-bright star-forming galaxies, SDSS J120602.09+514229.5 and
SDSS J090122.37+181432.3. Using the magnification boost from lensing, we are
able to study the physical properties of these objects in greater detail than
is possible for unlensed systems. In both targets, we detect strong PAH
emission at 6.2, 7.7, and 11.3 microns, indicating the presence of vigorous
star formation. For J1206, we find a steeply rising continuum and significant
[S IV] emission, suggesting that a moderately hard radiation field is powering
continuum emission from small dust grains. The strength of the [S IV] emission
also implies a sub-solar metallicity of ~ 0.5 Z_{Sun}, confirming published
rest-frame optical measurements. In J0901, the PAH lines have large rest-frame
equivalent widths (> 1 micron) and the continuum rises slowly with wavelength,
suggesting that any AGN contribution to L_{IR} is insignificant, in contrast to
the implications of optical emission-line diagnostics. Using [O III] line flux
as a proxy for AGN strength, we estimate that the AGN in J0901 provides only a
small fraction of its mid-infrared continuum flux. By combining the detection
of [Ar II] with an upper limit on [Ar III] emission, we infer a metallicity of
> 1.3 Z_{Sun}. This work highlights the importance of combining rest-frame
optical and mid-IR spectroscopy in order to understand the detailed properties
of star-forming galaxies at high redshift.
