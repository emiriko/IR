Observations of anisotropies in the brightness temperature of the 21 cm line
of neutral hydrogen from the period before reionization would shed light on the
dawn of the first stars and galaxies. In this paper, we use large-scale
semi-numerical simulations to analyse the imprint on the 21 cm signal of
spatial fluctuations in the Lyman-alpha flux arising from the clustering of the
first galaxies. We show that an experiment such as the Square Kilometer Array
(SKA) can probe this signal at the onset of reionization, giving us important
information about the UV emission spectra of the first stars and characterizing
their host galaxies. SKA-pathfinders with ~ 10% of the full collecting area
should be capable of making a statistical detection of the 21 cm power spectrum
at redshifts z < 20 (corresponding to frequencies $\nu$ > 67 MHz). We then show
that the SKA should be able to measure the three dimensional power spectrum as
a function of the angle with the line of sight and discuss the use of the
redshift space distortions as a way to separate out the different components of
the 21 cm power spectrum. We demonstrate that, at least on large scales where
the Lyman-alpha fluctuations are linear, they can be used as a model
independent way to extract the power spectra due to these Lyman-alpha
fluctuations.
