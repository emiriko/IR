A recent progress in the study of $\gamma$-ray jets is reviewed, with a focus
on some theoretical interpretations of the VHE emission from M87, and possibly
other misaligned blazars; the connection betwe en the GeV breaks exhibited by
bright LAT blazars and opacity sources in the broad line region; the
consequences of the detection of GeV emission from GRBs to models of magnetic
outf lows; and the implications of the thermal emission observed is some GRBs
to dissipation of the outflow bulk energy.
