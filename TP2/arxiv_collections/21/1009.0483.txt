We show that periodic optical lattices imprinted in cubic nonlinear media
with strong two-photon absorption and localized linear gain landscapes support
stable dissipative defect modes in both focusing and defocusing media. Their
shapes and transverse extent are determined by the propagation constant that
belongs to a gap of the lattice spectrum which, in turn, is determined by the
relation between gain and losses. One-hump and two-hump dissipative defect
modes are obtained.
