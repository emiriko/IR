We investigate the local density of states and Friedel oscillation in
graphene around a well localized impurity in Born approximation. In our
analytical calculations Green's function technique has been used taking into
account both the localized atomic wavefunctions in a tight-binding scheme and
the corresponding symmetries of the lattice. As a result we obtained long
wavelength oscillations in the density of electrons with long range behavior
proportional to the inverse square of the distance from the impurity. These
leading oscillations are out of phase on nearby lattice sites (in fact for an
extended defect they cancel each other within one unit cell), therefore a probe
with resolution worse than a few unit cells will experience only the next to
leading inverse cube decay of density oscillations even for a short range
scatterer.
