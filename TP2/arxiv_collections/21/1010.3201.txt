We survey diverse approaches to the notion of information: from Shannon
entropy to Kolmogorov complexity. Two of the main applications of Kolmogorov
complexity are presented: randomness and classification. The survey is divided
in two parts in the same volume. Part I is dedicated to information theory and
the mathematical formalization of randomness based on Kolmogorov complexity.
This last application goes back to the 60's and 70's with the work of
Martin-L\"of, Schnorr, Chaitin, Levin, and has gained new impetus in the last
years.
