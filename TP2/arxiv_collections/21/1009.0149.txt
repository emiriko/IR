Direct numerical simulations of two-dimensional decaying MHD turbulence in
bounded domains show the rapid generation of angular momentum in
nonaxisymmetric geometries. It is found that magnetic fluctuations enhance this
mechanism. On a larger time scale, the generation of a magnetic angular
momentum, or angular field, is observed. For axisymmetric geometries, the
generation of angular momentum is absent; nevertheless, a weak magnetic field
can be observed. The derived evolution equations for both the angular momentum
and angular field yield possible explanations for the observed behavior.
