Structural changes in REMnO3 (RE= Y, Ho, Lu) under high pressure were
examined by synchrotron x-ray diffraction methods at room temperature.
Compression occurs more readily in the ab plane than along the c-axis. Under
hydrostatic pressure (~11 GPa), the atoms hold their approximate ambient
fractional positions in the unit cell and the spontaneous polarization shows no
significant change. With increased pressure, a pressure-induced hexagonal to
orthorhombic phase transition was observed starting at ~ 22GPa for Lu(Y)MnO3. A
small volume fraction of Lu(Y)MnO3 is converted to the orthorhombic phase when
the pressure is increased to 35 GPa and the orthorhombic phase is maintained on
pressure release. High pressure IR absorption spectroscopy and Mn K-edge near
edge x-ray absorption spectroscopy confirm that the hexagonal P63cm structure
is stable below ~20 GPa and the environment around Mn ion is not changed.
Shifts in the unoccupied p-band density of states with pressure are observed in
the Mn K-Edge spectra. A schematic pressure-temperature phase diagram is given
for the small ion REMnO3 system.
