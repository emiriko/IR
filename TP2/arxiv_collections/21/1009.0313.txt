We present evidence for the saturation of the Froissart bound at high energy
for {\em all hadronic} total cross sections at high energies, and use this to
unify $pp$ (and $\bar p p$) total cross sections over the energy range from
cyclotrons to colliders to ultra-high energy cosmic rays, an energy span from
$\sqrt s = 4$ GeV to 80 TeV.
