A fractal-like alignment of quantum wells is shown to accommodate resonant
states with long lifetimes. For the parameters of the semiconductor
heterostructure GaAs/Al$_{0.4}$Ga$_{0.6}$As with the well depth 300meV, a
resonant state of the energy as high as 44meV with the lifetime as long as
2.8\{mu}s is shown to be achievable.
