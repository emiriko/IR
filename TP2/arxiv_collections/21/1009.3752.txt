As part of a long term observational project, we are investigating the
macroturbulent broadening in O and B supergiants (Sgs) and its possible
connection with spectroscopic variability phenomena and stellar oscillations.
We present the first results of our project, namely firm observational evidence
for a strong correlation between the extra broadening and photospheric
line-profile variations in a sample of 13 Sgs with spectral types ranging from
O9.5 to B8.
