Pulses as short as 260 fs have been generated in a diode-pumped low-gain
Er:Yb:glass laser by exploiting the nonlinear optical response of single-layer
graphene. The application of this novel material to solid-state bulk lasers
opens up a way to compact and robust lasers with ultrahigh repetition rates.
