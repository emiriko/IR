It is the purpose of this note to point out that the CMS observation is in
line with previous observations in particle physics at large transverse momenta
and/or high multiplicities at lower energies, which were interpreted as
possible evidence for quark-gluon plasma (QGP), and to suggest other features
of the QGP observed in A+A collisions such as radial flow and jet quenching,
which should be investigated in p-p collisions in order to provide further
evidence for QGP production.
