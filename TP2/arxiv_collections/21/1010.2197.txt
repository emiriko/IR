Although our solar system features predominantly circular orbits, the
exoplanets discovered so far indicate that this is the exception rather than
the rule. This could have crucial consequences for exoplanet climates, both
because eccentric terrestrial exoplanets could have extreme seasonal variation,
and because giant planets on eccentric orbits could excite Milankovitch-like
variations of a potentially habitable terrestrial planet,\"A\^os eccentricity,
on timescales of thousands-to-millions of years. A particularly interesting
implication concerns the fact that the Earth is thought to have gone through at
least one globally frozen, "snowball" state in the last billion years that it
presumably exited after several million years of buildup of greenhouse gases
when the ice-cover shut off the carbonate-silicate cycle. Water-rich extrasolar
terrestrial planets with the capacity to host life might be at risk of falling
into similar snowball states. Here we show that if a terrestrial planet has a
giant companion on a sufficiently eccentric orbit, it can undergo
Milankovitch-like oscillations of eccentricity of great enough magnitude to
melt out of a snowball state.
