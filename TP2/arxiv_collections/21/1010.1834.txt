The Generalized Discretizable Molecular Distance Geometry Problem is a
distance geometry problems that can be solved by a combinatorial algorithm
called ``Branch-and-Prune''. It was observed empirically that the number of
solutions of YES instances is always a power of two. We give a proof that this
event happens with probability one.
