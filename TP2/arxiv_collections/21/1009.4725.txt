We investigate the occurrence of waterlike thermodynamic and dynamic
anomalous behavior in a one dimensional lattice gas model. The system
thermodynamics is obtained using the transfer matrix technique and anomalies on
density and thermodynamic response functions are found. When the hydrogen bond
(molecules separated by holes) is more attractive than the van der Waals
interaction (molecules in contact) a transition between two fluid structures is
found at null temperature and high pressure. This transition is analogous to a
`critical point' and intimately connects the anomalies in density and in
thermodynamic response functions. Monte Carlo simulations were performed in the
neighbourhood of this transition and used to calculate the self diffusion
constant, which increases with density as in liquid water.
