Obtaining the electronic structure of the newly discovered iron-based
superconductors is the key to understanding the mechanism of their
high-temperature superconductivity. We used angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy (ARPES) to make direct measurements of the electronic structure
and Fermi surface (FS) of the untwinned uniaxial state of CaFe2As2, the parent
compound of iron-based superconductors. We observed unequal dispersions and FS
geometries along the orthogonal Fe-Fe bond directions. More importantly,
unidirectional straight and flat FS segments are observed near the zone center,
which indicates the existence of a unidirectional nematic charge density wave
order, strengthening the case for a quantum electronic liquid crystalline
"nematic" phase. Further, the doping dependence extrapolates to a possible
quantum critical point of the disappearance of this order in the heavily
overdoped regime of these materials.
