A permissible spectrum of transverse vibrations for the holographic screen
modifies both a distribution of thermal energy over bits at low temperatures
and the law of gravitation at small accelerations of free fall in agreement
with observations of flat rotation curves in spiral galaxies. This modification
relates holographic screen parameters in de Sitter space-time with the Milgrom
acceleration in MOND.
