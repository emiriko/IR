Geiger-mode Avalanche Photodiodes (G-APD) bear the potential to significantly
improve the sensitivity of Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescopes (IACT). We are
currently building the First G-APD Cherenkov Telescope (FACT) by refurbishing
an old IACT with a mirror area of 9.5 square meters and construct a new, fine
pixelized camera using novel G-APDs. The main goal is to evaluate the
performance of a complete system by observing very high energy gamma-rays from
the Crab Nebula. This is an important field test to check the feasibility of
G-APD-based cameras to replace at some time the PMT-based cameras of planned
future IACTs like AGIS and CTA. In this article, we present the basic design of
such a camera as well as some important details to be taken into account.
