We investigate the collective excitations in spin-one color superconductors.
We classify the Nambu--Goldstone modes by the pattern of spontaneous symmetry
breaking, and then use the Ginzburg--Landau theory to derive their dispersion
relations. These soft modes play an important role for the low-energy dynamics
of the system such as the transport phenomena and hence are relevant for
late-stage evolution of neutron stars. In the case of the color-spin-locking
phase, we use a functional technique to obtain the low-energy effective action
for the physical Nambu--Goldstone bosons that survive after gauging the color
symmetry.
