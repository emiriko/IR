The use of the hyperspherical harmonic (HH) basis in the description of bound
states in an $A$-body system composed by identical particles is normally
preceded by a symmetrization procedure in which the statistic of the system is
taken into account. This preliminary step is not strictly necessary; the direct
use of the HH basis is possible, even if the basis has not a well defined
behavior under particle permutations. In fact, after the diagonalization of the
Hamiltonian matrix, the eigenvectors reflect the symmetries present in it. They
have well defined symmetry under particle permutation and the identification of
the physical states is possible, as it will be shown in specific cases. The
problem related to the large degeneration of the basis is circumvented by
constructing the Hamiltonian matrix as a sum of products of sparse matrices.
This particular representation of the Hamiltonian is well suited for a
numerical iterative diagonalization, where only the action of the matrix on a
vector is needed. As an example we compute bound states for systems with
$A=3-6$ particles interacting through a short-range central interaction. We
also consider the case in which the potential is restricted to act in relative
s-waves with and without the inclusion of the Coulomb potential. This very
simple model predicts results in qualitative good agreement with the
experimental data and it represents a first step in a project dedicated to the
use of the HH basis to describe bound and low energy scattering states in light
nuclei.
