The survey of radial velocity orbits for short period (P < 1 day), bright (V
< 10, with a few fainter stars) conducted at the David Dunlap Observatory in
the last 9 years before its closure in 2008 included 162 binaries and resulted
in 150 SB2 orbits and 5 SB1 spectroscopic orbits thus becoming one of the main
legacies of DDO. The paper summarizes the main results from the survey.
