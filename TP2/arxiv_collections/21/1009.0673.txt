This system description provides an overview of H-PILoT (Hierarchical Proving
by Instantiation in Local Theory extensions), a program for hierarchical
reasoning in extensions of logical theories. H-PILoT reduces deduction problems
in the theory extension to deduction problems in the base theory. Specialized
provers and standard SMT solvers can be used for testing the satisfiability of
the formulae obtained after the reduction. For a certain type of theory
extension (namely for local theory extensions) this hierarchical reduction is
sound and complete and -- if the formulae obtained this way belong to a
fragment decidable in the base theory -- H-PILoT provides a decision procedure
for testing satisfiability of ground formulae, and can also be used for model
generation.
