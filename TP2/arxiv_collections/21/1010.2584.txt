We study numerically a 5D hybrid model which incorporates a split fermion
scenario and bulk neutrinos. We perform a Monte Carlo analysis of the model in
order to find the regions in the parameter space allowing for realization of
the leptogenesis. We find that higher order Yukawa terms must be included in
order the model to produce a CP violation and net baryon number sufficient for
the creation of the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe.
