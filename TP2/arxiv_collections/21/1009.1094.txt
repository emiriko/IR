We investigate some aspects of the self-consistency in the Dyson-Schwinger
approach to both the QED and the self-interacting scalar field theories. We
prove that the set of the Dyson-Schwinger equations, together with the
Green-Ward-Takahashi identity, is equivalent to the analogous set of integral
equations studied in condensed matter, namely many-body perturbation theory,
where it is solved self-consistently and iteratively. In this framework, we
compute the non-perturbative solution of the gap equation for the
self-interacting scalar field theory.
