The presence of electron-electron interactions in one dimension profoundly
changes the properties of a system. The separation of charge and spin degrees
of freedom is just one example. We consider what happens when a system
consisting of a ferromagnetic region of non-collinearity, i.e. a domain wall,
is coupled to interacting electrons in one-dimension (more specifically a
Luttinger liquid). The ferromagnetism breaks spin charge separation and the
presence of the domain wall introduces a spin dependent scatterer into the
problem. The absence of spin charge separation and the effects of the electron
correlations results in very different behaviour for the excitations in the
system and for spin-transfer-torque effects in this model.
