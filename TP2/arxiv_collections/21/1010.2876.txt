LiFeAs is unique among the broad family of FeAs-based superconductors,
because it is superconducting with a rather large $T_c\simeq 18$ K under
ambient conditions although it is a stoichiometric compound. We studied the
electrical transport on a high-quality single crystal. The resistivity shows
quadratic temperature dependence at low temperature giving evidence for strong
electron-electron scattering and a tendency towards saturation around room
temperature. The Hall constant is negative and changes with temperature, what
most probably arises from a van Hove singularity close to the Fermi energy in
one of the hole-like bands. Using band structure calculations based on angular
resolved photoemission spectra we are able to reproduce all the basic features
of both the resistivity as well as the Hall effect data.
