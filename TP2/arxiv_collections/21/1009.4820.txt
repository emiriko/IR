We consider rational power series over an alphabet $\Sigma$ with coefficients
in a ordered commutative semiring $K$ and characterize them as the free ordered
$K$-semialgebras in various classes of ordered $K$-semialgebras equipped with a
star operation satisfying the least pre-fixed point rule and/or its dual. The
results are generalizations of Kozen's axiomatization of regular languages.
