We study charged spin textures (CST) over the Moore-Read quantum Hall state
at filling factor 5/2. We develop an algebraic framework and show that the
pairing condition that is inherent in the Moore-Read state naturally leads to a
class of charged spin textures, labeled by winding numbers [w_I, w_II]. The
fundamental CST, with labels [1,0] and electric charge e/4, is identified with
the polar core vortex known in the spin-1 BEC literature. The spin texture
carried by the fusion product of fundamental CSTs is correlated with the fusion
channel of the underlying non-Abelian quasiholes.
