We discuss the coupler system of two nonlinear oscillators excited by an
external coherent field prepared in a maximally entangled state (Bell-like
state). We show that as a result of the coupler interaction of the system with
external broadband squeezed vacuum bath, entanglement decay dynamics can be
considerably affected. Besides the phenomena of sudden entanglement death and
its rebirth, a shortening (or lengthening) of the total disentanglement time
{\tau}D can be observed, depending on the squeezing parameters. Moreover, on
the example of one of the reborn entanglement cases it is shown that by
changing the values of these parameters the maximal values of the negativity
for the 3 \otimes 2 system discussed can be tailored.
