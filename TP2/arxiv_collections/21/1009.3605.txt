In this article, we study the strong decays of the newly observed charmed
mesons $D(2550)$, $D(2600)$, $D(2750)$ and $D(2760)$ with the heavy quark
effective theory in the leading order approximation, and tentatively identify
the $(D(2550),D(2600))$ as the $2S$ doublet $(0^-,1^-)$ and the
$(D(2750),D(2760))$ as the $1D$ doublet $(2^-,3^-)$, respectively. The
identification of the $D(2750)$ and $D(2760)$ as the same particle with
$J^P=3^-$ is disfavored.
