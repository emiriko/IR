The magnetic and thermodynamic properties of the complete
Ln$_{2/3}$Cu$_3$Ti$_4$O$_{12}$ series were investigated. Here $Ln$ stands for
the lanthanides La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, and Yb. %Most
of the compounds were prepared as single phase polycrystalline powder %without
any traces of impurities. Marginal amounts of %impurities $(< 2%)$ were
detected $Ln=$ Gd, Er, and Tm. %Significant amounts of impurity phases were
found for $Ln=$ Ce and Yb. All the samples investigated crystallize in the
space group $Im\bar{3}$ with lattice constants that follow the lanthanide
contraction. The lattice constant of the Ce compound reveals the presence of
Ce$^{4+}$ leading to the composition Ce$_{1/2}$Cu$_3$Ti$_4$O$_{12}$. From
magnetic susceptibility and electron-spin resonance experiments it can be
concluded that the copper ions always carry a spin $S=1/2$ and order
antiferromagnetically close to 25\,K. The Curie-Weiss temperatures can
approximately be calculated assuming a two-sublattice model corresponding to
the copper and lanthanide ions, respectively. It seems that the magnetic
moments of the heavy rare earths are weakly coupled to the copper spins, while
for the light lanthanides no such coupling was found. The $4f$ moments remain
paramagnetic down to the lowest temperatures, with the exception of the Tm
compound, which indicates enhanced Van-Vleck magnetism due to a non-magnetic
singlet ground state of the crystal-field split $4f$ manifold. From
specific-heat measurements we accurately determined the antiferromagnetic
ordering temperature and obtained information on the crystal-field states of
the rare-earth ions. The heat-capacity results also revealed the presence of a
small fraction of Ce$^{3+}$ in a magnetic $4f^1$ state.
