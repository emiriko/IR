In spintronics, the ability to transport magnetic information often depends
on the existence of a spin current traveling between two different magnetic
objects acting as source and probe. A large fraction of this information never
reaches the probe and is lost because the spin current tends to travel
omni-directionally. We propose that a curved boundary between a gated and a
non-gated region within graphene acts as an ideal lens for spin currents
despite being entirely of non-magnetic nature. We show as a proof of concept
that such lenses can be utilized to redirect the spin current that travels away
from a source onto a focus region where a magnetic probe is located, saving a
considerable fraction of the magnetic information that would be otherwise lost.
