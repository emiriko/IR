We study the Tevatron signatures of promptly-decaying slepton co-NLSPs in the
context of General Gauge Mediation (GGM). The signatures consist of trileptons
plus MET and same-sign dileptons plus MET. Focusing first on electroweak
production, where the Tevatron has an advantage over the early LHC, we
establish four simple benchmark scenarios within the parameter space of GGM
which qualitatively capture all the relevant phenomenology. We derive limits on
these benchmarks from existing searches, estimate the discovery potential with
10 fb^-1, and discuss ways in which these searches can be optimized for slepton
co-NLSPs. We also analyze the Tevatron constraints on a scenario with light
gluinos that could be discovered at the early LHC. Overall, we find that the
Tevatron still has excellent reach for the discovery of SUSY in multilepton
final states. Finally, we comment on the possible interpretation of a mild
"excess" in the CDF same-sign dilepton search in terms of slepton co-NLSPs.
