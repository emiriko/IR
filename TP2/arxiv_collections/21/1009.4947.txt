The emission-line Be star HD 215227 lies within the positional error circle
of the newly identified gamma-ray source AGL J2241+4454. We present new blue
spectra of the star, and we point out the morphological and variability
similarities to other Be binaries. An analysis of the available optical
photometry indicates a variation with a period of 60.37 +/- 0.04 d, which may
correspond to an orbital modulation of the flux from the disk surrounding the
Be star. The distance to the star of 2.6 kpc and its relatively large Galactic
latitude suggest that the binary was ejected from the plane by a supernova
explosion that created the neutron star or black hole companion. The binary and
runaway properties of HD 215227 make it an attractive candidate as the optical
counterpart of AGL J2241+4454 and as a new member of the small class of
gamma-ray emitting binaries.
