Embryonic stem cells (ESC) have the potential to self-renew indefinitely and
to differentiate into any of the three germ layers. The molecular mechanisms
for self-renewal, maintenance of pluripotency and lineage specification are
poorly understood, but recent results point to a key role for epigenetic
mechanisms. In this study, we focus on quantifying the impact of histone 3
acetylation (H3K9,14ac) on gene expression in murine embryonic stem cells. We
analyze genome-wide histone acetylation patterns and gene expression profiles
measured over the first five days of cell differentiation triggered by
silencing Nanog, a key transcription factor in ESC regulation. We explore the
temporal and spatial dynamics of histone acetylation data and its correlation
with gene expression using supervised and unsupervised statistical models. On a
genome-wide scale, changes in acetylation are significantly correlated to
changes in mRNA expression and, surprisingly, this coherence increases over
time. We quantify the predictive power of histone acetylation for gene
expression changes in a balanced cross-validation procedure. In an in-depth
study we focus on genes central to the regulatory network of Mouse ESC,
including those identified in a recent genome-wide RNAi screen and in the
PluriNet, a computationally derived stem cell signature. We find that compared
to the rest of the genome, ESC-specific genes show significantly more
acetylation signal and a much stronger decrease in acetylation over time, which
is often not reflected in an concordant expression change. These results shed
light on the complexity of the relationship between histone acetylation and
gene expression and are a step forward to dissect the multilayer regulatory
mechanisms that determine stem cell fate.
