We obtain analitically the $v^2$ dependence of the drag force on a falling
sphere close to the drag crisis, as well as the drag coefficient at the drag
crisis, with excellent agreement with experiment. We take into account the
effects of viscosity in creating a turbulent boundary layer and perform the
calculations using the Navier-Stokes equation.
