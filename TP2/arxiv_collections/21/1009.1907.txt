A scanning force microscope tip is used to write ferroelectric domains in
He-implanted single-crystal lithium niobate and subsequently probe them by
piezoresponse force microscopy. Investigation of cross-sections of the samples
showed that the buried implanted layer, $\sim 1$\,\textmu m below the surface,
is non-ferroelectric and can thus act as a barrier to domain growth. This
barrier enabled stable surface domains of $< 1$\,\textmu m size to be written
in 500\,\textmu m-thick crystal substrates with voltage pulses of only 10\,V
applied to the tip.
