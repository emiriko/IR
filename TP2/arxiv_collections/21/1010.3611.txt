The coupled-channels density-matrix technique for nuclear reaction dynamics,
which is based on the Liouville-von Neumann equation with Lindblad dissipative
terms, is developed with the inclusion of full angular momentum couplings. It
allows a quantitative study of the role and importance of quantum decoherence
in nuclear scattering. Formulae of asymptotic observables that can reveal
effects of quantum decoherence are given. A method for extracting
energy-resolved scattering information from the time-dependent density matrix
is introduced. As an example, model calculations are carried out for the
low-energy collision of the $^{16}$O projectile on the $^{154}$Sm target.
