We show how the band structure and beam dynamics of non-Hermitian
$PT$-symmetric sinusoidal optical lattices can be approached from the point of
view of the equivalent Hermitian problem, obtained by an analytic continuation
in the transverse spatial variable $x$. In this latter problem the eigenvalue
equation reduces to the Mathieu equation, whose eigenfunctions and properties
have been well studied. That being the case, the beam propagation, which
parallels the time-development of the wave-function in quantum mechanics, can
be calculated using the equivalent of the method of stationary states. We also
discuss a model potential that interpolates between a sinusoidal and periodic
square well potential, showing that some of the striking properties of the
sinusoidal potential, in particular birefringence, become much less prominent
as one goes away from the sinusoidal case.
