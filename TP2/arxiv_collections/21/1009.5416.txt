We propose a new class of semiconducting graphene-based nanostructures:
hydrogenated graphene nanoripples (HGNRs), based on continuum-mechanics
analysis and first principles calculations. They are formed via a two-step
combinatorial approach: first by strain engineered pattern formation of
graphene nanoripples, followed by a curvature-directed self-assembly of H
adsorption. It offers a high level of control of the structure and morphology
of the HGNRs, and hence their band gaps which share common features with
graphene nanoribbons. A cycle of H adsorption/desorption at/from the same
surface locations completes a reversible metal-semiconductor-metal transition
with the same band gap.
