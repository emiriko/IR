The longitudinal response of single semiflexible polymers to sudden changes
in externally applied forces is known to be controlled by the propagation and
relaxation of backbone tension. Under many experimental circumstances,
realized, e.g., in nano-fluidic devices or in polymeric networks or solutions,
these polymers are effectively confined in a channel- or tube-like geometry. By
means of heuristic scaling laws and rigorous analytical theory, we analyze the
tension dynamics of confined semiflexible polymers for various generic
experimental setups. It turns out that in contrast to the well-known linear
response, the influence of confinement on the non-linear dynamics can largely
be described as that of an effective prestress. We also study the free
relaxation of an initially confined chain, finding a surprising superlinear
t^(9/8) growth law for the change in end-to-end distance at short times.
