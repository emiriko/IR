We study the quantum phase transition out of the Neel state in SU(3) and
SU(4) generalizations of the Heisenberg anti-ferromagnet with a sign problem
free four spin coupling (so-called JQ model), by extensive quantum Monte Carlo
simulations. We present evidence that the SU(3) and SU(4) order parameters and
the SU(3) and SU(4) stiffness' go to zero continuously without any evidence for
a first order transition. However, we find considerable deviations from simple
scaling laws for the stiffness even in the largest system sizes studied. We
interpret these as arising from multiplicative scaling terms in these
quantities which affect the leading behavior, i.e., they will persist in the
thermodynamic limit unlike the conventional additive corrections from
irrelevant operators. We conjecture that these multiplicative terms arise from
dangerously irrelevant operators whose contributions to the quantities of
interest are non-analytic.
