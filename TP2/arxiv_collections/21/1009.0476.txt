Recent developments on tau detection technologies and the construction of
high intensity neutrino beams open the possibility of a high precision search
for non-standard {\mu} - {\tau} flavour transition with neutrinos at short
distances. The MINSIS - Main Injector Non-Standard Interaction Search- is a
proposal under discussion to realize such precision measurement. This document
contains the proceedings of the workshop which took place on 10-11 December
2009 in Madrid to discuss both the physics reach as well as the experimental
requirements for this proposal.
