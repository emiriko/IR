Given a chiral algebra, we study modules over an arbitrary power of a curve.
We describe this category in three different ways: in terms of factorization,
in terms of certain chiral operations and as modules for a lie algebra in a
certain tensor category. In addition, we consider analogous questions for LIe-*
algebras and factorization spaces. For factorization spaces, we give a
construction of multijets in terms of a certain Weil restriction which lets us
characterize counital factorizable algebraic stacks as multijets.
