Recently, a nonperturbative formulation of 4d N=4 super Yang-Mills theory
which does not require fine tuning at least to all order in perturbation theory
has been proposed by combining two-dimensional lattice and matrix model
techniques. In this paper we provide an analogous model by utilizing
deconstruction approach of Kaplan et al. Two-dimensional lattice with a plane
wave deformation is deconstructed from a matrix model and two additional
dimensions emerge through the Myers effect. In other words we construct a
D1-brane theory from which a D3-brane theory comes out. The action is much
simpler than the previous formulation and hence numerical study, which enables
us to test the AdS/CFT duality at fully nonperturbative level, becomes much
easier.
