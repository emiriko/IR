Let h \subset g be an inclusion of Lie algebras with quotient h-module n.
There is a natural degree filtration on the h-module U(g)/U(g)h whose
associated graded h-module is isomorphic to S(n). We give a necessary and
sufficient condition for the existence of a splitting of this filtration. In
turn such a splitting yields an isomorphism between the h-modules U(g)/U(g)h
and S(n). For the diagonal embedding h \subset h \oplus h the condition is
automatically satisfied and we recover the classical Poincae-Birkhoff-Witt
theorem.
  The main theorem and its proof are direct translations of results in
algebraic geometry, obtained using an ad hoc dictionary. This suggests the
existence of a unified framework allowing the simultaneous study of Lie
algebras and of algebraic varieties, and a closely related work in this
direction is on the way.
