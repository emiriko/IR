We seek solutions $u\in\R^n$ to the semilinear elliptic partial difference
equation $-Lu + f_s(u) = 0$, where $L$ is the matrix corresponding to the
Laplacian operator on a graph $G$ and $f_s$ is a one-parameter family of
nonlinear functions. This article combines the ideas introduced by the authors
in two papers: a) {\it Nonlinear Elliptic Partial Difference Equations on
Graphs} (J. Experimental Mathematics, 2006), which introduces analytical and
numerical techniques for solving such equations, and b) {\it Symmetry and
Automated Branch Following for a Semilinear Elliptic PDE on a Fractal Region}
wherein we present some of our recent advances concerning symmetry,
bifurcation, and automation fo
  We apply the symmetry analysis found in the SIAM paper to arbitrary graphs in
order to obtain better initial guesses for Newton's method, create informative
graphics, and be in the underlying variational structure. We use two modified
implementations of the gradient Newton-Galerkin algorithm (GNGA, Neuberger and
Swift) to follow bifurcation branches in a robust way. By handling difficulties
that arise when encountering accidental degeneracies and higher-dimension we
can find many solutions of many symmetry types to the discrete nonlinear
system. We present a selection of experimental results which demonstrate our
algorithm's capability to automatically generate bifurcation diagrams and
solution graphics starting with only an edgelis of a graph. We highlight
interesting symmetry and variational phenomena.
