We study the exciton condensate in zero temperature limit in a special class
of electron-hole bilayer systems adjacent to insulating ferromagnetic films.
With the self-consistent mean-field approximation, we find that the Rashba
spin-orbit interaction in the electron and hole layers can induce the p \pm ip
or p pairing states depending on the different magnetization of the overlapped
ferromagnetic films. Correspondingly, the topologically nontrivial or trivial
phases emerge. Furthermore, in the topologically nontrivial phase, the
quasiparticle excitations of the U(1) vortex are attached to fractional quantum
numbers and obey Abelian statistics.
