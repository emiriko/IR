Multiple distinct glass states occur in binary hard-sphere mixtures with
constituents of very disparate sizes according to the mode-coupling theory of
the glass transition (MCT), distinguished by considering whether small
particles remain mobile or not, and whether small particles contribute
significantly to perturb the big-particle structure or not. In the idealized
glass, the four different glasses are separated by sharp transitions that give
rise to higher-order transition phenomena involving logarithmic decay laws, and
to anomalous power-law-like diffusion. The phenomena are argued to be expected
generally in glass-forming mixtures.
