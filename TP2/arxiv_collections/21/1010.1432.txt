We examine k-minimal and k-maximal operator spaces and operator systems, and
investigate their relationships with the separability problem in quantum
information theory. We show that the matrix norms that define the k-minimal
operator spaces are equal to a family of norms that have been studied
independently as a tool for detecting k-positive linear maps and bound
entanglement. Similarly, we investigate the k-super minimal and k-super maximal
operator systems that were recently introduced and show that their cones of
positive elements are exactly the cones of k-block positive operators and
(unnormalized) states with Schmidt number no greater than k, respectively. We
characterize a class of norms on the k-super minimal operator systems and show
that the completely bounded versions of these norms provide a criterion for
testing the Schmidt number of a quantum state that generalizes the
recently-developed separability criterion based on trace-contractive maps.
