By studying the dielectric properties of the geometrically frustrated spinel
CdV2O4, we observe ferroelectricity developing at the transition into the
collinear antiferromagnetic ground state. In this multiferroic spinel,
ferroelectricity is driven by local magnetostriction and not by the more common
scenario of spiral magnetism. The experimental findings are corroborated by
ab-initio calculations of the electric polarization and the underlying spin and
orbital order. The results point towards a charge rearrangement due to
dimerization, where electronic correlations and the proximity to the
insulator-metal transition play an important role.
