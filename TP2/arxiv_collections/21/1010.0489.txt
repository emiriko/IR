The LCLS beam is meant for a single user, but the baseline undulator is long
enough to serve two users simultaneously. To this end, we propose a setup
composed of two elements: an X-ray mirrors pair for X-ray beam deflection, and
a 4 m-long magnetic chicane, which creates an offset for mirrors pair
installation in the middle of the baseline undulator. The insertable mirrors
pair can separate spatially the X-ray beams generated in the first and in the
second half of the baseline undulator. Rapid switching of the FEL amplification
process allows deactivating one half and activating another half of the
undulator. As proposed elsewhere, using a kicker installed upstream of the LCLS
baseline undulator and an already existing corrector in the first half of the
undulator, it is possible to rapidly switch the X-ray beam from one user to
another. We present simulation results for the LCLS baseline, and show that it
is possible to generate two saturated SASE X-ray beams in the whole 0.8-8 keV
photon energy range in the same baseline undulator. These can serve two users.
Our technique does not perturb the baseline mode of operation of the LCLS
undulator. Also, the magnetic chicane setup is very flexible, and can be used
as a self-seeding setup too. We present simulation results for the LCLS
baseline undulator with SHAB. One can produce monochromatic radiation at the
2nd harmonic as well as at the 1st. We describe an efficient way for obtaining
multi-user operation at the LCLS hard X-ray FEL. To this end, a photon beam
distribution system based on the use of crystals in the Bragg reflection
geometry is proposed. The reflectivity of crystal deflectors can be switched
fast enough by flipping the crystals with piezoelectric devices. Monochromatic
hard X-rays can then be distributed among 6 independent experiments, thereby
enabling 6 users to work in parallel in the near and far experimental halls.
