The charge current adiabatically pumped through a mesoscopic region coupled
to a classical variable obeying a nonlinear dynamics is studied within the
scattering matrix approach. Due to the nonlinearity in the dynamics of the
variable, a hysteretic behavior of the pumping current can be observed for
specific characteristics of the pumping cycle. The steps needed to build a
quantum pump working as a memory device are discussed together with a possible
experimental implementation.
