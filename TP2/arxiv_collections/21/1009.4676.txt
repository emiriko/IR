For the first time, we have measured the optical noise equivalent power (NEP)
in titanium (Ti) superconducting hot-electron nanobolometers (nano-HEBs). The
bolometers were 2{\mu}mx1{\mu}mx20nm and 1{\mu}mx1{\mu}mx20nm planar
antenna-coupled devices. The measurements were done at {\lambda} = 460 {\mu}m
using a cryogenic black body radiation source delivering optical power from a
fraction of a femtowatt to a few 100s of femtowatts. A record low NEP =
3x10^{-19} W/Hz^{1/2} at 50 mK has been achieved. This sensitivity meets the
requirements for SAFARI instrument on the SPICA telescope. The ways for further
improvement of the nano-HEB detector sensitivity are discussed.
