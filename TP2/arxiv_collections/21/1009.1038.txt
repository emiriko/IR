With the discovery of new exploit techniques, novel protection mechanisms are
needed as well. Mitigations like DEP (Data Execution Prevention) or ASLR
(Address Space Layout Randomization) created a significantly more difficult
environment for exploitation. Attackers, however, have recently researched new
exploitation methods which are capable of bypassing the operating system's
memory mitigations. One of the newest and most popular exploitation techniques
to bypass both of the aforementioned security protections is JIT memory
spraying, introduced by Dion Blazakis. In this article we will present a short
overview of the JIT spraying technique and also novel mitigation methods
against this innovative class of attacks. An anti-JIT spraying library was
created as part of our shellcode execution prevention system.
