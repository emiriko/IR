We study the interactions between the thermodynamic transition and
hydrodynamic flows which would characterise a thermo- and hydro-dynamic
evolution of a binary mixture in a dissolution/nucleation process. The primary
attention is given to the slow dissolution dynamics. The Cahn-Hilliard approach
is used to model the behaviour of evolving and diffusing interfaces. An
important peculiarity of the full Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes equations is the
use of the full continuity equation required even for a binary mixture of
incompressible liquids, firstly, due to dependence of mixture density on
concentration and, secondly, due to strong concentration gradients at liquids'
interfaces. Using the multiple-scale method we separate the physical processes
occurring on different time scales and, ultimately, provide a strict derivation
of the Boussinesq approximation for the Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes equations.
This approximation forms a universal theoretical model that can be further
employed for a thermo/hydro-dynamic analysis of the multiphase systems with
strongly evolving and diffusing interfacial boundaries, i.e. for the processes
involving dissolution/nucleation, evaporation/condensation,
solidification/melting, polymerisation, etc.
