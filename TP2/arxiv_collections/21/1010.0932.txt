We show that a chiral $f+if$-wave superconducting pairing may be induced in
the lowest heavy hole band of a hole-doped semiconductor thin film through
proximity contact with an \textit{s}-wave superconductor. The chirality of the
pairing originates from the $3\pi $ Berry phase accumulated for a heavy hole
moving along a close path on the Fermi surface. There exist three chiral
gapless Majorana edge states, in consistence with the chiral $f+if$% -wave
pairing. We show the existence of zero energy Majorana fermions in vortices in
the semiconductor-superconductor heterostructure by solving the
Bogoliubov-de-Gennes equations numerically as well as analytically in the
strong confinement limit.
