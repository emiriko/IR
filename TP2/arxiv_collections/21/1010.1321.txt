In this paper, we note that there are two different types of inconsistencies
of quantum adiabatic theorem in work of K. P. Marzlin and B. C. Sanders [Phys.
Rev. Lett. 93, 160408, 2004], MS inconsistency and MS counterexample.
Nevertheless, these two types are often confused as one by many authors. We
shall point out that the inconsistencies of quantum adiabatic theorem raised by
the relevant references just can be classified as these two types.
