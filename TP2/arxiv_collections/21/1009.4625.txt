We formalize automated analysis techniques for the validation of web services
specified in BPEL and a RBAC variant tailored to BPEL. The idea is to use
decidable fragments of first-order logic to describe the state space of a
certain class of web services and then use state-of-the-art SMT solvers to
handle their reachability problems. To assess the practical viability of our
approach, we have developed a prototype tool implementing our techniques and
applied it to a digital contract signing service inspired by an industrial case
study.
