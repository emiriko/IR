We improve on Fourier transforms (FT) between imaginary time $\tau$ and
imaginary frequency $\omega_n$ used in certain quantum cluster approaches using
the Hirsch-Fye method. The asymptotic behavior of the electron Green's function
can be improved by using a "sumrule" boundary condition for a spline. For
response functions a two-dimensional FT of a singular function is required. We
show how this can be done efficiently by splitting off a one-dimensional part
containing the singularity and by performing a semi-analytical FT for the
remaining more innocent two-dimensional part.
