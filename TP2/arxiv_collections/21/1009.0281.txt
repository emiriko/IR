It has recently become clear that simulations under amorphpous boundary
conditions (ABCs) can provide valuable information on the dynamics and
thermodynamics of disordered systems with no obvious ordered parameter. In
particular, they allow to detect a correlation length that is not measurable
with standard correlation functions. Here we explain what exactly is meant by
ABCs, discuss their relation with point-to-set correlations and briefly
describe some recent results obtained with this technique.
