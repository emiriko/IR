We investigate electromagnetic and weak form factors of heavy-light mesons in
the context of point-form relativistic quantum mechanics. To this aim we treat
the physical processes from which such electroweak form factors are extracted
by means of a coupled channel approach which accounts for the dynamics of the
intermediate gauge bosons. It is shown that heavy-quark symmetry is respected
by this formulation. A simple analytical expression is obtained for the
Isgur-Wise function in the heavy-quark limit. Breaking of heavy-quark symmetry
due to realistic values of the heavy-quark mass are studied numerically.
