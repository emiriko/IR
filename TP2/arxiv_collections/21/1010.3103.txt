A vessel is plunged upside down into a pool of 50 cSt silicone oil. An air
bell is then created. This bell is vertically shaken at 60 Hz that leads to the
oscillation of the air/oil interface. The edges of the immersed vessel generate
surface waves that propagate towards the center of the bell. When the amplitude
of the oscillation increases, wave amplitude increases. We study the influence
of the angle between successive sides on the wave patterns. Two kinds of vessel
have been studied: a triangular and a square prism. The shape of the air/oil
meniscus depends on the angle between the sides of the considered prism. As the
amplitude of the oscillation is increased, the triple line, which is the
contact line between the solid and the air/oil interface, moves up and down.
Above a given acceleration that depends on the immersion depth and on the shape
vessel, wave goes under the corner edge of the bell. During the oscillation,
the wave generates at the edges presents a singularity that leads eventually to
a jet and a drop ejection. A drop is ejected at each oscillation. More
complicated ejection can be produced with further increase of the amplitude.
