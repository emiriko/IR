Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) at liquid helium temperature is used to
image potassium adsorbed on graphite at low coverage (~0.02 monolayer). Single
atoms appear as protrusions on STM topographs. A statistical analysis of the
position of the atoms demonstrates repulsion between adsorbates, which is
quantified by comparison with molecular dynamics simulations. This gives access
to the dipole moment of a single adsorbate, found to be 10.5 Debye. Time lapse
imaging shows that long range order is broken by thermally activated diffusion,
with a 32 meV barrier to hopping between graphite lattice sites.
