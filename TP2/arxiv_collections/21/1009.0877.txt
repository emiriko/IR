We construct via generators and relations, generalized Weil representations
for analogues of classical $SL(2,k), k$ a field, over involutive base rings
$(A, \ast).$ This family of groups covers different kinds of groups, classical
and non classical. We give some examples that include symplectic groups as well
as non classical groups like $SL_\ast(2,A_m), $ where $A_m$ is the finite
modular analogue of the algebra of real m-jets in one dimension with its
canonical involutive symmetry.
