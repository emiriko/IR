An experimental overview of reactions induced by the stable, but weakly-bound
nuclei 6Li, 7Li and 9Be, and by the exotic, halo nuclei 6He, 8He, 8B, and 11Be
on medium-mass targets, such as 58Ni, 59Co or 64Zn, is presented. Existing data
on elastic scattering, total reaction cross sections, fusion processes, breakup
and transfer channels are discussed in the framework of a CDCC approach taking
into account the breakup degree of freedom.
