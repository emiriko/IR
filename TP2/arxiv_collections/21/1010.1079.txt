We have performed hydrodynamic and radiative transfer calculations of a
photoevaporating disc around a Herbig Ae/Be star to determine the evolution and
observational impact of dust entrained in the wind. We find that the wind
selectively entrains grains of different sizes at different radii resulting in
a dust population that varies spatially and increases with height above the
disc at radii > 10 AU. This variable grain population results in a 'wingnut'
morphology to the dust density distribution. We calculate images of this dust
distribution at NIR wavelengths that also show a wingnut morphology at all
wavelengths considered. We have also considered the contribution that
crystalline dust grains will have in the wind and show that a photoevaporative
wind can result in a significant crystallinity fraction at all radii, when the
disc is edge-on. However, when the disc's photosphere is unobscured, a
photoevaporative wind makes no contribution to the observable crystallinity
fraction in the disc. Finally, we conclude that the analysis of extended
emission around edge-on discs could provide a new and independent method of
testing photoevaporation models.
