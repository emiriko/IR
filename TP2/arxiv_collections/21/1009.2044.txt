We present both simulated and partial empirical evidence for the
computational utility of many connected vesicle analogs of an encapsulated
non-linear chemical processing medium. By connecting small vesicles containing
a solution of sub-excitable Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction, sustained and
propagating wave fragments are modulated by both spatial geometry, network
connectivity and their interaction with other waves. The processing ability is
demonstrated through the creation of simple Boolean logic gates and then by the
combination of those gates to create more complex circuits.
