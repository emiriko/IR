A scanning tunneling microscope can be used to visualize in real space Fermi
surfaces with buried impurities far below substrates acting as local probes. A
theory describing this feature is developed based on the stationary phase
approximation. It is demonstrated how a Fermi surface of a material acts as a
mirror focusing electrons that scatter at hidden impurities.
