In some previous papers we proposed the use of free software for a processing
of the Google satellite imagery. Here we discuss the use of a wavelet filter
for the same purposes. This filter is a tool included in a freely downloadable
software (Iris), well-known for the processing of astronomical images.
Combining the image obtained after applying the wavelet filter, with an image
created with Gimp and AstroFracTool, the visibility of the landforms, as
obtained from Google Maps, is strongly increased. Among several possible
examples, we proposed a crater, a paleochannel and the Great Bend of the Nile.
