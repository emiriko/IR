A momentum representation treatment of the hydrogen atom problem with a
generalized uncertainty relation,which leads to a minimal length
({\Delta}X_{i})_{min}= \hbar \sqrt(3{\beta}+{\beta}'), is presented. We show
that the distance squared operator can be factorized in the case
{\beta}'=2{\beta}. We analytically solve the s-wave bound-state equation. The
leading correction to the energy spectrum caused by the minimal length depends
on \sqrt{\beta}. An upper bound for the minimal length is found to be about
10^{-9} fm.
