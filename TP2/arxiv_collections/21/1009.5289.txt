Global citizenship plays an important role in today's schools. Many subjects
taught in schools have already incorporated such ideas. Science and physics
have also followed suit. However, when dealing with astronomy - a topic so
seemingly far removed from society - it becomes difficult to imagine any links
with global citizenship. At Nottingham Trent University observatory we have
developed an activity ideal to transport the idea of global citizenship and
deal with common astronomical misconceptions. It incorporates role playing in
the inspiring environment of an astronomical observatory. In this activity
stellar constellations with their myths and history pose an ideal opportunity
to explore global citizenship. Students not only place themselves in someone
else's situation, but also compare their different reactions when faced with a
common situation. This idea is extended to analyse the change in constellation
culture throughout time and the affect politics has had on constellations. In
this article we outline the details of this activity and how it deals with
common astronomical misconceptions. We also demonstrate its implementation into
astronomy taught at schools. First results showing the impact the activity had
on the students will also be given.
