In this study, we have found a new random ordered phase in isotropic models
with many-body interactions. Spin correlations between neighboring planes are
rigorously shown to form a long-range order, namely coplanar order, using a
unitary transformation, and the phase transition of this new order has been
analyzed on the bases of the mean-field theory and correlation identities. In
the systems with regular 4-body interactions, the transition temperature
$T_{\text{c}}$ is obtained as $T_{\text{c}}=(z-2)J/k_{\text{B}}$, and the field
conjugate to this new order parameter is found to be $H^2$. In contrast, the
corresponding physical quantities in the systems with random 4-body
interactions are given by $T_{\text{c}}=\sqrt{z-2}J/k_{\text{B}}$ and $H^4$,
respectively. Scaling forms of order parameters for regular or random 4-body
interactions are expressed by the same scaling functions in the systems with
regular or random 2-body interactions, respectively. Furthermore, we have
obtained the nonlinear susceptibilities in the regular and random systems,
where the coefficient $\chi_{\text{nl}}$ of $H^3$ in the magnetization shows
positive divergence in the regular model, while the coefficient $\chi_{7}$ of
$H^7$ in the magnetization shows negative divergence in the random model.
