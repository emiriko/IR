Motivated by recent experiments, we consider the dynamics of spin-one spinor
condensates after a quantum quench from the polar to ferromagnetic state from
varying the quadratic Zeeman field q. We apply the Truncated Wigner
Approximation (TWA) to the spinor system, including all spatial and spin
degrees of freedom. For short times, we find full agreement with the linearized
Bogoliubov analysis. For longer times, where the Bogoliubov theory fails, we
find that the system reaches a quasi-steady prethermalized state. We compute
the Bogoliubov spectrum about the ferromagnetic state with general q and show
that the resulting finite temperature correlation functions grossly disagree
with the full TWA results, thus indicating that the system does not thermalize
even over very long time scales. Finally we show that the absence of
thermalization over realistic time scales is consistent with calculations of
Landau damping rates of excitations in the finite-temperature condensate.
