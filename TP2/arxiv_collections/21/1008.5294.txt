Taking advantage of both the low-emittance proton-beam of the Cooler
Synchrotron COSY and the high momentum precision of the COSY-11 detector
system, the mass distribution of the eta' meson was measured with a resolution
of 0.33 MeV/c^2 (FWHM), improving the experimental mass resolution by almost an
order of magnitude with respect to previous results. Based on the sample of
more than 2300 reconstructed pp --> pp eta' events the total width of the eta'
meson was determined to be 0.226 +- 0.017(stat.) +- 0.014(syst.) MeV/c^2.
