Nonlinear dynamics of a bouncing ball moving in gravitational field and
colliding with a moving limiter is considered. Displacement of the limiter is a
quadratic function of time. Several dynamical modes, such as fixed points, 2 -
cycles and chaotic bands are studied analytically and numerically. It is shown
that chaotic bands appear due to homoclinic structures created from unstable 2
- cycles in a corner-type bifurcation.
