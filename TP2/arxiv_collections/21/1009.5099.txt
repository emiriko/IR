We consider evolution of the Universe after EWSB leading to the present inert
phase, containing a SM-like Higgs boson and scalar dark particles, among them a
Dark Matter candidate. We address the question, if there is a possibility to
have a sequence of the phase transitions instead of a single one leading
directly from EW symmetric phase to the inert one.
