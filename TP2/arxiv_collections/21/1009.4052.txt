Recently, a new organic superconductor, K-intercalated Picene with high
transition temperatures $T_c$ (up to 18\,K) has been discovered. We have
investigated the electronic properties of the undoped relative, solid picene,
using a combination of experimental and theoretical methods. Our results
provide detailed insight into the occuopied and unoccupied electronic states.
