This fluid dynamics video shows how an oil-in-water emulsion stabilized by an
ionic surfactant spreads on the free surface of a layer of pure water. The
spreading shows two intriguing features: a transparent area surrounding the
source of oil droplets, and a fast retraction of the layer of oil droplets on
itself once the source has emptied. We show that the dynamics of spreading are
strongly connected to the interfacial/bulk properties of the surfactant.
