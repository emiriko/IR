In this paper modified variants of the sparse Fourier transform algorithms
from [14] are presented which improve on the approximation error bounds of the
original algorithms. In addition, simple methods for extending the improved
sparse Fourier transforms to higher dimensional settings are developed. As a
consequence, approximate Fourier transforms are obtained which will identify a
near-optimal k-term Fourier series for any given input function, $f : [0, 2 pi]
-> C, in O(k^2 \cdot D^4)$ time (neglecting logarithmic factors). Faster
randomized Fourier algorithm variants with runtime complexities that scale
linearly in the sparsity parameter k are also presented.
