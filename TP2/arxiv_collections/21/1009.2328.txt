We construct a 3-3-1 model based on family symmetry S_4 responsible for the
neutrino and quark masses. The tribimaximal neutrino mixing and the diagonal
quark mixing have been obtained. The new lepton charge \mathcal{L} related to
the ordinary lepton charge L and a SU(3) charge by L=2/\sqrt{3} T_8+\mathcal{L}
and the lepton parity P_l=(-)^L known as a residual symmetry of L have been
introduced which provide insights in this kind of model. The expected vacuum
alignments resulting in potential minimization can origin from appropriate
violation terms of S_4 and \mathcal{L}. The smallness of seesaw contributions
can be explained from the existence of such terms too. If P_l is not broken by
the vacuum values of the scalar fields, there is no mixing between the exotic
and the ordinary quarks at the tree level.
