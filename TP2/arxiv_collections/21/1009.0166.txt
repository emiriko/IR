A circulation redistribution scheme for viscous flow is presented. Unlike
other redistribution methods, it operates by transferring the circulation to a
set of fixed nodes rather than neighbouring vortex elements. A new distribution
of vortex elements can then be constructed from the circulation on the nodes.
The solution to the redistribution problem can be written explicitly as a set
of algebraic formulae, producing a method which is simple and efficient. The
scheme works with the circulation contained in the vortex elements only, and
does not require overlap of vortex cores. With a body fitted redistribution
mesh, smooth and accurate estimates of the pointwise surface forces can be
obtained. The ability of the scheme to produce high resolution solution is
demonstrated using a series of test problems.
