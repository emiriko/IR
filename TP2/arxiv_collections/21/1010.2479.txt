Compared to a neutral model, purifying selection distorts the structure of
genealogies and hence alters the patterns of sampled genetic variation.
Although these distortions may be common in nature, our understanding of how we
expect purifying selection to affect patterns of molecular variation remains
incomplete. Genealogical approaches such as coalescent theory have proven
difficult to generalize to situations involving selection at many linked sites,
unless selection pressures are extremely strong. Here, we introduce an
effective coalescent theory (a "fitness-class coalescent") to describe the
structure of genealogies in the presence of purifying selection at many linked
sites. We use this effective theory to calculate several simple statistics
describing the expected patterns of variation in sequence data, both at the
sites under selection and at linked neutral sites. Our analysis combines our
earlier description of the allele frequency spectrum in the presence of
purifying selection (Desai et al. 2010) with the structured coalescent approach
of Nordborg (1997), to trace the ancestry of individuals through the
distribution of fitnesses within the population. Alternatively, we can derive
our results using an extension of the coalescent approach of Hudson and Kaplan
(1994). We find that purifying selection leads to patterns of genetic variation
that are related but not identical to a neutrally evolving population in which
population size has varied in a specific way in the past.
