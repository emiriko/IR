We investigate the possibility of measuring the thermal Casimir force and its
gradient in the configuration of a plate and a microfabricated cylinder
attached to a micromachined oscillator. The Lifshitz-type formulas in this
configuration are derived using the proximity force approximation. The accuracy
for the obtained expressions is determined from a comparison with exact results
available in ideal metal case. Computations of the thermal correction to both
the Casimir force and its gradient are performed in the framework of different
theoretical approaches proposed in the literature. The correction to the
Casimir force and its gradient due to lack of parallelism of the plate and
cylinder is determined using the nonmultiplicative approach. The error
introduced in the theory due to the finite length of the cylinder is estimated.
We propose that both static and dynamic experiments measuring the thermal
Casimir interaction between a cylinder and a plate using a micromachined
oscillator can shed additional light on the thermal Casimir force problem.
Specifically, it is shown that the static experiment is better adapted for the
measurement of thermal effects.
