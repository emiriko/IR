Two-component Fermi and Bose gases with infinitely large interspecies s-wave
scattering length $a_s$ exhibit a variety of intriguing properties. Among these
are the scale invariance of two-component Fermi gases with equal masses, and
the favorable scaling of Efimov features for two-component Bose gases and
Bose-Fermi mixtures with unequal masses. This paper builds on our earlier work
[D. Blume and K. M. Daily, arXiv:1006.5002] and presents a detailed discussion
of our studies of small unequal-mass two-component systems with infinite $a_s$
in the regime where three-body Efimov physics is absent. We report on
non-universal few-body resonances. Just like with two-body systems on
resonance, few-body systems have a zero-energy bound state in free space and a
diverging generalized scattering length. Our calculations are performed within
a non-perturbative microscopic framework and investigate the energetics and
structural properties of small unequal-mass two-component systems as functions
of the mass ratio $\kappa$, and the numbers $N_{1}$ and $N_2$ of heavy and
light atoms. For purely attractive Gaussian two-body interactions, we find that
the $(N_1,N_2)=(2,1)$ and $(3,1)$ systems exhibit three-body and four-body
resonances at mass ratios $\kappa = 12.314(2)$ and 10.4(2), respectively. The
three- and four-particle systems on resonance are found to be large. This
suggests that the corresponding wave function has relatively small overlap with
deeply-bound dimers, trimers or larger clusters and that the three- and
four-body systems on resonance have a comparatively long lifetime. Thus, it
seems feasible that the features discussed in this paper can be probed
experimentally with present-day technology.
