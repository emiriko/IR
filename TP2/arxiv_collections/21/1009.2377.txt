The emission properties of a molecular light source depend on its optical and
chemical environment. This dependence, however, is different for various light
sources. We present a general classification of sources by introducing the
concepts of Constant Amplitude and Constant Power Sources. The unforeseen
consequences of this classification are illustrated for photonic studies by
random laser experiments. Comparison of the experimental results with properly
customized rate equations identifies the type of light source in the gain
medium and an estimate for its quantum efficiency. Our results require a major
revision of source studies in multiple scattering media.
