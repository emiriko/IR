We conjecture that the counting of the levels in the orbital entanglement
spectra (OES) of finite-sized Laughlin Fractional Quantum Hall (FQH) droplets
at filling $\nu=1/m$ is described by the Haldane statistics of particles in a
box of finite size. This principle explains the observed deviations of the OES
counting from the edge-mode conformal field theory counting and directly
provides us with a topological number of the FQH states inaccessible in the
thermodynamic limit- the boson compactification radius. It also suggests that
the entanglement gap in the Coulomb spectrum in the conformal limit protects a
universal quantity- the statistics of the state. We support our conjecture with
ample numerical checks.
