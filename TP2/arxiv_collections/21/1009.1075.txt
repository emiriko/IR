The field electron emission current from graphene is calculated analytically
on a semiclassical model. The unique electronic energy band structure of
graphene and the field penetration in the edge from which the electrons emit
have been taken into account. The relation between the effective vacuum barrier
height and the applied field is obtained. The calculated slope of the
Fowler-Nordheim plot of the current-field characteristic is in consistent with
existing experiments.
