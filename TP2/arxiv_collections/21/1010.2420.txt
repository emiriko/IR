Games on graphs provide a natural and powerful model for reactive systems. In
this paper, we consider generalized reachability objectives, defined as
conjunctions of reachability objectives. We first prove that deciding the
winner in such games is $\PSPACE$-complete, although it is fixed-parameter
tractable with the number of reachability objectives as parameter. Moreover, we
consider the memory requirements for both players and give matching upper and
lower bounds on the size of winning strategies. In order to allow more
efficient algorithms, we consider subclasses of generalized reachability games.
We show that bounding the size of the reachability sets gives two natural
subclasses where deciding the winner can be done efficiently.
