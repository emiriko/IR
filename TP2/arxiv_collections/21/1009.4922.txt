We prove a refined Agler decomposition for bounded analytic functions on the
bidisk and show how it can be used to reprove an interesting result of Guo et
al. related to extending holomorphic functions without increasing their norm.
In addition, we give a new treatment of Heath and Suffridge's characterization
of holomorphic retracts on the polydisk.
