This contribution to the proceedings of "A New Golden Age for Radio
Astronomy" is simply intended to give some of the highlights from pulsar
observations with LOFAR at the time of its official opening: June 12th, 2010.
These observations illustrate that, though LOFAR is still under construction
and astronomical commissioning, it is already starting to deliver on its
promise to revolutionize radio astronomy in the low-frequency regime. These
observations also demonstrate how LOFAR has many "next-generation"
capabilities, such as wide-field multi-beaming, that will be vital to open a
new Golden Age in radio astronomy through the Square Kilometer Array and its
precursors.
