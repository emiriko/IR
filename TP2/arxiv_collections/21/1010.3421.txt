Recent results on muonic hydrogen [1] and the ones compiled by CODATA on
ordinary hydrogen and $ep$-scattering [2] are $5\sigma$ away from each other.
Two reasons justify a further look at this subject: 1) One of the
approximations used in [1] is not valid for muonic hydrogen. This amounts to a
shift of the proton's radius by $\sim 3$ of the standard deviations of [1], in
the "right" direction of data-reconciliation. In field-theory terms, the error
is a mismatch of renormalization scales. Once corrected, the proton radius
"runs", much as the QCD coupling "constant" does. 2) The result of [1] requires
a choice of the "third Zemach moment". Its published independent determination
is based on an analysis with a $p$-value --the probability of obtaining data
with equal or lesser agreement with the adopted (fit form-factor) hypothesis--
of $3.92\times 10^{-12}$. In this sense, this quantity is not empirically
known. Its value would regulate the level of "tension" between muonic- and
ordinary-hydrogen results, currently {\it at most} $\sim 4\sigma$. There is no
tension between the results of [1] and the proton radius determined with help
of the analyticity of its form factors.
