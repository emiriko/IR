We measured high resolution Cu $L_3$ edge resonant inelastic x-ray scattering
(RIXS) of the undoped cuprates La$_2$CuO$_4$, Sr$_2$CuO$_2$Cl$_2$, CaCuO$_2$
and NdBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_6$. The dominant spectral features were assigned to $dd$
excitations and we extensively studied their polarization and scattering
geometry dependence. In a pure ionic picture, we calculated the theoretical
cross sections for those excitations and used them to fit the experimental data
with excellent agreement. By doing so, we were able to determine the energy and
symmetry of Cu-3$d$ states for the four systems with unprecedented accuracy and
confidence. The values of the effective parameters could be obtained for the
single ion crystal field model but not for a simple two-dimensional cluster
model. The firm experimental assessment of $dd$ excitation energies carries
important consequences for the physics of high $T_c$ superconductors. On one
hand, having found that the minimum energy of orbital excitation is always
$\geq 1.4$ eV, i.e., well above the mid-infrared spectral range, leaves to
magnetic excitations (up to 300 meV) a major role in Cooper pairing in
cuprates. On the other hand, it has become possible to study quantitatively the
effective influence of $dd$ excitations on the superconducting gap in cuprates.
