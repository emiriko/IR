Epitaxial bilayers of ferromagnetic La2/3Ca1/3MnO3 (LCMO) and superconducting
YBa2Cu3O7-d (YBCO) have been grown on single-crystalline SrTiO3 (STO)
substrates by pulsed laser deposition. The Manganese magnetization profile
across the FM layer has been determined with high spatial resolution at low
temperatures by X-ray resonant magnetic reflectivity (XRMR). It is found that
not only the adjacent superconductor but also the substrate underneath
influences the magnetization of the LCMO film at the interfaces at low
temperatures. Both effects can be investigated individually by XRMR.
