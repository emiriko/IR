Investigations of photoluminescence (PL) in the magnetic field of quantum
structures based on the ZnSe quantum well with asymmetrical ZnBeMnSe and ZnBeSe
barriers reveal that the introduction of Be into semimagnetic ZnMnSe causes a
decrease of the exchange integrals for conductive and valence bands as well as
the forming of a complex based on Mn, degeneration of an energy level of which
with the energy levels of the V band of ZnBeMnSe or ZnSe results in spin-flip
electron transitions.
