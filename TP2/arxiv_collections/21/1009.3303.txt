Nanoscale control of the metal-insulator transition in LaAlO3/ SrTiO3
heterostructures can be achieved using local voltages applied by a conductive
atomic-force microscope probe. One proposed mechanism for the writing and
erasing process involves an adsorbed H2O layer at the top LaAlO3 surface. In
this picture, water molecules dissociates into OH- and H+ which are then
selectively removed by a biased AFM probe. To test this mechanism, writing and
erasing experiments are performed in a vacuum AFM using various gas mixtures.
Writing ability is suppressed in those environments where H2O is not present.
The stability of written nanostructures is found to be strongly associated with
the ambient environment. The self-erasure process in air can be strongly
suppressed by creating a modest vacuum or replacing the humid air with dry
inert gas. These experiments provide strong constraints for theories of both
the writing process as well as the origin of interfacial conductance.
