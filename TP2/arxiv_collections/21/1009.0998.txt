Depinning of two-dimensional liquid ridges and three-dimensional drops on an
inclined substrate is studied within the lubrication approximation. The
structures are pinned to wetting heterogeneities arising from variations of the
strength of the short-range polar contribution to the disjoining pressure. The
case of a periodic array of hydrophobic stripes transverse to the slope is
studied in detail using a combination of direct numerical simulation and
branch-following techniques. Under appropriate conditions the ridges may either
depin and slide downslope as the slope is increased, or first breakup into
drops via a transverse instability, prior to depinning. The different
transition scenarios are examined together with the stability properties of the
different possible states of the system.
