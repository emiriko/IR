We study mesoscopic spin Hall effect on the surface of topological insulator
with a step-function potential. The giant spin polarization induced by a
transverse electric current is derived analytically by using McMillan method in
the ballistic transport limit, which oscillates across the potential boundary
with no confinement from the potential barrier due to the Klein paradox, and
should be observable in spin resolved scanning tunneling microscope.
