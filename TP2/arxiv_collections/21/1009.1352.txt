Tidal effects arise from differential and inelastic deformation of a planet
by a perturbing body. The continuous action of tides modify the rotation of the
planet together with its orbit until an equilibrium situation is reached. It is
often believed that synchronous motion is the most probable outcome of the
tidal evolution process, since synchronous rotation is observed for the
majority of the satellites in the Solar System. However, in the 19th century,
Schiaparelli also assumed synchronous motion for the rotations of Mercury and
Venus, and was later shown to be wrong. Rather, for planets in eccentric orbits
synchronous rotation is very unlikely. The rotation period and axial tilt of
exoplanets is still unknown, but a large number of planets have been detected
close to the parent star and should have evolved to a final equilibrium
situation. Therefore, based on the Solar System well studied cases, we can make
some predictions for exoplanets. Here we describe in detail the main tidal
effects that modify the secular evolution of the spin and the orbit of a
planet. We then apply our knowledge acquired from Solar System situations to
exoplanet cases. In particular, we will focus on two classes of planets,
"Hot-Jupiters" (fluid) and "Super-Earths" (rocky with atmosphere).
