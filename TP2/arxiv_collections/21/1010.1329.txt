Ultrafast fiber lasers with short pulses and broad bandwidth are in great
demand for a variety of applications, such as spectroscopy, biomedical
diagnosis and optical communications. In particular sub-200fs pulses are
required for ultrafast spectroscopy with high temporal resolution. Graphene is
an ideal ultra-wide-band saturable absorber. We report the generation of 174fs
pulses from a graphene-based fiber laser
