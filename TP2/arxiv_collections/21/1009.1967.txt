We present a combined X-ray and optical analysis of three bimodal galaxy
clusters selected as merging candidates at z ~ 0.1. These targets are part of
MUSIC (MUlti--Wavelength Sample of Interacting Clusters), which is a general
project designed to study the physics of merging clusters by means of
multi-wavelength observations. Observations include spectro-imaging with
XMM-Newton EPIC camera, multi-object spectroscopy (260 new redshifts), and
wide-field imaging at the ESO 3.6m and 2.2m telescopes. We build a global
picture of these clusters using X-ray luminosity and temperature maps together
with galaxy density and velocity distributions. Idealized numerical simulations
were used to constrain the merging scenario for each system. We show that A2933
is very likely an equal-mass advanced pre-merger ~ 200 Myr before the core
collapse, while A2440 and A2384 are post-merger systems ~ 450 Myr and ~1.5 Gyr
after core collapse, respectively). In the case of A2384, we detect a
spectacular filament of galaxies and gas spreading over more than 1 h^{-1} Mpc,
which we infer to have been stripped during the previous collision. The
analysis of the MUSIC sample allows us to outline some general properties of
merging clusters: a strong luminosity segregation of galaxies in recent
post-mergers; the existence of preferential axes --corresponding to the merging
directions-- along which the BCGs and structures on various scales are aligned;
the concomitance, in most major merger cases, of secondary merging or accretion
events, with groups infalling onto the main cluster, and in some cases the
evidence of previous merging episodes in one of the main components. These
results are in good agreement with the hierarchical scenario of structure
formation, in which clusters are expected to form by successive merging events,
and matter is accreted along large--scale filaments.
