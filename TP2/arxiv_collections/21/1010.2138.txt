Our work aims to study tools offered to students and tutors involved in
face-to-face or blended project- based learning activities. Project-based
learning is often applied in the case of complex learning (i.e. which aims at
making learners acquire various linked skills or develop their behaviours). In
comparison to traditional learning, this type of learning relies on
co-development, collective responsibility and co-operation. Learners are the
principal actors of their learning. These trainings rest on rich and complex
organizations, particularly for tutors, and it is difficult to apply innovative
educational strategies. Our aim, in a bottom-up approach, is (1) to observe,
according to Knowledge Management methods, a course characterized by these
three criteria. The observed course concerns project management learning. Its
observation allows us (2) to highlight and to analyze the problems encountered
by the actors (students, tutors, designers) and (3) to propose tools to solve
or improve them. We particularly study the relevance and the limits of the
existing monitoring and experience sharing tools. We finally propose a result
in the form of the tool MEShaT (Monitoring and Experience Sharing Tool) and end
on the perspectives offered by these researches.
