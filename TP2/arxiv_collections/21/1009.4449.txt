It has now been possible to prepare chain of ions in an entangled state and
thus question arises --- how the optical properties of a chain of entangled
ions differ from say a chain of independent particles. We investigate nonlinear
optical processes in such chains. We explicitly demonstrate the possibility of
entanglement produced super Raman scattering. Our results in contrast to
Dicke's work on superradiance are applicable to stimulated processes and are
thus free from the standard complications of multimode quantum electrodynamics.
Our results suggest the possibility of similar enhancement factors in other
nonlinear processes like four wave mixing.
