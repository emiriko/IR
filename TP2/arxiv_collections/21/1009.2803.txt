This is a short survey illustrating some of the essential aspects of the
theory of canonical extensions. In addition some topological results about
canonical extensions of lattices with additional operations in finitely
generated varieties are given. In particular, they are doubly algebraic
lattices and their interval topologies agree with their double Scott topologies
and make them Priestley topological algebras.
