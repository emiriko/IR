We present the improved solar radio spectrograph of the University of Athens
operating at the Thermopylae Satellite Telecommunication Station. Observations
now cover the frequency range from 20 to 650 MHz. The spectrograph has a
7-meter moving parabola fed by a log-periodic antenna for 100 650 MHz and a
stationary inverted V fat dipole antenna for the 20 100 MHz range. Two
receivers are operating in parallel, one swept frequency for the whole range
(10 spectrums/sec, 630 channels/spectrum) and one acousto-optical receiver for
the range 270 to 450 MHz (100 spectrums/sec, 128 channels/spectrum). The data
acquisition system consists of two PCs (equipped with 12 bit, 225 ksamples/sec
ADC, one for each receiver). Sensitivity is about 3 SFU and 30 SFU in the 20
100 MHz and 100 650 MHz range respectively. The daily operation is fully
automated: receiving universal time from a GPS, pointing the antenna to the
sun, system calibration, starting and stopping the observations at preset
times, data acquisition, and archiving on DVD. We can also control the whole
system through modem or Internet. The instrument can be used either by itself
or in conjunction with other instruments to study the onset and evolution of
solar radio bursts and associated interplanetary phenomena.
