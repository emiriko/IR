Light curves are calculated for an off-axis observer due the scattering of
primary radiation by extended baryonic material. The unusually long duration
and the chromaticity of the light curves above several KeV of XRF 060218 can be
explained as a result of the acceleration of the baryonic scattering material
by the primary radiation. The observed light curves by our model and detailed
fits to the data are presented. The model predicts that $\sim 4\times 10^{48}$
ergs are put into accelerated, mildly relativistic baryons by the radiation
pressure at large radii from the central engine. It is suggested that the
emission below 3 KeV, which lies {\it below} the Amati relation, is a baryon
contaminated fireball.
