Correlation in user connectivity patterns is generally considered a problem
for system designers, since it results in peaks of demand and also in the
scarcity of resources for peer-to-peer applications. The other side of the coin
is that these connectivity patterns are often predictable and that, to some
extent, they can be dealt with proactively.
  In this work, we build predictors aiming to determine the probability that
any given user will be online at any given time in the future. We evaluate the
quality of these predictors on various large traces from instant messaging and
file sharing applications.
  We also illustrate how availability prediction can be applied to enhance the
behavior of peer-to-peer applications: we show through simulation how data
availability is substantially increased in a distributed hash table simply by
adjusting data placement policies according to peer availability prediction and
without requiring any additional storage from any peer.
