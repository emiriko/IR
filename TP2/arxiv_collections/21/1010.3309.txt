Two-body charmless hadronic B decays involving a tensor meson in the final
state are studied within the framework of QCD factorization (QCDF). Due to the
G-parity of the tensor meson, both the chiral-even and chiral-odd two-parton
light-cone distribution amplitudes of the tensor meson are antisymmetric under
the interchange of momentum fractions of the quark and anti-quark in the SU(3)
limit. Our main results are: (i) In the naive factorization approach, the
decays such as $B^-\to \bar K_2^{*0}\pi^-$ and $\bar B^0\to K_2^{*-}\pi^+$ with
a tensor meson emitted are prohibited owing to the fact that a tensor meson
cannot be created from the local V-A or tensor current. Nevertheless, they
receive nonfactorizable contributions in QCDF from vertex, penguin and hard
spectator corrections. The experimental observation of $B^-\to \bar
K_2^{*0}\pi^-$ indicates the importance of nonfactorizable effects. (ii) For
penguin-dominated $B\to TP$ and $TV$ decays, the predicted rates in naive
factorization are usually too small by one to two orders of magnitude. In QCDF,
they are enhanced by power corrections from penguin annihilation and
nonfactorizable contributions.(iii) The dominant penguin contributions to $B\to
K_2^*\eta^{(')}$ arise from the processes: (a) $b\to ss\bar s\to s\eta_s$ and
(b) $b\to s q\bar q\to q \bar K_2^*$ with $\eta_q=(u\bar u+d\bar d)/\sqrt{2}$
and $\eta_s=s\bar s$. The interference, constructive for $K_2^*\eta'$ and
destructive for $K_2^*\eta$, explains why $\Gamma(B\to
K_2^*\eta')\gg\Gamma(B\to K_2^*\eta)$.
