In order to investigate the phenomenological implications of allowing gauge
fields to propagate in warped spaces of more than five dimensions, we consider
a toy model of a space warped by the presence of a anisotropic bulk
cosmological constant. After solving the Einstein equation, three classes of
solutions are found, those in which the additional ($D>5$) dimensions are
growing, shrinking or remaining constant. It is found that gauge fields
propagating in these spaces have a significantly different Kaluza Klein (KK)
mass spectrum and couplings from that of the Randall and Sundrum model. This
leads to a greatly reduced lower bound on the KK scale, arising from
electroweak constraints, for spaces growing towards the IR brane.
