We argue that the hidden order state in URu$_2$Si$_2$ will induce a charge
density wave. The modulation vector of the charge density wave will be twice
that of the hidden order state, $Q_{CDW} = 2Q_{HO}$. To illustrate how the
charge density wave arises we use a Ginzburg-Landau theory that contains a
coupling of the charge density wave amplitude to the square of the HO order
parameter $\Delta_{HO}$. This simple analysis allows us to predict the
intensity and temperature dependence of the charge density wave order parameter
in terms of the susceptibilities and coupling constants used in the
Ginzburg-Landau analysis.
