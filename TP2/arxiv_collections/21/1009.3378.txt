About 25 isolated neutron stars (INSs) are now detected in the optical
domain, mainly thanks to the HST and to VLT-class telescopes. The European
Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT) will yield ~100 new identifications, many of
which from the follow-up of SKA, IXO, and Fermi observations. Moreover, the
E-ELT will allow to carry out, on a much larger sample, INS observations which
still challenge VLT-class telescopes, enabling studies on the structure and
composition of the NS interior, of its atmosphere and magnetosphere, as well as
to search for debris discs. In this contribution, I outline future perspectives
for NS optical astronomy with the E-ELT.
