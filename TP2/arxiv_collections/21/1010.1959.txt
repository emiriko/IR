For this exceptional 25th anniversary of the QCD-Montpellier series of
conferences initiated in 85 with the name "Non-perturbative methods", we take
the opportunuity to celebrate the 30 + 1 years of the discovery of the SVZ
(also called ITEP, QCD or QCD spectral) sum rules by M.A. Shifman, A.I.
Vainshtein and V.I. Zakahrov in 79 [1]. In this talk, I have the duty to
present the status of the method. I shall (can) not enumerate the vast area of
successful applications of sum rules in hadron physics but I shall focus on the
historical evolution of field and its new developments. More detailed related
discussions and more complete references can be found in the textbooks [2,3].
