This paper is the third of a series giving a self-contained way from the
Neveu-Schwarz algebra to a new series of irreducible subfactors. Here we
introduce the local von Neumann algebra of the Neveu-Schwarz algebra, to obtain
Jones-Wassermann subfactors for each representation of the discrete series.
Then using primary fields we prove the irreducibility of these subfactors; to
next compute the Connes fusion ring and obtain the explicit formula of the
subfactors indices.
