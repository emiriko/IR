Utilizing the scales theory of electromagnetic theory, the anisotropic
dielectric material is reconstructed into an isotropic medium. The analytic
expressions of scattering field and the scattering breadth for an anisotropic
material cylinder are first presented. Their validities are checked
theoretically. The influences induced by the dielectric constant tensor etc. on
the scattering breadth are simulated. The results show that the scatterings
both in the forward direction and vertical direction to the incident direction
are strong. The dielectric constant in the polarizing direction has a biggish
effect on scattering field. The mechanism of results is presented
