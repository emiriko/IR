Suppose V is a surface over a number field k that admits two elliptic
fibrations. We show that for each integer d there exists an explicitly
computable closed subset Z of V, not equal to V, such that for each field
extension K of k of degree at most d over the field of rational numbers, the
set V(K) is Zariski dense as soon as it contains any point outside Z. We also
present a version of this statement that is universal over certain twists of V
and over all extensions of k. This generalizes a result of Swinnerton-Dyer, as
well as previous work of Logan, McKinnon, and the author.
