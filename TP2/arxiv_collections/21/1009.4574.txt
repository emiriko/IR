Text classification is the process of classifying documents into predefined
categories based on their content. Existing supervised learning algorithms to
automatically classify text need sufficient documents to learn accurately. This
paper presents a new algorithm for text classification that requires fewer
documents for training. Instead of using words, word relation i.e association
rules from these words is used to derive feature set from preclassified text
documents. The concept of Naive Bayes classifier is then used on derived
features and finally only a single concept of Genetic Algorithm has been added
for final classification. Experimental results show that the classifier build
this way is more accurate than the existing text classification systems.
