Single free-falling freshwater drops were generated with no initial velocity
by hypodermic needles, at an altitude of 3.61 m above a still freshwater
surface. High resolution high speed videos (0.13 mm/pixel, 500 frames/second)
of the dynamics of the impact were acquired. A few milliseconds after forming
the usually observed cavity, canopy and coronet (Prosperetti et al. 1993),
drops of diameters typically greater than 3.8 mm consistently generated
toroidal (donut-shaped) air bubbles upon impact at the water surface. Videos of
the dynamics of the impingement were successively taken from different angles,
and with a 105 mm lens focused on different regions of the event. These allowed
for a qualitative description and hypothetical explanation of the observed
phenomena, which are presented alongside the actual video footage, in the
hereby displayed fluid dynamics video. The video displays a cartoon of the
experimental setup, followed by two simultaneously running videoclips of the
drop impact upon the water surface, from 2 different viewpoints (front and
top). As the event occurs over less than 1 second, the videos were slowed down
to a frame rate of 12 frames/sec. The footage suggests that the air is trapped
by the converging rim (or coronet) of the closing canopy. The very bottom of
the cavity then rises rapidly, and collides with the falling water mass
provided by the fully converged canopy rim. This incidentally prevents the
formation of a secondary jet. The center (or donut hole) of the unstable
toroidal air bubble eventually moves outward, thus yielding a hemispherical air
bubble.
