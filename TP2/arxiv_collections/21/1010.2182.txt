The important role of metallicity on massive star evolution and the
combination of multi-object spectrographs and 10m class telescopes, have lead
to numerous systematic studies of massive stars in Local Group galaxies. While
color based quests of blue massive stars are relatively successful, they must
be confirmed with spectroscopy and usually lead to lists dominated by B-type
modest-mass stars. We have developed a friends of friends code to find OB
associations in Local Group galaxies, presented in Garcia et al. (2009). One of
the key points of the method is the photometric criterion to choose candidate
OB stars from the reddening-free Q parameter, that could be easily extended to
include from GALEX to near-IR photometry. While not a new idea, one of our
code's strong advantages is the automatic determination of evolutionary masses
for the members, enabling a quick and more insightful choice of candidates for
spectroscopy, and the identification of potential advanced evolutionary stages.
We present our work on the very metal-poor irregular IC 1613 (Garcia et al.
2010). The association properties are not only a powerful aid towards finding
the most interesting candidate massive stars, but also reveal the galaxy's
structure and recent star formation history.
