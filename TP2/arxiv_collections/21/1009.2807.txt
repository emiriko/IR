Radical-ion-pair reactions were recently shown to represent a rich
biophysical laboratory for the application of quantum measurement theory
methods and concepts. We here show that radical-ion-pair reactions essentially
form a non-linear biochemical double slit interferometer. Quantum coherence
effects are visible when "which-path" information is limited, and the
incoherent limit is approached when measurement-induced decoherence sets in.
Based on this analogy with the optical double slit experiment we derive and
elaborate on the fundamental master equation of spin-selective radical-ion-pair
reactions that covers the continuous range from complete incoherence to maximum
singlet-triplet coherence.
