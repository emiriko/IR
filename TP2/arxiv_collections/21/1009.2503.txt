We present a study of the cosmic infrared background, which is a measure of
the dust obscured activity in all galaxies in the Universe. We venture to
isolate the galaxies responsible for the background at 1mm; with spectroscopic
and photometric redshifts we constrain the redshift distribution of these
galaxies. We create a deep 1.16mm map (sigma ~ 0.5mJy) by combining the AzTEC
1.1mm and MAMBO 1.2mm datasets in GOODS-N. This combined map contains 41 secure
detections, 13 of which are new. By averaging the 1.16mm flux densities of
individually undetected galaxies with 24um flux densities > 25uJy, we resolve
31--45 per cent of the 1.16mm background. Repeating our analysis on the SCUBA
850um map, we resolve a higher percentage (40--64 per cent) of the 850um
background. A majority of the background resolved (attributed to individual
galaxies) at both wavelengths comes from galaxies at z > 1.3. If the ratio of
the resolved submillimeter to millimeter background is applied to a reasonable
scenario for the origins of the unresolved submillimeter background, 60--88 per
cent of the total 1.16mm background comes from galaxies at z > 1.3.
