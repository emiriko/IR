Measurements of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (hereafter SZ) effect distortion of
the cosmic microwave background provide us with an independent method to derive
the gas temperature of galaxy clusters. In merging galaxy clusters the gas
distribution is inhomogeneous and, therefore, the method of temperature
measuring based on the SZ effect should be more relevant than that based on an
X-ray emission analysis. Here we study a method for measuring the gas
temperature in merging clusters by means of the SZ effect.
  Our calculations of intensity maps of the SZ effect include relativistic
corrections considered within the framework of the Wright formalism and utilize
a cosmological numerical simulation of a merging galaxy cluster evolved with
its baryon physics.
  We found that the gas temperature in merging clusters can be measured by
means of the ratio of the SZ intensity at a low frequency (128 GHz) to that at
a high frequency (369 GHz). This SZ intensity ratio permits us to reveal
prominent features of the temperature structure caused by violent merger shock
waves. Therefore, measurements of the ratio of the SZ intensities are a
promising tool for measuring gas temperature in merging galaxy clusters.
