We report combined studies on the prototypical S(^1D_2) + H2 insertion
reaction. Kinetics and crossed-beam experiments are performed in experimental
conditions approaching the cold energy regime, yielding absolute rate
coefficients down to 5.8 K and relative integral cross sections to collision
energies as low as 0.68 meV. They are supported by quantum calculations on a
potential energy surface treating long range interactions accurately. All
results are consistent and the excitation function behavior is explained in
terms of the cumulative contribution of various partial waves.
