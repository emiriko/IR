We present an analytical approach to the strong coupling regime of similarly
and highly charged plates in the presence of counter-ions. The procedure is
physically transparent and based on an exact expansion around the ground state
formed by the two-dimensional Wigner crystal of counter-ions. The one plate
problem is worked out, together with the two plates situation. Unlike previous
approaches, the expansion is free of divergences, and is shown to be in
excellent agreement with available data of Monte-Carlo simulations under strong
Coulombic couplings. The present results shed light on the like-charge
attraction regime.
