A hybrid lattice-statistical model on doubly decorated planar lattices, which
have localized Ising spins at their nodal lattice sites and two itinerant
electrons at each pair of decorating sites, is exactly solved by the use of a
generalized decoration-iteration transformation. Our main attention is focused
on an in uence of the on-site Coulomb repulsion on ground-state properties and
critical behavior of the investigated system.
