Coin flipping is a cryptographic primitive for which strictly better
protocols exist if the players are not only allowed to exchange classical, but
also quantum messages. During the past few years, several results have appeared
which give a tight bound on the range of implementable unconditionally secure
coin flips, both in the classical as well as in the quantum setting and for
both weak as well as strong coin flipping. But the picture is still incomplete:
in the quantum setting, all results consider only protocols with perfect
correctness, and in the classical setting tight bounds for strong coin flipping
are still missing. We give a general definition of coin flipping which unifies
the notion of strong and weak coin flipping (it contains both of them as
special cases) and allows the honest players to abort with a certain
probability. We give tight bounds on the achievable range of parameters both in
the classical and in the quantum setting.
