We discuss leptogenesis within a TeV-scale inverse seesaw model for neutrino
masses where the seesaw structure is guaranteed by an SO(10) symmetry. Contrary
to the TeV-scale type-I gauged seesaw, the constraints imposed by successful
leptogenesis in these models are rather weak and allow for the extra gauge
bosons W_R and Z' to be in the LHC accessible range. The key differences in the
inverse seesaw compared to the type I case are: (i) decay and inverse decay
rates larger than the scatterings involving extra gauge bosons due to the large
Yukawa couplings and (ii) the suppression of the washout due to very small
lepton number breaking.
