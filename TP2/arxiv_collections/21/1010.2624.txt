The atomic models of nanotubes for layered FeSe, LiFeAs, SrFe2As2, and
LnFeAsO - the parent phases of so-called 11, 111, 122, and 1111 groups of newly
discovered family of iron-based high temperature superconductors are proposed.
On example of SrFe2As2 the electronic properties of predicted nanotubes are
examined and discussed in comparison with those for the corresponding single
layer and the crystal.
