We present a synchronization algorithm to let nodes in a sensor network
simultaneously execute a task at a given point in time. In contrast to other
time synchronization algorithms we do not provide a global time basis that is
shared on all nodes. Instead, any node in the network can spontaneously
initiate a process that allows the simultaneous execution of arbitrary tasks.
We show that our approach is beneficial in scenarios where a global time is not
needed, as it requires little communication compared with other time
synchronization algorithms. We also show that our algorithm works in
heterogeneous systems where the hardware provides highly varying clock
accuracy. Moreover, heterogeneity does not only affect the hardware, but also
the communication channels. We deal with different connection types---from
highly unreliable and fluctuating wireless channels to reliable and fast wired
connections.
