We present the study of the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) pairing
states in the $p$-orbital bands in both two and three-dimensional optical
lattices. Due to the quasi one-dimensional band structure which arises from the
unidirectional hopping of the orthogonal $p$-orbitals, the pairing phase space
is not affected by spin imbalance. Furthermore, interactions build up high
dimensional phase coherence which stabilizes the FFLO states in 2D and 3D
optical lattices in a large parameter regime in phase diagram. These FFLO
phases are stable with imposing the inhomogeneous trapping potential. Their
entropies are comparable to those of the normal states at finite temperatures.
