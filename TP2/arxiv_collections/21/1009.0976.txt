We calculate asymmetric neutrino absorption and scattering cross sections on
hot and dense magnetized neutron-star matter including hyperons in fully
relativistic mean field theory. The absorption/scattering cross sections are
suppressed/enhanced incoherently in the direction of the magnetic fielld, B.
The asymmetry is 2-4% at the matter density \rho_0 < \rho_B < 3\rho_0 and
temperature T < 40 MeV for B=2 X 10^{17} G. This asymmetry is comparable to the
effects owing to parity violation or asymmetric magnetic field topology
proposed for the origin of pulsar kicks.
