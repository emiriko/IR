We discuss a new approach to reducing excited state contributions from two-
and three-point correlation functions in lattice simulations. For the purposes
of this talk, we focus on the Delta(1232) resonance and discuss how this new
method reduces excited state contamination from two-point functions and mention
how this will be applied to three-point functions to extract hadronic form
factors.
