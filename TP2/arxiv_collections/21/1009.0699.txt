We report on the molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) growth of high crystalline
quality LiMnAs. The introduction of a group-I alkali metal element Li with flux
comparable to fluxes of Mn and As has not caused any apparent damage to the MBE
system after as many as fifteen growth cycles performed on the system to date.
