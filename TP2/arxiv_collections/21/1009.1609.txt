We present results of a bright polarization-entangled photon source operating
at 1552 nm via type-II collinear degenerate spontaneous parametric
down-conversion in a periodically poled potassium titanyl phosphate crystal. We
report a conservative inferred pair generation rate of 123,000 pairs/s/mW into
collection modes. Minimization of spectral and spatial entanglement was
achieved by group velocity matching the pump, signal and idler modes and
through properly focusing the pump beam. By utilizing a pair of calcite beam
displacers, we are able to overlap photons from adjacent down-conversion
processes to obtain polarization-entanglement visibility of 94.7 +/- 1.1% with
accidentals subtracted.
