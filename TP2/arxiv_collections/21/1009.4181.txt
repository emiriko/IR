The phase diagram of the one-dimensional extended Hubbard model at
half-filling is investigated by a weak coupling renormalization group method
applicable beyond the usual continuum limit for the electron spectrum and
coupling constants. We analyze the influence of irrelevant momentum dependent
interactions on asymptotic properties of the correlation functions and the
nature of dominant phases for the lattice model under study.
