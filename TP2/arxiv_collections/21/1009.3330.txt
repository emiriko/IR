Though pulsars spin regularly, the differences between the observed and
predicted ToA (time of arrival), known as "timing noise", can still reach a few
milliseconds or more. We try to understand the noise in this paper. As proposed
by Xu & Qiao in 2001, both dipole radiation and particle emission would result
in pulsar braking. Accordingly, possible fluctuation of particle current flow
is suggested here to contribute significant ToA variation of pulsars. We find
that the particle emission fluctuation could lead to timing noise which can't
be eliminated in timing process, and that a longer period fluctuation would
arouse a stronger noise. The simulated timing noise profile and amplitude are
in accord with the observed timing behaviors on the timescale of years.
