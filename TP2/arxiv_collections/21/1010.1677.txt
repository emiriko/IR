We present the sub-mm/mm SED for a sample of eight young circumstellar disks
in the outer regions of the Orion Nebula Cluster. New observations were carried
out at 2.9 mm with the CARMA array and for one disk, 216-0939, at 3.3 and 6.8
mm with ATCA. By combining these new millimeter data with literature
measurements at sub-millimeter wavelengths we investigate grain growth and
measure the dust mass in protoplanetary disks in the Orion Nebula Cluster.
These data provide evidence for dust grain growth to at least millimeter-sizes
for the first time in a high-mass star forming region. The obtained range in
sub-mm/mm spectral index, namely 1.5-3.2, indicates that for disks in the
outskirts of the Orion Nebula Cluster (projected distance from the cluster
center between about 0.4 pc and 1.5 pc) grain growth to mm sizes occurs in the
same manner as disks in regions where only low-mass stars form. Finally, in our
sample three disks are more massive than about $0.05\,M_\odot$, confirming that
massive disks are present in the outer regions of the Orion Nebula.
