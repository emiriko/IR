One of the most essential but uncertain processes for producing cosmic-rays
(CRs) and their spectra is how accelerated particles escape into the
interstellar space. We propose that the CR electron spectra at >~TeV energy can
provide a direct probe of the CR escape complementary to the CR nuclei and
gamma-rays. We calculate the electron spectra from a young pulsar embedded in
the supernova remnant (SNR), like Vela, taking into account the
energy-dependent CR escape. SNRs would accelerate and hence confine particles
with energy up to 10^{15.5}eV. Only energetic particles can escape first, while
the lower energy particles are confined and released later. Then the observed
electron spectrum should have a low energy cutoff whose position marks the age
of the pulsar/SNR. The low energy cutoff is observable in the $\gtrsim {\rm
TeV}$ energy window, where other contaminating sources are expected to be few
due to the fast cooling of electrons. The spectrum looks similar to a dark
matter annihilation line if the low energy cutoff is close to the high energy
intrinsic or cooling break. The future experiments such as CALET and CTA are
capable of directly detecting the CR escape features toward revealing the
origin of CRs.
