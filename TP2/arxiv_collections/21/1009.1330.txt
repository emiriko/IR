Two distinct ferromagnetic phases of LaMn$_{0.5}$Co$_{0.5}$O$_{3}$ having
monoclinic structure with distinct physical properties have been studied. The
ferromagnetic ordering temperature $\textit{T}_{c}$ is found to be different
for both the phases. The origin of such contrasting characteristics is assigned
to the changes in the distance(s) and angle(s) between Mn - O - Co resulting
from distortions observed from neutron diffraction studies. Investigations on
the temperature dependent Raman spectroscopy provide evidence for such
structural characteristics, which affects the exchange interaction. The
difference in B-site ordering which is evident from the neutron diffraction is
also responsible for the difference in $\textit{T}_{c}$. Raman scattering
suggests the presence of spin-phonon coupling for both the phases around the
$\textit{T}_{c}$. Electrical transport properties of both the phases have been
investigated based on the lattice distortion.
