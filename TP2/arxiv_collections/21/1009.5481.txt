We shortly discuss results on the isospin dependence of the eta-prime
production cross section in nucleon-nucleon collisions, results of comparative
analysis of the invariant mass distributions for the pp-->pp eta-prime and
pp-->pp eta reactions, and we present the value of the total width of the
eta-prime meson as derived directly from the mass distribution measured with
the mass resolution of 0.3~MeV/c^2.
