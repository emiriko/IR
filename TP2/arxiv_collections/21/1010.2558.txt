This work investigates the impingement of a liquid microdroplet onto a glass
substrate at different temperatures. A finite-element model is applied to
simulate the transient fluid dynamics and heat transfer during the process.
Results for impingement under both isothermal and non-isothermal conditions are
presented for four liquids: isopropanol, water, dielectric fluid (FC-72) and
eutectic tin-lead solder (63Sn-37Pb). The objective of the work is to select
liquids for a combined numerical and experimental study involving a high
resolution, laser-based interfacial temperature measurement to measure
interfacial heat transfer during microdroplet deposition. Applications include
spray cooling, micro-manufacturing and coating processes, and electronics
packaging. The initial droplet diameter and impact velocity are 80 {\mu}m and 5
m/s, respectively. For isothermal impact, our simulations with water and
isopropanol show very good agreement with experiments. The magnitude and rates
of spreading for all four liquids are shown and compared. For non-isothermal
impacts, the transient drop and substrate temperatures are expressed in a
non-dimensional way. The influence of imperfect thermal contact at the
interface between the drop and the substrate is assessed for a realistic range
of interfacial Biot numbers. We discuss the coupled influence of interfacial
Biot numbers and hydrodynamics on the initiation of phase change.
