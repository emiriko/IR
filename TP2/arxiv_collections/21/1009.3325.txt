The channeling of the ion recoiling after a collision with a WIMP changes the
ionization signal in direct detection experiments, producing a larger signal
scintillation or ionization than otherwise expected. We give estimates of the
fraction of channeled recoiling ions in CsI crystals using analytic models
produced since the 1960's and 70's to describe channeling and blocking effects.
