We present low-resolution (R~850) spectra for 67 asymptotic giant branch
(AGB), horizontal branch and red giant branch (RGB) stars in the
low-metallicity globular cluster NGC 5466, taken with the VIRUS-P
integral-field spectrograph at the 2.7-m Harlan J. Smith telescope at McDonald
Observatory. Sixty-six stars are confirmed, and one rejected, as cluster
members based on radial velocity, which we measure to an accuracy of 16 km s-1
via template-matching techniques. CN and CH band strengths have been measured
for 29 RGB and AGB stars in NGC 5466, and the band strength indices measured
from VIRUS-P data show close agreement with those measured from Keck/LRIS
spectra previously taken of five of our target stars. We also determine carbon
abundances from comparisons with synthetic spectra. The RGB stars in our data
set cover a range in absolute V magnitude from +2 to -3, which permits us to
study the rate of carbon depletion on the giant branch as well as the point of
its onset. The data show a clear decline in carbon abundance with rising
luminosity above the luminosity function "bump" on the giant branch, and also a
subdued range in CN band strength, suggesting ongoing internal mixing in
individual stars but minor or no primordial star-to-star variation in
light-element abundances.
