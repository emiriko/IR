An inverse iterative algorithm for microwave imaging based on moment method
solution is presented here. The iterative scheme has been developed on
constrained optimization technique and is certain to converge. Different mesh
size for the model has been used here to overcome the Inverse Crime. The
synthetic data at the receivers is contaminated with different percentage of
noise. The ill-posedness of the problem is solved by Levenberg-Marquardt
method. The algorithm is applied to synthetic data and the reconstructed image
is then further enhanced through the Image enhancement technique
