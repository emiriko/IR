Quantum Optimal Control Theory (QOCT) provides the necessary tools to
theoretically design driving fields capable of controlling a quantum system
towards a given state or along a prescribed path in Hilbert space. This theory
must be complemented with a suitable model for describing the dynamics of the
quantum system. Here, we are concerned with many electron systems (atoms,
molecules, quantum dots, etc) irradiated with laser pulses. The full solution
of the many electron Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation is not feasible in general, and
therefore, if we aim to an ab initio description, a suitable choice is
time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT). In this work, we establish
the equations that combine TDDFT with QOCT, and demonstrate their numerical
feasibility with examples.
