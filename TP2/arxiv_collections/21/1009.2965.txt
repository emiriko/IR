We investigate angular and energy distributions of medium-induced gluon
emission off a quark-antiquark antenna in the framework of perturbative QCD as
an attempt toward understanding, from first principles, jet evolution inside
the quark-gluon plasma. In-medium color coherence between emitters, neglected
in all previous calculations, leads to a novel mechanism of soft-gluon
radiation. The structure of the corresponding spectrum, in contrast with known
medium-induced radiation, retains some properties of the vacuum case; in
particular, it exhibits a soft divergency. However, as opposed to the vacuum,
the collinear singularity is regulated by the pair opening angle, leading to a
strict angular separation between vacuum and medium-induced radiation, denoted
as antiangular ordering. We comment on the possible consequences of this new
contribution for jet observables in heavy-ion collisions.
