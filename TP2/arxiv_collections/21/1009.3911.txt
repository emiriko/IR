This paper proposes a method for deriving formal specifications of systems.
To accomplish this task we pass through a non trivial number of steps, concepts
and tools where the first one, the most important, is the concept of method
itself, since we realized that computer science has a proliferation of
languages but very few methods. We also propose the idea of Layered Fault
Tolerant Specification (LFTS) to make the method extensible to dependable
systems. The principle is layering the specification, for the sake of clarity,
in (at least) two different levels, the first one for the normal behavior and
the others (if more than one) for the abnormal. The abnormal behavior is
described in terms of an Error Injector (EI) which represents a model of the
erroneous interference coming from the environment. This structure has been
inspired by the notion of idealized fault tolerant component but the
combination of LFTS and EI using rely guarantee thinking to describe
interference can be considered one of the main contributions of this work. The
progress toward this method and the way to layer specifications has been made
experimenting on the Transportation and the Automotive Case Studies of the
DEPLOY project.
