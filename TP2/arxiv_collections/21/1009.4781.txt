The heating associated with the deposition of $\gamma$-rays in an accretion
disk is proposed as a mechanism to facilitate the transformation of a low mass
X-ray binary to the radio millisecond pulsar phase. The $\gamma$-ray emission
produced in the outer gap accelerator in the pulsar magnetosphere likely
irradiates the surrounding disk, resulting in its heating and to the possible
escape of matter from the system. We apply the model to PSR J1023+0038, which
has recently been discovered as a newly born rotation powered millisecond
pulsar. The predicted $\gamma$-ray luminosity $\sim 6 \times
10^{34}~\mathrm{erg~s^{-1}}$ can be sufficient to explain the disappearance of
the truncated disk existing during the 8~month$\sim 2$~yr period prior to the
2002 observations of J1023+0038 and the energy input required for the
anomalously bright optical emission of its companion star.
