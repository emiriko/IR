It is known that the number of different classical messages which can be
communicated with a single use of a classical channel with zero probability of
decoding error can sometimes be increased by using entanglement shared between
sender and receiver. It has been an open question to determine whether
entanglement can ever increase the zero-error communication rates achievable in
the limit of many channel uses. In this paper we show, by explicit examples,
that entanglement can indeed increase asymptotic zero-error capacity, even to
the extent that it is equal to the normal capacity of the channel.
Interestingly, our examples are based on the exceptional simple root systems E7
and E8.
