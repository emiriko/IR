We demonstrate magnetometry by detection of the spin state of high-density
nitrogen-vacancy ensembles in diamond using optical absorption at 1042 nm. With
this technique, measurement contrast, and collection efficiency can approach
unity, leading to an increase in magnetic sensitivity compared to the more
common method of collecting red fluorescence. Working at 75 K with a sensor
with effective volume $50 \times 50 \times 300$ microns^3, we project photon
shot-noise limited sensitivity of 5 pT in one second of acquisition and
bandwidth from dc to a few megahertz. Operation in a gradiometer configuration
yields a noise floor of 7 nTrms at ~110 Hz in one second of acquisition.
