We investigate the chemical composition and adhesion of chemical vapour
deposited thin-film alumina on TiC using and extending a recently proposed
nonequilibrium method of ab initio thermodynamics of deposition growth (AIT-DG)
[Rohrer J and Hyldgaard P 2010 Phys. Rev. B 82 045415]. A previous study of
this system [Rohrer J, Ruberto C and Hyldgaard P 2010 J. Phys.: Condens. Matter
22 015004] found that use of equilibrium thermodynamics leads to predictions of
a non-binding TiC/alumina interface, despite the industrial use as a
wear-resistant coating. This discrepancy between equilibrium theory and
experiment is resolved by the AIT-DG method which predicts interfaces with
strong adhesion. The AIT-DG method combines density functional theory
calculations, rate-equation modelling of the pressure evolution of the
deposition environment and thermochemical data. The AIT-DG method was
previously used to predict prevalent terminations of growing or as-deposited
surfaces of binary materials. Here we extent the method to predict surface and
interface compositions of growing or as-deposited thin films on a substrate and
find that inclusion of the nonequilibrium deposition environment has important
implications for the nature of buried interfaces.
