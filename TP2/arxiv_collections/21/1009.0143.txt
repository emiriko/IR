We exhibit a Probabilistic Cellular Automaton (PCA) on the integers with an
alphabet and a neighborhood of size 2 which is non-ergodic although it has a
unique invariant measure. This answers by the negative an old open question on
whether uniqueness of the invariant measure implies ergodicity for a PCA.
