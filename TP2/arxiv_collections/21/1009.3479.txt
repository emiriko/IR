In an incomplete continuous-time securities market with uncertainty generated
by Brownian motions, we derive closed-form solutions for the equilibrium
interest rate and market price of risk processes. The economy has a finite
number of heterogeneous exponential utility investors, who receive partially
unspanned income and can trade continuously on a finite time-interval in a
money market account and a single risky security. Besides establishing the
existence of an equilibrium, our main result shows that if the investors'
unspanned income has stochastic countercyclical volatility, the resulting
equilibrium can display both lower interest rates and higher risk premia
compared to the Pareto efficient equilibrium in an otherwise identical complete
market.
