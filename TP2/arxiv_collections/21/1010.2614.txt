The study of an extension of the standard model based on the flavor symmetry
A4 is presented. Neutrino Majorana mass terms arise from dimension five
operator and charged lepton masses from renormalizable Yukawa couplings. We
introduce three Higgs doublets that belong to one triplet irreducible
representation of A4. We study the most general A4-invariant scalar potential
and the phenomenological consequences of the model. We find that the reactor
angle could be as large as 0.03, while the atmospheric mixing angle is close to
maximal.
