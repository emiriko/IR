We introduce the quantum fractional Hadamard transform with continuous
variables. It is found that the corresponding quantum fractional Hadamard
operator can be decomposed into a single-mode fractional operator and two
single-mode squeezing operators. This is extended to the entangled case by
using the bipartite entangled state representation. The new transformation
presents more flexibility to represent signals in the fractional Hadamard
domain with extra freedom provided by an angle and two-squeezing parameters.
