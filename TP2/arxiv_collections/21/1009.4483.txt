Plans for the next generation of optical-infrared telescopes, the Extremely
Large Telescopes (ELTs), are well advanced. With primary apertures in excess of
20m, they will revolutionise our ground-based capabilities. In this review I
summarise the three current ELT projects, their instrumentation plans, and
discuss their science case and potential performance in the context of studies
of massive stars.
