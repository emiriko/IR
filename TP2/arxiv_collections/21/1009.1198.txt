We explore the geometrical structure of Liquid-gas (LG) mixed phase which is
relevant to nuclear matter in the crust region of compact stars or supernovae.
To get the equation of state (EOS) of the system, the Maxwell construction is
found to be applicable to symmetric nuclear matter, where protons and neutrons
behave simultaneously. For asymmetric nuclear matter, on the other hand, the
phase equilibrium can be obtained by fully solving the Gibbs conditions since
the components in the L and G phases are completely different. We also discuss
the effects of surface and the Coulomb interaction on the mixed phase.
