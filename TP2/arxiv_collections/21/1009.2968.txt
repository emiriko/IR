We studied the high temperature plasma in the direction of the Sculptor
supercluster at z=0.108 with Suzaku. Suzaku carried out four observations in
the supercluster: namely, A2811, A2811 offset, A2804, A2801 regions in 2005
Nov.--Dec., including the regions beyond the virial radii of these clusters.
The study needed precise background estimation because the measured intensity
of the redshifted lines, especially those from oxygen, were strongly affected
by the the Galactic emission. The spectra taken in the regions outside of the
virial radii of the member clusters were used as the background which included
both the Galactic and Cosmic X-ray Background (CXB) components. We also used
the background data which were taken near the Sculptor supercluster.
Temperature and metal abundance profiles were determined to the virial radii of
the member clusters, and then we searched for the oxygen line emission in the
region outside of the virial radii of the clusters. As a result, the
temperature of the clusters decreased toward the virial radii, and the spectral
fits for the filament region did not require extra component other than the
Galactic and CXB components. We constrained the intensities of O VII and O VIII
lines to be less than 8.1 and 5.1 photons cm^-2 s^-1 arcmin^-2, respectively,
as 2-sigma upper limits. The intensity of O VII indicates n_H < 1.6e-5 cm^-3
(Z/0.1 Z_solar)^-1/2 (L/25 Mpc)^-1/2, which corresponds to an over density,
delta < 60 (Z/0.1 Z_solar)^-1/2 (L/25 Mpc)^-1/2.
