Let X be a complex symplectic manifold. By showing that any Lagrangian
subvariety has a unique lift to a contactification, we associate to X a
triangulated category of regular holonomic microdifferential modules. If X is
compact, this is a Calabi-Yau category of complex dimension dim X+1. We further
show that regular holonomic microdifferential modules can be realized as
modules over a quantization algebroid canonically associated to X.
