In this paper we show that the skeleton diagrams in the m-Loop nPI effective
action correspond to an infinite resummation of perturbative diagrams which is
void of double counting at the m-Loop level. We also show that the variational
equations of motion produced by the n-Loop nPI effective theory are equivalent
to the Schwinger-Dyson equations, up to the order at which they are consistent
with the underlying symmetries of the original theory. We use a diagrammatic
technique to obtain the 5-Loop 5PI effective action for a scalar theory with
cubic and quartic interactions, and verify that the result satisfies these two
statements.
