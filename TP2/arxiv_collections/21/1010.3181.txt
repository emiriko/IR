We revisit $\bar{B}_s\to \pi K$, $\pi K^{\ast}$ and $\rho K$ decays within
QCDF formalism and examine the possible effects of a family non-universal
$Z^\prime$ boson in these decays. In our evaluations, the strong constraints
from $B_d-\bar{B_d}$ mixing on the strength of the left-handed flavor-changing
$d-b-Z^{\prime}$ coupling $B_{db}^{L}$ ~($\sim0.2\times10^{-3}$) is also
included. Numerically, we find that a new weak phase $\phi^L_d\sim-50^{\circ}$
involved in $B_{db}^{L}$, the negative combination of the $u-u-Z^{\prime}$ and
$d-d-Z^{\prime}$ couplings $P_{ud}^{R}$ and/or $D_{ud}^{L}$ with larger
absolute value are crucial to improve the agreement of ${\cal B}(\bar{B}_s\to
\pi^- K^+)$ between the SM prediction and the experimental measurement.
Generally, ${\cal B}(\bar{B}_s\to \pi^- K^+)$ could be reduced by about 18% at
most by $Z^{\prime}$ contributions. Moreover, combining with the recent updated
measurement on $\beta_s$ by CDF and D0 collaborations, we also find that
$Z^{\prime}$ effects in $\bar{B}_s\to \pi^- K^+$ decays are very important for
examining whether the CKM-like hierarchy persists in a family non-universal
$Z^{\prime}$ coupling matrix.
