Forster, Winkler, and Wolf recently showed that weak nonlocality can be
amplified by giving the first protocol that distills a class of nonlocal boxes
(NLBs) [Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 120401 (2009)]. We first show that their protocol
is optimal among all non-adaptive protocols. We next consider adaptive
protocols. We show that the depth 2 protocol of Allcock et al. [Phys. Rev. A
80, 062107, (2009)] performs better than previously known adaptive depth 2
protocols for all symmetric NLBs. We present a new depth 3 protocol that
extends the known region of distillable NLBs. We give examples of NLBs for
which each of Forster et al.'s, Allcock et al.'s, and our protocol performs
best. The new understanding we develop is that there is no single optimal
protocol for NLB distillation. The choice of which protocol to use depends on
the noise parameters for the NLB.
