The method of pulse-shape analysis (PSA) for particle identification (PID)
was applied to a double-sided silicon strip detector (DSSD) with a strip pitch
of 300 \{mu}m. We present the results of test measurements with particles from
the reactions of a 70 MeV 12C beam impinging on a mylar target. Good separation
between protons and alpha particles down to 3 MeV has been obtained when
excluding the interstrip events of the DSSD from the analysis.
