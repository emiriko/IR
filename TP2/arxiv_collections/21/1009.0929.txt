A target-oriented sequential pattern is a sequential pattern with a concerned
itemset in the end of pattern. A time-interval sequential pattern is a
sequential pattern with time-intervals between every pair of successive
itemsets. In this paper we present an algorithm to discover target-oriented
sequential pattern with time-intervals. To this end, the original sequences are
reversed so that the last itemsets can be arranged in front of the sequences.
The contrasts between reversed sequences and the concerned itemset are then
used to exclude the irrelevant sequences. Clustering analysis is used with
typical sequential pattern mining algorithm to extract the sequential patterns
with time-intervals between successive itemsets. Finally, the discovered
time-interval sequential patterns are reversed again to the original order for
searching the target patterns.
