A fast multichannel Stokes/Mueller polarimeter with no mechanically moving
parts has been designed to have close to optimal performance from 430-2000 nm
by applying a genetic algorithm. Stokes (Mueller) polarimeters are
characterized by their ability to analyze the full Stokes (Mueller) vector
(matrix) of the incident light. This ability is characterized by the condition
number, $\kappa$, which directly influences the measurement noise in
polarimetric measurements. Due to the spectral dependence of the retardance in
birefringent materials, it is not trivial to design a polarimeter using
dispersive components. We present here both a method to do this optimization
using a genetic algorithm, as well as simulation results. Our results include
fast, broad-band polarimeter designs for spectrographic use, based on 2 and 3
Ferroelectric Liquid Crystals, whose material properties are taken from
measured values. The results promise to reduce the measurement noise
significantly over previous designs, up to a factor of 4.5 for a Mueller
polarimeter, in addition to extending the spectral range.
