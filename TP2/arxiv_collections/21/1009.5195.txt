We theoretically investigate the spin dynamics of a heavy hole confined to an
unstrained III-V semiconductor quantum dot and interacting with a narrowed
nuclear-spin bath. We show that band hybridization leads to an exponential
decay of hole-spin superpositions due to hyperfine-mediated nuclear pair flips,
and that the accordant single-hole-spin decoherence time T2 can be tuned over
many orders of magnitude by changing external parameters. In particular, we
show that, under experimentally accessible conditions, it is possible to
suppress hyperfine-mediated nuclear-pair-flip processes so strongly that
hole-spin quantum dots may be operated beyond the `ultimate limitation' set by
the hyperfine interaction which is present in other spin-qubit candidate
systems.
