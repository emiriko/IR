Scattering of resonant radiation in a dense two-level medium is studied
theoretically with account for local field effects and renormalization of the
resonance frequency. Intrinsic optical bistability is viewed as switching
between different spectral patterns of fluorescent light controlled by the
incident field strength. Response spectra are calculated analytically for the
entire hysteresis loop of atomic excitation. The equations to describe the
non-linear interaction of an atomic ensemble with light are derived from the
Bogolubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon hierarchy for reduced single particle
density matrices of atoms and quantized field modes and their correlation
operators. The spectral power of scattered light with separated coherent and
incoherent constituents is obtained straightforwardly within the hierarchy. The
formula obtained for emission spectra can be used to distinguish between
possible mechanisms suggested to produce intrinsic bistability.
