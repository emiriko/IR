The relativistic six-quark equations including the $u$, $d$ quarks and
antiquarks are found. The nonstrange baryonia $B \bar B$ are constructed
without the mixing of the quarks and antiquarks. The relativistic six-quark
amplitudes of the baryonia are calculated. The poles of these amplitudes
determine the masses of baryonia. 15 masses of baryonia are predicted. The mass
of baryonium with the spin-parity $J^P=0^-$ $M=1835\, MeV$ is used as a fit.
