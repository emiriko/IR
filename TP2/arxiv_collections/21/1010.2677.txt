Properties of Random Overlap Structures (ROSt)'s constructed from the
Edwards-Anderson (EA) Spin Glass model on $\Z^d$ with periodic boundary
conditions are studied. ROSt's are $\N\times\N$ random matrices whose entries
are the overlaps of spin configurations sampled from the Gibbs measure. Since
the ROSt construction is the same for mean-field models (like the
Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model) as for short-range ones (like the EA model), the
setup is a good common ground to study the effect of dimensionality on the
properties of the Gibbs measure. In this spirit, it is shown, using translation
invariance, that the ROSt of the EA model possesses a local stability that is
stronger than stochastic stability, a property known to hold at almost all
temperatures in many spin glass models with Gaussian couplings. This fact is
used to prove stochastic stability for the EA spin glass at all temperatures
and for a wide range of coupling distributions. On the way, a theorem of Newman
and Stein about the pure state decomposition of the EA model is recovered and
extended.
