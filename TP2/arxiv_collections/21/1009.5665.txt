We observed the microlensing event MOA-2007-BLG-192 at high angular
resolution in JHKs with the NACO adaptive optics system on the VLT while the
object was still amplified by a factor 1.23 and then at baseline 18 months
later. We analyzed and calibrated the NACO photometry in the standard 2MASS
system in order to accurately constrain the source and the lens star fluxes. We
detect light from the host star of MOA-2007-BLG-192Lb, which significantly
reduces the uncertainties in its char- acteristics as compared to earlier
analyses. We find that MOA-2007-BLG-192L is most likely a very low mass late
type M-dwarf (0.084 [+0.015] [-0.012] M\odot) at a distance of 660 [+100] [-70]
pc orbited by a 3.2 [+5.2] [-1.8] M\oplus super-Earth at 0.66 [+0.51] [-0.22]
AU. We then discuss the properties of this cold planetary system.
