We consider the Ginzburg-Landau functional defined over a bounded and smooth
three dimensional domain. Supposing that the strength of the applied magnetic
field varies between the first and second critical fields, in such a way that
$H_{C_1}\ll H\ll H_{C_2}$, we estimate the ground state energy to leading order
as the Ginzburg-Landau parameter tends to infinity.
