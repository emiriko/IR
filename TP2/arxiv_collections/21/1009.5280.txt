This paper is devoted to study the energy problem in general relativity using
approximate Lie symmetry methods for differential equations. We evaluate
second-order approximate symmetries of the geodesic equations for the stringy
charged black hole solutions. It is concluded that energy must be re-scaled by
some factor in the second-order approximation.
