The famous Perona-Malik (P-M) equation which was at first introduced for
image restoration has been solved via various numerical methods. In this paper
we will solve it for the first time via applying a new numerical method called
the Variational Iteration Method (VIM) and the correspondent approximated
solutions will be obtained for the P-M equation with regards to relevant error
analysis. Through implementation of our algorithm we will access some effective
results which are deserved to be considered as worthy as the other solutions
issued by the other methods.
