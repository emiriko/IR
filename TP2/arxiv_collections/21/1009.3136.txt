We perform calculations for the binding energies and low-lying levels of
${}^{10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22}C$ nuclei starting from the chiral
$N3LO$ nucleon-nucleon potential within the framework of the Hybrid
Multideterminant scheme. The calculations are restricted to 4 major harmonic
oscillator shells, via the Lee-Suzuki renormalization scheme. The results are
compared with the experimental data.
