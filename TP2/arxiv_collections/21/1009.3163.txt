Andreev reflection at the interface between a half-metallic ferromagnet and a
spin-singlet superconductor is possible only if it is accompanied by a spin
flip. Here we calculate the Andreev reflection amplitudes for the case that the
spin flip originates from a spatially non-uniform magnetization direction in
the half metal. We calculate both the microscopic Andreev reflection amplitude
for a single reflection event and an effective Andreev reflection amplitude
describing the effect of multiple Andreev reflections in a ballistic thin film
geometry. It is shown that the angle and energy dependence of the Andreev
reflection amplitude strongly depends on the orientation of the gradient of the
magnetization with respect to the interface. Establishing a connection between
the scattering approach employed here and earlier work that employs the
quasiclassical formalism, we connect the symmetry properties of the Andreev
reflection amplitudes to the symmetry properties of the anomalous Green
function in the half metal.
