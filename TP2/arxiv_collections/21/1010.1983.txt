By using photon pairs created in parametric down conversion, we report on an
experiment, which demonstrates that measurement can recover the quantum
entanglement of two qubit system in a pure dephasing environment. The
concurrence of the final state with and without measurement are compared and
analyzed. Furthermore, we verify that recovered states can still violate Bell's
inequality, that is, to say, such recovered states exhibit nonlocality. In the
context of quantum entanglement, sudden death and rebirth provide clear
evidence, which verifies that entanglement dynamics of the system is sensitive
not only to its environment, but also on its initial state.
