We analyze uncertainties in the cosmic X-ray background measurements
performed by the INTEGRAL observatory. We find that the most important effect
limiting the accuracy of the measurements is related to the intrinsic
background variation in detectors. Taking into account all of the uncertainties
arising during the measurements we conclude that the X-ray background intensity
obtained in the INTEGRAL observations is compatible with the historic X-ray
background observations performed by the HEAO-1 satellite.
