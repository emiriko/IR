The aim of this paper is to construct many examples of rational surface
automorphisms with positive entropy by means of the concept of orbit data. We
show that if an orbit data satisfies some mild conditions, then there exists an
automorphism realizing the orbit data. Applying this result, we describe the
set of entropy values of the rational surface automorphisms in terms of Weyl
groups.
