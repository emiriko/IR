We construct a time-consistent sublinear expectation in the setting of
volatility uncertainty. This mapping extends Peng's G-expectation by allowing
the range of the volatility uncertainty to be stochastic. Our construction is
purely probabilistic and based on an optimal control formulation with
path-dependent control sets.
