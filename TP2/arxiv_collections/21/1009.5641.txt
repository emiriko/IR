ZnO nanoparticles with Wurtzite structure were prepared by chemical methods
at low temperature in aqueous solution. Nanoparticles are in the range from
about 10 to 30 nm. Ferromagnetic properties were observed from 2 K to room
temperature and above. Magnetization vs temperature, M(T) and isothermal
measurements M(H) were determined. The coercive field clearly shows
ferromagnetism above room temperature. The chemical synthesis, structural
defects in the bulk related to oxygen vacancies are the main factors for the
observed magnetic behavior.
