A polycrystalline graphene consists of perfect domains tilted at angle
{\alpha} to each other and separated by the grain boundaries (GB). These nearly
one-dimensional regions consist in turn of elementary topological defects,
5-pentagons and 7-heptagons, often paired up into 5-7 dislocations. Energy
G({\alpha}) of GB computed for all range 0<={\alpha}<=Pi/3, shows a slightly
asymmetric behavior, reaching ~5 eV/nm in the middle, where the 5's and 7's
qualitatively reorganize in transition from nearly armchair to zigzag
interfaces. Analysis shows that 2-dimensional nature permits the off-plane
relaxation, unavailable in 3-dimensional materials, qualitatively reducing the
energy of defects on one hand while forming stable 3D-landsapes on the other.
Interestingly, while the GB display small off-plane elevation, the random
distributions of 5's and 7's create roughness which scales inversely with
defect concentration, h ~ n^(-1/2)
