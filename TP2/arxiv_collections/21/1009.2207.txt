Increasing user engagement is constant challenge for Intelligent Tutoring
Systems researchers. A current trend in the ITS field is to increase engagement
of proven learning systems by integrating them within games, or adding in game
like components. Incorporating proven learning methods within a game based
environment is expected to add to the overall experience without detracting
from the original goals, however, the current study demonstrates two important
issues with regard to ITS design. First, effective designs from the physical
world do not always translate into the digital world. Second, games do not
necessarily improve engagement, and in some cases, they may have the opposite
effect. The current study discusses the development and a brief assessment of
MiBoard a multiplayer collaborative online board game designed to closely
emulate a previously developed physical board game, iSTART: The Board Game.
