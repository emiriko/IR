In this work we consider the issue of localization of antisymmetric tensor
fields of arbitrary rank in a D dimensional Space-time with a codimension two.
A string-like defect is used to simulate the membrane. The localization of
massless and massive fields is found. The mass spectrum is infinitely
degenerate for each mass level and this is solved by coupling the $q-$form to
fermions.
