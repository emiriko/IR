We provide analytical three-dimensional bright multi-soliton solutions to the
(3+1)-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation with time and space-dependent
potential, time-dependent nonlinearity, and gain/loss. The zigzag propagation
trace and the breathing behavior of solitons are observed. Different shapes of
bright solitons and fascinating interactions between two solitons can be
achieved with different parameters. The obtained results may raise the
possibility of relative experiments and potential applications.
