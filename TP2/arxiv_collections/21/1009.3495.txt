The existence of extremely wide binaries in the low-inclination component of
the Kuiper Belt provides a unique handle on the dynamical history of this
population. Some popular frameworks of the formation of the Kuiper Belt suggest
that planetesimals were moved there from lower semi-major axis orbits by
scattering encounters with Neptune. We test the effects such events would have
on binary systems, and find that wide binaries are efficiently destroyed by the
kinds of scattering events required to create the Kuiper Belt with this
mechanism. This indicates that a binary-bearing component of the cold Kuiper
Belt was emplaced through a gentler mechanism or was formed in situ.
