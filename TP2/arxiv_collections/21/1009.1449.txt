Adinkras are a graphical tool for studying off-shell representations of
supersymmetry. In this paper we efficiently classify the automorphism groups of
Adinkras relative to a set of local parameters. Using this, we classify
Adinkras according to their equivalence and isomorphism classes. We extend
previous results dealing with characterization of Adinkra degeneracy via matrix
products, and present algorithms for calculating the automorphism groups of
Adinkras and partitioning Adinkras into their isomorphism classes.
