This paper proposes a different interpretation on the renormalization program
of an interacting Klein-Gordon field in curved space-times. Rather than being
just another renormalization program we argue that it that it makes the QFT
ultraviolet-finite at its foundation. More precisely, we argue that
renormalization is a part of the foundation of QFT and that without it the
theory is mathematically ill-defined or at the very least incompletely
specified.
