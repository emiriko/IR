We report the arcsecond resolution SMA observations of the $^{12}$CO (2-1)
transition in the massive cluster forming region G10.6-0.4. In these
observations, the high velocity $^{12}$CO emission is resolved into individual
outflow systems, which have a typical size scale of a few arcseconds. These
molecular outflows are energetic, and are interacting with the ambient
molecular gas. By inspecting the shock signatures traced by CH$_{3}$OH, SiO,
and HCN emissions, we suggest that abundant star formation activities are
distributed over the entire 0.5 pc scale dense molecular envelope. The star
formation efficiency over one global free-fall timescale (of the 0.5 pc
molecular envelope, $\sim10^{5}$ years) is about a few percent. The total
energy feedback of these high velocity outflows is higher than 10$^{47}$ erg,
which is comparable to the total kinetic energy in the rotational motion of the
dense molecular envelope. From order-of-magnitude estimations, we suggest that
the energy injected from the protostellar outflows is capable of balancing the
turbulent energy dissipation. No high velocity bipolar molecular outflow
associated with the central OB cluster is directly detected, which can be due
to the photo-ionization.
