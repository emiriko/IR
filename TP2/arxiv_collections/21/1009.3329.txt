Sensors based on whispering gallery mode resonators can detect single
nanoparticles and even single molecules. Particles attaching to the resonator
induce a doublet in the transmission spectrum which provides a self-referenced
detection signal. However, in practice this spectral feature is often obscured
by the width of the resonance line which hides the doublet structure. This
happens particularly in liquid environments that reduce the effective Q factor
of the resonator. In this paper we demonstrate an interferometric set-up that
allows the direct detection of the hidden doublet and thus provides a pathway
for developing practical sensor applications.
