This paper motivates the need for a formalism for the modelling and analysis
of dynamic reconfiguration of dependable real-time systems. We present
requirements that the formalism must meet, and use these to evaluate well
established formalisms and two process algebras that we have been developing,
namely, Webpi and CCSdp. A simple case study is developed to illustrate the
modelling power of these two formalisms. The paper shows how Webpi and CCSdp
represent a significant step forward in modelling adaptive and dependable
real-time systems.
