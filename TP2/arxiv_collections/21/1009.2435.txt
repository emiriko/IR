We use an elliptic differential equation of Tzitzeica type to construct a
minimal Lagrangian surface in CH2 from the data of a compact hyperbolic Riemann
surface and a small holomorphic cubic differential. The minimal Lagrangian
surface is invariant under an SU(2,1) action of the fundamental group. We
further parameterise a neighborhood of the R-Fuchsian representations in the
representation space by pairs consisting of a point in Teichmuller space and a
small cubic differential. By constructing a fundamental domain, we show these
representations are complex-hyperbolic quasi-Fuchsian, thus recovering a result
of Guichard and Parker-Platis. Our proof involves using the Toda lattice
framework to construct an SU(2,1) frame corresponding to a minimal Lagrangian
surface. Then the equation of Tzitzeica type is an integrability condition. A
very similar equation to ours governs minimal surfaces in hyperbolic 3-space,
and our paper can be interpreted as an analog of the theory of minimal surfaces
in quasi-Fuchsian manifolds, as first studied by Uhlenbeck.
