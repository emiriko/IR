In addition to Anderson and Mott localization, intrinsic phase separation has
long been advocated as the third fundamental mechanism controlling the
doping-driven metal-insulator transitions. In electronic system, where charge
neutrality precludes global phase separation, it may lead to various
inhomogeneous states and dramaticahttp://arxiv.org/submit/215787/metadata arXiv
Submission metadatally affect transport. Here we theoretically predict the
precise experimental signatures of such phase-separation-driven metal-insulator
transitions. We show that anomalous transport is expected in an intermediate
regime around the transition, displaying very strong temperature and magnetic
field dependence, but very weak density dependence. Our predictions find
striking agreement with recent experiments on Mn-doped CdTe quantum wells, a
system where we identify the microscopic origin for intrinsic phase separation.
