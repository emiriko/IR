We show that a simplified two-band model describing toroidal magnetic order
in two-dimensional crystal is entirely equivalent to the well-known Haldane
model of a honeycomb lattice in periodic internal magnetic field with zero
total flux through the unit cell. Crystals with toroidal ordering can be
considered as real physical systems which should exhibit topologically
nontrivial state, predicted by Haldane, that is similar to the quantum Hall
effect regime without any external magnetic field. Analogous description is
formulated for quantum spin Hall effect without any spin-orbit interaction.
