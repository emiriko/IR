We introduce an approach to studying a driven qubit-oscillator system in the
ultrastrong coupling regime, where the ratio $g/\Omega$ between coupling
strength and oscillator frequency approaches unity or goes beyond, and
simultaneously for driving strengths much bigger than the qubit energy
splitting (extreme driving). Both qubit-oscillator coupling and external
driving lead to a dressing of the qubit tunneling matrix element of different
nature: the former can be used to suppress selectively certain oscillator modes
in the spectrum, while the latter can bring the qubit's dynamics to a
standstill at short times (coherent destruction of tunneling) even in the case
of ultrastrong coupling.
