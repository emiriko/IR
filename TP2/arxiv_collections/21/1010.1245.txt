We use numerical simulations to understand how random deviations from the
ideal spherical shape affect the ability of hard particles to form fcc
crystalline structures. Using a system of hard spheres as a reference, we
determine the fluid-solid coexistence pressures of both shape-polydisperse and
monodisperse systems of aspherical hard particles. We find that when particles
are sufficiently isotropic, the coexistence pressure can be predicted from a
linear relation involving the product of two simple geometric parameters
characterizing the asphericity of the particles. Finally, our results allow us
to gain direct insight into the crystallizability limits of these systems by
rationalizing empirical data obtained for analogous monodisperse systems.
