We analyze in detail the heating of bosonic atoms in an optical lattice due
to incoherent scattering of light from the lasers forming the lattice. Because
atoms scattered into higher bands do not thermalize on the timescale of typical
experiments, this process cannot be described by the total energy increase in
the system alone (which is determined by single-particle effects). The heating
instead involves an important interplay between the atomic physics of the
heating process and the many-body physics of the state. We characterize the
effects on many-body states for various system parameters, where we observe
important differences in the heating for strongly and weakly interacting
regimes, as well as a strong dependence on the sign of the laser detuning from
the excited atomic state. We compute heating rates and changes to
characteristic correlation functions based both on perturbation theory
calculations, and a time-dependent calculation of the dissipative many-body
dynamics. The latter is made possible for 1D systems by combining
time-dependent density matrix renormalization group (t-DMRG) methods with
quantum trajectory techniques.
