A gradient-holonomic approach for the Lax type integrability analysis of
differentialdiscrete dynamical systems is devised. The asymptotical solutions
to the related Lax equation are studied, the related gradient identity is
stated. The integrability of a discrete nonlinear Schredinger type dynamical
system is treated in detail.
