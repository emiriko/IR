Understanding the consequences of the gravitational interaction between a
star and a planet is fundamental to the study of exoplanets. The solution of
the two-body problem shows that the planet moves in an elliptical path around
the star and that each body moves in an ellipse about the common center of
mass. The basic properties of such a system are derived from first principles
and described in the context of detecting exoplanets.
