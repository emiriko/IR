The Particle Flow Analysis approach retained for the future ILC detectors
requires high granularity and compact particle energy deposition. A Glass
Resistive Plate Chamber based Semi-Digital calorimeter can offer both at a low
price for the hadronic section. This paper presents some recent developments
and results near test beam in the use of Glass Resistive Plate Chamber with
embedded front-end electronics to build a prototype based on this principle.
All the critical parameters such as the spatial and angular uniformity of the
response as well as the noise level have been measured on small chambers and
found to be appropriate. Small semi-conductive chambers allowing for high rates
and a large chamber have also been tested.
