We present a novel technique to determine the absolute inclination of single
stars using multi-wavelength sub-milliarcsecond astrometry. The technique
exploits the effect of gravity darkening, which causes a wavelength-dependent
astrometric displacement parallel to a star's projected rotation axis. We find
this effect is clearly detectable using SIM Lite for various giant stars and
rapid rotators, and present detailed models for multiple systems using the
REFLUX code. We also explore the multi-wavelength astrometric reflex motion
induced by spots on single stars. We find that it should be possible to
determine spot size, relative temperature, and some positional information for
both giant and nearby main-sequence stars utilizing multi-wavelength SIM Lite
data. This data will be extremely useful in stellar and exoplanet astrophysics,
as well as supporting the primary SIM Lite mission through proper
multi-wavelength calibration of the giant star astrometric reference frame, and
reduction of noise introduced by starspots when searching for extrasolar
planets.
