Entanglement of a 795 nm light polarization qubit and an atomic Rb spin wave
qubit for a storage time of 0.1 s is observed by measuring the violation of
Bell's inequality (S = 2.65 \pm 0.12). Long qubit storage times are achieved by
pinning the spin wave in a 1064 nm wavelength optical lattice, with a
magic-valued magnetic field superposed to eliminate lattice-induced dephasing.
Four-wave mixing in a cold Rb gas is employed to perform light qubit conversion
between near infra red (795 nm) and telecom (1367 nm) wavelengths, and after
propagation in a telecom fiber, to invert the conversion process. Observed Bell
inequality violation (S = 2.66 \pm 0.09), at 10 ms storage, confirms
preservation of memory/light entanglement through the two stages of light qubit
frequency conversion.
