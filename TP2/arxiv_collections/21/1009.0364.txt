Massive stars are inherently extreme objects, in terms of radiation, mass
loss, rotation, and sometimes also magnetic fields. Concentrating on a
(personally biased) subset of processes related to pulsations, rapid rotation
and its interplay with mass-loss, and the bi-stability mechanism, we will
discuss how active (and normal) OB stars can serve as appropriate laboratories
to provide further clues.
