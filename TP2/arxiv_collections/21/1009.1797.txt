In this paper we compare the performance of multi and single-mode
interferometry for the estimation of the phase of the complex visibility. We
provide a theoretical description of the interferometric signal which enables
to derive the phase error in presence of detector, photon and atmospheric
noises, for both multi and single-mode cases. We show that, despite the loss of
flux occurring when injecting the light in the single-mode component (i.e.
single-mode fibers, integrated optics), the spatial filtering properties of
such single-mode devices often enable higher performance than multimode
concepts. In the high flux regime speckle noise dominated, single-mode
interferometry is always more efficient, and its performance is significantly
better when the correction provided by adaptive optics becomes poor, by a
factor of 2 and more when the Strehl ratio is lower than 10%. In low light
level cases (detector noise regime), multimode interferometry reaches better
performance, yet the gain never exceeds 20%, which corresponds to the
percentage of photon loss due to the injection in the guides. Besides, we
demonstrate that single-mode interferometry is also more robust to the
turbulence in both cases of fringe tracking and phase referencing, at the
exception of narrow field of views (<1 arcsec).
