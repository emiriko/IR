In this paper, we introduce a class of spacetimes
$\left(\mathcal{M},g\right)$ which satisfy the vacuum Einstein equations and
dynamically approach a Schwarzschild solution of mass $M$, a class we shall
call \emph{ultimately Schwarzschildean spacetimes}. The approach is captured in
terms of boundedness and decay assumptions on appropriate spacetime-norms of
the Ricci-coefficients and spacetime curvature. Given such assumptions at the
level of $k$ derivatives of the Ricci-coefficients (and hence $k-1$ derivatives
of curvature), we prove boundedness and decay estimates for $k$ derivatives of
\emph{curvature}. The proof employs the framework of vectorfield multipliers
and commutators for the Bel-Robinson tensor, pioneered by
Christodoulou-Klainerman in the context of the stability of the Minkowski
space. We provide multiplier analogues capturing the essential decay mechanisms
(which have been identified previously for the scalar wave equation on black
hole backgrounds) for the Bianchi equations. In particular, a formulation of
the redshift-effect near the horizon is obtained. Morever, we identify a
certain hierarchy in the Bianchi equations, which leads to the control of
strongly $r$-weighted spacetime curvature-norms near infinity. This allows to
avoid the use the classical conformal Morawetz multiplier $K$, therby
generalizing recent work of Dafermos and Rodnianski in the context of the wave
equation. Finally, the proof requires a detailed understanding of the structure
of the error-terms in the interior. This is particularly intricate in view of
both the phenomenon of trapped orbits and the fact that, unlike in the
stability of Minkowski space, not all curvature components decay to zero.
