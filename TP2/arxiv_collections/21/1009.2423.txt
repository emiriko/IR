We present the elements of a new approach to the foundations of quantum
theory and probability theory which is based on the algebraic approach to
integration, information geometry, and maximum relative entropy methods. It
enables us to deal with conceptual and mathematical problems of quantum theory
without any appeal to frameworks of Hilbert spaces and measure spaces.
