This is the contribution to the proceedings of the MENU 2010 conference. The
recent work of Ref. [7] is summarized. Elastic piN scattering and the reaction
pi^+ p --> K^+ Sigma^+ are described simultaneously in a unitary
coupled-channels approach which respects analyticity. SU(3) flavor symmetry is
used to relate the t- and u- channel exchanges that drive the meson-baryon
interaction in the different channels. Angular distributions, polarizations,
and spin-rotation parameters are compared with available experimental data. The
pole structure of the amplitudes is extracted from the analytic continuation.
