Light propagation in distributed feedback optical structures with gain/loss
regions is shown to provide an accessible laboratory tool to visualize in
optics the spectral properties of the one-dimensional Dirac equation with
non-Hermitian interactions. Spectral singularities and PT symmetry breaking of
the Dirac Hamiltonian are shown to correspond to simple observable physical
quantities and related to well-known physical phenomena like resonance
narrowing and laser oscillation.
