The Galactic Black hole candidate XTE J1752-223 was observed during the decay
of its 2009 outburst with the Suzaku and XMM-Newton observatories. The observed
spectra are consistent with the source being in the ''intermediate`` and
''low-hard state`` respectively. The presence of a strong, relativistic iron
emission line is clearly detected in both observations and the line profiles
are found to be remarkably consistent and robust to a variety of continuum
models. This strongly points to the compact object in \j\ being a stellar-mass
black hole accretor and not a neutron star. Physically-motivated and
self-consistent reflection models for the Fe-\ka\ emission-line profile and
disk reflection spectrum rule out either a non-rotating, Schwarzchild black
hole or a maximally rotating, Kerr black hole at greater than 3sigma level of
confidence. Using a fully relativistic line function in which the black hole
spin parameter is a variable, we have formally constrained the spin parameter
to be $0.52\pm0.11 (1\sigma)$. Furthermore, we show that the source in the
low--hard state still requires an optically--thick disk component having a
luminosity which is consistent with the $L\propto T^4$ relation expected for a
thin disk extending down to the inner--most stable circular orbit. Our result
is in contrast to the prevailing paradigm that the disk is truncated in the
low-hard state.
