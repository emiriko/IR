We studied the effects of high-pressure on the crystalline structure of bulk
and nanocrystalline scheelite-type PbMoO4. We found that in both cases the
compressibility of the materials is highly non-isotropic, being the c-axis the
most compressible one. We also observed that the volume compressibility of
nanocrystals becomes higher that the bulk one at 5 GPa. In addition, at 10.7(8)
GPa we observed the onset of an structural phase transition in bulk PbMoO4. The
high-pressure phase has a monoclinic structure similar to M-fergusonite. The
transition is reversible and not volume change is detected between the low- and
high-pressure phases. No additional structural changes or evidence of
decomposition are found up to 21.1 GPa. In contrast nanocrystalline PbMoO4
remains in the scheelite structure at least up to 16.1 GPa. Finally, the
equation of state for bulk and nanocrystalline PbMoO4 are also determined.
