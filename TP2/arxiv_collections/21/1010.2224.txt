Spectropolarimetric observations of HD 155806 - the hottest Galactic Oe star
- were obtained with CFHT/ESPaDOnS to test the hypothesis that disk signatures
in its spectrum are due to magnetic channeling and confinement of its stellar
wind. We did not detect a dipole field of sufficient strength to confine the
wind, and could not confirm previous reports of a magnetic detection. It
appears that stellar magnetism is not responsible for producing the disk of HD
155806.
