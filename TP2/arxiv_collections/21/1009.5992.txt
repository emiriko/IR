The stellar initial mass function (IMF) describes the mass distribution of
stars at the time of their formation and is of fundamental importance for many
areas of astrophysics. The IMF is reasonably well constrained in the disk of
the Milky Way but we have very little direct information on the form of the IMF
in other galaxies and at earlier cosmic epochs. Here we investigate the stellar
mass function in elliptical galaxies by measuring the strength of the Na I
doublet and the Wing-Ford molecular FeH band in their spectra. These lines are
strong in stars with masses <0.3 Msun and weak or absent in all other types of
stars. We unambiguously detect both signatures, consistent with previous
studies that were based on data of lower signal-to-noise ratio. The direct
detection of the light of low mass stars implies that they are very abundant in
elliptical galaxies, making up >80% of the total number of stars and
contributing >60% of the total stellar mass. We infer that the IMF in massive
star-forming galaxies in the early Universe produced many more low mass stars
than the IMF in the Milky Way disk, and was probably slightly steeper than the
Salpeter form in the mass range 0.1 - 1 Msun.
