A goal of the IPHAS survey is to determine the frequency and nature of
emission-line sources in the Galactic plane. According to our selection
criteria, K 3-22 is a candidate symbiotic star, but it was previously
classified as a planetary nebula. To determine its nature, we acquired a
low-resolution optical spectrum of K 3-22. Our analysis of our spectroscopy
demonstrates that K 3-22 is indeed a D-type symbiotic star, because of its high
excitation nebular spectrum and the simultaneous presence of Raman-scattered O
VI emission at 6825 and 7082 angstrom, which is detected primarily in symbiotic
stars.
