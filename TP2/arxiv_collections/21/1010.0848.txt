The possibility of using squeezed states and balanced homodyne detection of
gravitational waves is discussed. It is shown that the quantum noise due to
high laser intensities in Michelson interferometer for gravitational waves
detection can be reduced by sending squeezed vacuum states to the 'dark' port
of the interferometer. The present analysis describes photon statistics
measurements effects related to quadrature balanced homodyne detection showing
the advantage of using this scheme for detecting gravitational waves.
