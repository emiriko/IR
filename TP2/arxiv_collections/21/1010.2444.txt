In this paper we prove the Geyer-Jarden conjecture on the torsion part of the
Mordell-Weil group for a large class of abelian varieties defined over finitely
generated fields of arbitrary characteristic. The class consists of all abelian
varieties with big monodromy, i.e., such that the image of Galois
representation on l-torsion points, for almost all primes l, contains the full
symplectic group.
