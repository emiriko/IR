The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) is a wide (20,000 sq.deg.) and
deep ugrizy imaging survey which will be sited at Cerro Pachon in Chile. A
major scientific goal of LSST is to constrain dark energy parameters via the
baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) signal. Crucial to this technique is the
measurement of well-understood photometric redshifts, derived from the survey
ugrizy imaging. Here we present the results of the effect of simulated
photometric redshift (PZ) errors on the reconstruction of the BAO signal. We
generate many "Monte Carlo" simulations of galaxies from a model power spectrum
using Fast Fourier Transform techniques. Mock galaxy properties are assigned
using an algorithm that reproduces observed luminosity-color-redshift
distributions from the GOODS survey. We also compare these results to those
expected from a possible future spectroscopic survey such as BigBOSS.
