Results of photometric and spectroscopic investigations of the recently
discovered disc cataclysmic variable star 1RXS J180834.7+101041 are presented.
Emission spectra of the system show broad double peaked hydrogen and helium
emission lines. Doppler maps for the hydrogen lines demonstrate strongly
non-uniform emissivity distribution in the disc, similar to that found in IP
Peg. It means that the system is a new cataclysmic variable with a spiral
density wave in the disc. Masses of the components (M_WD = 0.8 +/- 0.22 M_sun
and M_RD = 0.14 +/- 0.02 M_sun), and the orbit inclination (i = 78 +/- 1.5 deg)
were estimated using the various well-known relations for cataclysmic
variables.
