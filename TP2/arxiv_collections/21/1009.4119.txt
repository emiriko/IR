We present a generalization of the coordinate Bethe ansatz that allows us to
solve integrable open XXZ and ASEP models with non-diagonal boundary matrices,
provided their parameters obey some relations. These relations extend the ones
already known in the literature in the context of algebraic or functional Bethe
ansatz. The eigenvectors are represented as sums over cosets of the $BC_n$ Weyl
group.
