In experimental microwave maps, point-sources can strongly affect the
estimation of the power-spectrum and/or the test of Gaussianity of the Cosmic
Microwave Background (CMB) component. As a consequence, their removal from the
sky maps represents a critical step in the analysis of the CMB data. Before
removing a source, however, it is necessary to detect it and source extraction
consists of a delicate preliminary operation. In the literature, various
techniques have been presented to detect point-sources in the sky maps. The
most sophisticated ones exploit the multi-frequency nature of the observations
that is typical of the CMB experiments. These techniques have "optimal"
theoretical properties and, at least in principle, are capable of remarkable
performances. Actually, they are rather difficult to use and this deteriorates
the quality of the obtainable results. In this paper, we present a new
technique, the "weighted matched filter" (WMF), that is quite simple to use and
hence more robust in practical applications. Such technique shows particular
efficiency in the detection of sources whose spectra have a slope different
from zero. We apply this method to three Southern Hemisphere sky regions - each
with an area of 400 square degrees - of the seven years Wilkinson Microwave
Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) maps and compare the resulting sources with those of
the two seven-year WMAP point-sources catalogues. In these selected regions we
find seven additional sources not previously listed in WMAP catalogues and
discuss their most likely identification and spectral properties.
