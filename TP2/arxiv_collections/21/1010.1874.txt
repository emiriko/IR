Spin fluctuations and density fluctuations are studied for a two-component
gas of strongly interacting fermions along the BEC-BCS crossover. This is done
by in-situ imaging of dispersive speckle patterns. Compressibility and magnetic
susceptibility are determined from the measured fluctuations. This new
sensitive method easily resolves a tenfold suppression of spin fluctuations
below shot noise due to pairing, and can be applied to novel magnetic phases in
optical lattices.
