We consider new implicit-explicit (IMEX) Runge-Kutta methods for hyperbolic
systems of conservation laws with stiff relaxation terms. The explicit part is
treated by a strong-stability-preserving (SSP) scheme, and the implicit part is
treated by an L-stable diagonally implicit Runge-Kutta methods (DIRK). The
schemes proposed are asymptotic preserving (AP) in the zero relaxation limit.
High accuracy in space is obtained by Weighted Essentially Non Oscillatory
(WENO) reconstruction. After a description of the mathematical properties of
the schemes, several applications will be presented.
