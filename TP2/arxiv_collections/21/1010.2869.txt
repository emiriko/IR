A new QCD calculation of the mass of the nucleon is presented. It makes use
of a polynomial kernel in the dispersion integrals tailored to practically
eliminate the contribution of the unknown 1/2+ and 1/2- continuum. This
approach avoids the arbitrariness and other drawbacks attached to the Borel
kernel used in previous sum rules calculations. Our method yields stable
results for the nucleon mass and coupling for standard values of the
condensates. The prediction of the nucleon mass m_{N}=(0.945 \pm .045) GeV is
in good agreement with experiment.
