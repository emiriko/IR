The Kepler mission has detected transits and occultations of a hot compact
object around an early-type star, the Kepler Object of Interest KOI 74. The
mass of this transiting object was photometrically assessed in a previous study
using the presence of the relativistic beaming effect (so-called `Doppler
boosting') in the light curve. Our aim was to provide a spectroscopic
validation of this pioneering approach. We measured the radial velocity
variations of the A1V star KOI 74 with the SOPHIE spectrograph at the 1.93-m
telescope of the Observatoire de Haute-Provence (France). Radial velocity
measurements of this star are challenging because of the high level of stellar
pulsations and the few available spectral lines. Using a technique dedicated to
early-type main-sequence stars, we measured radial velocity variations
compatible with a companion of mass 0.252+/-0.025 Msun, in good agreement with
the value derived from the Kepler light curve. This work strengthens the
scenario suggesting that KOI 74 is a blue straggler orbited by a stellar core
despoiled of its envelope, the low-mass white dwarf KOI 74b.
