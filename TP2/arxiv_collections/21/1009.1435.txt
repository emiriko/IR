In this paper a convergent series expansion is constructed to solve the
prescribed mean curvature equation for n-dimensional hypersurfaces in n+1
dimensional Euclidean or Minkowskian space(time) which are graphs of a smooth
real function u, and whose mean curvature function H is not too large in
Hoelder norm, and integrable. Our approach is inspired by the
Maxwell-Born-Infeld theory of electromagnetism in Minkowski spacetime, for
which our method yields the first systematic way of explicitly computing the
electrostatic potential u for regular charge densities proportional to H and
small Born parameter.
