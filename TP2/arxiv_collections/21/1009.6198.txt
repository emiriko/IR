We discuss two lagrangian interacting dark energy models in the context of
the holographic principle. The potentials of the interacting fields are
constructed. The models are compared with CMB distance information, baryonic
acoustic oscilations, lookback time and the Constitution supernovae sample. For
both models the results are consistent with a non vanishing interaction between
dark sectors - with more than three standard deviations of confidence for one
of them. Moreover, in both cases, the sign of coupling is consistent with dark
energy decaying into dark matter, alleviating the coincidence problem.
