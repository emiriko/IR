We report the observation of positive magnetization on field cooling (PMFC)
in low applied magnetic fields (H < 100 Oe) in a single crystal of
Ca(3)Rh(4)Sn(13) near its superconducting transition temperature (T(c) approx
8.35 K). For 30 Oe < H < 100 Oe, the PMFC response crosses over to a
diamagnetic response as the temperature is lowered below 8 K. For 100 Oe < H <
300 Oe, the diamagnetic response undergoes an unexpected reversal in its field
dependence above a characteristic temperature (designated as T*(VL) = 7.9 K),
where the field-cooled cool-down magnetization curves intersect. The in-phase
and out-of-phase ac susceptibility data confirm the change in the
superconducting state across T*(VL). We ascribe the PMFC response to a
compression of magnetic flux caused by the nucleation of superconductivity at
the surface of the sample. In very low fields (H < 20 Oe), the PMFC response
has an interesting oscillatory behaviour which persists up to about 7 K. The
oscillatory nature underlines the interplay between competing responses
contributing to the magnetization signal in PMFC regime. We believe that the
(i) counterintuitive field dependence of the diamagnetic response for H > 100
Oe and above T*(VL) (lasting up to T(c), (ii) the oscillatory character in PMFC
response at low fields and (iii) the PMFC peaks near 8.2 K in 30 Oe <= H <= 100
Oe provide support in favour of a theoretical scenario based on the
Ginzburg-Landau equations. The scenario predicts the possibility of complex
magnetic fluctuations associated with transformation between different
metastable giant vortex states prior to transforming into the conventional
vortex state as the sample is cooled below T*(VL).
