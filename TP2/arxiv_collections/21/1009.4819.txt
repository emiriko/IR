The spin dynamics in a quantum wire with a Rashba spin orbit interaction
(SOI) is shown to be controllable via sub-picosecond electromagnetic pulses
shaped appropriately. If the light polarization vector is along the wire's
direction, the carriers experience a momentum boost while the phase coherence
in different spin channels is maintained, a fact exploitable to control the
speed of a photo-driven spin field effect transistor. A photon pulse with a
polarization vector perpendicular to the wire results in a spin precession
which is comparable to that due to the Rashba SOI and is tunable by the pulse
field parameters, an effect utilizable in optically controlled spintronics
devices.
