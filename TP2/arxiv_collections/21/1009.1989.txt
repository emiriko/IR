We report on single InGaAs quantum dots embedded in a lateral electric field
device. By applying a voltage we tune the neutral exciton transition into
resonance with the biexciton using the quantum confined Stark effect. The
results are compared to theoretical calculations of the relative energies of
exciton and biexciton. Cascaded decay from the manifold of single
exciton-biexciton states has been predicted to be a new concept to generate
entangled photon pairs on demand without the need to suppress the fine
structures splitting of the neutral exciton.
