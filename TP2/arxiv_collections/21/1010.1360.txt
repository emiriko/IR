The perturbative and nonperturbative renormalisation of quark-antiquark
operators in lattice QCD with two flavours of clover fermions is investigated
within the research programme of the QCDSF collaboration. Operators with up to
three derivatives are considered. The nonperturbative results based on the
RI-MOM scheme are compared with estimates from one- and two-loop lattice
perturbation theory.
