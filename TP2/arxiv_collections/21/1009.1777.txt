Future big surveys are going to provide many targets of rare compact binary
populations that will require photometric and spectroscopic follow-up to use
them to answer questions on the formation and evolution of compact binaries,
their space densities and the connection to other astrophysical phenomena such
as Supernovae Type Ia and the populations of gravitational wave emitters. Now
is the time to start preparing efficient follow-up strategies for upcoming
static and synoptic surveys. The proposal is to develop a standard photometer
that will facilitate a homogeneous multi-band follow-up strategy.
