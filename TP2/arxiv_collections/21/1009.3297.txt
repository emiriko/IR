We designed a two-day laboratory exploration of fundamental concepts in
digital images for an introductory engineering course at Maui Community
College. Our objective was for the students to understand spatial vs.
brightness resolution, standard file formats, image tradeoffs, and the
engineering design cycle. We used open investigation, question generation, and
an engineering design challenge to help our students achieve these learning
goals. We also experimented with incorporating Hawaiian language and cultural
awareness into our activity. We present our method, student response, and
reflections on the success of our design. The 2008 re-design of this activity
focused on better incorporating authentic engineering process skills, and on
using a rubric for summative assessment of the students' poster presentations.
