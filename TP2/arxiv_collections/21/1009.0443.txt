We analyze the recent paper by Wazwaz [Wazwaz A.M., M - component nonlinear
evolution equations: multiple soliton solutions, Phys. Scr. 81 (2010) 055004].
We demonstrate that author did not consider in essence the M - component
nonlinear evolution equations but he reduced the M - component equations to the
well - known Korteweg - de Vries equation, to modified Korteweg - de Vries
equation and to the Kadomtsev - Petviashvili equation. To find multiple soliton
solutions for these well - known equations author has used the Hirota method.
