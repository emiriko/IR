In the present analysis, thousand of events were simulated for the neutron
rich reaction of 54Xe131 + 54Xe131, at different impact parameters using hard
(HMD) and soft (SMD) momentum dependent equation of state. one can clearly see
more stopping in the presence of HMD. Production of LCP's and free particles
follows the same trend as stopping parameter R. This simply implies that the
fragment production can act as a global indicator for the nuclear stopping.
