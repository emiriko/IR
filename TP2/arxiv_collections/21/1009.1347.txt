The aim of this paper is to study the representation theory of quantum
Schubert cells. Let $\g$ be a simple complex Lie algebra. To each element $w$
of the Weyl group $W$ of $\g$, De Concini, Kac and Procesi have attached a
subalgebra $U_q[w]$ of the quantised enveloping algebra $U_q(\g)$. Recently,
Yakimov showed that these algebras can be interpreted as the quantum Schubert
cells on quantum flag manifolds. In this paper, we study the primitive ideals
of $U_q[w]$. More precisely, it follows from the Stratification Theorem of
Goodearl and Letzter that the primitive spectrum of $U_q[w]$ admits a
stratification indexed by those primes that are invariant under a natural torus
action. Moreover each stratum is homeomorphic to the spectrum of maximal ideals
of a torus. The main result of this paper gives an explicit formula for the
dimension of the stratum associated to a given torus-invariant prime.
