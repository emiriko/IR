We review the search for a mediator of high-Tc superconductivity focusing on
ARPES experiment. In case of HTSC cuprates, we summarize and discuss a
consistent view of electronic interactions that provides natural explanation of
both the origin of the pseudogap state and the mechanism for high temperature
superconductivity. Within this scenario, the spin-fluctuations play a decisive
role in formation of the fermionic excitation spectrum in the normal state and
are sufficient to explain the high transition temperatures to the
superconducting state while the pseudogap phenomenon is a consequence of a
Peierls-type intrinsic instability of electronic system to formation of an
incommensurate density wave. On the other hand, a similar analysis being
applied to the iron pnictides reveals especially strong electron-phonon
coupling that suggests important role of phonons for high-Tc superconductivity
in pnictides.
