The pseudogap state is one of the peculiarities of the cuprate high
temperature superconductors. Here we investigate its presence in
BaCo$_{x}$Fe$_{2-x}$As$_{2}$, a member of the pnictide family, with temperature
dependent scanning tunneling spectroscopy. We observe that for under, optimally
and overdoped systems the gap in the tunneling spectra always closes at the
bulk T$_{c}$, ruling out the presence of a pseudogap state. For the underdoped
case we observe superconducting gaps over large fields of view, setting a lower
limit of tens of nanometers on the length scale of possible phase separated
regions.
