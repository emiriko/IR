All-oxide magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) incorporating functional materials
as insulating barriers have the potential of becoming the founding technology
for novel multi-functional devices. We investigate, by first-principles density
functional theory, the bias-dependent transport properties of an all-oxide
SrRuO3/BaTiO3/SrRuO3 MTJ. This incorporates a BaTiO3 barrier which can be found
either in a non-ferroic or in a ferroelectric state. In such an MTJ not only
can the tunneling magnetoresistance reach enormous values, but also, for
certain voltages, its sign can be changed by altering the barrier electric
state. These findings pave the way for a new generation of
electrically-controlled magnetic sensors.
