Deep spectroscopy of the planetary nebula (PN) NGC\,6153 shows that its heavy
element abundances derived from optical recombination lines (ORLs) are ten
times higher than those derived from collisionally excited lines (CELs), and
points to the existence of H-deficient inclusions embedded in the diffuse
nebula. In this study, we have constructed chemically homogeneous and
bi-abundance three-dimensional photoionization models, using the Monte Carlo
photoionization code {\sc mocassin}. We attempt to reproduce the multi-waveband
spectroscopic and imaging observations of NGC\,6153, and investigate the nature
and origin of the postulated H-deficient inclusions, as well as their impacts
on the empirical nebular analyses assuming a uniform chemical composition. Our
results show that chemically homogeneous models yield small electron
temperature fluctuations and fail to reproduce the strengths of ORLs from C, N,
O and Ne ions. In contrast, bi-abundance models incorporating a small amount of
metal-rich inclusions ($\sim 1.3$ per cent of the total nebular mass) are able
to match all the observations within the measurement uncertainties. The
metal-rich clumps, cooled down to a very low temperature ($\sim 800$~K) by
ionic infrared fine-structure lines, dominate the emission of heavy element
ORLs, but contribute almost nil to the emission of most CELs. We find that the
abundances of C, N, O and Ne derived empirically from CELs, assuming a uniform
chemical composition, are about 30 per cent lower than the corresponding
average values of the whole nebula, including the contribution from the
H-deficient inclusions. Ironically, in the presence of H-deficient inclusions,
the traditional standard analysis of the optical helium recombination lines,
assuming a chemically homogeneous nebula, overestimates the helium abundance by
40 per cent.
