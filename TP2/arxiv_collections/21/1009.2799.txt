We study condensation in several particle systems related to the inclusion
process. For an asymmetric one-dimensional version with closed boundary
conditions and drift to the right, we show that all but a finite number of
particles condense on the right-most site. This is extended to a general result
for independent random variables with different tails, where condensation
occurs for the index (site) with the heaviest tail, generalizing also previous
results for zero-range processes. For inclusion processes with homogeneous
stationary measures we establish condensation in the limit of vanishing
diffusion strength in the dynamics, and give several details about how the
limit is approached for finite and infinite systems. Finally, we consider a
continuous model dual to the inclusion process, the so-called Brownian energy
process, and prove similar condensation results.
