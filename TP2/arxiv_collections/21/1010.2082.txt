A simple relativistic quantum hidden-variable theory of particle
trajectories, similar to the Bohm theory but without nonlocal forces between
the particles, is proposed. To provide compatibility with statistical
predictions of quantum mechanics one needs to assume the initial probability
density |psi|^2 of particle positions in spacetime, which is the only source of
nonlocality in the theory. This demonstrates that the usual Bohm
hidden-variable theory contains much more nonlocality than required by the Bell
theorem.
