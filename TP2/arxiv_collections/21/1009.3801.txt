Supersymmetric theories with gravitino dark matter generally do not allow the
high reheating temperature required by thermal leptogenesis without running
afoul of relic abundance or big bang nucleosynthesis constraints. We report on
a successful search for parameter space that does satisfy these requirements.
The main implication is the near degeneracy of the gluino with the other
neutralinos in the spectrum. The leading discovery channel at the LHC for this
scenario is through monojet plus missing energy events.
