I present results for top quark production in hadronic collisions at LHC and
Tevatron energies. The soft-gluon corrections to the differential cross section
are resummed at next-to-next-to-leading-logarithm (NNLL) accuracy via the
two-loop soft anomalous dimension matrices. Approximate
next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) differential and total cross sections are
calculated. Detailed theoretical predictions are shown for the t tbar cross
section and the top quark p_T distribution at the Tevatron and the LHC.
