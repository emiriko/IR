We study analytically the highly damped quasinormal modes of Kerr black holes
in the small angular momentum limit. To check the previous analytic
calculations in the literature, which use a combination of radial and tortoise
coordinates, we reproduce all the results using the radial coordinate only.
According to the earlier calculations, the real part of the highly damped
quasinormal mode frequency of Kerr black holes approaches zero in the limit
where the angular momentum goes to zero. This result is not consistent with the
Schwarzschild limit where the real part of the highly damped quasinormal mode
frequency is equal to c^3 ln(3)/(8 pi G M). In this paper, our calculations
suggest that the highly damped quasinormal modes of Kerr black holes in the
zero angular momentum limit make a continuous transition from the Kerr value to
the Schwarzschild value. We explore the nature of this transition using a
combination of analytical and numerical techniques. Finally, we calculate the
highly damped quasinormal modes of the extremal case in which the topology of
Stokes/anti-Stokes lines takes a different form.
