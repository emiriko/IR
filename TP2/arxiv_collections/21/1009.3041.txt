The problem of secret sharing over the Gaussian wiretap channel is
considered. A source and a destination intend to share secret information over
a Gaussian channel in the presence of a wiretapper who observes the
transmission through another Gaussian channel. Two constraints are imposed on
the source-to-destination channel; namely, the source can transmit only binary
phase shift keyed (BPSK) symbols, and symbol-by-symbol hard-decision
quantization is applied to the received symbols of the destination. An
error-free public channel is also available for the source and destination to
exchange messages in order to help the secret sharing process. The wiretapper
can perfectly observe all messages in the public channel. It is shown that a
secret sharing scheme that employs a random ensemble of regular low density
parity check (LDPC) codes can achieve the key capacity of the BPSK-constrained
Gaussian wiretap channel asymptotically with increasing block length. To
accommodate practical constraints of finite block length and limited decoding
complexity, fixed irregular LDPC codes are also designed to replace the regular
LDPC code ensemble in the proposed secret sharing scheme.
