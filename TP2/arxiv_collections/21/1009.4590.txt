Segmented display is widely used for efficient display of alphanumeric
characters. English numerals are displayed by 7 segment and 16 segment display.
The segment size is uniform in this two display architecture. Display
architecture using 8, 10, 11, 18 segments have been proposed for Bengali
numerals 0...9 yet no display architecture is designed using segments of
uniform size and uniform power consumption. In this paper we have proposed a
uniform 10 segment architecture for Bengali numerals. This segment architecture
uses segments of uniform size and no bent segment is used.
