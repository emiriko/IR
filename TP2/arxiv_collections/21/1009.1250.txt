We present spherically symmetric boson stars as black hole mimickers based on
the power spectrum of a simple accretion disk model. The free parameters of the
boson star are the mass of the boson and the fourth order self-interaction
coefficient in the scalar field potential. We show that even if the mass of the
boson is the only free parameter it is possible to find a configuration that
mimics the power spectrum of the disk due to a black hole of the same mass. We
also show that for each value of the self-interaction a single boson star
configuration can mimic a black hole at very different astrophysical scales in
terms of the mass of the object and the accretion rate. In order to show that
it is possible to distinguish one of our mimickers from a black hole we also
study the deflection of light.
