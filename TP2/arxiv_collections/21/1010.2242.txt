We present adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) hydrodynamical simulations of the
interaction between Type Ia supernovae and their companion stars within the
context of the single-degenerate model. Results for 3D red-giant companions
without binary evolution agree with previous 2D results by Marietta et al. We
also consider evolved helium-star companions in 2D. For a range of helium-star
masses and initial binary separations, we examine the mass unbound by the
interaction and the kick velocity delivered to the companion star. We find that
unbound mass versus separation obeys a power law with index between -3.1 and
-4.0, consistent with previous results for hydrogen-rich companions. Kick
velocity also obeys a power-law relationship with binary separation, but the
slope differs from those found for hydrogen-rich companions. Assuming accretion
via Roche-lobe overflow, we find that the unbound helium mass is consistent
with observational limits. Ablation (shock heating) appears to be more
important in removing gas from helium-star companions than from hydrogen-rich
ones, though stripping (momentum transfer) dominates in both cases.
