We propose a physically transparent analytic model of astrophysical S-factors
as a function of a center-of-mass energy E of colliding nuclei (below and above
the Coulomb barrier) for non-resonant fusion reactions. For any given reaction,
the S(E)-model contains four parameters [two of which approximate the barrier
potential, U(r)]. They are easily interpolated along many reactions involving
isotopes of the same elements; they give accurate practical expressions for
S(E) with only several input parameters for many reactions. The model
reproduces the suppression of S(E) at low energies (of astrophysical
importance) due to the shape of the low-r wing of U(r). The model can be used
to reconstruct U(r) from computed or measured S(E). For illustration, we
parameterize our recent calculations of S(E) (using the Sao Paulo potential and
the barrier penetration formalism) for 946 reactions involving stable and
unstable isotopes of C, O, Ne, and Mg (with 9 parameters for all reactions
involving many isotopes of the same elements, e.g., C+O). In addition, we
analyze astrophysically important 12C+12C reaction, compare theoretical models
with experimental data, and discuss the problem of interpolating reliably known
S(E) values to low energies (E <= 2-3 MeV).
