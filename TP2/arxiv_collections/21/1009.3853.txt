We study the decay properties of a heavy-light meson. We reformulate the
decay amplitudes for the heavy-light systems and find a new way to calculate
decay rates. Applying this formulation, we find a new sum rule for the
radiative decays of one heavy-light meson into another, $H_1\to H_2+\gamma$
with various combinations of $H_i$.
