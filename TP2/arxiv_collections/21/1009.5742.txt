The T-wave of an electrocardiogram (ECG) represents the ventricular
repolarization that is critical in restoration of the heart muscle to a
pre-contractile state prior to the next beat. Alterations in the T-wave reflect
various cardiac conditions; and links between abnormal (prolonged) ventricular
repolarization and malignant arrhythmias have been documented. Cardiac safety
testing prior to approval of any new drug currently relies on two points of the
ECG waveform: onset of the Q-wave and termination of the T-wave; and only a few
beats are measured. Using functional data analysis, a statistical approach
extracts a common shape for each subject (reference curve) from a sequence of
beats, and then models the deviation of each curve in the sequence from that
reference curve as a four-dimensional vector. The representation can be used to
distinguish differences between beats or to model shape changes in a subject's
T-wave over time. This model provides physically interpretable parameters
characterizing T-wave shape, and is robust to the determination of the endpoint
of the T-wave. Thus, this dimension reduction methodology offers the strong
potential for definition of more robust and more informative biomarkers of
cardiac abnormalities than the QT (or QT corrected) interval in current use.
