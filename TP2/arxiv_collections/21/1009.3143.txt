We study the nuclear effects in the neutrino\anti-neutrino-nucleon deep
inelastic scattering (DIS) by comparing the NuTeV, CDHSW, and CHORUS
cross-sections from Iron and Lead targets to the predictions derived from the
latest parton distribution functions (PDFs). The nuclear modifications found
seem to display agreement with those in charged lepton DIS. Our study thus
lends support to the consistency of employing neutrino data in global fits of
PDFs.
