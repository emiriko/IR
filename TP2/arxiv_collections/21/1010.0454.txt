This paper is the first in series of four papers that present an analytical
approach to war using game theory. We try to explore why is it that "true
peace" can't be achieved and all or any efforts we make towards that goal will
have huge road-blocks. A fairly simplistic and non technical overview of our
approach is given in this paper using prisoner's dilemma.
