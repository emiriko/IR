We study the motion of spinning test bodies in the de Sitter spacetime of
constant positive curvature. With the help of the 10 Killing vectors, we derive
the 4-momentum and the tensor of spin explicitly in terms of the spacetime
coordinates. However, in order to find the actual trajectories, one needs to
impose the so-called supplementary condition. We discuss the dynamics of
spinning test bodies for the cases of the Frenkel and Tulczyjew conditions.
