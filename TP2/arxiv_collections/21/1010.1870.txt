Using the negative binomial distribution (NBD) and the generalized
Glauber-Lachs (GGL) formula, we analyze the data on charged multiplicity
distributions with pseudo-rapidity cutoffs \eta_c at 0.9, 2.36, and 7 TeV by
ALICE Collaboration and at 0.2, 0.54, and 0.9 TeV by UA5 Collaboration. We
confirm that the KNO scaling holds among the multiplicity distributions with
\eta_c = 0.5 at \sqrt{s} = 0.2\sim2.36 TeV and estimate the energy dependence
of a parameter 1/k in NBD and parameters 1/k and \gamma (the ratio of the
average value of the coherent hadrons to that of the chaotic hadrons) in the
GGL formula. Using empirical formulae for the parameters 1/k and \gamma in the
GGL formula, we predict the multiplicity distributions with \eta_c = 0.5 at 7
and 14 TeV. Data on the 2nd order Bose-Einstein correlations (BEC) at 0.9 TeV
by ALICE Collaboration and 0.9 and 2.36 TeV by CMS Collaboration are also
analyzed based on the GGL formula. Prediction for the 3rd order BEC at 0.9 and
2.36 TeV are presented. Moreover, the information entropy is discussed.
