Results of hadron spectroscopy with two dynamical mass-degenerate chirally
improved quarks are presented. Three ensembles with pion masses of 322(5),
470(4) and 525(7) MeV, lattices of size 16^3 \times 32, and lattice spacings
close to 0.15 fm are investigated. We discuss the possible appearance of
scattering states, considering masses and eigenvectors. Partially quenched
results in the scalar channel suggest the presence of a 2-particle state,
however, in most channels we cannot identify them. Where available, we compare
to results from quenched simulations using the same action.
