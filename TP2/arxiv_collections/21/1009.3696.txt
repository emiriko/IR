The embedding of a $p$-brane into higher dimensional spacetime breaks not
only translational symmetries transverse to the worldvolume, but also Lorentz
symmetries. There exist formulations for $p$-brane actions which associate
Goldstone bosons with the generators of the broken Lorentz symmetries. These
Goldstone bosons are unphysical, in that they can be eliminated in favour of
other Goldstone bosons either via their equations of motion or via the
imposition of an inverse Higgs constraint. In this paper, we examine the
inter-relationship between the coset parameterization necessary to implement
the inverse Higgs constraint, the equivalence of the inverse Higgs constraint
to equations of motion, and the ability to find versions of the action with no
explicit dependence on the unphysical Goldstone bosons. This is evidence that
the unphysical Goldstone bosons are gauge degrees of freedom associated with an
enlarged isotropy group. In addition to $p$-brane actions, a number of other
cases, including conformally invariant dilaton actions, are shown to exhibit
the same structure.
