Details of the discovery of a new X-ray source, IGR J18462-0223, on October
12, 2007, during a short (several hours), intense (~ 35 mCrab at the peak)
outburst of hard radiation by the IBIS/ISGRI gamma-ray telescope onboard the
INTEGRAL observatory are given. The detection of another earlier outburst from
this source occurred on April 28, 2006, in the archival data of the telescope
is reported. We present the results of the source's localization and our
spectral/timing analysis of the observational data. The source may turn out to
be yet another representative of the continuously growing population of fast
X-ray transients, which are the focus of attention because of the
identification of their optical counterparts with early-type supergiants.
