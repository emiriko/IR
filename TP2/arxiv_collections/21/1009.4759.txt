Using the isospin-dependent quantum molecular dynamics model we study the
isospin effects on the disappearance of flow for the reactions of 58Ni+58Ni and
58Fe+58Fe as a function of impact parameter. We found good agreement between
our calculations and experimentally measured energy of vanishing flow at all
colliding geometries. Our calculations reproduce the experimental data within
5%(10%) at central (peripheral) colliding geometries.
