Neutron-rich isotopes in the sdpf space with Z < 15 require modifications to
derived effective interactions to agree with experimental data away from
stability. A quantitative justification is given for these modifications due to
the weakly bound nature of model space orbits via a procedure using realistic
radial wavefunctions and realistic NN interactions. The long tail of the radial
wavefunction for loosely bound single particle orbits causes a reduction in the
size of matrix elements involving those orbits, most notably for pairing matrix
elements, resulting in a more condensed level spacing in shell model
calculations. Example calculations are shown for 36Si and 38Si.
