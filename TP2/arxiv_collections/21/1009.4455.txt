Assume that for some $\alpha<1$ and for all nutural $n$ a set $F_n$ of at
most $2^{\alpha n}$ "forbidden" binary strings of length $n$ is fixed. Then
there exists an infinite binary sequence $\omega$ that does not have (long)
forbidden substrings. We prove this combinatorial statement by translating it
into a statement about Kolmogorov complexity and compare this proof with a
combinatorial one based on Laslo Lovasz local lemma. Then we construct an
almost periodic sequence with the same property (thus combines the results of
Levin and Muchnik-Semenov-Ushakov). Both the combinatorial proof and Kolmogorov
complexity argument can be generalized to the multidimensional case.
