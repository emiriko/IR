This paper focuses on a particular transmission scheme called local network
coding, which has been reported to provide significant performance gains in
practical wireless networks. The performance of this scheme strongly depends on
the network topology and thus on the locations of the wireless nodes. Also, it
has been shown previously that finding the encoding strategy, which achieves
maximum performance, requires complex calculations to be undertaken by the
wireless node in real-time.
  Both deterministic and random point pattern are explored and using the
Boolean connectivity model we provide upper bounds for the maximum coding
number, i.e., the number of packets that can be combined such that the
corresponding receivers are able to decode. For the models studied, this upper
bound is of order of $\sqrt{N}$, where $N$ denotes the (mean) number of
neighbors. Moreover, achievable coding numbers are provided for grid-like
networks. We also calculate the multiplicative constants that determine the
gain in case of a small network. Building on the above results, we provide an
analytic expression for the upper bound of the efficiency of local network
coding. The conveyed message is that it is favorable to reduce computational
complexity by relying only on small encoding numbers since the resulting
expected throughput loss is negligible.
