The observed suppression of high-$p_\perp$ hadrons allows different
explanations. We discuss two possible scenarios: In scenario 1, parton energy
loss from scattering in the hot medium is complemented by final state
interactions in the resonance matter. Scenario 2 has an enhanced transport
parameter $\hat q$ which is fitted to RHIC data. For LHC, the two scenarios
lead to very different predictions for the nuclear modification factor of
hadrons. In addition, jet reconstruction allows more specific tests of the
mechanisms responsible for jet quenching. We calculate the distribution of
partons inside a jet and find different results for the two scenarios.
