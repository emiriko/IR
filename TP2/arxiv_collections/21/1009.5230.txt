Monte Carlo simulations are used to compute the centrality dependence of the
participant eccentricities ($\epsilon_{n}$) in Au+Au collisions, for the two
primary models currently employed for eccentricity estimates -- the Glauber and
the factorized Kharzeev-Levin-Nardi (fKLN) models. They suggest specific
testable predictions for the magnitude and centrality dependence of the flow
coefficients $v_n$, respectively measured relative to the event planes
$\Psi_n$. They also indicate that the ratios of several of these coefficients
may provide an additional constraint for distinguishing between the models.
Such a constraint could be important for a more precise determination of the
specific viscosity of the matter produced in heavy ion collisions.
