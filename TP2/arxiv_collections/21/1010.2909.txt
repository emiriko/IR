Space-resolved X-ray diffraction measurements performed on gradient-etched
CuInGaSe2 (CIGS) solar cells provide information about stress and texture depth
profiles in the absorber layer. An important parameter for CIGS layer growth
dynamics, the absorber thickness-dependent stress in the molybdenum back
contact is analyzed. Texturing of grains and quality of the polycrystalline
absorber layer are correlated with the intentional composition gradients (band
gap grading). Band gap gradient is determined by space-resolved
photoluminescence measurements and correlated with composition and strain
profiles.
