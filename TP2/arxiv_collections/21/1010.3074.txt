We investigate the impact of singularities occurring at future times in
solutions of the Friedmann equations expressed in conformal coordinates. We
focus on the consequences of extending the time coordinate through the
singularity for the physics of matter and radiation occupying just one side.
Mostly this involves investigation of the relationship between the metric with
line element ds^2 = a^2(t) * (dt^2 - dx^2) and time reversal symmetry within
electrodynamics. It turns out compatibility between these two is possible only
if there is a singular physical event at the time of the singularity or if the
topology is not trivial. In both cases the singularity takes on the appearance
of a time-like mirror. We are able to demonstrate a relationship between the
broken time symmetry in electrodynamics characterized by retarded radiation and
radiation reaction and the absolute conformal time relative to the time of the
singularity, i.e. between the Electromagnetic and Cosmological arrows of time.
It is determined that the Wheeler-Feynman reasoning but with the future
absorber replaced by the Cosmological mirror leads to a conflict with
observation unless matter is electromagnetically strongly bound to the
environment.
