Perturbative O(alpha_s^2) corrections to BR(B -> Xs gamma) in the BLM
approximation receive contributions from two-, three- and four-body final
states. While all the two-body results are well established by now, the other
ones have remained incomplete for several years. Here, we calculate the last
contribution that has been missing to date, namely the one originating from
interference of the current-current and gluonic dipole operators
(K_18^{(2)beta_0} and K_{28}^{(2)beta_0}). Moreover, we confirm all the
previously known results for BLM corrections to the photon energy spectrum that
involve the current-current operators (e.g., K_{22}^{(2)beta_0} and
K_{27}^{(2)beta_0}). Finally, we also confirm the recent findings of Ferroglia
and Haisch on self-interference of the gluonic dipole operator
(K_{88}^{(2)beta_0}).
