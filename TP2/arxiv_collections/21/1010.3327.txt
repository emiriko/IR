Distributed order fractional Langevin-like equations are introduced and
applied to describe anomalous diffusion without unique diffusion or scaling
exponent. It is shown that these fractional Langevin equations of distributed
order can be used to model the kinetics of retarding subdiffusion whose scaling
exponent decreases with time, and the strongly anomalous ultraslow diffusion
with mean square displacement which varies asymptoically as a power of
logarithm of time.
