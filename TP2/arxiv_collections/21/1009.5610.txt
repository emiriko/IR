Aims. We present the results of our detailed spectroscopic and photometric
analysis of two previously unknown < 1 M{_\sun} detached eclipsing binaries:
ASAS J045304-0700.4 and ASAS J082552-1622.8.
  Methods. With the HIgh Resolution Echelle Spectrometer (HIRES) on the Keck-I
telescope, we obtained spectra of both objects covering large fractions of
orbits of the systems. We also obtained V and I band photometry with the 1.0-m
Elizabeth telescope of the South African Astronomical Observatory (SAAO). The
orbital and physical parameters of the systems were derived with the PHOEBE and
JKTEBOP codes. We investigated the evolutionary status of both binaries with
several sets of widely-used isochrones.
  Results. Our modelling indicates that (1) ASAS J045304-0700.4 is an old,
metal-poor, active system with component masses of M1 = 0.8452 \pm 0.0056
M$_\odot$, M2 = 0.8390 \pm 0.0056 M$_\odot$ and radii of R1 = 0.848 \pm 0.005
R$_\odot$ and R2 = 0.833 \pm 0.005 R$_\odot$, which places it at the end of the
Main Sequence evolution - a stage rarely observed for this type of stars. (2)
ASAS J082552-1622.8 is a metal-rich, active binary with component masses of M1
= 0.703 \pm 0.003 M$_\odot$, M2 = 0.687 \pm 0.003 M$_\odot$ and radii of R1 =
0.694(+0.007-0.011) R$_\odot$ and R2 = 0.699(+0.011-0.014) R$_\odot$. Both
systems show significant out-of-eclipse variations, probably owing to large,
cold spots. we also investigated the influence of a third light in the second
system.
