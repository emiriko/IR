In this work pair productions of charged and doubly charged scalars in the
framework of littlest Higgs model at $e^+e^-$ colliders are studied. In the
allowed parameter space of the littlest Higgs model, the production rates of
the scalar pairs are calculated. It is obtained that pair productions of
charged and doubly charged scalars are reachable at $e^+ e^-$ colliders with
energy $\sqrt{S}\geq 1.7TeV$. Using the lepton flavor violating decays of
charged scalars calculated in literature, final state analysis is done for pair
production processes. This analysis show that depending on the model
parameters, lepton number and lepton flavor violations can be observed free
from any backgrounds.
