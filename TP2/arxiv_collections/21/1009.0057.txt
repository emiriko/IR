The films with the discrete diamond-like-carbon nanoparticles were prepared
by the deposition of the carbon nanoparticle beam. Their morphologies were
imaged by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM).
The nanoparticles were found distributed on the silicon (100) substrate
discretely. The semisphere shapes of the nanoparticles were demonstrated by the
AFM line profile. EELS was measured and the sp3 ratio as high as 86% was found.
The field-induced electron emission of the as-prepared cascade (nanoDLC/ Si)
was tested and the current density of 1mA/cm2 was achieved at 10.2V/{\mu}m.
