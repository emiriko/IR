We study the existence of stable axially and spherically symmetric plasma
structures on the basis of the new nonlinear Schrodinger equation (NLSE)
accounting for nonlocal electron nonlinearities. The numerical solutions of
NLSE having the form of spatial solitions are obtained and their stability is
analyzed. We discuss the possible application of the obtained results to the
theoretical description of natural plasmoids in the atmosphere.
