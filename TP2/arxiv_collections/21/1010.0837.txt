The impurity Green's function Gf in the local non-Fermi liquid state is
evaluated by means of the continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo method extended
to the multichannel Anderson model. For N=M (where N and M are numbers of spin
components and channels, respectively), Gf is expressed as -Im Gf(w+i0) = c - b
|w|^{1/2}, and the zero-frequency value c depends only on N (=M). A
corresponding impurity self-energy at low frequencies is composed of two parts:
a resonance term related to c, and a non-Fermi liquid term proportional to
|w|^{1/2}. The characteristic energy scale is discussed in terms of the
non-Fermi liquid term in the self-energy.
