Cosmologists such Sakharov, Alfv\'en, Klein, Weizs\"acker, Gamow and Harrison
all disregarded the distribution of baryons and antibaryons immediately prior
to freeze-out in trying to elucidate the circumstances that explained hadron
distribution in the early universe. They simply accepted a uniform
distribution: each baryon paired with an antibaryon. Their acceptance of this
assumption resulted in theoretical difficulties that could not be overcome.
This essay discards this assumption of homogeneity or uniformity. Although this
essay does deal with early-universe matters, it is not meant to indicate any
involvement in energy distribution functions nor in any symmetry-asymmetry
controversies. Cluster formation is strictly geometric. This essay has value as
far as problems early cosmologists faced but also should complete the historic
record.
