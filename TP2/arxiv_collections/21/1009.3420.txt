This work originates from a heart's images tracking which is to generate an
apparent continuous motion, observable through intensity variation from one
starting image to an ending one both supposed segmented. Given two images p0
and p1, we calculate an evolution process p(t, \cdot) which transports p0 to p1
by using the optimal extended optical flow. In this paper we propose an
algorithm based on a fixed point formulation and a time-space least squares
formulation of the mass conservation equation for computing the optimal mass
transport problem. The strategy is implemented in a 2D case and numerical
results are presented with a first order Lagrange finite element, showing the
efficiency of the proposed strategy.
