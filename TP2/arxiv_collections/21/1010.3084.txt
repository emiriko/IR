A large number of insect species feed primarily on a fluid diet. To do so,
they must overcome the numerous challenges that arise in the design of
high-efficiency, miniature pumps. Although the morphology of insect feeding
structures has been described for decades, their dynamics remain largely
unknown even in the most well studied species (e.g. fruit fly). Here, in the
fluid dynamics video, we demonstrate in-vivo imaging and microsurgery to
elucidate the design principles of feeding structures of the common house fly.
Using high-resolution X-ray absorption microscopy, we record in-vivo flow of
sucrose solutions through the body over many hours during fly feeding.
Borrowing from microsurgery techniques common in neurophysiology, we are able
to perturb the pump to a stall position and thus evaluate function under load
conditions. Furthermore, fluid viscosity-dependent feedback is observed for
optimal pump performance. As the gut of the fly starts to fill up, feedback
from the stretch receptors in the cuticle dictates the effective flow rate.
Finally, via comparative analysis between the housefly, blow fly, fruit fly and
bumble bees, we highlight the common design principles and the role of
interfacial phenomena in feeding.
