Let G be a reductive group; in this note we give an interpretation of the
dynamical Weyl group of of the Langlands dual group $\check{G}$ defined by
Etingof and Varchenko in terms of the geometry of the affine Grassmannian Gr of
G. In this interpretation the dynamical parameters of Etingof and Varchenko
correspond to equivariant parameters with respect to certain natural torus
acting on Gr. We also present a conjectural generalization of our results to
the case of affine Kac-Moody groups.
