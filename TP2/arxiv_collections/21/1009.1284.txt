We study the asymptotic entanglement of three identical qubits under the
action of a Markovian open system dynamics that does not distinguish them. We
show that by adding a completely depolarized qubit to a special class of two
qubit states, by letting them reach the asymptotic state and by finally
eliminating the added qubit, can provide more entanglement than by direct
immersion of the two qubits within the same environment.
