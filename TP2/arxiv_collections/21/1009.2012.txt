A possibility to produce bound states of several heavy fermions, which are
bound together due to the Higgs exchange, is examined. It is shown that for 12
fermions, 6 fermions and 6 antifermions, occupying the lowest S_{1/2} shell
this bound state cannot exist if the fermion mass is below the critical value,
which depends on the Higgs mass and is found to be restricted to 320 < m_{cr} <
410 Gev/c^2 for the Higgs mass in the interval 100 < m_{H}< 200 Gev/c^2. This
estimate is derived in the relativistic mean field approximation. The
corrections are estimated to be not able to reduce significantly the critical
value for the fermion mass. Consequently there exist no bound state for 12 top
quarks, and the only feasible hope to observe a bag of 12 fermions
experimentally should rely on possible existence of heavy fermions of the next,
fourth generations.
