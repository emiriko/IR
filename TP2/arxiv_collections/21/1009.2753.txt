New statistical method is proposed to coherently combine Baryon Acoustic
Oscillation statistics (BAO) and peculiar velocity measurements exploiting
decomposed density-density and velocity-velocity spectra in real space from the
observed redshift distortions in redshift space, 1) to achieve stronger dark
energy constraints, \sigma(w)=0.06 and \sigma(w_a)=0.20, which are enhanced
from BAO or velocity measurements alone, and 2) to cross-check consistency of
dark energy constraints from two different approaches; BAO as geometrical
measurements and peculiar velocity as large scale structure formation
observables. In addition to those advantages, as power spectra decomposition
procedure is free from uncertainty of galaxy bias, this simultaneous fitting is
an optimal method to extract cosmological parameters without any pre-assumption
about galaxy bias.
