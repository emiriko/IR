We have analytically solved the LO pQCD singlet DGLAP equations using Laplace
transform techniques. Newly-developed highly accurate numerical inverse Laplace
transform algorithms allow us to write fully decoupled solutions for the
singlet structure function F_s(x,Q^2)and G(x,Q^2) as F_s(x,Q^2)={\cal
F}_s(F_{s0}(x), G_0(x)) and G(x,Q^2)={\cal G}(F_{s0}(x), G_0(x)). Here {\cal
F}_s and \cal G are known functions of the initial boundary conditions
F_{s0}(x) = F_s(x,Q_0^2) and G_{0}(x) = G(x,Q_0^2), i.e., the chosen starting
functions at the virtuality Q_0^2. For both G and F_s, we are able to either
devolve or evolve each separately and rapidly, with very high numerical
accuracy, a computational fractional precision of O(10^{-9}). Armed with this
powerful new tool in the pQCD arsenal, we compare our numerical results from
the above equations with the published MSTW2008 and CTEQ6L LO gluon and singlet
F_s distributions, starting from their initial values at Q_0^2=1 GeV^2 and 1.69
GeV^2, respectively, using their choices of \alpha_s(Q^2). This allows an
important independent check on the accuracies of their evolution codes and
therefore the computational accuracies of their published parton distributions.
Our method completely decouples the two LO distributions, at the same time
guaranteeing that both G and F_s satisfy the singlet coupled DGLAP equations.
It also allows one to easily obtain the effects of the starting functions on
the evolved gluon and singlet structure functions, as functions of both Q^2 and
Q_0^2, being equally accurate in devolution as in evolution. Further, it can
also be used for non-singlet distributions, thus giving LO analytic solutions
for individual quark and gluon distributions at a given x and Q^2, rather than
the numerical solutions of the coupled integral-differential equations on a
large, but fixed, two-dimensional grid that are currently available.
