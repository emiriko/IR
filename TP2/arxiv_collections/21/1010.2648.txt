With this note we would like to draw attention to a possible novel signal of
new physics in dijet data at the hadron colliders. Usually it is accepted that
all exotic models predict that these two jets populate the central
(pseudo)rapidity region where y_{1,2} ~ 0. Contrary, the excited bosons do not
contribute into this region, but produce an excess of dijet events over the
almost flat QCD background in chi = exp|y_1-y_2| away from this region.
