We slightly extend the fluctuation theorem obtained in \cite{LS} for sums of
generators, considering continuous-time Markov chains on a finite state space
whose underlying graph has multiple edges and no loop. This extended frame is
suited when analyzing chemical systems. As simple corollary we derive in a
different method the fluctuation theorem of D. Andrieux and P. Gaspard for the
fluxes along the chords associated to a fundamental set of oriented cycles
\cite{AG2}.
  We associate to each random trajectory an oriented cycle on the graph and we
decompose it in terms of a basis of oriented cycles. We prove a fluctuation
theorem for the coefficients in this decomposition. The resulting fluctuation
theorem involves the cycle affinities, which in many real systems correspond to
the macroscopic forces. In addition, the above decomposition is useful when
analyzing the large deviations of additive functionals of the Markov chain. As
example of application, in a very general context we derive a fluctuation
relation for the mechanical and chemical currents of a molecular motor moving
along a periodic filament.
