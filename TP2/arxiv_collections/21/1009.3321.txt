Patterns of word use both reflect and influence a myriad of human activities
and interactions. Like other entities that are reproduced and evolve, words
rise or decline depending upon a complex interplay between {their intrinsic
properties and the environments in which they function}. Using Internet
discussion communities as model systems, we define the concept of a word niche
as the relationship between the word and the characteristic features of the
environments in which it is used. We develop a method to quantify two important
aspects of the size of the word niche: the range of individuals using the word
and the range of topics it is used to discuss. Controlling for word frequency,
we show that these aspects of the word niche are strong determinants of changes
in word frequency. Previous studies have already indicated that word frequency
itself is a correlate of word success at historical time scales. Our analysis
of changes in word frequencies over time reveals that the relative sizes of
word niches are far more important than word frequencies in the dynamics of the
entire vocabulary at shorter time scales, as the language adapts to new
concepts and social groupings. We also distinguish endogenous versus exogenous
factors as additional contributors to the fates of words, and demonstrate the
force of this distinction in the rise of novel words. Our results indicate that
short-term nonstationarity in word statistics is strongly driven by individual
proclivities, including inclinations to provide novel information and to
project a distinctive social identity.
