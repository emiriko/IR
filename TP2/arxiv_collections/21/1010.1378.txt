We give a new approach to the construction of derived equivalences between
blocks of finite groups, based on perverse equivalences, in the setting of
Brou\'e's conjecture. We provide in particular local and global perversity data
describing the principal blocks and the derived equivalences for a number of
finite simple groups with Sylow subgroups C3xC3. We also examine extensions to
automorphism groups in a general setting.
