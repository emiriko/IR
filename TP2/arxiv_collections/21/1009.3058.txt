We model the classical transmission of a massless scalar field from a source
to a detector on a background causal set. The predictions do not differ
significantly from those of the continuum. Thus, introducing an intrinsic
inexactitude to lengths and durations - or more specifically, replacing the
Lorentzian manifold with an underlying discrete structure - need not disrupt
the usual dynamics of propagation.
