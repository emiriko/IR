The energy-momentum conservation laws for general reduced-fluid (e.g.,
gyrofluid) models are derived by Noether method from a general reduced
variational principle. The reduced canonical energy-momentum tensor (which is
explicitly asymmetric and has the Minkowski form) exhibits polarization and
magnetization effects associated with dynamical reduction. In particular, the
asymmetry in the reduced canonical momentum-stress tensor produces a
non-vanishing reduced intrinsic torque that can drive spontaneous toroidal
rotation in axisymmetric tokamak plasmas.
