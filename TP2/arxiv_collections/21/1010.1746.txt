XML has emerged as the standard for representing and exchanging data on the
World Wide Web. It is critical to have efficient mechanisms to store and query
XML data to exploit the full power of this new technology. Several researchers
have proposed to use relational databases to store and query XML data. While
several algorithms of schema mapping and query mapping have been proposed, the
problem of mapping XML data to relational data, i.e., mapping an XML INSERT
statement to a sequence of SQL INSERT statements, has not been addressed
thoroughly in the literature. In this paper, we propose an efficient linear
algorithm for mapping XML data to relational data. This algorithm is based on
our previous proposed inlining algorithm for mapping DTDs to relational schemas
and can be easily adapted to other inlining algorithms.
