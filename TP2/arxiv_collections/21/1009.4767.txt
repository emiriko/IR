The study of monoclonal antibodies (MAb) is a field of great interest to
science medicine, for example, anti-TNF agents (infliximab and adalimumab)
represent an important tool for the management of autoimmune and inflammatory
disorders. In this work we focus on the physical description of the transport
kinetics of MAb in a fluid with laminar flow and parabolic profile. To simulate
the kinetics of the MAb, standard equations were solved numerically (using The
Verlet algorithm) to calculate the motion of a particle with a spherically
symmetric inside of parabolic laminar flow, in order to find the time evolution
of the antibody velocity in blood plasma in function of the increase of the
radius, mass and density of the MAb, and the fluid pressure in blood vessels.
In the case of we fixed the value of the antibody density, their kinetics
increased when the pressure in the vessels increased. When we fixed the
pressure in the vessels we found: if we reduce the antibody radius their
kinetics increased, and when we increase antibody density we found that their
kinetics also increased.
