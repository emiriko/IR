In this work we present two correspondences between the massless Gross-Neveu
model with one or two coupling constants in 1+1 dimensions and nonrelativistic
field theories in 3+1 dimensions. It is shown that on a mean-field level the
massless Gross-Neveu model can be mapped onto BCS theory provided that
translational invariance of the condensate is assumed. The generalized massless
Gross-Neveu model with two coupling constants is mapped onto a quasi
one-dimensional extended Hubbard model used in the description of spin-Peierls
systems. It is shown that the particle hole symmetry of the Hubbard model
implies self-consistency of the condensate. The dimensional reduction allows an
identification of the phase diagrams of the models.
