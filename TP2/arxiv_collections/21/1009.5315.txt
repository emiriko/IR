This paper studies foot bone geometrical shape and its mass distribution and
establishes an assessment method of bone strength. Using spiral CT scanning,
with an accuracy of sub-millimeter, we analyze the data of 384 pieces of foot
bones in vivo and investigate the relationship between the bone's external
shape and internal structure. This analysis is explored on the bases of the
bone's center of mass and its centroid of shape. We observe the phenomenon of
superposition of center of mass and centroid of shape fairly precisely,
indicating a possible appearance of biomechanical organism. We investigate two
aspects of the geometrical shape, (i) distance between compact bone's centroid
of shape and that of the bone and (ii) the mean radius of the same density bone
issue relative to the bone's centroid of shape. These quantities are used to
interpret the influence of different physical exercises imposed on bone
strength, thereby contributing to an alternate assessment technique to bone
strength.
