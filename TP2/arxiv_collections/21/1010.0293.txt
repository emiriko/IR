Most of the current theories on the p-wave superfluid in cold atomic gases
are based on the effective-range theory for the two-body scattering, where the
low energy p-wave scattering amplitude $f_1(k)$ is given by $%
f_1(k)=-1/[ik+1/(\mathcal{V}k^2)+1/\mathcal{R}]$, where $k$ is the incident
momentum, and $\mathcal{V}$ and $\mathcal{R}$ are the $k$-independent
scattering volume and effective-range, respectively. However, due to the
long-range nature of the van der Waals interaction between two colliding
ultracold atoms, the p-wave scattering amplitude of the two atoms is not
described by the effective-range theory. In this paper we provide an explicit
calculation for the p-wave scattering of two ultracold atoms near the p-wave
magnetic Feshbach resonance (PMFR). We show that the low energy p-wave
scattering amplitude in the presence of PMFR takes the form
$f_1(k)=-1/[ik+1/(\mathcal{V}^{\mathrm{eff}}k^2)+1/(\mathcal{S}^{\mathrm{eff}%}k)+1/\mathcal{R}^{\mathrm{eff}}]$
where $\mathcal{V}^{\mathrm{eff}},$ $% \mathcal{S}^{\mathrm{eff}}$ and
$\mathcal{R}^{\mathrm{eff}}$ are $k$% -dependent parameters. Based on this
result, we show sufficient conditions for the effective range theory to be a
good approximation of the exact scattering amplitude. Using these conditions we
show that the effective-range theory is a good approximation for the p-wave
scattering in the ultracold gases of $^{6}$Li and $^{40}$K when the scattering
volume is enhanced by the resonance.
