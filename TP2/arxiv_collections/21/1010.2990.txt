In this work we study the properties of a relativistic mixture of two
non-reacting species in thermal local equilibrium. We use the full Boltzmann
equation (BE) to find the general balance equations. Following conventional
ideas in kinetic theory, we use the concept of chaotic velocity. This is a
novel approach to the problem. The resulting equations will be the starting
point of the calculation exhibiting the correct thermodynamic forces and the
corresponding fluxes; these results will be published elsewhere.
