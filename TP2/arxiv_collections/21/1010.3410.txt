Hom-Novikov-Poisson algebras, which are twisted generalizations of
Novikov-Poisson algebras, are studied. Hom-Novikov-Poisson algebras are shown
to be closed under tensor products and several kinds of twistings. Necessary
and sufficient conditions are given under which Hom-Novikov-Poisson algebras
give rise to Hom-Poisson algebras.
