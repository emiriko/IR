We consider the classical superintegrable Hamiltonian system given by
$H=T+U={p^2}/{2(1+\lambda q^2)}+{{\omega}^2 q^2}/{2(1+\lambda q^2)}$, where U
is known to be the "intrinsic" oscillator potential on the Darboux spaces of
nonconstant curvature determined by the kinetic energy term T and parametrized
by {\lambda}. We show that H is Stackel equivalent to the free Euclidean
motion, a fact that directly provides a curved Fradkin tensor of constants of
motion for H. Furthermore, we analyze in terms of {\lambda} the three different
underlying manifolds whose geodesic motion is provided by T. As a consequence,
we find that H comprises three different nonlinear physical models that, by
constructing their radial effective potentials, are shown to be two different
nonlinear oscillators and an infinite barrier potential. The quantization of
these two oscillators and its connection with spherical confinement models is
briefly discussed.
