This paper introduces a random multiple access method for satellite
communications, named Network Coding-based Slotted Aloha (NCSA). The goal is to
improve diversity of data bursts on a slotted-ALOHA-like channel thanks to
error correcting codes and Physical-layer Network Coding (PNC). This scheme can
be considered as a generalization of the Contention Resolution Diversity
Slotted Aloha (CRDSA) where the different replicas of this system are replaced
by the different parts of a single word of an error correcting code. The
performance of this scheme is first studied through a density evolution
approach. Then, simulations confirm the CRDSA results by showing that, for a
time frame of $400$ slots, the achievable total throughput is greater than
$0.7\times C$, where $C$ is the maximal throughput achieved by a centralized
scheme. This paper is a first analysis of the proposed scheme which open
several perspectives. The most promising approach is to integrate collided
bursts into the decoding process in order to improve the obtained performance.
