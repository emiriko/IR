Jet fragmentation in p+p and Au+Au collisions is studied via back-to-back
correlations of direct photons and charged hadrons. The direct photon
correlations are obtained by statical subtraction of the background from decay
photons. Results on the nuclear modification to the associated charged hadron
yields are reviewed. Further studies of jet fragmentation in p+p using isolated
direct photons are also presented. A kT-smeared LO pQCD calculation is used to
interpret the data. The sensitivity of the data to the underlying fragmentation
function is tested and the results are found to be compatible with expectations
of a sample dominated by quark jet fragmentation.
