We present a study of bars in lenticular galaxies based on a sample of 371
galaxies from the SDSS-DR 7 and 2MASS in optical and near-infrared bands,
respectively. We found a bar in 15% of the lenticular galaxies in our sample,
which is consistent with recent studies. The barred galaxy fraction shows a
luminosity dependence, with faint lenticular galaxies (MK > -24.5, total
absolute magnitude in K band) having a larger fraction of bars than bright
lenticular galaxies (MK < -24.5). A similar trend is seen when Mr = -21.5, the
total absolute magnitude in SDSS r band is used to divide the sample into faint
and bright lenticular galaxies. We find that faint galaxies in clusters show a
higher bar fraction than their counterparts in the field. This suggests that
the formation of bars in lenticular galaxies not only depends on the total
luminosity of galaxy but also on the environment of the host galaxy.
