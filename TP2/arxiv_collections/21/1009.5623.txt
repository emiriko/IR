When a water jet impinges upon a solid surface it produces a so called
hydraulic jump that everyone can observe in the sink of its kitchen. It is
characterized by a thin liquid sheet bounded by a circular rise of the surface
due to capillary and gravitational forces. In this phenomenon, the impact
induces a geometrical transition, from the cylindrical one of the jet to the
bi-dimensional one of the film. A true jet rebound on a solid surface, for
which the cylindrical geometry is preserved, has never been yet observed. Here
we experimentally demonstrate that a water jet can impact a solid surface
without being destabilized. Depending on the incident angle of the impinging
jet, its velocity and the degree of hydrophobicity of the substrate, the jet
can i) bounce on the surface with a fixed reflected angle, ii) land on it and
give rise to a supported jet or iii) be destabilized, emitting drops. Capillary
forces are predominant at the sub-millimetric jet scale considered in this
work, along with the hydrophobic nature of the substrate. The results presented
in this letter raise the fundamental problem of knowing why such capillary
hydraulic jump gives rise to this unexpected jet rebound phenomenon. This study
furthermore offers new and promising possibilities to handle little quantity of
water through "jet micro-fluidics"
