The ALICE experiment at the LHC is equipped with an electromagnetic
calorimeter (EMCal) designed to enhance its capabilities for jet measurement.
In addition, the EMCal enables triggering on high energy jets. Based on the
previous development made for the Photon Spectrometer (PHOS) level-0 trigger, a
specific electronic upgrade was designed in order to allow fast triggering on
high energy jets (level-1). This development was made possible by using the
latest generation of FPGAs which can deal with the instantaneous incoming data
rate of 26 Gbit/s and process it in less than 4 {\mu}s.
