We present $d+1-$dimensional pure magnetic Yang-Mills (YM) black strings (or
$1-$branes) induced by the $d-$dimensional Einstein-Yang-Mills-Dilaton black
holes. Born-Infeld version of the YM field makes our starting point which goes
to the standard YM field through a limiting procedure. The lifting from black
holes to black strings, (with less number of fields) is by adding an extra,
compact coordinate. This amounts to the change of horizon topology from
$S^{d-2}$ to a product structure. Our black string in $5-$dimensions is a
rather special one, with uniform Hawking temperature and non-asymptotically
flat structure. As the YM charge becomes large the string gets thinner to tend
into a breaking point and transform into a $4-$% dimensional black hole.
