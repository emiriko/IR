The pre-stellar cores in which low mass stars form are generally well
magnetized. Our simulations show that early protostellar discs are massive and
experience strong magnetic torques in the form of magnetic braking and
protostellar outflows. Simulations of protostellar disk formation suggest that
these torques are strong enough to suppress a rotationally supported structure
from forming for near critical values of mass-to-flux. We demonstrate through
the use of a 3D adaptive mesh refinement code -- including cooling, sink
particles and magnetic fields -- that one produces transient 1000 AU discs
while simultaneously generating large outflows which leave the core region,
carrying away mass and angular momentum. Early inflow/outflow rates suggest
that only a small fraction of the mass is lost in the initial magnetic
tower/jet event.
