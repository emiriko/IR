The first hydrostatic core (FHSC) represents a very early phase in the
low-mass star formation process, after collapse of the parent core has begun
but before a true protostar has formed. This large (few AU), cool (100 K),
pressure supported core of molecular hydrogen is expected from theory, but has
yet to be observationally verified. Here we present observations of an
excellent candidate for the FHSC phase: Per-Bolo 58, a dense core in Perseus
that was previously believed to be starless. The 70 micron flux of 65 mJy, from
new deep Spitzer MIPS observations, is consistent with that expected for the
FHSC. A low signal-to-noise detection at 24 micron leaves open the possibility
that Per-Bolo 58 could be a very low luminosity protostar, however. We utilize
radiative transfer models to determine the best-fitting FHSC and protostar
models to the spectral energy distribution and 2.9 mm visibilities of Per-Bolo
58. The source is consistent with a FHSC with some source of lower opacity
through the envelope allowing 24 micron emission to escape; a small outflow
cavity or a cavity in the envelope are both possible. While we are unable to
rule out the presence of a protostar, if present it would be one of the lowest
luminosity protostellar objects yet observed, with an internal luminosity of
approximately 0.01 Lsun.
