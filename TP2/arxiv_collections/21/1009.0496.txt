A mass model that includes galaxies in and near the Local Group and an
external mass in the direction of the Maffei system, with the condition from
cosmology that protogalaxies have small peculiar velocities at high redshifts,
allows a plausible picture for the past motion of the Large Magellanic Cloud
relative to the Milky Way. The model also fits the proper motions of M33 and
IC10.
