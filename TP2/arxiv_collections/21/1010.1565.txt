We study the effects of electron screening on nuclear reaction rates
occurring during the Big Bang nucleosynthesis epoch. The sensitivity of the
predicted elemental abundances on electron screening is studied in details. It
is shown that electron screening does not produce noticeable results in the
abundances unless the traditional Debye-H\"uckel model for the treatment of
electron screening in stellar environments is enhanced by several orders of
magnitude. The present work rules out electron screening as a relevant
ingredient to Big Bang nucleosynthesis and ruling out exotic possibilities for
the treatment of screening, beyond the mean-field theoretical approach.
