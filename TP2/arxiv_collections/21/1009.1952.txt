Present-days Reversed Field Pinches (RFPs) are characterized by quasi-laminar
magnetic configurations in their core, whose boundaries feature sharp internal
transport barriers, in analogy with tokamaks and stellarators. The abatement of
magnetic chaos leads to the reduction of associated particle and heat transport
along wandering field lines. At the same time, the growth of steep temperature
gradients may trigger drift microinstabilities. In this work we summarize the
work recently done in the RFP RFX-mod in order to assess the existence and the
impact upon transport of such electrostatic and electromagnetic
microinstabilities as Ion Temperature Gradient (ITG), Trapped Electron Modes
(TEM) and microtearing modes.
