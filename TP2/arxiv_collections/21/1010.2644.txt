Up to now, planet search programs have concentrated on main sequence stars
later than spectral type F5. However, identifying planets of early type stars
would be interesting. For example, the mass loss of planets orbiting early and
late type stars is different because of the differences of the EUV and X-ray
radiation of the host stars. As an initial step, we carried out a program to
identify suitable A-stars in the CoRoT fields using spectra taken with the
AAOmega spectrograph. In total we identified 562 A-stars in IRa01, LRa01, and
LRa02.
