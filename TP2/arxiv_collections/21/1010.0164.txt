Two-qubit interactions are at the heart of quantum information processing.
For single-spin qubits in semiconductor quantum dots, the exchange gate has
always been considered the natural two-qubit gate. The recent integration of
magnetic field or g-factor gradients in coupled quantum dot systems allows for
a one-step, robust realization of the controlled phase (C-Phase) gate instead.
We analyze the C-Phase gate durations and fidelities that can be obtained under
realistic conditions, including the effects of charge and nuclear field
fluctuations, and find gate error probabilities of below 10-4, possibly
allowing fault-tolerant quantum computation.
