We show that a magnetic field perpendicular to an AlGaAs/GaAs coupled quantum
well efficiently traps dipolar excitons and leads to the stabilization of the
excitonic formation and confinement in the illumination area. Hereby, the
density of dipolar excitons is remarkably enhanced up to $\sim 10^{11}
cm^{-2}$. By means of Landau level spectroscopy we study the density of excess
holes in the illuminated region. Depending on the excitation power and the
applied electric field, the hole density can be tuned over one order of
magnitude up to $\sim 2.5$ $10^{11} cm^{-2}$ - a value comparable with typical
carrier densities in modulation-doped structures.
