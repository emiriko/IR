We propose diagrams representing the equilibrium morphologies of two
immiscible liquid droplets brought into contact. We study the dependence of the
shape of the droplets on the surface tensions and ratio of volumes. We study
theoretically and experimentally the regimes of the parameters corresponding to
complete engulfing (one of the droplets completely absorbed by the other one),
non-engulfing (in which the droplets remain separated) and partial-engulfing
(intermediate configuration in which all three interfaces are present). We
specify the values of surface tensions corresponding to a Janus droplet, i.e.,
a perfectly spherical droplet composed of two sub-volumes occupied by two
different phases and separated by a curved interface. We further calculate and
experimentally verify a morphological transition between the states with
positive and negative curvature of this interface depending on the ratio of
volumes and on the equilibrium contact angle.
