The aim of this letter is to propose a new description to the time varying
gravitational constant problem, which naturally implements the Dirac's large
numbers hypothesis in a new proposed holographic scenario for the origin of
gravity as an entropic force. We survey the effect of the Stochastic motion of
the test particle in Verlinde's scenario for gravity\cite{Verlinde}. Firstly we
show that we must get the equipartition values for $t\rightarrow\infty$ which
leads to the usual Newtonian gravitational constant. Secondly,the stochastic
(Brownian) essence of the motion of the test particle, modifies the Newton's
2'nd law. The direct result is that the Newtonian constant has been time
dependence in resemblance as \cite{Running}.
