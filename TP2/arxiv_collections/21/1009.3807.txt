The transient optical conductivity of photoexcited 1T-TaS2 is determined over
a three-order-of-magnitude frequency range. Prompt collapse and recovery of the
Mott gap is observed. However, we find important differences between this
transient metallic state and that seen across the thermally-driven
insulator-metal transition. Suppressed low-frequency conductivity, Fano phonon
lineshapes, and a mid-infrared absorption band point to polaronic transport.
This is explained by noting that the photo-induced metallic state of 1T-TaS2 is
one in which the Mott gap is melted but the lattice retains its low-temperature
symmetry, a regime only accessible by photo-doping.
