Theory of electronic and optical properties of exciton and bi-exciton
complexes confined in CdSe spherical nanocrystals is presented. The electron
and hole states are computed using atomistic $sp^3d^5s^*$ tight binding
Hamiltonian including an effective crystal field splitting, spin-orbit
interactions, and model surface passivation. The optically excited states are
expanded in electron-hole configurations and the many-body spectrum is computed
in the configuration-interaction approach. Results demonstrate that the
low-energy electron spectrum is organized in shells ($s$, $p$, ...), whilst the
valence hole spectrum is composed of four low-lying, doubly degenerate states
separated from the rest by a gap. As a result, the bi-exciton and exciton
spectrum is composed of a manifold of closely lying states, resulting in a fine
structure of exciton and bi-exciton spectra. The quasi-degenerate nature of the
hole spectrum results in a correlated bi-exciton state, which makes it slowly
convergent with basis size. We carry out a systematic study of the exciton and
bi-exciton emission spectra as a function of the nanocrystal diameter and find
that the interplay of repulsion between constituent excitons and correlation
effects results in a change of the sign of bi-exciton binding energy from
negative to positive at a critical nanocrystal size.
