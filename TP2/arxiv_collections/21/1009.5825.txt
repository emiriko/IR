Low multipole amplitudes in the Cosmic Microwave Background CMB radiation can
be explained by selection rules from the underlying multiply-connected
homotopy. We apply a multipole analysis to the harmonic bases and introduce
point symmetry.We give explicit results for two cubic 3-spherical manifolds and
lowest polynomial degrees, and derive three new spherical 3-manifolds.
