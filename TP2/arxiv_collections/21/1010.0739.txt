We present a moderate-resolution spectroscopic analysis of the 10-25 Myr
clusters NGC 7160 and NGC 2232, using observations obtained with the WIYN 3.5-m
telescope. Both NGC 7160 and NGC 2232 are found to have super-solar
metallicities, with a mean [Fe/H] = 0.16 \pm 0.03 (s.e.m.) for NGC 7160, and
0.22 \pm 0.09 (s.e.m.) or 0.32 \pm 0.08 for NGC 2232, depending on the adopted
temperature scale. NGC 7160 exhibits solar distributions of Na, Fe-peak, and
{\alpha}-elements. NGC 2232 is underabundant in light elements Al and Si, by
~0.25 and ~ 0.15 dex, respectively; [Ni/Fe] is roughly solar. The abundance of
lithium in NGC 2232 stars is in agreement with undepleted values reported for
other cluster main sequence stars. Our abundances are similar to other
metal-rich open clusters and Galactic thin and thick disk stars.
