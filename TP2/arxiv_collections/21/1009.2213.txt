The observation of a large Nernst signal in cuprates above the
superconducting transition temperature has attracted much attention. A
potential explanation is that it originates from superconducting fluctuations.
Although the Nernst signal is indeed consistent with gaussian fluctuations for
overdoped cuprates, gaussian theory fails to describe the temperature
dependence seen for underdoped cuprates. Here, we consider the vertex
correction to gaussian theory resulting from the pseudogap. This yields a
Nernst signal in good agreement with the data.
