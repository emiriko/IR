Clusters of para-hydrogen (pH2) have been predicted to exhibit superfluid
behavior, but direct observation of this phenomenon has been elusive. Combining
experiments and theoretical simulations, we have determined the size evolution
of the superfluid response of pH2 clusters doped with carbon dioxide (CO2).
Reduction of the effective inertia is observed when the dopant is surrounded by
the pH2 solvent. This marks the onset of molecular superfluidity in pH2. The
fractional occupation of solvation rings around CO2 correlates with enhanced
superfluid response for certain cluster sizes.
