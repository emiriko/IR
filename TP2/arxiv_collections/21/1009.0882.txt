We consider the production of primordial micro black holes (MBH) remnants in
the early universe. These objects induce the universe to be in a
matter-dominated era before the onset of inflation. Effects of such an epoch on
the CMB power spectrum are discussed and computed both analytically and
numerically. By comparison with the latest observational data from the WMAP
collaboration, we find that our model is able to explain the quadrupole anomaly
of the CMB power spectrum.
