Comparing four different (ideal and viscous) hydrodynamic models for the
evolution of the medium created in 200 AGeV Au-Au collisions, combined with two
different models for the path length dependence of parton energy loss, we study
the effects of jet quenching on the emission-angle dependence of the nuclear
suppression factor R_AA(phi) and the away-side per trigger yield I_AA(phi).
Each hydrodynamic model was tuned to provide a reasonable description of the
single-particle transverse momentum spectra for all collision centralities, and
the energy loss models were adjusted to yield the same pion nuclear suppression
factor in central Au-Au collisions. We find that the experimentally measured
in-plane vs. out-of-plane spread in R_AA(phi) is better reproduced by models
that shift the weight of the parton energy loss to later times along its path.
Among the models studied here, this is best achieved by energy loss models that
suppress energy loss at early times, combined with hydrodynamic models that
delay the dilution of the medium density due to hydrodynamic expansion by
viscous heating. We were unable to identify a clear tomographic benefit of a
measurement of I_AA(phi) over that of R_AA(phi).
