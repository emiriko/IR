We present a photometric analysis of the galaxy cluster Abell 1763 at visible
and infrared wavelengths. Included are fully reduced images in r', J, H, and Ks
obtained using the Palomar 200in telescope, as well as the IRAC and MIPS images
from Spitzer. The cluster is covered out to approximately 3 virial radii with
deep 24um imaging (a 5? depth of 0.2 mJy). This same field of 40' by 40' is
covered in all four IRAC bands as well as the longer wavelength MIPS bands (70
and 160um). The r' imaging covers 0.8 deg2 down to 25.5 magnitudes, and
overlaps with most of the MIPS field of view. The J, H, Ks images cover the
cluster core and roughly half of the filament galaxies, which extend towards
the neighboring cluster, Abell 1770. This first, in a series of papers on Abell
1763, discusses the data reduction methods and source extraction techniques
used for each dataset. We present catalogs of infrared (IR) sources (with 24
and/or 70um emission) and their corresponding emission in the optical (u', g',
r', i', z'), and Near- to Far-IR (J, H, Ks, IRAC, and MIPS 160um). We provide
the catalogs and reduced images to the community through the NASA/IPAC Infrared
Science Archive (IRSA).
