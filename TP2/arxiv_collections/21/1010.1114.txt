We have performed magnetic susceptibility and neutron scattering measurements
on polycrystalline Ag-In-RE (RE: rare-earth) 1/1 approximants. In the magnetic
susceptibility measurements, for most of the RE elements, inverse
susceptibility shows linear behaviour in a wide temperature range, confirming
well localized isotropic moments for the RE$^{3+}$ ions. Exceptionally for the
light RE elements, such as Ce and Pr, non-linear behaviour was observed,
possibly due to significant crystalline field splitting or valence fluctuation.
For RE = Tb, the susceptibility measurement clearly shows a bifurcation of the
field-cooled and zero-field-cooled susceptibility at $T_{\rm f} = 3.7$~K,
suggesting a spin-glass-like freezing. On the other hand, neutron scattering
measurements detect significant development of short-range antiferromagnetic
spin correlations in elastic channel, which accompanied by a broad peak at
$\hbar\omega = 4$~meV in inelastic scattering spectrum. These features have
striking similarity to those in the Zn-Mg-Tb quasicrystals, suggesting that the
short-range spin freezing behaviour is due to local high symmetry clusters
commonly seen in both the systems.
