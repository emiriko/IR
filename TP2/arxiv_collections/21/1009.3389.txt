We present a new setup to measure element-selective magnetization dynamics
using the ALICE chamber (RSI \textbf{74}, 4048 (2003)) at the BESSY II
synchrotron at the Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin. A magnetic field pulse serves as
excitation, and the magnetization precession is probed by element selective
X-ray Resonant Magnetic Scattering (XRMS). With the use of single bunch
generated x-rays a temporal resolution well below 100 ps is reached. The setup
is realized in reflection geometry and enables investigations of thin films
described here, multilayers, and laterally structured samples. The combination
of the time resolved setup with a cryostat in the ALICE chamber will allow to
conduct temperature-dependent studies of precessional magnetization dynamics
and of damping constants over a large temperature range and for a large variety
of systems in reflection geometry.
