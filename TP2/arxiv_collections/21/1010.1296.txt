We fabricated highly adherent and electrically conductive micropatterns on
SU-8 by supersonic cluster beam deposition (SCBD). This technique is based on
the acceleration of neutral metallic nanoparticles produced in the gas phase.
The kinetic energy acquired by the nanoparticles allows implantation in a SU-8
layer, thus producing a metal-polymer nanocomposite thin layer. The
nanocomposite shows ohmic electrical conduction and it can also be used as an
adhesion layer for further metallization with a metallic overlayer. We
characterized the electrical conduction, adhesion and biocompatibility of
microdevices obtained by SCBD on SU-8 demonstrating the compatibility of our
approach with standard lift off technology on 4" wafer. A self-standing and
flexible Micro Electrode Array has been produced. Cytological tests with
neuronal cell lines demonstrated an improved cell growth and a spontaneous
confinement of cells on the nanocomposite layer.
