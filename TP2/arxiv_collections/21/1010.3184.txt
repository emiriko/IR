Jets are produced from hard scatterings in the early stages of heavy-ion
collisions. It is expected that these high-$p_T$ partons travel through the hot
and dense medium before fragmenting. Therefore they are expected to suffer
energy loss in the QGP via gluon radiation and elastic collisions along their
path. Measurements of fully reconstructed jets help understand the effect of
the energy loss on the jet structure and energy profile. A data-driven
characterization of the background in Au+Au is needed in order to compare the
results to p+p. The full azimuthal coverage of STAR Time Projection Chamber and
Electromagnetic Calorimeter allows measurements of fully reconstructed di-jets,
defined by jets that match the online trigger and recoil jets on the away side.
A tight selection of the trigger jets allows for a selection of those coming
from the surface. Hence, the population of jets on the recoil side is biased
towards a maximal energy loss because of the extreme in-medium pathlength. We
present measurements of di-jets, exploring their structure and properties in
Au+Au and p+p at $\sqrt s_{NN}=$200 GeV in the STAR experiment.
