We study the time-evolution of localized wavepackets in graphene quantum dots
under a perpendicular magnetic field, focusing on the quasiclassical and
revival periodicities, for different values of the magnetic field intensities
in a theoretical framework. We have considered contributions of the two
inequivalent points in the Brillouin zone. The revival time has been found as
an observable that shows the break valley degeneracy.
