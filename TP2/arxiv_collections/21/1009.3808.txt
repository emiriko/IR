We present observations of multiple system of dwarf galaxies at the Russian
6-m telescope and the GMRT (Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope). The optical
observations are a part of the programme Study of Groups of Dwarf Galaxies in
the Local Supercluster. The group of galaxies under consideration looks like
filament of 5 dwarfs. Two faint galaxies show peculiar structure. Long slit
spectrum reveals inner motions about 150 km/s in one of them. It suggests that
the galaxy is on stage of ongoing interaction. Probably, we see the group in
moment of its formation.
