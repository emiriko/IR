We present an extensive study of the static properties of light exotic and
non-exotic baryons, based on the formulation of chiral quark-soliton model in
terms of light-cone wave functions. We discuss in particular vector, axial and
tensor charges as well as an estimation of the electromagnetic moments for the
baryon octet, decuplet and hypothetical antidecuplet. Contributions from Fock
components up to the seven-quark sector are considered and appear to be
sizeable, reflecting the importance of the pion cloud. All these observables
are further decomposed into flavor, valence quark, sea quark and antiquark
contributions.
