In a previous paper, we generalized the definition of the framed Kontsevich
integral initially presented by Le and Murakami. We also defined an isotopy
invariant $\widetilde{Z}_f$ that is well-behaved under band sum moves. Using
this invariant we study the construction of the LMO invariant, the Wheeling
Theorem, and the Aarhus integral.
