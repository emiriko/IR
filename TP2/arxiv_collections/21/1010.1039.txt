A theoretical and experimental study of the spin-dependent photoconductivity
in dilute Nitride GaAsN is presented. The non linear transport model we develop
here is based on the rate equations for electrons, holes, deep paramagnetic and
non paramagnetic centers both under CW and pulsed optical excitation. Emphasis
is given to the effect of the competition between paramagnetic centers and non
paramagnetic centers which allows us to reproduce the measured characteristics
of the spin-dependent recombination power dependence. Particular attention is
paid to the role of an external magnetic field in Voigt geometry. The
photoconductivity exhibits a Hanle-type curve whereas the spin polarization of
electrons shows two superimposed Lorentzian curves with different widths,
respectively related to the recombination of free and trapped electrons. The
model is capable of reproducing qualitatively and quantitatively the most
important features of photoluminescence and photocurrent experiments and is
helpful in providing insight on the various mechanisms involved in the electron
spin polarization and filtering in GaAsN semiconductors.
