Progenitors of long GRBs, and core-collapse supernovae in general, may have
two separate mechanisms driving the outflows: quasi-isotropic neutrino-driven
supernova explosions followed by a highly collimated relativistic outflow
driven by the GRB central engine, a black hole or a magnetar. We consider the
dynamics of the second GRB-driven explosion propagating through expanding
envelope generated by the passage of the primary supernova shock. Beyond the
central core, in the region of steep density gradient created by the SN shock
breakout, the accelerating secondary quasi-spherical GRB shock become unstable
to corrugation and under certain conditions may form a highly collimated jet, a
"chimney", when a flow expands almost exclusively along a nearly cylindrically
collimated channel. Thus, weakly non-spherical driving and/or non-spherical
initial conditions of the wind cavity may produce highly non-spherical, jetted
outflows. For a constant luminosity GRB central engine, this occurs for density
gradient in the envelope \rho ~ r^{-\omega} steeper than \omega >4.
