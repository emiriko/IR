Using the IMaX instrument on-board the Sunrise stratospheric
balloon-telescope we have detected extremely shifted polarization signals
around the Fe I 5250.217 {\AA} spectral line within granules in the solar
photosphere. We interpret the velocities associated with these events as
corresponding to supersonic and magnetic upflows. In addition, they are also
related to the appearance of opposite polarities and highly inclined magnetic
fields. This suggests that they are produced by the reconnection of emerging
magnetic loops through granular upflows. The events occupy an average area of
0.046 arcsec$^2$ and last for about 80 seconds, with larger events having
longer lifetimes. These supersonic events occur at a rate of $1.3\times10^{-5}$
occurrences per second per arcsec$^{2}$.
