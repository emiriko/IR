We report the discovery of a Saturn-sized planet transiting a V = 11.3, K4
dwarf star every 3.9 d. WASP-29b has a mass of 0.24+/-0.02 M_Jup and a radius
of 0.79+/-0.05 R_Jup, making it the smallest planet so far discovered by the
WASP survey, and the exoplanet most similar in mass and radius to Saturn. The
host star WASP-29 has an above-Solar metallicity and fits a possible
correlation for Saturn-mass planets such that planets with higher-metallicity
host stars have higher core masses and thus smaller radii.
