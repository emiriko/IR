Folded graphene flakes are a natural byproduct of the micromechanical
exfoliation process. In this Letter we show by a combination of analytical and
numerical methods that such systems behave as intriguing interferometers due to
the interplay between an externally applied magnetic field and the gauge field
induced by the deformations in the region of the fold.
