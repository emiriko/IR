Apoptosis is an important area of research because of its role in keeping a
mature multicellular organism's number of cells constant hence, ensuring that
the organism does not have cell accumulation that may transform into cancer
with additional hallmarks. Firstly, we have carried out sensitivity analysis on
an existing mitochondria-dependent mathematical apoptosis model to find out
which parameters have a role in causing monostable cell survival i.e.,
malfunction in apoptosis. We have then generated three healthy cell models by
changing these sensitive parameters while preserving bistability i.e., healthy
functioning. For each healthy cell, we varied the proapoptotic production
rates, which were found to be among the most sensitive parameters, to yield
cells that have malfunctioning apoptosis. We simulated caspase-3 activation, by
numerically integrating the governing ordinary differential equations of a
mitochondria-dependent apoptosis model, in a hypothetical malfunctioning cell
which is treated by four potential treatments, namely: (i) proteasome inhibitor
treatment, (ii) Bcl-2 inhibitor treatment, (iii) IAP inhibitor treatment, (iv)
Bid-like synthetic peptides treatment. The simulations of the present model
suggest that proteasome inhibitor treatment is the most effective treatment
though it may have severe side effects. For this treatment, we observed that
the amount of proteasome inhibitor needed for caspase-3 activation may be
different for cells in individuals with a different proapoptotic protein
deficiency. We also observed that caspase-3 can be activated by Bcl-2 inhibitor
treatment only in those hypothetical malfunctioning cells with Bax deficiency
but not in others. These support the view that molecular heterogeneity in
individuals may be an important factor in determining the individuals' positive
or negative responses to treatments.
