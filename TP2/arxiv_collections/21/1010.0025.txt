We present a hybrid approach for GW/Bethe-Salpeter Equation (BSE)
calculations of core excitation spectra, including x-ray absorption (XAS),
electron energy loss spectra (EELS), and non-resonant inelastic x-ray
scattering (NRIXS). The method is based on {\it ab initio} wavefunctions from
the plane-wave pseudopotential code ABINIT; atomic core-level states and
projector augmented wave (PAW) transition matrix elements; the NIST core-level
BSE solver; and a many-pole GW self-energy model to account for final-state
broadening and self-energy shifts. Multiplet effects are also accounted for.
The approach is implemented using an interface dubbed OCEAN (Obtaining Core
Excitations using ABINIT and NBSE). To demonstrate the utility of the code we
present results for the K-edges in LiF as probed by XAS and NRIXS, the K-edges
of KCl as probed by XAS, the Ti L_2,3-edge in SrTiO_3 as probed by XAS, and the
Mg L_2,3-edge in MgO as probed by XAS. We compare the results to experiments
and results obtained using other theoretical approaches.
