We summarize studies of growing lengths in different aging systems. The
article is structured as follows. We recall the definition of a number of
observables, typically correlations and susceptibilities, that give access to
dynamic and static correlation lengths. We use a growing length perspective to
review three out of equilibrium cases: domain growth phenomena; the evolution
of Edwards-Wilkinson and Kardar-Parisi-Zhang manifolds and other directed
elastic manifolds in random media; spin and structural glasses in relaxation
and under an external drive. Finally, we briefly report on a mechanism for
dynamic fluctuations in aging systems that is based on a time-reparametrization
invariance scenario and may be at the origin of the dynamic growing length in
glassy materials.
