We have studied the star formation history and the initial mass function
(IMF) using the age and mass derived from spectral energy distribution (SED)
fitting and from color-magnitude diagrams. We also examined the physical and
structural parameters of more than 1,000 pre-main sequence stars in NGC 2264
using the on-line SED fitting tool (SED fitter) of Robitaille et al.
  The cumulative distribution of stellar ages showed a distinct difference
among SFRs. The results indicate that star formation in NGC 2264 started at the
surface region (Halo and Field regions) about 6 - 7 Myr ago, propagated into
the molecular cloud and finally triggered the recent star formation in the
Spokes cluster. The kind of sequential star formation that started in the
low-density surface region (Halo and Field regions) implies that star formation
in NGC 2264 was triggered by an external source.
  The IMF of NGC 2264 was determined in two different ways. The slope of the
IMF of NGC 2264 for massive stars (log m >= 0.5) is -1.7 \pm 0.1, which is
somewhat steeper than the so-called standard "Salpeter-Kroupa" IMF. We also
present data for 79 young brown dwarf candidates.
