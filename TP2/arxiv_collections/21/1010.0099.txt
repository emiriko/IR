In this communication we discuss the Weak Field Approach, and in particular
the Newtonian limit, applied to f(R)-Gravity. Particular emphasis is placed on
the spherically symmetric solutions and finally, it is clearly shown that
General Relativity results, in the Solar System context, are easily recovered
since Einstein theory is a particular case of $f(R)$-Gravity. This is a crucial
point against several wrong results in literature stating that these theories
are not viable at local scales.
