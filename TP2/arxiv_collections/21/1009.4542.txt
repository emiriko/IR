We review the present situation with hadron form factors in space-like and
time-like regions. The possibility to transfer high momenta, and therefore to
access small internal nucleon distances, allows to test nucleon models in
particular pQCD predictions such as quark counting rules and helicity
conservation. We will focus here to the proton case, although general
statements apply also to neutron and light hadrons.
