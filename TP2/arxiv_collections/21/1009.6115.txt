A phase transition of a model compound of the long-range Ising spin glass
(SG) Dy$_{x}$Y$_{1-x}$Ru$_{2}$Si$_{2}$, where spins interact via the RKKY
interaction, has been investigated. The static and the dynamic scaling analyses
reveal that the SG phase transition in the model magnet belongs to the
mean-field universality class. Moreover, the characteristic relaxation time in
finite magnetic fields exhibits a critical divergent behavior as well as in
zero field, indicating a stability of the SG phase in finite fields. The
presence of the SG phase transition in field in the model magnet strongly
syggests that the replica symmetry is broken in the long-range Ising SG.
