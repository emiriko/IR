We generalize the notion of a dielectric analog Schwarzschild black hole
model to analog models of arbitrary space-times; in particular, the approach is
not restricted to static space-times. This is done by establishing a
correspondence between electrodynamics on a curved, vacuum manifold, with
electrodynamics in a general linear dielectric residing in Minkowski
space-time. The mapping is not unique, allowing for some freedom in the
specification of equivalent materials, which could be useful for exploiting
recent developments in the production of metamaterials. Some examples are
considered, with special attention paid to the dielectric analog of the
exterior Kerr geometry, which is found to be reproducible with regular, linear,
dielectrics.
