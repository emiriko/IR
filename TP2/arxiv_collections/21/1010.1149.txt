This paper gives sufficient conditions for a class of bang-bang extremals
with multiple switches to be locally optimal in the strong topology. The
conditions are the natural generalizations of the ones considered in previous
papers for more specific cases. We require both the strict bang-bang Legendre
condition, and the second order conditions for the finite dimensional problem
obtained by moving the switching times of the reference trajectory.
