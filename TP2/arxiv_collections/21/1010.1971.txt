We derive a two-parameter formula for the electromagnetic form factors of the
nucleon described as an instanton by "integrating out" all KK modes other than
the lowest mesons from the infinite-tower of vector mesons in holographic QCD
while preserving hidden local symmetry for the resultant vector fields. With
only two parameters, the proton Sachs form factors can be fit surprisingly well
to the available experimental data for momentum transfers $Q^2\lsim 0.5$
GeV$^2$ with $\chi^2$/dof $\lsim 2$, indicating the importance of an infinite
tower in the soliton structure of the nucleon. The prediction of the
Sakai-Sugimoto holographic dual model is checked against the fit values that we
interpret as representing Nature. The nature of the "core" in the nucleon
structure is reassessed in light of the results obtained with the
infinite-tower structure.
