It is well known that in every experiment involving charged particles there
are individual photons emitted with small energy /omega and those with /omega <
/omega_{0} will not be detected but are present in the data. The typical
procedure to estimate this effect consists in taking the leading logarithm from
the soft photon approximation and to make a simulation through a Monte Carlo
Algorithm (PHOTOS). The aim of this work is to compute the model independent
QED correction to tau--> K /pi /nu and to estimate its effect in the decay
width in the particular process tau^{+}-->K^{0} /pi^{+}/nu.
