This fluid dynamics video shows the breakup of a droplet in a stationary
homogeneous and isotropic turbulent flow. We consider droplets with the same
density of the transporting fluid. The droplets and the fluid are numerically
modelled by means of a multicompo- nent Lattice-Boltzmann method. The turbulent
fluid is maintained through a large scale stirring force and the radius of
stable droplets, for the parameters in our simulation, is larger than the
Kolmogorov scale. Events of droplet deformation, break-up and aggregation are
clearly visible from the movie. With the present database droplet evo- lution
can be studied from both an Eulerian and Lagrangian point of view. The
Kolmogorov-Hinze criteria for droplets break-up can be tested also by means of
simulations with different viscosity contrast between the two components.
