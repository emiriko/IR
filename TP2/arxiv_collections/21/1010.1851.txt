The LHCb experiment is designed for hadronic flavour physics and will look
for New Physics manifestations in the decay of charm and bottom hadrons
abundantly produced at the LHC. All parts of the LHCb physics programme can be
embarked on with the expected statistics to be collected during the first
2010-2011 physics run at $\sqrt{s}$ = 7 TeV. We present first preliminary
results on strangeness production, and demonstrate, using the few nb-1 of
already collected data, the potential for initial measurements in heavy-flavour
physics.
