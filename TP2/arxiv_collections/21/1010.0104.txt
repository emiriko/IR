In many architectures for fault tolerant quantum computing universality is
achieved by a combination of Clifford group unitary operators and preparation
of suitable nonstabilizer states, the so-called magic states. Universality is
possible even for some fairly noisy nonstabilizer states, as distillation can
convert many noisy copies into fewer purer magic states. Here we propose novel
protocols that exploit multiple species of magic states in surprising ways.
These protocols provide examples of previously unobserved phenomena that are
analogous to catalysis and activation well known in entanglement theory.
