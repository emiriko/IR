Quantum correlations exhibit behaviour that cannot be resolved with a local
hidden variable picture of the world. In quantum information, they are also
used as resources for information processing tasks, such as Measurement-based
Quantum Computation (MQC). In MQC, universal quantum computation can be
achieved via adaptive measurements on a suitable entangled resource state. In
this paper, we look at a version of MQC in which we remove the adaptivity of
measurements and aim to understand what computational abilities still remain in
the resource. We show that there are explicit connections between this model of
computation and the question of non-classicality in quantum correlations. We
demonstrate this by focussing on deterministic computation of Boolean
functions, in which natural generalisations of the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger
(GHZ) paradox emerge; we then explore probabilistic computation, via which
multipartite Bell Inequalities can be defined. We use this correspondence to
define families of multi-party Bell inequalities, which we show to have a
number of interesting contrasting properties.
