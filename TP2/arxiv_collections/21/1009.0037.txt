We report on the experimental evidences for an unusual coupling between the
magnetic field- induced fluctuations of correlated Ce-ions coinciding with the
discontinuous movement of the underlying spin density wave in the intermetallic
rare earth compound CeAg2Ge2. The measurements performed using neutron
scattering and magnetic Gruneisen ratio methods suggest that the coupling
onsets at H= 2.7 T, T < 3.8 K and persists to the lowest measurement
temperature T ~ 0.05 K. These measurements suggest a new mechanism behind the
spin fluctuations which can affect the intrinsic properties of the system.
