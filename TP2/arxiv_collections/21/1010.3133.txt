A probabilistic cellular automaton (PCA) can be viewed as a Markov chain. The
cells are updated synchronously and independently, according to a distribution
depending on a finite neighborhood. We investigate the ergodicity of this
Markov chain. A classical cellular automaton is a particular case of PCA. For a
1-dimensional cellular automaton, we prove that ergodicity is equivalent to
nilpotency, and is therefore undecidable. We then propose an efficient perfect
sampling algorithm for the invariant measure of an ergodic PCA. Our algorithm
does not assume any monotonicity property of the local rule. It is based on a
bounding process which is shown to be also a PCA. Last, we focus on the PCA
Majority, whose asymptotic behavior is unknown, and perform numerical
experiments using the perfect sampling procedure.
