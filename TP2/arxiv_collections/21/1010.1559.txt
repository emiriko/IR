We explore a scenario in the Standard Model in which dimension four Yukawa
couplings are either forbidden by a symmetry, or happen to be very tiny, and
the Yukawa interactions are dominated by effective dimension six interactions.
In this case, the Higgs interactions to the fermions are enhanced in a large
way, whereas its interaction with the gauge bosons remains the same as in the
Standard Model. In hadron colliders, Higgs boson production via gluon gluon
fusion increases by a factor of nine. Higgs decay widths to fermion
anti-fermion pairs also increase by the same factor, whereas the decay widths
to photon photon and gamma Z are reduced. Current Tevatron exclusion range for
the Higgs mass increases to ~ 142-200 GeV in our scenario, and new physics must
appear at a scale below a TeV.
