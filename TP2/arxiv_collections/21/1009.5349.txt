Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS-02) is a general purpose high energy
particle detector which will be deployed on the International Space Station
(ISS) at the end of 2010 - beginning of 2011 to conduct a unique 10 to 18 year
mission of fundamental physics research in space. Among the physics objectives
of AMS are a search for an understanding of Dark Matter, Antimatter, the origin
of cosmic rays and the exploration of new physics phenomena not possible to
study from ground based experiments. This article reviews the status of the
AMS-02 detector construction, detector calibration results as well as AMS
physics potential for new phenomena searches.
