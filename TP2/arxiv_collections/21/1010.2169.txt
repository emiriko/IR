We discuss low mass dilepton rates ($\le 1$ GeV) from the deconfined phase of
QCD using both perturbative and non-perturbative models and compare with those
from lattice gauge theory and in-medium hadron gas. Our analysis suggests that
the rate at very low invariant mass ($ M\le 200$ MeV) using the nonperturbative
gluon condensate in a semiempirical way within the Green function dominates
over the Born-rate and independent of any uncertainty associated with the
choice of the strong coupling in perturbation theory. On the other hand the
rate from $\rho-q$ interaction in the deconfined phase is important between 200
MeV $\le M \le 1 GeV as it is almost of same order of the Born-rate as well as
in-medium hadron gas rate. Also the higher order perturbative rate, leaving
aside its various uncertainties, from HTL approximation becomes reliable at
$M\ge 200$ MeV and also becomes comparable with the Born-rate and the
lattice-rate for $M\ge 500$ MeV, constraining on the broad resonance structures
in the dilepton rate at large invariant mass. We also discuss the lattice
constraints on the low mass dilepton rate. Furthermore, we discuss a more
realistic way to advocate the quark-hadron duality hypothesis based on the
dilepton rates from QGP and hadron gas than it is done in the literature.
