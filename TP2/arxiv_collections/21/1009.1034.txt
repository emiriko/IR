Most of the spectra of neutron star low mass X-ray binaries (NS LMXBs), being
them persistent or transient, are characterized by the presence of a strong
thermal Comptonization bump, thought to originate in the transition layer (TL)
between the accretion disk and the NS surface. The observable quantities which
characterize this component dominating the emission below 30 keV, are the
spectral index alpha and the rollover energy, both related to the electron
temperature and optical depth of the plasma. Starting from observational
results on a sample of NS LMXBs in different spectral states, we formulate the
problem of X-ray spectral formation in the TL of these sources. We predict a
stability of the thermal Comptonization spectral index in different spectral
states if the energy release in the TL is much higher than the intercepted flux
coming from the accretion disk. We use an equation for the energy balance and
the radiative transfer diffusion equation for a slab geometry in the TL, to
derive a formula for the thermal Comptonization index alpha. We show that in
this approximation the TL electron temperature kTe and optical depth tau_0 can
be written as a function of the energy flux from the disk intercepted by the
corona (TL) and that in the corona itself Qdisk/Qcor, in turn leading to a
relation alpha=f(Qdisk/Qcor), with alpha ~ 1 when Qdisk/Qcor <<1. We show that
the observed spectral index alpha for the sample of sources here considered
lies in a belt around 1 +/- 0.2 a part for the case of GX 354--0. Comparing our
theoretical predictions with observations, we claim that this result, which is
consistent with the condition Qdisk/Qcor <<1, can give us constraints on the
accretion geometry of these systems, an issue that seems difficult to be solved
using only the spectral analysis method.
