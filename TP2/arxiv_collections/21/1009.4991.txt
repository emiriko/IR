Web page categorization is one of the challenging tasks in the world of ever
increasing web technologies. There are many ways of categorization of web pages
based on different approach and features. This paper proposes a new dimension
in the way of categorization of web pages using artificial neural network (ANN)
through extracting the features automatically. Here eight major categories of
web pages have been selected for categorization; these are business & economy,
education, government, entertainment, sports, news & media, job search, and
science. The whole process of the proposed system is done in three successive
stages. In the first stage, the features are automatically extracted through
analyzing the source of the web pages. The second stage includes fixing the
input values of the neural network; all the values remain between 0 and 1. The
variations in those values affect the output. Finally the third stage
determines the class of a certain web page out of eight predefined classes.
This stage is done using back propagation algorithm of artificial neural
network. The proposed concept will facilitate web mining, retrievals of
information from the web and also the search engines.
