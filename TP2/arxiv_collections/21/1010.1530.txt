Starting from a modified version of Polchinski's equation, Morris'
fixed-point equation for the effective average action is derived. Since an
expression for the line of equivalent fixed-points associated with every
critical fixed-point is known in the former case, this link allows us to find,
for the first time, the analogous expression in the latter case.
