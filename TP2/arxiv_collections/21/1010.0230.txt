In many ostensibly crystalline materials, unit-cell-based descriptions do not
always capture the complete physics of the system due to disruption in
long-range order. In the series of cobalt hydroxides studied here,
Co(OH)$_{2-x}$(Cl)$_x$(H$_2$O)$_{n}$, magnetic Bragg diffraction reveals a
fully compensated N\'eel state, yet the materials show significant and open
magnetization loops. A detailed analysis of the local structure defines the
aperiodic arrangement of cobalt coordination polyhedra. Representation of the
structure as a combination of distinct polyhedral motifs explains the existence
of locally uncompensated moments and provides a quantitative agreement with
bulk magnetic measurements and magnetic Bragg diffraction.
