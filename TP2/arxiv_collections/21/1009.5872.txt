We show that the existence of a degenerate halo of sterile neutrinos with
rest mass of 17.4 keV near the Galactic Center can account for both the excess
8.7 keV emission observed by the $Suzaku$ mission and the power needed
($10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$) to maintain the high temperature of the hot gas (8
keV) near the Galactic Center. The required decay rate and mixing angle of the
sterile neutrinos are $\Gamma \ge 5 \times 10^{-20}$ s$^{-1}$ and $\sin^22
\theta \sim 10^{-3}-10^{-4}$ respectively. These values are consistent with a
low reheating temperature in the inflation model, and suggest the exciting
possibility that the sterile - active neutrino oscillation can be visible in
near future experiments.
