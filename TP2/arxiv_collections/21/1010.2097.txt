It is argued that Trauzettel et al. [Phys. Rev. B 75, 035305 (2007)] made
some mistakes in their calculations regarding the photon-assisted transport in
graphene that lead to uncoupled sidebands and emergence of step-like features
in dG/dV (G is differential conductance and V is the bias voltage). We discuss
the relevant corrections and explain in detail how the correct results are
expected to be quite different than the incorrect ones.
