We investigate the metal-insulator transition occurring in semiconductors
with magnetic impurities when lowering temperature. In contrast to the usually
considered percolation transition in the non-uniform medium induced by the
localization of charge carriers in the fluctuating \emph{electric} potential,
the studied transition is connected with their localization in the fluctuating
\emph{magnetic} potential produced by magnetized impurities (more accurately -
in the combined fluctuating potential). When decreasing temperature, the
magnetization of magnetic impurities in the semiconductor becomes higher and
even at the invariable (temperature independent) amplitude of the electric
potential, the magnetic component of the total potential increases. With
increasing fluctuation amplitude, the Fermi level of charge carriers sinks
deeper and deeper into the growing tail of density of states until it falls
under the percolation level. For that, fluctuations of the total potential have
to run up to some critical value. On reaching that value, the transition occurs
from the metal conductivity to the activation one (the metal-insulator
transition).
