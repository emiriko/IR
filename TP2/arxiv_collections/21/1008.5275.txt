The colored Tverberg theorem asserts that for every d and r there exists
t=t(d,r) such that for every set C in R^d of cardinality (d+1)t, partitioned
into t-point subsets C_1,C_2,...,C_{d+1} (which we think of as color classes;
e.g., the points of C_1 are red, the points of C_2 blue, etc.), there exist r
disjoint sets R_1,R_2,...,R_r \subseteq C that are "rainbow", meaning that |R_i
\cap C_j| < 2 for every i,j, and whose convex hulls all have a common point.
  All known proofs of this theorem are topological. We present a geometric
version of a recent beautiful proof by Blagojevi\'c, Matschke, and Ziegler,
avoiding a direct use of topological methods. The purpose of this
de-topologization is to make the proof more concrete and intuitive, and
accessible to a wider audience.
