We use a holographic model to compute the quark scalar current correlator.
Already used in other contexts, our model consists in a bulk field theory
defined on a deformed Anti de Sitter space and allows to derive analogous
results to those of the soft wall model. One issue of such computations is to
understand relevant holographic physical constraints which give predictive QCD
results rather than to make the inverse step as done until now.
