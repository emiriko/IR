Using the AdS/CFT correspondence, we study the high-energy behavior of
scattering amplitudes in N=4 SYM gauge theory for dipole-dipole soft elastic
scattering, described in the Wilson-loop correlator formalism. The amplitudes
are evaluated in the dual picture, at large impact-parameter, by considering
the exchange of supergravity fields between certain minimal surfaces in
Euclidean AdS_5, and performing the appropriate analytic continuation to
Minkowskian signature. The purely elastic behavior at large impact-parameter is
then combined with the unitarity constraint in the central region, in order to
derive an absolute bound on the high-energy behavior of the dipole-dipole total
cross section. The possibility to obtain a stronger bound by assuming a larger
domain of validity for the AdS/CFT result is also discussed.
