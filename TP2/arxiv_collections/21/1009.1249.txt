We study the beam energy dependence of equilibration process and space-time
characteristics of participant and spectator matter. For this, we simulated the
semi-central collisions of $^{40}Ca+ ^{40}Ca$ at incident energies of 400, 600
and 1000 AMeV within the \emph{quantum molecular dynamics} (QMD) approach. Our
numerical calculations based on the molecular dynamics approach show that
incident energy of the projectile influences the reaction observables
drastically. The effect is more visible for transverse expansion of the nuclear
matter and transparency behavior. The degree of thermalization of participant
matter, however, remains independent of the incident energy. The
characteristics of the trajectories followed by the nucleons suffering maximal
and minimal binary collisions are also analyzed.
