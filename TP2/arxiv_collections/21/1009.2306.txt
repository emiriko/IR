We investigate phase-insensitive linear amplification at the quantum limit
for single- and two-mode states and show that there exists a broad class of
non-Gaussian states whose nonclassicality survives even at an arbitrarily large
gain. We identify the corresponding observable nonclassical effects and find
that they include, remarkably, two-mode entanglement. The implications of our
results for quantum cloning outside the Gaussian regime are also addressed.
