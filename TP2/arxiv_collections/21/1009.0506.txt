Recombination is a hadronization process that converts partons to hadrons at
late time, but the description has no quantitative significance without some
meaningful input on the parton distributions at earlier time. Thus observations
of particle spectra and correlations have definitive implications on the
partonic processes at all transverse momenta. After presenting a general review
of the subject at the Workshop, I selected two topics in nuclear collisions for
more detailed discussion, which are summarized here. One is on the azimuthal
anisotropy at low $p_T$ due to hard or semihard scattering of partons that
create ridges with or without triggers. The ridge particles are the products of
recombination of thermal partons enhanced by the energy loss of hard or
semihard partons. Their $\phi$ dependence at midrapidity can be determined
essentially from geometry. The other topic is on the scaling behavior in $\phi$
and centrality at high $p_T$, where the hadronization process is dominated by
TS and SS recombination. The relevant RHIC data are found to have the same
scaling behavior. But at LHC such scaling is badly broken at $p_T \sim 10$
GeV/c if two-jet recombination is important. At the end of this article some
comments are made to relate our study of the effects of semihard partons to the
observation of minijets in the analyses of STAR data.
