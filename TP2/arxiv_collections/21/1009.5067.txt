We present hadron-level predictions from the Monte Carlo generator Cascade
and numerical calculations of charm and beauty production at the Fermilab
Tevatron within the framework of the $k_T$-factorization QCD approach. Our
consideration is based on the CCFM-evolved unintegrated gluon densities in a
proton. The performed analysis covers the total and differential cross sections
of open charm and beauty quarks, $B$ and $D$ mesons (or rather muons from their
semileptonic decays) and the total and differential cross sections of $b \bar
b$ di-jet hadroproduction. We study the theoretical uncertainties of our
calculations and investigate the effects coming from parton showers in initial
and final states. Our predictions are compared with the recent experimental
data taken by the D0 and CDF collaborations. Special attention is put on the
specific angular correlations between the final-state particles. We demonstrate
that the final state parton shower plays a crucial role in the description of
such observables. The decorrelated part of angular separations can be fully
described, if the process $gg^*\rightarrow gg$ is included.
