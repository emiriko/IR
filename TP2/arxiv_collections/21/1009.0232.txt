After a brief update on the prospects for dark matter in the constrained
version of the MSSM (CMSSM) and its differences with models based on minimal
supergravity (mSUGRA), I will consider the effects of unifying the
supersymmetry-breaking parameters at a scale above M_{GUT}. One of the
consequences of superGUT unification, is the ability to take vanishing scalar
masses at the unification scale with a neutralino LSP dark matter candidate.
This allows one to resurrect no-scale supergravity as a viable phenomenological
model.
