We present stationary, nonextremal three charge rotating black hole solutions
in the five-dimensional U(1)^3 ungauged supergravity. At infinity, our
solutions behave as a four-dimensional flat spacetime with a compact
extra-dimension and hence describe spherical black holes with Kaluza-Klein
asymptotics.
