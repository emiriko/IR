A Lorentz violating modification of massless QED is proposed, with higher
order space derivatives for the photon field. The fermion dynamical mass
generation is studied with the Schwinger-Dyson approach, and it is found that
the resulting mass is many orders of magnitude smaller than the (Plank-) mass
scale introduced by the higher order derivative terms. This is due to a
suppressing factor, non-analytic in the fine structure constant and
exponentially small. This scenario is an alternative to the Higgs mechanism for
the electron mass, which arises here from Lorentz violating effects at high
energies.
