Ferromagnetic insulator Pr0.8Ca0.2Mn1-yCoyO3 (0 <= y <= 0.7) thin films were
epitaxially grown on (LaAlO3)0.3-(SrAl0.5Ta0.5O3)0.7 (100) substrates by pulsed
laser deposition. To probe the ferromagnetic insulator state of hole-doped
manganites, the Co content dependences of the structural, magnetic, and
transport properties were studied. Variation of lattice constant by the
substitution of Co ions is well reproduced considering that divalent and
trivalent Co ions substitute for Mn ions at the perovskite B-sites. For 0 <= y
<= 0.3, the Curie temperature, saturation magnetization, and magnetoresistance
increase with increasing Co content, retaining the insulating properties.
Detailed analyses of transport and magnetic properties indicate the
contribution of both double exchange and superexchange interactions to the
appearance of the ferromagnetic insulating phase.
