Magnetic Bright Points (MBPs) are among the smallest observable objects on
the solar photosphere. A combination of G-band observations and numerical
simulations is used to determine their area distribution. An automatic
detection algorithm, employing 1-dimensional intensity profiling, is utilized
to identify these structures in the observed and simulated datasets. Both
distributions peak at an area of $\approx$45000 km$^2$, with a sharp decrease
towards smaller areas. The distributions conform with log-normal statistics,
which suggests that flux fragmentation dominates over flux convergence.
Radiative magneto-convection simulations indicate an independence in the MBP
area distribution for differing magnetic flux densities. The most commonly
occurring bright point size corresponds to the typical width of intergranular
lanes.
