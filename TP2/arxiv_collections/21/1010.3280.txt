We present an analytical model of a magnetar as a high density magnetized
quark bag. The effect of strong magnetic fields (B > 5 x 10^{16} G) in the
equation of state is considered. An analytic expression for the Mass-Radius
relationship is found from the energy variational principle in general
relativity. Our results are compared with observational evidences of possible
quark and/or hybrid stars.
