We use the gauge/gravity correspondence to study the screening of a heavy
quark-antiquark pair in various strongly coupled plasmas. Besides N=4 super
Yang-Mills theory and the corresponding AdS_5 space we also study theories
obtained as deformations of AdS_5, among them in particular a class of
deformations solving supergravity equations of motion. We consider the
dependence of the screening distance on the velocity and the orientation of the
pair in the plasma. The value of the screening distance in N=4 SYM is found to
be a minimum in the class of theories under consideration for all kinematic
parameters.
