Using first-principles methods we performed a theoretical study of carbon
clusters in silicon carbide nanowires. We examined small clusters with carbon
interstitials and antisites in hydrogen-passivated SiC nanowires growth along
the [100] and [111] directions. The formation energies of these clusters were
calculated as a function of the carbon concentration. We verified that the
energetic stability of the carbon defects in SiC nanowires depends strongly on
the composition of the nanowire surface: the energetically most favorable
configuration in carbon-coated [100] SiC nanowire is not expected to occur in
silicon-coated [100] SiC nanowire. The binding energies of some aggregates were
also obtained, and they indicate that the formation of carbon clusters in SiC
nanowires is energetically favored.
