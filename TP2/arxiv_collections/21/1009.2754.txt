Motivated by a recent experiment [J. W. A. Robinson, J. D. S. Witt and M. G.
Blamire, Science, \textbf{329}, 5987 (2010)], we here study the possibility of
establishing a long-range spin-triplet supercurrent through an inhomogeneous
ferromagnetic region consisting of a Ho$\mid$Co$\mid$Ho trilayer sandwiched
between two conventional s-wave superconductors. We utilize a full numerical
solution in the diffusive regime of transport and study the behavior of the
supercurrent for various experimentally relevant configurations of the
ferromagnetic trilayer. We obtain qualitatively very good agreement with
experimental data regarding the behavior of the supercurrent as a function of
the width of the Co-layer, $L_\text{Co}$. Moreover, we find a synthesis of
0-$\pi$ oscillations with superimposed rapid oscillations when varying the
width of the Ho-layer which pertain specifically to the spiral magnetization
texture in Ho. We are not able to reproduce the anomalous peaks in the
supercurrent observed experimentally in this regime, but note that the results
obtained are quite sensitive to the exact magnetization profile in the
Ho-layers, which could be the reason for the discrepancy between our model and
the experimental reported data for this particular aspect. We also investigate
the supercurrent in a system where the intrinsically inhomogeneous Ho
ferromagnets are replaced with domain-wall ferromagnets, and find similar
behavior as in the Ho$\mid$Co$\mid$Ho case. Furthermore, we propose a novel
type of magnetic Josephson junction including only a domain-wall ferromagnet
and a homogeneous ferromagnetic layer, which in addition to simplicity
regarding the magnetization profile also offers a tunable long-range
spin-triplet supercurrent. Finally, we discuss some experimental aspects of our
findings.
