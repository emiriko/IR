Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) class of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is
generally radio-quiet, but a small percent of them are radio-loud. The recent
discovery by Fermi/LAT of high-energy gamma-ray emission from 4 NLS1s proved
the existence of relativistic jets in these systems. It is therefore important
to study this new class of gamma-ray emitting AGNs. Here we report preliminary
results about the observations of the July 2010 gamma-ray outburst of PMN
J0948+0022, when the source flux exceeded for the first time 10^-6 ph cm^-2
s^-1 (E > 100 MeV).
