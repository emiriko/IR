Third harmonic generation microscopy has been used to analyze the morphology
of photonic structures created using the femtosecond laser direct-write
technique. Three dimensional waveguide arrays and waveguide-Bragg gratings
written in fused-silica and doped phosphate glass were investigated. A
sensorless adaptive optical system was used to correct the optical aberrations
occurring in the sample and microscope system, which had a lateral resolution
of less than 500 nm. This non-destructive testing method creates volume
reconstructions of photonic devices and reveals details invisible to other
linear microscopy and index profilometry techniques.
