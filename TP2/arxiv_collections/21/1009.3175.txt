We compare the yields of Ti44 and Ni56 produced from post-processing the
thermodynamic trajectories from three different core-collapse models -- a
Cassiopeia A progenitor, a double shock hypernova progenitor, and a rotating 2D
explosion -- with the yields from exponential and power-law trajectories. The
peak temperatures and densities achieved in these core-collapse models span
several of the distinct nucleosynthesis regions we identify, resulting in
different trends in the Ti44 and Ni56 yields for different mass elements. The
Ti44 and Ni56 mass fraction profiles from the exponential and power-law
profiles generally explain the tendencies of the post-processed yields,
depending on which regions are traversed by the model. We find integrated
yields of Ti44 and Ni56 from the exponential and power-law trajectories are
generally within a factor 2 or less of the post-process yields. We also analyze
the influence of specific nuclear reactions on the Ti44 and Ni56 abundance
evolution. Reactions that affect all yields globally are the 3a, p(e-,nu)n and
n(e+,nubar)p. The rest of the reactions are ranked according to their degree of
impact on the synthesis of Ti44. The primary ones include Ti44(a,p)V47,
Ca40(a,g)Ti44, V45(p,g)Cr46, Ca40(a,p)Sc43, F17(a,p)Ne20, Na21(a,p)Mg24,
Sc41(p,g)Ti42, Sc43(p,g)Ti44, Ti44(p,g)V45, and Ni57(p,g)Cu58, along with
numerous weak reactions. Our analysis suggests that not all Ti44 need be
produced in an a-rich freeze-out in core-collapse events, and that reaction
rate equilibria in combination with timescale effects for the expansion profile
may account for the paucity of Ti44 observed in supernovae remnants.
