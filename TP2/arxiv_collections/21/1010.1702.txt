Faddeev and Niemi have proposed a reformulation of SU(2) Yang-Mills theory in
terms of a U(1) gauge theory with 8 off-shell degrees of freedom. We present a
solution to Faddeev and Niemi's formulation which does not solve the SU(2)
Yang-Mills Gauss constraints. This demonstrates that the proposed reformulation
is inequivalent to Yang-Mills, but instead describes Yang-Mills coupled to a
particular choice of external charge.
