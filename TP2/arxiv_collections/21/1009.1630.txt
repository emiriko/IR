Landauer's erasure principle exposes an intrinsic relation between
thermodynamics and information theory: the erasure of information stored in a
system, S, requires an amount of work proportional to the entropy of that
system. This entropy, H(S|O), depends on the information that a given observer,
O, has about S, and the work necessary to erase a system may therefore vary for
different observers. Here, we consider a general setting where the information
held by the observer may be quantum-mechanical, and show that an amount of work
proportional to H(S|O) is still sufficient to erase S. Since the entropy H(S|O)
can now become negative, erasing a system can result in a net gain of work (and
a corresponding cooling of the environment).
