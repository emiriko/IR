We adopt the so--called \emph{occupation number representation}, originally
used in quantum mechanics and recently considered in the description of stock
markets, in the analysis of the dynamics of love relations. We start with a
simple model, involving two actors (Alice and Bob): in the linear case we
obtain periodic dynamics, whereas in the nonlinear regime either periodic or
quasiperiodic solutions are found. Then we extend the model to a love triangle
involving Alice, Bob and a third actress, Carla. Interesting features appear,
and in particular we find analytical conditions for the linear model of love
triangle to have periodic or quasiperiodic solutions. Numerical solutions are
exhibited in the nonlinear case.
