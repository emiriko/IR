We determine the nature of the magnetic quantum critical point in the doped
LaFeAsO using a set of constrained density functional calculations that provide
ab initio coefficients for a Landau order parameter analysis. The system turns
out to be remarkably close to a quantum tricritical point, where the nature of
the phase transition changes from first to second order. We compare with the
effective field theory and discuss the experimental consequences.
