We give a short overview of the phenomenology of azimuthal and transverse
single spin asymmetries in (un)polarized high-energy hadronic collisions. We
briefly summarize a transverse momentum dependent, generalized parton model
approach to these polarization phenomena, and discuss some of its applications.
Finally, open points and future developments will be outlined.
