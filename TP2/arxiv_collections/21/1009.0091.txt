The electronic structure and structural evolution of hydrogenated graphene
are investigated by Raman spectroscopy with multiple excitations. The
excitation energy dependent saturation effect on the ratio of integrated
intensities of D and G modes (ID/IG) is revealed and further developed as a
quick method for estimation of inter-defect distance and defect density in
hydrogenated graphene. At low hydrogen coverage, the chemisorbed H atoms behave
like defects in sp2 C=C matrix; while for a high hydrogen coverage, the sp3 C-H
bonds become coalescent clusters, resulting in confinement effect on the sp2 C
domains. Electronic structure changes caused by varying hydrogen coverage are
evidenced by excitation energy dependent red shift of D and 2D bands. Our
results provide a useful guide for developing applications of hydrogenated
graphene, as well as using Raman spectroscopy as quick metrology of the defect
density in further exploring other kinds of graphene derivatives.
