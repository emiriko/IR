We consider the quantum phase transition between a Neel antiferromagnet and a
valence-bond solid (VBS) in a two-dimensional system of S=1/2 spins. Assuming
that the excitations of the critical ground state are linearly dispersing
deconfined spinons obeying Bose statistics, we derive expressions for the
specific heat and the magnetic susceptibility at low temperature T. Comparing
with quantum Monte Carlo results for the J-Q model, which is a candidate for a
deconfined Neel-VBS transition, we find excellent agreement, including a
previously noted logarithmic correction in the susceptibility. In our
treatment, this is a direct consequence of a confinement length scale Lambda
which is proportional to the correlation length xi raised to a non-trivial
power; Lambda ~ xi^(1+a) ~1/T^(1+a), with a>0 (with a approximately 0.2 in the
model).
