The heavy-quark QCD sum rules are applied to a model of charmonium based upon
the gauge/gravity duality. We find that there is strong agreement between the
moments of the polarization function calculated from the holographic model and
the experimental data suggesting that the model is consistent with the
heavy-quark QCD sum rules at zero temperature.
