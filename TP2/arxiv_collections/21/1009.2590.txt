In a recent paper Yanagisawa et al. [1] claim from a theoretical analysis of
a multi-channel multi-band superconductor model that an inverse isotope
exponent on the superconducting transition temperature Tc can be realized in
iron-based superconductors. Simultaneously, a subgroup of the authors of Ref. 1
performed the corresponding isotope effect experiment on (Ba, K)Fe2As2 by
investigating the iron isotope exchange effect on Tc [2]. In accordance with
their theoretical analysis they indeed report an unusually large sign reversed
isotope exponent of {\alpha} \simeq -0.18(3) which is in strong contrast to
previous experiments on the nominally same system with the same composition in
Ba, K content, namely Ba0.6K0.4Fe2As2 [3], where the exponent was determined to
be {\alpha} \simeq 0.37(3). This conflict remains unsolved until now with the
exception of Ref. 4 where the iron isotope exponent has been determined for
FeSe. In accordance with the results of Ref. 3 a large positive isotope
exponent has been seen thus questioning the outcome of Ref. 1 and implicitly
the findings of Ref. 2. Here, we do not comment on the controversial
experimental situation but address the theoretical analysis of Ref. 1, where a
variety of misleading assumptions have led to the conclusion that a sign
reversed isotope exponent can be realized in a multi-band and multi-channel
attractive model for iron based superconductors.
