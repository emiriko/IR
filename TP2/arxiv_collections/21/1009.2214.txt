We study the electromagnetic and gravitational fields of the proton and
electron in terms of the Einstenian gravity via the introduction of an
arbitrary Lande $g$-factor in the Kerr-Newman solution. We show that at length
scales of the order of the reduced Compton wavelength, corrections from
different values of the $g$-factor are not negligible and discuss the presence
of general relativistic effects in highly ionized heavy atoms. On the other
hand, since at the Compton-wavelength scale the gravitational field becomes
spin dominated rather than mass dominated, we also point out the necessity of
including angular momentum as a source of corrections to Newtonian gravity in
the quantum description of gravity at this scale.
