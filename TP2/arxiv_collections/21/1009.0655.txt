This paper presents one suggestion that comprises the authors' experience in
development and implementation of systems for information security in the
Automated Information Systems of the Bulgarian Armed Forces. The architecture
of risk analysis and assessment system for the communication and information
system's information security (CIS IS) has been presented. E-net model of
"Defining" Subsystem as a tool that allows to examine the subsystems is
proposed as well. Such approach can be applied successfully for communication
and information systems in the business field.
