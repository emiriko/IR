Using a custom 3 \v{C}erenkov-ring fitter, we report cross sections for
$\nu_\mu$-induced charged-current single $\pi^0$ production on mineral oil
(\chtwo) from a sample of 5810 candidate events with 57% signal purity over an
energy range of $0.5-2.0$GeV. This includes measurements of the absolute total
cross section as a function of neutrino energy, and flux-averaged differential
cross sections measured in terms of $Q^2$, $\mu^-$ kinematics, and $\pi^0$
kinematics. The sample yields a flux-averaged total cross section of
$(9.2\pm0.3_{stat.}\pm1.5_{syst.})\times10^{-39}$cm$^2$/CH$_2$ at mean neutrino
energy of 0.965GeV.
