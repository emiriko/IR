In this paper, we study a weakly dissipative variant of the periodic
Degasperis-Procesi equation. We show the local well-posedness of the associated
Cauchy problem in $H^s(\S)$, $s>3/2$, and discuss the precise blow-up scenario
for $s=3$. We also present explicit examples for globally existing solutions
and blow-up.
