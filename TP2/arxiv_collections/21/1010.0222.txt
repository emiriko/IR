For the first time to our knowledge, we demonstrate fast magnetic
reconnection near a magnetic null point in a fluid model of collisionless pair
plasma without resorting to the contrivance of anomalous resistivity. In
particular, we demonstrate that fast reconnection occurs in an anisotropic
adiabatic two-fluid model of collisionless pair plasma with relaxation toward
isotropy for a broad range of isotropization rates. For very rapid
isotropization we see fast reconnection, but instabilities eventually arise
that cause numerical error and cast doubt on the simulated behavior.
