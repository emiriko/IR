By detecting the beginning of electron pairs with nuclear emulsion, precise
gamma-ray direction and gamma-ray polarization can be detected. With recent
advancement in emulsion scanning system, emulsion analyzing capability is
becoming powerful. Now we are developing the balloon-borne gamma-ray telescope
with nuclear emulsion. Overview and status of our telescope is described.
