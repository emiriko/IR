In this article, we prove that in the Baire category sense, measures
supported by the unit cube of $\R^d$ typically satisfy a multifractal
formalism. To achieve this, we compute explicitly the multifractal spectrum of
such typical measures $\mu$. This spectrum appears to be linear with slope 1,
starting from 0 at exponent 0, ending at dimension $d$ at exponent $d$, and it
indeed coincides with the Legendre transform of the $L^q$-spectrum associated
with typical measures $\mu$.
