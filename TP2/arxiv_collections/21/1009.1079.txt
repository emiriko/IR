The theoretical description of a Raman amplifier based on the vector model of
randomly birefringent fibers is proposed and applied to the characterization of
Raman polarizers. The Raman polarizer is a special type of Raman amplifier with
the property of producing a highly repolarized beam when fed by relatively weak
and unpolarized light.
