Causal inference approaches in systems genetics exploit quantitative trait
loci (QTL) genotypes to infer causal relationships among phenotypes. The
genetic architecture of each phenotype may be complex, and poorly estimated
genetic architectures may compromise the inference of causal relationships
among phenotypes. Existing methods assume QTLs are known or inferred without
regard to the phenotype network structure. In this paper we develop a
QTL-driven phenotype network method (QTLnet) to jointly infer a causal
phenotype network and associated genetic architecture for sets of correlated
phenotypes. Randomization of alleles during meiosis and the unidirectional
influence of genotype on phenotype allow the inference of QTLs causal to
phenotypes. Causal relationships among phenotypes can be inferred using these
QTL nodes, enabling us to distinguish among phenotype networks that would
otherwise be distribution equivalent. We jointly model phenotypes and QTLs
using homogeneous conditional Gaussian regression models, and we derive a
graphical criterion for distribution equivalence. We validate the QTLnet
approach in a simulation study. Finally, we illustrate with simulated data and
a real example how QTLnet can be used to infer both direct and indirect effects
of QTLs and phenotypes that co-map to a genomic region.
