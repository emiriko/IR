We investigate the effects of point and line defects in monolayer graphene
within the framework of the Hubbard model, using a self-consistent mean field
theory. These defects are found to induce characteristic patterns into the
electronic density of states and cause non-uniform distributions of magnetic
moments in the vicinity of the impurity sites. Specifically, defect induced
resonance bound states in the local density of states are observed at energies
close to the Dirac points. The magnitudes of the frequencies of these resonance
states are shown to decrease with the strength of the scattering potential,
whereas their amplitudes decay algebraically with increasing distance from the
defect. For the case of defect clusters, we observe that with increasing defect
cluster size the local magnetic moments in the vicinity of the cluster center
are strongly enhanced. Furthermore, non-trivial impurity induced magnetic
patterns are observed in the presence of line defects: zigzag line defects are
found to introduce stronger-amplitude magnetic patterns than armchair line
defects. When the scattering strength of these topological defects is
increased, the induced patterns of magnetic moments become more strongly
localized.
