We here extend the well known Positive Real Lemma (also known as the
Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov Lemma) to complex matrix-valued generalized positive
rational function, when non-minimal realizations are considered. We then
exploit this result to provide an easy construction procedure of all (not
necessarily minimal) state space realizations of generalized positive
functions. As a by-product, we partition all state space realizations into
subsets: Each is identified with a set of matrices satisfying the same Lyapunov
inclusion and thus form a convex invertible cone, cic in short. Moreover, this
approach enables us to characterize systems which may be brought to be
generalized positive through static output feedback. The formulation through
Lyapunov inclusions suggests the introduction of an equivalence class of
rational functions of various dimensions associated with the same system
matrix.
