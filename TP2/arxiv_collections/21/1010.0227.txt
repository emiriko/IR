Both particle physics and the 1890s Seeliger-Neumann modification of
Newtonian gravity suggest considering a "mass term" for gravity, yielding a
finite range due to an exponentially decaying Yukawa potential. Unlike
Nordstr\"{o}m's "massless" theory, massive scalar gravities are strictly
Special Relativistic, being invariant under the Poincar\'{e} group but not the
conformal group. Geometry is a poor guide to understanding massive scalar
gravities: matter sees a conformally flat metric, but gravity also sees the
rest of the flat metric, barely, in the mass term. Infinitely many theories
exhibit this bimetric 'geometry,' all with the total stress-energy's trace as
source. All are new except the Freund-Nambu theory. The smooth massless limit
indicates underdetermination of theories by data between massless and massive
scalar gravities. The ease of accommodating electrons, protons and other
fermions using density-weighted Ogievetsky-Polubarinov spinors in scalar
gravity is noted.
