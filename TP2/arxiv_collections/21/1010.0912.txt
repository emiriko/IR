We study the beta functions of the leading, two-derivative terms of the
left-gauged SU(N) nonlinear sigma-model in d dimensions. In d>2, we find the
usual Gaussian ultraviolet fixed point for the gauge coupling and an attractive
non-Gaussian fixed point for the Goldstone boson coupling. The position of the
latter fixed point controls the chiral expansion, unitarity and the strength of
the tree-level Goldstone boson scattering amplitudes. Attention is paid to the
gauge- and scheme-dependence of the results.
