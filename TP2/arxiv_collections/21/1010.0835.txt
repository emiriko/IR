We present the theoretical results on the forward Lambda_b production in pp
collisions obtained within the soft QCD, namely the quark gluon string model,
at LHC energies. It can give us useful information on the Regge trajectories of
the (b{\bar b}) mesons. An opportunity to find the information on the intrinsic
charm and bottom in the proton by analyzing the forward heavy flavour hadron
production in pp collisions is discussed.
