The results of the third phase of the Super-Kamiokande solar neutrino
measurement are presented and compared to the first and second phase results.
With improved detector calibrations, a full detector simulation, and improved
analysis methods, the systematic uncertainty on the total neutrino flux is
estimated to be ?2.1%, which is about two thirds of the systematic uncertainty
for the first phase of Super-Kamiokande. The observed 8B solar flux in the 5.0
to 20 MeV total electron energy region is 2.32+/-0.04 (stat.)+/-0.05 (sys.)
*10^6 cm^-2sec^-1, in agreement with previous measurements. A combined
oscillation analysis is carried out using SK-I, II, and III data, and the
results are also combined with the results of other solar neutrino experiments.
The best-fit oscillation parameters are obtained to be sin^2 {\theta}12 =
0.30+0.02-0.01(tan^2 {\theta}12 = 0.42+0.04 -0.02) and {\Delta}m2_21 =
6.2+1.1-1.9 *10^-5eV^2. Combined with KamLAND results, the best-fit oscillation
parameters are found to be sin^2 {\theta}12 = 0.31+/-0.01(tan^2 {\theta}12 =
0.44+/-0.03) and {\Delta}m2_21 = 7.6?0.2*10^-5eV^2 . The 8B neutrino flux
obtained from global solar neutrino experiments is
5.3+/-0.2(stat.+sys.)*10^6cm^-2s^-1, while the 8B flux becomes
5.1+/-0.1(stat.+sys.)*10^6cm^-2s^-1 by adding KamLAND result. In a three-flavor
analysis combining all solar neutrino experiments, the upper limit of sin^2
{\theta}13 is 0.060 at 95% C.L.. After combination with KamLAND results, the
upper limit of sin^2 {\theta}13 is found to be 0.059 at 95% C.L..
