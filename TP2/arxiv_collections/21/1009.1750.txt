We discuss a general treatment based on the mean field plus random phase
approximation (RPA) for the evaluation of subsystem entropies and negativities
in ground states of spin systems. The approach leads to a tractable general
method, becoming straightforward in translationally invariant arrays. The
method is examined in arrays of arbitrary spin with $XYZ$ couplings of general
range in a uniform transverse field, where the RPA around both the normal and
parity breaking mean field state, together with parity restoration effects, are
discussed in detail. In the case of a uniformly connected $XYZ$ array of
arbitrary size, the method is shown to provide simple analytic expressions for
the entanglement entropy of any global bipartition, as well as for the
negativity between any two subsystems, which become exact for large spin. The
limit case of a spin $s$ pair is also discussed.
