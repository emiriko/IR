A theory of flexibility and rigidity is developed for general infinite
bar-joint frameworks (G,p). Determinations of nondeformability through
vanishing flexibility are obtained as well as sufficient conditions for
deformability. Forms of infinitesimal flexibility are defined in terms of the
operator theory of the associated infinite rigidity matrix R(G,p). The
matricial symbol function of an abstract crystal framework is introduced, being
the matrix-valued function on the $d$-torus representing R(G,p) as a Hilbert
space operator. The symbol function is related to infinitesimal flexibility,
deformability and isostaticity. Various generic abstract crystal frameworks
which are in Maxwellian equilibrium, such as certain 4-regular planar
frameworks, are proven to be square-summably infinitesimally rigid as well as
smoothly deformable in infinitely many ways. The symbol function of a
three-dimensional crystal framework determines the infinitesimal wave flexes in
models for the low energy vibrational modes (RUMs) in material crystals. For
crystal frameworks with inversion symmetry it is shown that the RUMS appear in
surfaces, generalising a result of F. Wegner for tetrahedral crystals.
