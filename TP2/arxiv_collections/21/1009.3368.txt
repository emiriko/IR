A new (1+1)-dimensional integrable system, i. e. the super coupled
Korteweg-de Vries (cKdV) system, has been constructed by a super extension of
the well-known (1+1)-dimensional cKdV system. For this new system, a novel
symmetry constraint between the potential and eigenfunction can be obtained by
means of the binary nonlinearization of its Lax pairs. The constraints for even
variables are explicit and the constraints for odd variables are implicit.
Under the symmetry constraint, the spacial part and the temporal parts of the
equations associated with the Lax pairs for the super cKdV system can be
decomposed into the super finite-dimensional integrable Hamiltonian systems on
the supersymmetry manifold $R^{4N|2N+2}$, whose integrals of motion are
explicitly given.
