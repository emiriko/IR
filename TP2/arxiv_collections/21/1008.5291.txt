Using previous results concerning the rank two and rank three cases, all
connected simply connected Cartan schemes for which the real roots form a
finite irreducible root system of arbitrary rank are determined. As a
consequence one obtains the list of all crystallographic arrangements, a large
subclass of the class of simplicial hyperplane arrangements. Supposing that the
rank is at least three, the classification yields Cartan schemes of type $A$
and $B$, an infinite family of series involving the types $C$ and $D$, and $74$
sporadic examples.
