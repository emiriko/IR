IC 10 is the nearest starburst irregular galaxy remarkable for its
anomalously high number of WR stars. We report the results of an analysis of
the emission spectra of HII-regions ionized by star clusters and WR stars based
on observations made with the 6-m telescope of the Special Astrophysical
Observatory of the Russian Academy of Sciences using MPFS field spectrograph
and SCORPIO focal reducer operating in the slit spectrograph mode. We determine
the masses and ages of ionizing star clusters in the violent star-forming
region of the galaxy in terms of the new evolutionary models of emission-line
spectra of HII-regions developed by Martin-Manjon et al. (2010). We estimate
the amount of stars needed to ionize the gas in the brightest HII-region HL 111
and report new determinations of oxygen abundance in HII regions.
