We present an experimental study of the anisotropic resistivity of
superconducting La(2-x)Ba(x)CuO(4) with x=0.095 and transition temperature
Tc=32 K. In a magnetic field perpendicular to the CuO(2) layers, H(perp), we
observe that the resistivity perpendicular to the layers, \rho(perp), becomes
finite at a temperature consistent with previous studies on very similar
materials; however, the onset of finite parallel resistivity, \rho(par), occurs
at a much higher temperature. This behavior contradicts conventional theory,
which predicts that \rho(perp) and \rho(par) should become finite at the same
temperature. Voltage vs. current measurements near the threshold of voltage
detectability indicate linear behavior perpendicular to the layers, becoming
nonlinear at higher currents, while the behavior is nonlinear from the onset
parallel to the layers. These results, in the presence of moderate H(perp),
appear consistent with superconducting order parallel to the layers with
voltage fluctuations between the layers due to thermal noise. In search of
uncommon effects that might help to explain this behavior, we have performed
diffraction measurements that provide evidence for H(perp)-induced charge and
spin stripe order. The field-induced decoupling of superconducting layers is
similar to the decoupled phase observed previously in La(2-x)Ba(x)CuO(4) with
x=1/8 in zero field.
