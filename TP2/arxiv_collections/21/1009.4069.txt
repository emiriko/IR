This article presents an overview of current understanding of the interaction
of low-energy positrons with molecules with emphasis on resonances, positron
attachment and annihilation. Annihilation rates measured as a function of
positron energy reveal the presence of vibrational Feshbach resonances (VFR)
for many polyatomic molecules. These resonances lead to strong enhancement of
the annihilation rates. They also provide evidence that positrons bind to many
molecular species. A quantitative theory of VFR-mediated attachment to small
molecules is presented. It is tested successfully for selected molecules (e.g.,
methyl halides and methanol) where all modes couple to the positron continuum.
Combination and overtone resonances are observed and their role is elucidated.
In larger molecules, annihilation rates from VFR far exceed those explicable on
the basis of single-mode resonances. These enhancements increase rapidly with
the number of vibrational degrees of freedom. While the details are as yet
unclear, intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution to states that do not
couple directly to the positron continuum appears to be responsible for these
enhanced annihilation rates. Downshifts of the VFR from the vibrational mode
energies have provided binding energies for thirty species. Their dependence
upon molecular parameters and their relationship to positron-atom and
positron-molecule binding energy calculations are discussed. Feshbach
resonances and positron binding to molecules are compared with the analogous
electron-molecule (negative ion) cases. The relationship of VFR-mediated
annihilation to other phenomena such as Doppler-broadening of the gamma-ray
annihilation spectra, annihilation of thermalized positrons in gases, and
annihilation-induced fragmentation of molecules is discussed.
