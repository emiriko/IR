The total cross-sections of the reaction e+e- --> W+W-, as measured at LEP-II
at centre-of-mass energies between 183 and 207 GeV are used to derive the upper
limits on the parameters of CP-violating (P-odd and C-even) triple gauge-boson
couplings WW\gamma and WWZ. The 95% CL limits |\widetilde{\kappa}_Z|<0.13 and
|\widetilde{\lambda}_Z|<0.31 are obtained assuming local SU(2)_L x U(1)_Y gauge
invariance. Our results are comparable with the previous ones obtained through
the analysis of the W decay products. We also discuss the upper limits on the
electric dipole moment (EDM) of the W-boson, which follow from the precision
measurements of the electron and neutron EDM.
