It is shown that unconventional critical phenomena commonly observed in
paramagnetic metals YbRh2Si2, YbRh2(Si0.95Ge0.05)2, and beta-YbAlB4 is
naturally explained by the quantum criticality of Yb-valence fluctuations. We
construct the mode coupling theory taking account of local correlation effects
of f electrons and find that unconventional criticality is caused by the
locality of the valence fluctuation mode. We show that measured low-temperature
anomalies such as divergence of uniform spin susceptibility $\chi T^{-\zeta)$
with $\zeta~0.6$ giving rise to a huge enhancement of the Wilson ratio and the
emergence of T-linear resistivity are explained in a unified way.
