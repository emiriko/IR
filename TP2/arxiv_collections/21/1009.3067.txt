We study light emission properties of a population-inverted 2D electron-hole
plasma in a quantizing magnetic field. We observe a series of superfluorescent
bursts, discrete both in time and energy, corresponding to the cooperative
recombination of electron-hole pairs from different Landau levels. The emission
energies are strongly renormalized due to many-body interactions among the
photogenerated carriers, exhibiting red-shifts as large as 20 meV at 15 T.
However, the magnetic field dependence of the lowest Landau level emission line
remains excitonic at all magnetic fields. Interestingly, our time-resolved
measurements show that this lowest-energy burst occurs only after all upper
states become empty, suggesting that this excitonic stability is related to the
`hidden symmetry' of 2D magneto-excitons expected in the magnetic quantum
limit.
