We report on a dusty Mg~II absorber associated with the quasar
SDSSJ003545.13+011441.2 (hereafter J0035+0114) at $z$=1.5501, which is the
strongest one among the three Mg~II absorbers along the sight line of quasar.
The two low redshift intervening absorbers are at $z$=0.7436, 0.5436,
respectively. Based on the photometric and spectroscopic data of Sloan Digital
Sky Survey (hereafter SDSS), we infer the rest frame color excess E(\bv) due to
the associated dust is more than 0.07 by assuming a Small Magellanic Cloud
(hereafter SMC) type extinction curve. Our follow-up moderate resolution
spectroscopic observation at the 10-m Keck telescope with the ESI spectrometer
enable us to reliably identify most of the important metal elements, such as
Zn, Fe, Mn, Mg, Al, Si, Cr, and Ni in the associated system. We measure the
column density of each species and detect significant dust depletion. In
addition, we develop a simulation technique to gauge the significance of
2175-{\AA} dust absorption bump on the SDSS quasar spectra. By using it, we
analyze the SDSS spectrum of J0035+0114 for the presence of a associated
2175-{\AA} extinction feature and report a tentative detection at
$\sim$2$\sigma$ significant level.
