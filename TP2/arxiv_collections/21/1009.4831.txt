Measurements with a one-electron quantum cyclotron determine the electron
magnetic moment, given by $g/2 =
1.001\,159\,652\,180\,73\,(28)\,[0.28~\textrm{ppt}]$, and the fine structure
constant, $\alpha^{-1}=137.035\,999\,084\,(51)\,[0.37~\textrm{ppb}]$. Brief
announcements of these measurements are supplemented here with a more complete
description of the one-electron quantum cyclotron and the new measurement
methods, a discussion of the cavity control of the radiation field, a summary
of the analysis of the measurements, and a fuller discussion of the
uncertainties.
