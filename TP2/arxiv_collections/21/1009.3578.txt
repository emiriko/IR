Scalar fields on a two dimensional curved surface are considered and the
canonical structure of this theory analyzed. Both the first and second order
forms of the Einstein-Hilbert (EH) action for the metric are used (these being
inequivalent in two dimensions). The Dirac constraint formalism is used to find
the generator of the gauge transformation, using the formalisms of Henneaux,
Teitelboim and Zanelli (HTZ) and of Castellani (C). The HTZ formalism is
slightly modified in the case of the first order EH action to accommodate the
gauge transformation of the metric; this gauge transformation is unusual as it
mixes the affine connection with the scalar field.
