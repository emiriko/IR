This paper is intended to show that a review in the concept of the game
theoretical utility, the revised utility to be applied to the definition of the
utility of a wave function representing an object subsystem relative to its
observer subsystem, both within an isolated system, leads to the emergence of
the Max Born's rule as a profit under a von Neumann's good measure game.
