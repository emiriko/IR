The ionospheric influence is one of the largest error sources in GPS
positioning and navigation after closing the Selective Availability (SA).
Therefore, it is available to establish a real time ionospheric correction
model to eliminate or mitigate the ionospheric influence. In this paper, a new
method, Hardy Function Interpolation method, is presented to establish a high
precision grid ionospheric model (GIM) over the Yangtze River Delta using
continuous GPS data of SIGAN network, and the internal and external accuracy of
TEC from the GIM are evaluated. It has shown that the real time and high
precision GIM over the Yangtze River delta is well established using the Hardy
Function Interpolation. The internal and external accuracy of TEC from the GIM
are all smaller than 0.3m and better than the methods of distance weight
function of WAAS and spherical harmonic function. In addition, these methods
are further used to initially investigate and analyze the seasonal variations
of TEC over Yangtze River delta.
