Based on the new quantum Vavilov-Cherenkov,s radiation(VCR) theory
(PRL,2004),it is stated the possibility of threshold realization in the modern
epoch of the novel VCR effect by the relict photon gas, when it is traversed by
relativistic particles of the cosmic rays with \gamma \geq \gamma_th \cong 2
\cdot 10^10, where \gamma^2 = 1 - \frac{V^2}{C^2}, v is the speed of particles,
and c is the speed of the light in vacuum.
