We have performed time-of-flight neutron scattering measurements on powder
samples of the unconventional spin-Peierls compound TiOBr using the
fine-resolution Fermi chopper spectrometer (SEQUOIA) at the SNS. These
measurements reveal two branches of magnetic excitations within the
commensurate and incommensurate spin-Peierls phases, which we associate with n
= 1 and n = 2 triplet excitations out of the singlet ground state. These
measurements represent the first direct measure of the singlet-triplet energy
gap in TiOBr, which is determined to be Eg = 21.2 +/- 1.0 meV.
