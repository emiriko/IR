A fraction of gamma-ray bursts exhibit distinct spectral features in their
prompt emission below few 10s of keV that exceed simple extrapolations of the
low-energy power-law portion of the Band spectral model. This is also true for
the prompt optical emission observed in several bursts. Through Monte Carlo
simulations, we model such low-energy spectral excess components as hadronic
cascade emission initiated by photomeson interactions of ultra-high-energy
protons accelerated within GRB outflows. Synchrotron radiation from the
cascading, secondary electron-positron pairs can naturally reproduce the
observed soft spectra in the X-ray band, and in some cases the optical spectra
as well. These components can be directly related to the higher energy
radiation at GeV energies due to the hadronic cascades. Depending on the
spectral shape, the total energy in protons is required to be comparable to or
appreciably larger than the observed total photon energy. In particular, we
apply our model to the excess X-ray and GeV emission of GRB 090902B, and the
bright optical emission of the "naked-eye" GRB 080319B. Besides the hard GeV
components detected by {\it Fermi}, such X-ray or optical spectral excesses are
further potential signatures of ultra-high-energy cosmic ray production in
gamma-ray bursts.
