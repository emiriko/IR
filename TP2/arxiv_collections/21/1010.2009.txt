We demonstrate on-demand control of localized surface plasmons in
metamaterials by means of incident light polarization. An asymmetric mode,
selectively excited by s-polarized light, interfere destructively with a bright
element, thereby allowing the incident light to propagate at a fairly low loss,
corresponding to electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) in an atomic
system. In contrast, a symmetric mode, excited by p-polarized light, directly
couples with the incident light, which is analogous to the switch-off of EIT.
The light polarization-dependent excitation of asymmetric and symmetric plasmon
modes holds potential for active switching applications of plasmon
hybridization.
