We report results of investigation of the low-frequency excess noise in
device channels made from topological insulators - a new class of materials
with a bulk insulating gap and conducting surface states. The thin-film bismuth
selenide samples were prepared by the "graphene-like" mechanical exfoliation
from bulk crystals. The fabricated four-contact devices had linear current -
voltage characteristics in the low-bias regime. The current fluctuations had
the noise spectral density proportional to 1/f for the frequency f below 10
kHz. The noise spectral density followed the quadratic dependence on the drain
- source current. The obtained data is important for planning transport
experiments with topological insulators. We suggest that achieving the pure
topological insulator phase with the current conduction through the "protected"
surface states can lead to noise reduction via suppression of certain
scattering mechanisms.
