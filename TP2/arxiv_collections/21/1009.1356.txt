We report on the discovery of new members of nearby young moving groups,
exploiting the full power of combining the RAVE survey with several stellar age
diagnostic methods and follow-up high-resolution optical spectroscopy. The
results include the identification of one new and five likely members of the
beta Pictoris moving group, ranging from spectral types F9 to M4 with the
majority being M dwarfs, one K7 likely member of the epsilon Cha group and two
stars in the Tuc-Hor association. Based on the positive identifications we
foreshadow a great potential of the RAVE database in progressing toward a full
census of young moving groups in the solar neighbourhood.
