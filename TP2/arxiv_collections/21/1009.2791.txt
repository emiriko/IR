We analyse the relationship between nominal algebra and nominal rewriting,
giving a new and concise presentation of equational deduction in nominal
theories. With some new results, we characterise a subclass of equational
theories for which nominal rewriting provides a complete procedure to check
nominal algebra equality. This subclass includes specifications of the
lambda-calculus and first-order logic.
