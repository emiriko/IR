46 years ago the quark model replaced the Sakata model as the standard
explanation of the hadron structure. The major alleged defect of the Sakata
model was its prediction of just too many types of particles, which have not
been seen in experiments. However, this allegation was made without detailed
consideration of the forces acting between sakatons. In this article we suggest
a set of pairwise sakaton-sakaton and sakaton-antisakaton potentials that
describe stability and masses of strongly interacting elementary particles in a
good agreement with observations.
