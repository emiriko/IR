Segmentation display plays a vital role to display numerals. But in today's
world matrix display is also used in displaying numerals. Because numerals has
lots of curve edges which is better supported by matrix display. But as matrix
display is costly and complex to implement and also needs more memory, segment
display is generally used to display numerals. But as there is yet no proposed
compact display architecture to display multiple language numerals at a time,
this paper proposes uniform display architecture to display multiple language
digits and general mathematical expressions with higher accuracy and simplicity
by using a 18-segment display, which is an improvement over the 16 segment
display.
