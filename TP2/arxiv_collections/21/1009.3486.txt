The blind quantum computing protocols (BQC) enable a classical client with
limited quantum technology to delegate a computation to the quantum server(s)
in such a way that the privacy of the computation is preserved. Here we present
a new scheme for BQC that uses the concept of the measurement based quantum
computing with the novel resource state of Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT)
chains leading to more robust computation. AKLT states are physically motivated
resource as they are gapped ground states of a physically natural Hamiltonian
in condensed matter physics. Our BQC protocol can enjoy the advantages of AKLT
resource states, such as the cooling preparation of the resource state, the
energy-gap protection of the quantum computation, and the simple and efficient
preparation of the resource state in linear optics with biphotons.
