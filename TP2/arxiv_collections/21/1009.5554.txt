A systematic study of the influence of the viscous effect on both the spectra
and the nonlinear fluxes of conserved as well as non conserved quantities in
Navier-Stokes turbulence is proposed. This analysis is used to estimate the
helicity dissipation scale which is shown to coincide with the energy
dissipation scale. However, it is shown using the decomposition of helicity
into eigen modes of the curl operator, that viscous effects have to be taken
into account for wave vector smaller than the Kolomogorov wave number in the
evolution of these eigen components of the helicity.
