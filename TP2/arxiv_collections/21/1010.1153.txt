In this paper we reconsider the problem of magnetic field diffusion in
neutron star cores. We model the star as consisting of a mixture of neutrons,
protons and electrons, and allow for particle reactions and binary collisions
between species. Our analysis is in much the same spirit as that of Goldreich &
Reisenegger (1992), and we content ourselves with rough estimates of magnetic
diffusion timescales, rather than solving accurately for some particular field
geometry. However, our work improves upon previous treatments in one crucial
respect: we allow for superfluidity in the neutron star matter. We find that
the consequent mutual friction force, coupling the neutrons and charged
particles, together with the suppression of particles collisions and reactions,
drastically affect the ambipolar magnetic field diffusion timescale. In
particular, the addition of superfluidity means that it is unlikely that there
is ambipolar diffusion in magnetar cores on the timescale of the lifetimes of
these objects, contradicting an assumption often made in the modelling of the
flaring activity commonly observed in magnetars. Our work suggests that if a
decaying magnetic field is indeed the cause of magnetar activity, the field
evolution is likely to take place outside of the core, and might represent
Hall/Ohmic diffusion in the stellar crust, or else that a mechanism other than
standard ambipolar diffusion is active, e.g. flux expulsion due to the
interaction between neutron vortices and magnetic fluxtubes.
