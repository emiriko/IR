The discovery that black holes emit thermal type radiation changed radically
our perception of their behavior. Until then, their interior was considered as
causally disconnected from the rest of the universe, so any kind of
information, that went down the black hole, was believed to remain eternally
trapped in it. The emission of the aforementioned radiation means that some
amount of information eventually returns to the universe outside the black
hole. The question then rises whether it is the whole of this information that
goes back to the universe during the black hole evaporation or not. Numerous
theories supporting either information preservation or extinction have been
developed ever since. A new idea is proposed, based on a deep re-examination of
what information is and what are its properties. We postulate that not all
kinds of information are of equal importance to nature and, as a result, some
of them should be preserved under any conditions, while the rest are allowed to
be destroyed, so both preservation and destruction of information is what
actually happens during the black hole formation/evaporation process.
