The authors report on the use of carbon nanofiber nanoemitters to ionize
deuterium atoms for the generation of neutrons in a deuterium-deuterium
reaction in a preloaded target. Acceleration voltages in the range of 50-80 kV
are used. Field emission of electrons is investigated to characterize the
emitters. The experimental setup and sample preparation are described and first
data of neutron production are presented. Ongoing experiments to increase
neutron production yields by optimizing the field emitter geometry and surface
conditions are discussed.
