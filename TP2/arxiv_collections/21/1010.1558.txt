Motivated by the emittance requirements for future light sources, we show how
longitudinal-transverse correlations can be introduced to create beams with
large emittance asymmetry. This concept generalizes a key aspect of a Flat Beam
Transform, which introduces initial correlations among the transverse planes,
to systems with initial longitudinal-transverse correlations. We present an
eigen-emittance formalism to analyze such systems. We illustrate the approach
by analyzing an electron beam emitted from a photoinjector utilizing a laser
with a tilted pulse front. This approach can be used to design beam delivery
systems that achieve extraordinarily transversely bright electron beams.
