We demonstrate near-complete cancellation of the differential light shift of
a two-photon magnetic-field-insensitive microwave hyperfine (clock) transition
in $^{87}$Rb atoms trapped in an optical lattice. Up to $95(2)%$ of the
differential light shift is canceled while maintaining magnetic-field
insensitivity. This technique should have applications in quantum information
and frequency metrology.
