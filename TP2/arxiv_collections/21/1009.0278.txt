A number of authentication protocols have been proposed recently, where at
least some part of the authentication is performed during a phase, lasting $n$
rounds, with no error correction. This requires assigning an acceptable
threshold for the number of detected errors. This paper describes a framework
enabling an expected loss analysis for all the protocols in this family.
Furthermore, computationally simple methods to obtain nearly optimal value of
the threshold, as well as for the number of rounds is suggested. Finally, a
method to adaptively select both the number of rounds and the threshold is
proposed.
