We present a general description of topological insulators from the point of
view of Dirac equations. The Z_{2} index for the Dirac equation is always zero,
and thus the Dirac equation is topologically trivial. After the quadratic B
term in momentum is introduced to correct the mass term m or the band gap of
the Dirac equation, the Z_{2} index is modified as 1 for mB>0 and 0 for mB<0.
For a fixed B there exists a topological quantum phase transition from a
topologically trivial system to a non-trivial one system when the sign of mass
m changes. A series of solutions near the boundary in the modified Dirac
equation are obtained, which is characteristic of topological insulator. From
the solutions of the bound states and the Z_{2} index we establish a relation
between the Dirac equation and topological insulators.
