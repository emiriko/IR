We report on the design, fabrication and testing of two superconducting
passive microwave components, a quadrature hybrid and a 20 dB directional
coupler. These components are designed to be integrated with superconducting
qubits or Josephson parametric amplifiers and used in quantum information
processing applications. For the coupler, we measure return loss and isolation
> 20 dB, and insertion loss < 0.3 dB in a 2 GHz band around 6 GHz. For the
hybrid performance, we measure isolation > 20 dB and insertion loss < 0.3 dB in
a 10% band around 6.5 GHz. These values are within the design specifications of
our application; however, we find a 7% difference between the designed and
measured center frequency for the hybrid.
