Recent structure function results from H1 and ZEUS are presented. The data
have been recorded in e+p and e-p collisions for both Neutral Current and
Charged Current reactions, covering a wide kinematic range of squared
four-momentum transfers Q2, from 0.2GeV2 to 30000GeV2, and Bjorken x between
~5*10-6 and 0.65. Data from both experiments have been combined, leading to
significantly reduced experimental uncertainties. The combined measurements are
analysed in a NLO QCD fit, and a set of parton density functions, HERAPDF1.0,
is extracted from these data alone. New direct measurements of the structure
function FL, making use of dedicated low energy runs of the HERA machine, are
also presented. The impact of the HERA data on the parton density functions and
predictions for LHC is discussed.
