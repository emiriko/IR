We consider a semi-classical Dirac operator in arbitrary spatial dimensions
with a smooth potential whose partial derivatives of any order are bounded by
suitable constants. We prove that the distribution kernel of the inverse
operator evaluated at two distinct points fulfilling a certain hypothesis can
be represented as the product of an exponentially decaying factor involving an
associated Agmon distance and some amplitude admitting a complete asymptotic
expansion in powers of the semi-classical parameter. Moreover, we find an
explicit formula for the leading term in that expansion.
