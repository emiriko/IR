Most of the physically based techniques for rendering translucent objects use
the diffusion theory of light scattering in turbid media. The widely used
dipole diffusion model (Jensen et al. 2001) applies the diffusion-theory
formula derived for a planar interface to objects of arbitrary shapes. This
paper presents first results of our investigation of how surface curvature
affects the diffuse reflectance from translucent materials.
