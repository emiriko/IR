Recent preliminary data gathered by the Fermilab MINOS Collaboration suggest
with 95% confidence that the mass of the muon neutrino differs from that of its
antineutrino partner, which contradicts the entrenched relativistic quantum
theory notion that a free antiparticle is a negative-energy free particle
compelled to travel backwards in time. Also a discrepancy of about five
standard deviations in the value of the proton charge radius recently obtained
from muonic hydrogen versus that previously obtained from electronic hydrogen
casts doubt on the calculation of the dominant relativistic QED contributions
to the effects that are actually measured (e.g., the Lamb shift): these QED
contributions dominate proton charge radius contributions less in muonic
hydrogen than in electronic hydrogen. The negative-energy "free particles" of
entrenched relativistic quantum theory are well-known features of the
Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations, which are shown to have many other unphysical
features as well. The correspondence principle for relativistic particles is
incompatible with these two equations, produces no unphysical features and
implies only positive energies for free particles, which eliminates the very
basis of the entrenched notion of antiparticles, as well as of the CPT theorem.
This principle thus requires antiparticles to arise from charge conjugation (or
more generally CP) invariance, whose known breaking is naturally expected to
produce mass splitting between particle and antiparticle, in consonance with
the preliminary MINOS data. It also requires revamping of relativistic QED,
which is in accord with the doubt cast on it by the proton charge radius
results, and implies that QED is nonlocal, i.e. has no Hamiltonian density.
