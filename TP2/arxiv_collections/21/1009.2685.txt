The short duration (T90 < 2 s) gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) detected in the
SPI-ACS experiment onboard the INTEGRAL observatory are investigated. Averaged
light curves have been constructed for various groups of events, including
short GRBs and unidentified short events. Extended emission has been found in
the averaged light curves of both short GRBs and unidentified short events. It
is shown that the fraction of the short GRBs in the total number of SPI-ACS
GRBs can range from 30 to 45%, which is considerably larger than has been
thought previously.
