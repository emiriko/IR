I briefly review what has been recently learned from determinations of mean
stellar ages and abundances from integrated light studies of early-type
galaxies, and discuss some new questions posed by recent data. A short
discussion of spectroscopic ages is presented, but the main focus of this
review is on the abundances of Fe, Mg, Ca, N, and C, obtained from comparisons
of measurements taken in integrated spectra of galaxies with predictions from
stellar population synthesis models.
