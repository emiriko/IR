Magnetic reconnection changes the magnetic field topology and powers
explosive events in astrophysical, space and laboratory plasmas. For flares and
coronal mass ejections (CMEs) in the solar atmosphere, the standard model
predicts the presence of a reconnecting current sheet, which has been the
subject of considerable theoretical and numerical modeling over the last fifty
years, yet direct, unambiguous observational verification has been absent. In
this Letter we show a bright sheet structure of global length (>0.25 Rsun) and
macroscopic width ((5 - 10)x10^3 km) distinctly above the cusp-shaped flaring
loop, imaged during the flare rising phase in EUV. The sheet formed due to the
stretch of a transequatorial loop system, and was accompanied by various
reconnection signatures that have been dispersed in the literature. This unique
event provides a comprehensive view of the reconnection geometry and dynamics
in the solar corona.
