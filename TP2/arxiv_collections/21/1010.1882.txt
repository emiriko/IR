The copper ferrite thin films have been deposited by RF sputtering at a 50W
rf power. The As-deposited films are annealed in air at $800^{\circ}$C and then
slow cooled. The As-deposited (AD) as well as slow cooled (SC) films are
studied using a SQUID Magnetometer. The M Vs H curves have been recorded at
various temperatures between 5K to 300K. The coercivities obtained from the MH
curves are then plotted against temperature (T). The magnetization in the films
does not saturate, even at the highest field of 7T. The high field part of the
M Vs H curves is fitted using the H1/2 term of Chikazumi expression M(H)= Q*(1-
a /Hn), with n=1/2. The variation of coefficient 'a' of H1/2 term has been
observed with temperature (T). An attempt has been made to correlate this with
the coercivity (Hc) in the case of annealed films.
