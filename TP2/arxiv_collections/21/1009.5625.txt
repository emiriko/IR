Constructing appropriate unitary matrix operators for new quantum algorithms
and finding the minimum cost gate sequences for the implementation of these
unitary operators is of fundamental importance in the field of quantum
information and quantum computation. Evolution of quantum circuits faces two
major challenges: complex and huge search space and the high costs of
simulating quantum circuits on classical computers. Here, we use the group
leaders optimization algorithm to decompose a given unitary matrix into a
proper-minimum cost quantum gate sequence. We test the method on the known
decompositions of Toffoli gate, the amplification step of the Grover search
algorithm, the quantum Fourier transform, and the sender part of the quantum
teleportation. Using this procedure, we present the circuit designs for the
simulation of the unitary propagators of the Hamiltonians for the hydrogen and
the water molecules. The approach is general and can be applied to generate the
sequence of quantum gates for larger molecular systems.
