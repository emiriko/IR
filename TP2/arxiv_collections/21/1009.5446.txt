We studied the fragmentation in Au(35 AMeV)+Au collisions at reduced impact
parameters in the range b/b_max=0.55 and 0.95 using soft and hard equations of
state. The comparison of of QMD simulations at 100 fm/c as a function of
reduced impact parameter $b/b_{max}$ with Multics Miniball data showed that
soft EoS accurately reproduces the experimental trend of declining fragment
multiplicity with impact parameter. The hard EoS on the contrary, seems too
explosive to explain the data.
