We analyzed XMM-Newton observations of two center-filled supernova remnants,
G27.8+0.6 and G28.8+1.5, to search for pulsars/pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) and
other types of neutron stars associated with these remnants. We discovered a
PWN candidate within the extent of the centrally-peaked radio emission of
G27.8+0.6. The X-ray morphology of the PWN candidate and its position with
respect to the host supernova remnant suggest that the alleged pulsar might be
moving away from the supernova remnant's center with a transverse velocity of
around 100-200 km/s. The majority of the detected X-ray point sources in both
fields are classified as main-sequence stars, based on their bright optical
counterparts and relatively soft X-ray spectra. The remaining medium-hard and
hard sources are most probably either AGNs or cataclysmic variables, although
we cannot completely rule out the possibility that some of these sources are
neutron stars.
