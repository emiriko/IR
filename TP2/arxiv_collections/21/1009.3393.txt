The Multi-conjugate Adaptive optics Demonstrator, MAD, successfully
demonstrated on sky the MCAO technique both in Layer Oriented and Star Oriented
modes. As results of the Guaranteed Time Observations in Layer Oriented mode
quality astronomy papers have been published. In this paper we concentrate on
the instrumentation issues and technical aspects which stay behind this
success.
