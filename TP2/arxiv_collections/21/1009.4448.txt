The orbital degrees of freedom are of vital importance in explanation of
various phenomena. Among them is the orbital-selective Mott transition (OSMT),
which is thought to occur in several materials as Ca$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$RuO$_4$ and
La$_{n+1}$Ni${_n}$O$_{3n+1}$. OSMT is usually studied in the infinite-dimension
limit, and for the time being, it is not clear if it could survive in
one-dimensional (1D) case. There exist two scenarios for the OSMT: upon
increasing the interaction in a two-band system i) one of the bands becomes
insulating, while the other remains metallic and ii) one of the bands becomes
empty, while the other may eventually undergo a single-band Mott insulator
transition. In this work, we present a preliminary study of the two-orbital
Hubbard model by means of Density Matrix Renormalization Group in 1D at
quarter-filling, where the second scenario seems to be realized. In particular,
we study the orbital densities, double occupancies and form-factors also in the
case of finite inter-orbital inter-site hopping.
