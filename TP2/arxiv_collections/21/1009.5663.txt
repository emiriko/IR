Electromagnetic metamaterials are capable of emulating many exotic space-time
geometries, such as black holes, rotating cosmic strings, and the big bang
singularity. Here we present a metamaterial-based model of the Alcubierre warp
drive, and study its limitations due to available range of material parameters.
It appears that the material parameter range introduces strong limitations on
the achievable "warp speed", so that ordinary magnetoelectric materials cannot
be used. On the other hand, newly developed "perfect" bi-anisotropic
non-reciprocal magnetoelectric metamaterials should be capable of emulating the
physics of warp drive gradually accelerating up to 1/4c.
