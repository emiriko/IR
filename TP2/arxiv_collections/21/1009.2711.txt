The existence of bound states in the continuum was predicted at the dawn of
quantum mechanics by von Neumann and Wigner. In this work we discuss the
mechanism of formation of these exotic states and the feasibility to observe
them experimentally in symmetrical heterostructures composed by segments of
graphene ribbons with different widths forming a graphene quantum dot. We
identify the existence of bound states in the continuum in these graphene
quantum dot systems by means of local density of states and electronic
conductance calculations.
