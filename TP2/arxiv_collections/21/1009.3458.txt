Perturbation theory predicts that a massless fermion cannot possess a
measurable magnetic moment. We explain, however, that the nonperturbative
phenomenon of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking generates a momentum-dependent
anomalous chromomagnetic moment for dressed light-quarks, which is large at
infrared momenta; and demonstrate that consequently these same quarks also
possess an anomalous electromagnetic moment with similar magnitude and opposite
sign.
