We report on the effect of annealing on the temperature and field
dependencies of the low temperature specific heat of the electron-doped
Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_{x}$)$_{2}$As$_{2}$ for under-(x = 0.045), optimal- (x = 0.08)
and over-doped (x = 0.105 and 0.14) regimes. We observed that annealing
significantly improves some superconducting characteristics in
Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_{x}$)$_{2}$As$_{2}$. It considerably increases $T_{c}$,
decreases $\gamma_{0}$ in the superconducting state and suppresses the
Schottky-like contribution at very low temperatures. The improved sample
quality allows for a better identification of the superconducting gap structure
of these materials. We examine the effects of doping and annealing within a
self-consistent framework for an extended s-wave pairing scenario. At optimal
doping our data indicates the sample is fully gapped, while for both under and
overdoped samples significant low-energy excitations possibly consistent with a
nodal structure remain. The difference of sample quality offers a natural
explanation for the variation in low temperature power laws observed by many
techniques.
