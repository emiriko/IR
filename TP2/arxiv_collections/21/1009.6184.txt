We review recent insights into the dynamics of the solar convection zone
obtained from global numerical simulations, focusing on two recent developments
in particular. The first is quasi-cyclic magnetic activity in a long-duration
dynamo simulation. Although mean fields comprise only a few percent of the
total magnetic energy they exhibit remarkable order, with multiple polarity
reversals and systematic variability on time scales of 6-15 years. The second
development concerns the maintenance of the meridional circulation. Recent
high-resolution simulations have captured the subtle nonlinear dynamical
balances with more fidelity than previous, more laminar models, yielding more
coherent circulation patterns. These patterns are dominated by a single cell in
each hemisphere, with poleward and equatorward flow in the upper and lower
convection zone respectively. We briefly address the implications of and future
of these modeling efforts.
