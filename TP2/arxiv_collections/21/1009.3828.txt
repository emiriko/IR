Based on exact diagonalization data for finite quantum Heisenberg
antiferromagnets on two frustrated lattices (two-leg ladder and bilayer) and
analytical arguments we map low-energy degrees of freedom of the spin models in
a magnetic field on classical lattice-gas models. Further we use
transfer-matrix calculations and classical Monte Carlo simulations to give a
quantitative description of low-temperature thermodynamics of the quantum spin
models. The classical lattice-gas model yields an excellent description of the
quantum spin models up to quite large temperatures. The main peculiarity of the
considered frustrated bilayer is a phase transition which occurs at low
temperatures for a wide range of magnetic fields below the saturation magnetic
field and belongs to the two-dimensional Ising model universality class.
