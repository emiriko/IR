The paper studies the impact of applied magnetic field on the inelastic
collisions of electrons with argon atoms. In the electron-argon Franck-Hertz
experiment, the influence of applied magnetic field emerges complicated
features, and is equivalent to that of the temperature. In case the
accelerating electric intensity becomes strong enough, enlarging magnetic flux
density will be equivalent to the increasing of oven temperature. When the
accelerating electric intensity is very weak and the applied magnetic field
occupies a dominant position, enhancing magnetic flux density is identical with
the decreasing of oven temperature. And the non-uniform distribution of applied
magnetic field has an influence on the inelastic collision as well. The study
claims that the influence of magnetic field variation is equivalent to that of
temperature variety, and that it leads the electron energy to transfer
obviously in the experiment.
