Using the Einstein energy-mass relation and a concept of cross-correlating
material unit-fields (pp. 1-148), the quantum equation for united gravitation
and electromagnetism is derived (pp. 148-164). The unified equation yields all
known solutions to the Dirac equation, for example, the fine and hyperfine
structure of the atom spectrum. Moreover, the model explains physical nature of
the spin and anomalous gyromagnetic factor of an electron, as well as the Pauli
exclusion principle. For weak fields, in the classical limit, the model
simplifies to the Lorentz-Maxwell electromagnetism and the so-called
gravitoelectromagnetic approximation of Einstein's general relativity. In case
of the strong fields, the unified model yields new predictions compared to the
Einstein gravity, Lorentz-Maxwell electromagnetism and quantum mechanics. For
instance, the cross-correlation of gravitational and electric potentials
predicts the "anti-gravity force". The "dark matter" and "dark energy" also
find natural explanations in the present model. For the unit-fields carrying
the gravitational, electric and strong-nuclear "dressings", the quantum
equation and its classical limit for the united gravitational, electromagnetic,
weak-nuclear and strong-nuclear fields and interactions are derived (pp.
164-183). The cross-correlation of electric and strong-nuclear potentials of
the electric and strong-nuclear "dressings" explains the physical nature of
weak-nuclear force. Whereas, the cross-correlation of gravitational and
strong-nuclear potentials predicts the new kind of interactions, namely the
gravito-nuclearstrong force.
