In our paper we show that the Camassa-Holm equation does not represent a long
wave asymptotic due to a major inconsistency with the theory of shallow water
waves. We state that any solution of the Camassa-Holm equation, which is not
asymptotically close to a solution of the Korteweg--de Vries equation is an
artefact of the model and irrelevant to the theory of shallow water waves.
