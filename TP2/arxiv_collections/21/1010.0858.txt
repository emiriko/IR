We generalize the results of [Comm. Math. Phys. 299 (2010), 825-866,
arXiv:0911.3731] (hidden Grassmann structure IV) to the case of excited states
of the transfer matrix of the six-vertex model acting in the so-called
Matsubara direction. We establish an equivalence between a scaling limit of the
partition function of the six-vertex model on a cylinder with quasi-local
operators inserted and special boundary conditions, corresponding to
particle-hole excitations, on the one hand, and certain three-point correlation
functions of conformal field theory (CFT) on the other hand. As in hidden
Grassmann structure IV, the fermionic basis developed in previous papers and
its conformal limit are used for a description of the quasi-local operators. In
paper IV we claimed that in the conformal limit the fermionic creation
operators generate a basis equivalent to the basis of the descendant states in
the conformal field theory modulo integrals of motion suggested by A.
Zamolodchikov (1987). Here we argue that, in order to completely determine the
transformation between the above fermionic basis and the basis of descendants
in the CFT, we need to involve excitations. On the side of the lattice model we
use the excited-state TBA approach. We consider in detail the case of the
descendant at level 8.
