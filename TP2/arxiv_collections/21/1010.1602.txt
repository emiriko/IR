The focus of this paper is on reducing the complexity in verification by
exploiting modularity at various levels: in specification, in verification, and
structurally. For specifications, we use the modular language CSP-OZ-DC, which
allows us to decouple verification tasks concerning data from those concerning
durations. At the verification level, we exploit modularity in theorem proving
for rich data structures and use this for invariant checking. At the structural
level, we analyze possibilities for modular verification of systems consisting
of various components which interact.We illustrate these ideas by automatically
verifying safety properties of a case study from the European Train Control
System standard, which extends previous examples by comprising a complex track
topology with lists of track segments and trains with different routes.
