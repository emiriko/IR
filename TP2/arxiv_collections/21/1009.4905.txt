In this work we continue the description of soliton-like solutions of some
slowly varying, subcritical gKdV equations.
  In this opportunity we describe, almost completely, the allowed behaviors:
either the soliton is refracted, or it is reflected by the potential, depending
on its initial energy. This last result describes a new type of soliton-like
solution for gKdV equations, also present in the NLS case.
  Moreover, we prove that the solution is not pure at infinity, unlike the
standard gKdV soliton.
