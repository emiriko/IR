The first science flight of the balloon-borne \Sunrise telescope took place
in June 2009 from ESRANGE (near Kiruna/Sweden) to Somerset Island in northern
Canada. We describe the scientific aims and mission concept of the project and
give an overview and a description of the various hardware components: the 1-m
main telescope with its postfocus science instruments (the UV filter imager
SuFI and the imaging vector magnetograph IMaX) and support instruments (image
stabilizing and light distribution system ISLiD and correlating wavefront
sensor CWS), the optomechanical support structure and the instrument mounting
concept, the gondola structure and the power, pointing, and telemetry systems,
and the general electronics architecture. We also explain the optimization of
the structural and thermal design of the complete payload. The preparations for
the science flight are described, including AIV and ground calibration of the
instruments. The course of events during the science flight is outlined, up to
the recovery activities. Finally, the in-flight performance of the
instrumentation is briefly summarized.
