We describe the design and elements of implementation of the Akamai Maui
Short Course (AMSC). The AMSC contains four full inquiry activities each of
which builds on those previous: Camera Obscura and Sun Shadows, Lenses and
Refraction, Color and Light, and the Adaptive Optics Demonstrator. In addition
we describe the workings of two additional strands: 1) Communication, and 2)
Science, Technology and Society. We also discuss our assessment methods and our
results.
