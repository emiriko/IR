Classical transport in a doubly connected polygonal billiard, i.e. the
annulus square billiard, is considered. Dynamical properties of the billiard
flow with a fixed initial direction are analyzed by means of the moments of
arbitrary order of the number of revolutions around the inner square,
accumulated by the particles during the evolution. An "anomalous" diffusion is
found: the moment of order q exhibits an algebraic growth in time with an
exponent different from q/2, like in the normal case. Transport features are
related to spectral properties of the system, which are reconstructed by
Fourier transforming time correlation functions. An analytic estimate for the
growth exponent of integer order moments is derived as a function of the
scaling index at zero frequency of the spectral measure, associated to the
angle spanned by the particles. The n-th order moment is expressed in terms of
a multiple-time correlation function, depending on n-1 time intervals, which is
shown to be linked to higher order density spectra (polyspectra), by a
generalization of the Wiener-Khincin Theorem. Analytic results are confirmed by
numerical simulations.
