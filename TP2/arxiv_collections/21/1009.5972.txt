We propose a focus of attention mechanism to speed up the Perceptron
algorithm. Focus of attention speeds up the Perceptron algorithm by lowering
the number of features evaluated throughout training and prediction. Whereas
the traditional Perceptron evaluates all the features of each example, the
Attentive Perceptron evaluates less features for easy to classify examples,
thereby achieving significant speedups and small losses in prediction accuracy.
Focus of attention allows the Attentive Perceptron to stop the evaluation of
features at any interim point and filter the example. This creates an attentive
filter which concentrates computation at examples that are hard to classify,
and quickly filters examples that are easy to classify.
