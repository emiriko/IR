Nowadays the question `what is complexity?' is a challenge to be answered.
This question is triggering a great quantity of works in the frontier of
physics, biology, mathematics and computer science. Even more when this century
has been told to be the century of Complexity. Although there seems to be no
urgency to answer the above question, many different proposals that have been
developed to this respect can be found in the literature. In this context,
several articles concerning statistical complexity and stochastic processes are
collected in this chapter.
