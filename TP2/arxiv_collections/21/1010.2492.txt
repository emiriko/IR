We show that for a transiting exoplanet accompanied by a moon which also
transits, the absolute masses and radii of the star, planet and moon are
determinable. For a planet-star system, it is well known that the density of
the star is calculable from the lightcurve by manipulation of Kepler's Third
Law. In an analogous way, the planetary density is calculable for a planet-moon
system which transits a star, and thus the ratio-of-densities is known. By
combining this ratio with the observed ratio-of-radii and the radial velocity
measurements of the system, we show that the absolute dimensions of the star
and planet are determinable. This means such systems could be used as
calibrators of stellar evolution. The detection of dynamical effects, such as
transit timing variations, allows the absolute mass of the moon to be
determined as well, which may be combined with the radius to infer the
satellite's composition.
