We demonstrate the conspiration of many-particle interferences of different
degree to determine the transmission of four photons of tunable
indistinguishability through a four-port beam splitter array. The probability
of certain output events depends non-monotonically on the degree of
distinguishability, due to distinct multi-particle interference contributions
to the transmission signal.
