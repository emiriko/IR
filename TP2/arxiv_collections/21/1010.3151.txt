We present a survey of CLEO-c open charm results. The unprecedented full data
sample includes over 10 million D mesons and approximately 1.2 million D_s
mesons. These results substantially extend the reach and understanding of heavy
flavor physics. The world community will benefit as results from CLEO-c extend
the reach of the Belle experiment at KEK and the LHCb experiment at CERN and
lay foundations for the physics program of the BESIII experiment in China.
