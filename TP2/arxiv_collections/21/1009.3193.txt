We present a detailed study of explosive chromospheric evaporation during a
microflare which occurred on 2007 December 7 as observed with the EUV Imaging
Spectrometer (EIS) onboard Hinode. We find temperature-dependent upflows for
lines formed from 1.0 to 2.5 MK and downflows for lines formed from 0.05 to
0.63 MK in the impulsive phase of the flare. Both the line intensity and the
nonthermal line width appear enhanced in most of the lines and are temporally
correlated with the time when significant evaporation was observed. Our results
are consistent with the numerical simulations of flare models, which take into
account a strong nonthermal electron beam in producing the explosive
chromospheric evaporation. The explosive evaporation observed in this
microflare implies that the same dynamic processes may exist in events with
very different magnitudes.
