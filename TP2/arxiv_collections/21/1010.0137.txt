The present status of extensive air shower (EAS) simulation procedures is
reviewed. The advantages of combining numerical and Monte Carlo methods for the
description of EAS development are discussed. Physics content of cosmic ray
interaction models is briefly described and their predictions are compared to
the first LHC data. Finally, some outstanding puzzles related to cosmic ray
composition at the "ankle" energies are analyzed.
