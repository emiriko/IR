We extend our recently developed interatomic potentials for UO_{2} to the
mixed oxide fuel system (U,Pu,Np)O_{2}. We do so by fitting against an
extensive database of ab initio results as well as to experimental
measurements. The applicability of these interactions to a variety of mixed
environments beyond the fitting domain is also assessed. The employed formalism
makes these potentials applicable across all interatomic distances without the
need for any ambiguous splining to the well-established short-range
Ziegler-Biersack-Littmark universal pair potential. We therefore expect these
to be reliable potentials for carrying out damage simulations (and Molecular
Dynamics simulations in general) in nuclear fuels of varying compositions for
all relevant atomic collision energies.
