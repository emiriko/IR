One of the central tenets of conventional theories of superconductivity,
including most models proposed for the recently discovered iron-pnictide
superconductors, is the notion that only electronic excitations with energies
comparable to the superconducting energy gap are affected by the transition.
Here we report the results of a comprehensive spectroscopic ellipsometry study
of a high-quality crystal of superconducting
$\textrm{Ba}_{0.68}\textrm{K}_{0.32}\textrm{Fe}_2\textrm{As}_2$ that challenges
this notion. We observe a superconductivity-induced suppression of an
absorption band at an energy of $2.5\ \textrm{eV}$, two orders of magnitude
above the superconducting gap energy $2\Delta\sim 20\ \textrm{meV}$. Based on
density-functional calculations, this band can be assigned to transitions from
As-p to Fe-d orbitals crossing the Fermi surface. We identify a related effect
at the spin-density-wave transition in parent compounds of the 122 family. This
suggests that As-p states deep below the Fermi level contribute to the
formation of the superconducting and spin-density-wave states in the iron
arsenides.
