Evaporation of water droplets on a superhydrophobic substrate, on which the
contact line is pinned, is investigated. While previous studies mainly focused
on droplets with contact angles smaller than 90^\circ, here we analyze almost
the full range of possible contact angles (10^\circ -150^\circ). The greater
contact angles and pinned contact lines can be achieved by the use of
superhydrophobic Carbon Nanofiber substrates. The time-evolutions of the
contact angle and the droplet mass are examined. The experimental data is in
good quantitative agreement with the model presented by Popov (Physical Review
E 71, 2005), demonstrating that the evaporation process is quasi-static,
diffusion-driven, and that thermal effects play no role. Furthermore, we show
that the experimental data for the evolution of both the contact angle and the
droplet mass can be collapsed onto one respective universal curve for all
droplet sizes and initial contact angles.
