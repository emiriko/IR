We propose a LEO-based communication system that is built by deploying
circum-terra, optic fibers connecting hundreds of small (perhaps)
phased-array-communications and RF-signal-transfer antennas around the earth on
multiple rings. The proposed LEO-earth connection will be through microwave
links (Ku or low-Ka band) and many of the ISL's through the optic-fiber rings.
Inter-ring connectivity could be with either high-Ka band or optical (laser)
links. The initial ring would serve to complement existing terrestrial fiber
networks; but, the system would expand with additional rings into
non-equatorial planes to provide global connectivity. The proposed system would
make use of connectivity & broadcasting capability of satellite constellations
as well as the high throughput point-to-point capability of optic-fiber
systems. The advantages, options, and economics of the proposed LEO optic-fiber
/ microwave communication system over existing terrestrial- and
space-communication systems (of similar functionality) as well as the future
development of the system are dealt with in the paper.
