In this paper I review the motivation and current status of modeling of
plasmas exposed to strong radiation fields, as it applies to the study of
cosmic X-ray sources. This includes some of the astrophysical issues which can
be addressed, the ingredients for the models, the current computational tools,
the limitations imposed by currently available atomic data, and the validity of
some of the standard assumptions. I will also discuss ideas for the future:
challenges associated with future missions, opportunities presented by improved
computers, and goals for atomic data collection.
