We investigate the effect of CP violation in the leptonic sector. Due to the
tiny neutrino masses its value is predicted to be very small and it is far
beyond the experimental reach of the current experiments. Recently, the magic
baseline experiment from CERN to INO (Indian Neutrino Observatory) with L=7152
km has been proposed to get a sensitive limit on $\sin \theta_{13}$. We show
that due to such magic baseline neutrino beam it is possible to observe CP
violation in the neutrino sector upto several percent for the beam energy
between (1-10) GeV.
