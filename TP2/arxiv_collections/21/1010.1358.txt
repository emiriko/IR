Motivated by the desirability of universal composability, we analyze in terms
of L_1 distinguishability the task of secret key generation from a joint random
variable. Under this secrecy criterion, using the Renyi entropy of order 1+s
for s in [0,1, we derive a new upper bound of Eve's distinguishability under
the application of the universal2 hash functions. It is also shown that this
bound gives the tight exponential rate of decrease in the case of independent
and identical distributions. The result is applied to the wire-tap channel
model and to secret key generation (distillation) by public discussion.
