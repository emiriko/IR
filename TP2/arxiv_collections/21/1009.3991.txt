We show that if $E \subset \mathbb{F}_q^d$, the $d$-dimensional vector space
over the finite field with $q$ elements, and $|E| \geq \rho q^d$, where $
q^{-\frac{1}{2}}\ll \rho \leq 1$, then $E$ contains an isometric copy of at
least $c \rho^{d-1} q^{d+1 \choose 2}$ distinct $(d+1)$-point configurations.
