The drying of a drop of human blood exhibits coupled physical mechanisms,
such as Marangoni flow, evaporation and wettability. The final stage of a whole
blood drop evaporation reveals regular patterns with a good reproducibility for
a healthy person. Other experiments on anaemic and hyperlipidemic people were
performed, and different patterns were revealed. The flow motion inside the
blood drop is observed and analyzed with the use of a digital camera: the
influence of the red blood cells (RBCs) motion is revealed at the drop
periphery as well as its consequences on the final stage of drying. The
mechanisms which lead to the final pattern of the dried blood drops are
presented and explained on the basis of fluid mechanics in conjunction with the
principles of haematology. The blood drop evaporation process is evidenced to
be driven only by Marangoni flow. The same axisymetric pattern formation is
observed, and can be forecast for different blood drop diameters. The
evaporation mass flux can be predicted with a good agreement, assuming only the
knowledge of the colloids mass concentration.
