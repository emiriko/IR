We address a question about how much resonance poles and residues extracted
from data depend on a model used for the extraction, and on the precision of
data. We focus on the P11 pi-N scattering and use the dynamical coupled-channel
(DCC) model developed in Excited Baryon Analysis Center (EBAC) at JLab. We
examine the model-dependence of the poles by varying parameters largely within
the EBAC-DCC model. We find that two poles associated with the Roper resonance
are fairly stable against the variation. We also study the stability of the
Roper poles against different analytic structure of the P11 amplitude below
pi-N threshold by using a bare nucleon model. We again find a good stability of
the Roper poles.
