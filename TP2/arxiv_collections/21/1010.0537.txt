It is shown that the violation of the positiveness of the entropy due to the
Casimir-Lifshitz interaction claimed in several papers is an artifact related
to an improper interpretation of the "Casimir entropy", which actually is a
difference of two positive terms. It is explained that at definite condition
this "Casimir entropy" must be negative. A direct derivation of the low
temperature behavior of the surface entropy of a metallic surface in conditions
of the anomalous skin effect is given and singular temperature dependency of
this quantity is discussed. In conclusion a hydrodynamic example of the entropy
of a liquid film is considered. It occurs that the entropy of a film of finite
thickness and a liquid half-space behave differently at T tends to 0.
