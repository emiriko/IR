The hysteresis observed in the magnetoresistance of bilayer 2D systems in the
quantum Hall regime is generally attributed to the long time constant for
charge transfer between the 2D systems due to the very low conductivity of the
quantum Hall bulk states. We report electrometry measurements of a bilayer 2D
system that demonstrate that the hysteresis is instead due to non-equilibrium
induced current. This finding is consistent with magnetometry and electrometry
measurements of single 2D systems, and has important ramifications for
understanding hysteresis in bilayer 2D systems.
