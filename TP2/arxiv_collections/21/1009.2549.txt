Three separate questions of relevance to Major League Baseball are
investigated from a physics perspective. First, can a baseball be hit farther
with a corked bat? Second, is there evidence that the baseball is more lively
today than in earlier years? Third, can storing baseballs in a temperature- or
humidity-controlled environment significantly affect home run production? Each
of these questions is subjected to a physics analysis, including an experiment,
an interpretation of the data, and a definitive answer. The answers to the
three questions are no, no, and yes.
