Precise control and manipulation of optical fields on a nanoscale is one of
the most important and challenging problems in "nanophotonics". Since optical
wavelength is on a much larger microscale, it is impossible to employ
conventional focusing for that purpose. We show the strong optically-induced
interactions between discrete meta-molecules in a metamaterial system and
coherent monochromatic continuous light beam with a spatially-tailored phase
profile can be used to prepare a sub-wavelength scale energy localization. Well
isolated energy hot-spots as small as $\lambda/10$ can be created and
positioned at will on the metamaterial landscape offering new opportunities for
data storage and imaging applications.
