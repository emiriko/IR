We report here the magnetic properties of electron-doped Sm1-xCaxMnO3
manganites with the doping level of x=0.91. Exchange bias effect has been
observed in Sm0.09Ca0.91MnO3 nanomanagnites system and can be tuned by the
strength of cooling magnetic field (Hcool). The values of exchange bias
parameter i.e. exchange bias fields (HE), coercivity (HC), remanence asymmetry
(ME) and magnetic coercivity (MC) are found to strongly depend on Hcool. The
larger effective magnetic moments and deviation of inverse susceptibility
(\c{hi}-1) from Curie-Weiss law indicate the possible existence of Griffiths
phase (GP). A rigorous measurement of linear and nonlinear ac and dc magnetic
susceptibility in nanomanganites proves the existence of Griffiths phase (GP)
in the temperature range TC<T<TG (Griffiths temperature). The effect of size
reduction on exchange bias effect and GP is addressed here. The enhancement of
exchange bias effect and GP has been argued to be due to the modification of
the phase separated state on size reduction.
