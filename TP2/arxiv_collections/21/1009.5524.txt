Students entering engineering in universities of applied sciences were tested
to see whether they understood easy Science problems within the first week of
the first semester. The test comprised of mathematics and physics questions in
both linear and diagrammatic form. Science misconceptions are investigated here
by comparison to a model of misconception based on the findings of other
investigators. The misconceptions demonstrated by the answers confirm this
model of misconception. The results are discussed with traditional theories
about education as well as with recent psychological research and with
neuroscience insights. These comparisons enable further investigation of
misconceptions.
