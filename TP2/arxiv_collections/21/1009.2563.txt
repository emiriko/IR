Transport measurements on the cuprates suggest the presence of a quantum
critical point hiding underneath the superconducting dome near optimal hole
doping. We provide numerical evidence in support of this scenario via a
dynamical cluster quantum Monte Carlo study of the extended two-dimensional
Hubbard model. Single particle quantities, such as the spectral function, the
quasiparticle weight and the entropy, display a crossover between two distinct
ground states: a Fermi liquid at low filling and a non-Fermi liquid with a
pseudogap at high filling. Both states are found to cross over to a marginal
Fermi-liquid state at higher temperatures. For finite next-nearest-neighbor
hopping t' we find a classical critical point at temperature T_c. This
classical critical point is found to be associated with a phase separation
transition between a compressible Mott gas and an incompressible Mott liquid
corresponding to the Fermi liquid and the pseudogap state, respectively. Since
the critical temperature T_c extrapolates to zero as t' vanishes, we conclude
that a quantum critical point connects the Fermi-liquid to the pseudogap
region, and that the marginal-Fermi-liquid behavior in its vicinity is the
analogous of the supercritical region in the liquid-gas transition.
