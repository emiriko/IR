Entanglement in bipartite continuous-variable systems is investigated in the
presence of partial losses, such as those introduced by a realistic quantum
communication channel, e.g. by propagation in an optical fiber. We find that
entanglement can vanish completely for partial losses, in a situa- tion
reminiscent of so-called entanglement sudden death. Even states with extreme
squeezing may become separable after propagation in lossy channels. Having in
mind the potential applications of such entangled light beams to optical
communications, we investigate the conditions under which entanglement can
survive for all partial losses. Different loss scenarios are examined and we
derive criteria to test the robustness of entangled states. These criteria are
necessary and sufficient for Gaussian states. Our study provides a framework to
investigate the robustness of continuous-variable entanglement in more complex
multipartite systems.
