We consider crossovers with respect to the weak convergence theorems from a
discrete-time quantum walk (DTQW). We show that a continuous-time quantum walk
(CTQW) and discrete- and continuous-time random walks can be expressed as DTQWs
in some limit. At first we generalize our previous study [Phys. Rev. A
\textbf{81}, 062129 (2010)] on the DTQW with position measurements. We show
that the position measurements per each step with probability $p \sim
1/n^\beta$ can be evaluated, where $n$ is the final time and $0<\beta<1$. We
also give a corresponding continuous-time case. As a consequence, crossovers
from the diffusive spreading (random walk) to the ballistic spreading (quantum
walk) can be seen as the parameter $\beta$ shifts from 0 to 1 in both discrete-
and continuous-time cases of the weak convergence theorems. Secondly, we
introduce a new class of the DTQW, in which the absolute value of the diagonal
parts of the quantum coin is proportional to a power of the inverse of the
final time $n$. This is called a final-time-dependent DTQW (FTD-DTQW). The CTQW
is obtained in a limit of the FTD-DTQW. We also obtain the weak convergence
theorem for the FTD-DTQW which shows a variety of spreading properties.
Finally, we consider the FTD-DTQW with periodic position measurements. This
weak convergence theorem gives a phase diagram which maps sufficiently
long-time behaviors of the discrete- and continuous-time quantum and random
walks.
