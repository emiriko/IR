Gabriel's Theorem, and the work of Bernstein, Gelfand and Ponomarev
established a connection between the theory of quiver representations and the
theory of simple Lie algebras. Lie superalgebras have been studied from many
perspectives, and many results about Lie algebras have analogues for Lie
superalgebras. In this paper, the notion of a super-representation of a quiver
is introduced, as well as the notion of reflection functors for odd roots.
These ideas are then used to give a categorical construction of the root system
A(n,m) by establishing a version of Gabriel's Theorem and modifying the
Bernstein, Gelfand, Ponomarev construction to the super-category. This is then
used to give a combinatorial construction of the root system A(n,m) where roots
correspond to vertices of a canonically defined quiver $\Gammahat$.
