This survey paper contains a detailed self-contained introduction to
Korovkin-type theorems and to some of their applications concerning the
approximation of continuous functions as well as of L^p-functions, by means of
positive linear operators. The paper also contains several new results and
applications. Moreover, the organization of the subject follows a simple and
direct approach which quickly leads both to the main results of the theory and
to some new ones.
