We extend Lorentz-violating Supersymmetry models to include vector
superfields. The CPT-preserving model generalizes easily, while the obvious
attempt at generalizing the CPT-violating model meets serious obstructions.
Generalizations of the CPT-preserving but Lorentz-Violating model to higher
dimensions are also straightforward. Compactification is used to reduce the
six-dimensional theory to an ${\cal{N}} =2$ Lorentz-violating theory in four
dimensions, while the ten-dimensional theory is used to produce an
${\cal{N}}=4$ Lorentz-violating theory. This may be useful in future
constructions involving Ads/CFT correspondence with Lorentz violation.
