We show that for macroscopic measurements which cannot reveal full
information about microscopic states of the system, the monogamy of Bell
inequality violations present in quantum mechanics implies that practically all
correlations between macroscopic measurements can be described by local
realistic models. Our results hold for sharp measurement and arbitrary closed
quantum systems.
