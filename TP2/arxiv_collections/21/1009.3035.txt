We study a sample of complex events; each includes a coronal type II burst,
accompanied by a GOES SXR flare and LASCO CME. The radio bursts were recorded
by the ARTEMIS-IV radio spectrograph (100-650 MHz range); the GOES SXR flares
and SOHO/LASCO CMEs, were obtained from the Solar Geophysical Data (SGD) and
the LASCO lists respectively. The radio burst-flare-CME characteristics were
compared and two groups of events with similar behavior were isolated. In the
first the type II shock exciter appears to be a flare blast wave propagating in
the wake of a CME. In the second the type II burst appears CME initiated though
it is not always clear if it is driven by the bow or the flanks of the CME or
if it is a reconnection shock.
