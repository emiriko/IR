Page has recently argued that the Born rule does not suffice for computing
all probabilities in quantum cosmology. He further asserts that the Born rule's
failure gives rise to the cosmological measure problem. Here I contend that
Page's result stems from his use of an overly restrictive definition of the
Born rule. In particular, I demonstrate that all of the probabilities he wishes
to compute follow from the Born rule when generalized measurements are
permitted. I also register two comments on Page's theoretical setting, relating
respectively to Hilbert space dimensionality and permutation symmetry. These
considerations lead me to conclude that the claimed insufficiency of the Born
rule is by no means specific to the cosmological context.
