Lattice Boltzmann simulations have become a method of choice to solve the
hydrodynamic equations of motion of a number of complex fluids. Here we review
some recent applications of lattice Boltzmann to study the hydrodynamics of
liquid crystalline materials. In particular, we focus on the study of (a) the
exotic blue phases of cholesteric liquid crystals, and (b) active gels - a
model system for actin plus myosin solutions or bacterial suspensions. In both
cases lattice Boltzmann studies have proved useful to provide new insights into
these complex materials.
