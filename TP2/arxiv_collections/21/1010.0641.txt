A novel family of exactly solvable quantum systems on curved space is
presented. The family is the quantum version of the classical Perlick family,
which comprises all maximally superintegrable 3-dimensional Hamiltonian systems
with spherical symmetry. The high number of symmetries (both geometrical and
dynamical) exhibited by the classical systems has a counterpart in the
accidental degeneracy in the spectrum of the quantum systems. This family of
quantum problem is completely solved with the techniques of the SUSYQM
(supersymmetric quantum mechanics). We also analyze in detail the ordering
problem arising in the quantization of the kinetic term of the classical
Hamiltonian, stressing the link existing between two physically meaningful
quantizations: the geometrical quantization and the position dependent mass
quantization.
