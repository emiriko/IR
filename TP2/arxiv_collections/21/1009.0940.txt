Spin-echo experiments are often said to constitute an instant of
anti-thermodynamic behavior in a concrete physical system that violates the
second law of thermodynamics. We argue that a proper thermodynamic treatment of
the effect should take into account the correlations between the spin and
translational degrees of freedom of the molecules. To this end, we construct an
entropy functional using Boltzmann macrostates that incorporates both spin and
translational degrees of freedom. With this definition there is nothing special
in the thermodynamics of spin echoes: dephasing corresponds to Hamiltonian
evolution and leaves the entropy unchanged; dissipation increases the entropy.
In particular, there is no phase of entropy decrease in the echo. We also
discuss the definition of macrostates from the underlying quantum theory and we
show that the decay of net magnetization provides a faithful measure of entropy
change.
