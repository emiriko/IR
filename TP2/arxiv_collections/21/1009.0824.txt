In an attempt of clarifying the [S/Fe] behavior with the run of [Fe/H] in the
metal-poor regime which has been a matter of debate, an extensive non-LTE
analysis of near-IR S I triplet lines (multiplet 3) at 1.046 micron was carried
out for selected 33 halo/disk stars in a wide metallicity range of [Fe/H] ~-3.7
to ~+0.3, based on the spectral data collected with IRCS+AO188 of the Subaru
Telescope. We found an evidence of considerably large [S/Fe] ratio amounting to
~+0.7-0.8 dex at very low metallicity of [Fe/H] ~-3, which makes marked
contrast with other alpha-elements (Mg, Si, Ca, Ti) flatly showing moderately
supersolar [alpha/Fe] of ~0.3 dex. Meanwhile, a locally-flat tendency of [S/Fe]
at ~+0.3 is seen at -2.5 <[Fe/H]< -1.5. These results may suggest that the
nature of [S/Fe] in metal-poor halo stars is not so simple as has been argued
(i.e., neither being globally flat independent of [Fe/H] nor monotonically
increasing with a decrease in [Fe/H]), but rather complicated with a local
plateau around [Fe/H] ~-2 followed by a discontinuous jump between the narrow
interval of -3 <[Fe/H]< -2.5.
