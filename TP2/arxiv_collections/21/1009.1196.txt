We investigate the properties of nuclear matter at the first-order phase
transitions such as liquid-gas phase transition and hadron-quark phase
transition. As a general feature of the first-order phase transitions of matter
consisting of many species of charged particles, there appears a mixed phases
with geometrical structures called ``pasta'' due to the balance of the Coulomb
repulsion and the surface tension between two phases. The equation of state
(EOS) of mixed phase is different from the one obtained by a bulk application
of the Gibbs conditions or by the Maxwell construction due to the effects of
the non-uniform structure. We show that the charge screening and strong surface
tension make the EOS close to that of the Maxwell construction. The thermal
effects are elucidated as well as the above finite-size effects.
