We analyse the track of an {\alpha}-particle passing through a cloud chamber
using the Bohm theory and show that the resulting classical track has its
origins in the quantum Zeno effect. By assuming the ionised gas molecules
reveal the positions of the {\alpha}-particle on its trajectory and using these
positions in a short time propagator technique developed by de Gosson, we show
it is the failure of the quantum potential to develop quickly enough that leads
to the appearance of the classical trajectory. Bohm and Hiley have already
argued that it is this failure of the quantum potential to develop
appropriately that prevents an Auger electron from undergoing a transition if
continuously watched. This allows us to conclude that, in general, it is the
suppression of the quantum potential that accounts for the quantum Zeno effect.
