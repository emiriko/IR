Numerous experiments and observations have confirmed the existence of a
dynamical 3-space, detectable directly by light-speed anisotropy experiments,
and indirectly by means of novel gravitational effects, such as bore hole g
anomalies, predictable black hole masses, flat spiral-galaxy rotation curves,
and the expansion of the universe, all without dark matter and dark energy. The
dynamics for this 3-space follows from a unique generalisation of Newtonian
gravity, once that is cast into a velocity formalism. This new theory of
gravity is applied to the sun to compute new density, pressure and temperature
profiles, using polytrope modelling of the equation of state for the matter.
These results should be applied to a re-analysis of solar neutrino production,
and to stellar evolution in general.
