..."but we do not have quantum gravity." This phrase is often used when
analysis of a physical problem enters the regime in which quantum gravity
effects should be taken into account. In fact, there are several models of the
gravitational field coupled to (scalar) fields for which the quantization
procedure can be completed using loop quantum gravity techniques. The model we
present in this paper consist of the gravitational field coupled to a scalar
field. The result has similar structure to the loop quantum cosmology models,
except for that it involves all the local degrees of freedom because no
symmetry reduction has been performed at the classical level.
