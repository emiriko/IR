We have designed an inquiry-based laboratory activity on transiting
extrasolar planets for an introductory college-level astronomy class. The
activity was designed with the intent of simultaneously teaching science
process skills and factual content about transits and light curves. In the
activity, groups of two to four students each formulate a specific science
question and design and carry out an investigation using a table-top model of a
star and orbiting planet. Each group then presents their findings to other
students in their class. In a final presentation, the instructors integrate
students' findings with a summary of how measured light curves indicate
properties of planetary systems. The activity debuted at Hartnell College in
November 2009 and has also been adapted for a lecture-based astronomy course at
U.C. Santa Cruz. We present the results of student surveys before and after the
astronomy course at Hartnell and discuss how well our activity promotes
students' confidence and identity as scientists, relative to traditional lab
activities.
