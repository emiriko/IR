We have incorporated the oblate distortion of the shape of the star due to
the stellar rotation, which modifies the finite disk correction factor (f_D) in
the m-CAK hydrodynamical model. We implement a simplified version for the f_D
allowing us to solve numerically the non-linear m- CAK momentum equation.We
solve this model for a classical Be star in the polar and equatorial
directions. The star's oblateness modifies the polar wind, which is now much
faster than the spherical one, mainly because the wind receives radiation from
a larger (than the spherical) stellar surface. In the equatorial direction we
obtain slow solutions, which are even slower and denser than the spherical
ones. For the case when the stellar rotational velocity is about the critical
velocity, the most remarkable result of our calculations is that the density
contrast between the equatorial density and the polar one, is about 100. This
result could explain a long-standing problem on Be stars.
