The symmetry energy coefficients of dilute clusterized nuclear matter are
evaluated in the $S$-matrix framework. Employing a few different definitions
commonly used in the literature for uniform nuclear matter, it is seen that the
different definitions lead to perceptibly different results for the symmetry
coefficients for dilute nuclear matter. They are found to be higher compared to
those obtained for uniform matter in the low density domain. The calculated
results are in reasonable consonance with those extracted recently from
experimental data.
