We consider the radiation pressure instability operating on short timescales
10^3 - 10^6 years in the accretion disk around a supermassive black hole as the
origin of the intermittent activity of radio sources. We test whether this
instability can be responsible for short ages (<10^4 years) of Compact Steep
Spectrum sources measured by hot spots propagation velocities in VLBI
observations and statistical overabundance of Gigahertz Peaked Spectrum
sources.The implied timescales are consistent with the observed ages of the
sources. We aslo discuss possible implications of the intermittent activity on
the complex morphology of radio sources, such as the quasar 1045+352, dominated
by a knotty jet showing several bends. It is possible that we are whitnessing
an ongoing jet precession in this source due to internal instabilities within
the jet flow.
