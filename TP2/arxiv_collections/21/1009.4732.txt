With planets orbiting stars, a planetary mass function should not be seen as
a low-mass extension of the stellar mass function, but a proper formalism needs
to take care of the fact that the statistical properties of planet populations
are linked to the properties of their respective host stars. This can be
accounted for by describing planet populations by means of a differential
planetary mass-radius-orbit function, which together with the fraction of stars
with given properties that are orbited by planets and the stellar mass function
allows to derive all statistics for any considered sample. These fundamental
functions provide a framework for comparing statistics that result from
different observing techniques and campaigns which all have their very specific
selection procedures and detection efficiencies. Moreover, recent results both
from gravitational microlensing campaigns and radial-velocity surveys of stars
indicate that planets tend to cluster in systems rather than being the lonely
child of their respective parent star. While planetary multiplicity in an
observed system becomes obvious with the detection of several planets, its
quantitative assessment however comes with the challenge to exclude the
presence of further planets. Current exoplanet samples begin to give us first
hints at the population statistics, whereas pictures of planet parameter space
in its full complexity call for samples that are 2-4 orders of magnitude
larger. In order to derive meaningful statistics however, planet detection
campaigns need to be designed in such a way that well-defined
fully-deterministic target selection, monitoring, and detection criteria are
applied. The probabilistic nature of gravitational microlensing makes this
technique an illustrative example of all the encountered challenges and
uncertainties.
