We experimentally demonstrate the storage of 1060 temporal modes onto a
thulium-doped crystal using an atomic frequency comb (AFC). The comb covers
0.93 GHz defining the storage bandwidth. As compared to previous AFC
preparation methods (pulse sequences i.e. amplitude modulation), we only use
frequency modulation to produce the desired optical pumping spectrum. To ensure
an accurate spectrally selective optical pumping, the frequency modulated laser
is self-locked on the atomic comb. Our approach is general and should be
applicable to a wide range of rare-earth doped material in the context of
multimode quantum memory.
