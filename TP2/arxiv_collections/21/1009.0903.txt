Photospheric parameters and chemical composition are determined for the
single-lined chromospherically active RS CVn-type star {\lambda} And (HD
222107). From the high resolution spectra obtained on the Nordic Optical
Telescope, abundances of 22 chemical elements and isotopes, including such key
elements as 12C, 13C, N and O, were investigated. The differential line
analysis with the MARCS model atmospheres gives T eff=4830 K, log g=2.8,
[Fe/H]=-0.53, [C/Fe]=0.09, [N/Fe]=0.35, [O/Fe]=0.45, C/N=2.21, 12C/13C = 14.
The value of 12C/13C ratio for a star of the RS CVn-type is determined for the
first time, and its low value gives a hint that extra-mixing processes may
start acting in low-mass chromospherically active stars below the bump of the
luminosity function of red giants.
