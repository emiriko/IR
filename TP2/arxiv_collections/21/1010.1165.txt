One of Aesop's (La Fontain's) famous fables `The Ant and the Grasshopper' is
widely known to give a moral lesson through comparison between the hard working
ant and the party-loving grasshopper. Here we show a slightly different version
of this fable, namely, "The Ant and the Metrohopper," which describes human
mobility patterns in modern urban life. Numerous real transportation networks
and the trajectory data have been studied in order to understand mobility
patterns. We study trajectories of commuters on the public transportation of
Metropolitan Seoul, Korea. Smart cards (Integrated Circuit Cards; ICCs) are
used in the public transportation system, which allow collection of transit
transaction data, including departure and arrival stations and time. This
empirical analysis provides human mobility patterns, which impact traffic
forecasting and transportation optimization, as well as urban planning.
