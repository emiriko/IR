Zero-dimensional nanocrystals, as obtained by chemical synthesis, offer a
broad range of applications, as their spectrum and thus their excitation gap
can be tailored by variation of their size. Additionally, nanocrystals of the
type ABC can be realized by alloying of two pure compound semiconductor
materials AC and BC, which allows for a continuous tuning of their absorption
and emission spectrum with the concentration x. We use the single-particle
energies and wave functions calculated from a multiband sp^3 empirical
tight-binding model in combination with the configuration interaction scheme to
calculate the optical properties of CdZnSe nanocrystals with a spherical shape.
In contrast to common mean-field approaches like the virtual crystal
approximation (VCA), we treat the disorder on a microscopic level by taking
into account a finite number of realizations for each size and concentration.
We then compare the results for the optical properties with recent experimental
data and calculate the optical bowing coefficient for further sizes.
