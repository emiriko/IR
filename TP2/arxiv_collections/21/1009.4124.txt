We present a semiclassical model for plasmon-enhanced high-harmonic
generation (HHG) in the vicinity of metal nanostructures. We show that both the
inhomogeneity of the enhanced local fields and electron absorption by the metal
surface play an important role in the HHG process and lead to the generation of
even harmonics and to a significantly increased cutoff. For the examples of
silver-coated nanocones and bowtie antennas we predict that the required
intensity reduces by up to three orders of magnitudes and the HHG cutoff
increases by more than a factor of two. The study of the enhanced high-harmonic
generation is connected with a finite-element simulation of the electric field
enhancement due to the excitation of the plasmonic modes.
