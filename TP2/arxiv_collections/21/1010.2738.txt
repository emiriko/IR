Utilizing the Foldy-Wouthuysen representation, we use a bottom-up approach to
construct heavy-baryon Lagrangian terms, without employing a relativistic
Lagrangian as the starting point. The couplings obtained this way feature a
straightforward $1/m$ expansion, which ensures Lorentz invariance order by
order in effective field theories. We illustrate possible applications with two
examples in the context of chiral effective field theory: the pion-nucleon
coupling, which reproduces the results in the literature, and the
pion-nucleon-delta coupling, which does not employ the Rarita-Schwinger field
for describing the delta isobar, and hence does not invoke any spurious degrees
of freedom. In particular, we point out that one of the subleading $\pi N
\Delta$ couplings used in the literature is, in fact, redundant, and discuss
the implications of this. We also show that this redundant term should be
dropped if one wants to use low-energy constants fitted from $\pi N$ scattering
in calculations of $NN\to NN\pi$ reactions.
