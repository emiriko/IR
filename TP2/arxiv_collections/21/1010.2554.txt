In this paper, we solve the field equations in metric f(R) gravity for
Bianchi type VI_0 spacetime and discuss evolution of the expanding universe. We
find two types of non-vacuum solutions by taking isotropic and anisotropic
fluids as the source of matter and dark energy. The physical behavior of these
solutions is analyzed and compared in the future evolution with the help of
some physical and geometrical parameters. It is concluded that in the presence
of isotropic fluid, the model has singularity at $\tilde{t}=0$ and represents
continuously expanding shearing universe currently entering into phantom phase.
In anisotropic fluid, the model has no initial singularity and exhibits the
uniform accelerating expansion. However, the spacetime does not achieve
isotropy as $t\rightarrow\infty$ in both of these solutions.
