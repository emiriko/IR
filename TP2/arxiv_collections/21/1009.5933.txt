We present results from numerical simulations of the interaction of internal
gravity waves (IGW) with magnetic fields in the radiative interior of the Sun.
In this second paper, the waves are forced self-consistently by an overlying
convection zone and a toroidal magnetic field is imposed in the stably
stratified layer just underneath convection zone. Consistent with the results
of previous analytic and simple numerical calculations, we find a strong
wave-field interaction, in which waves are reflected in the field region. The
wave-field interaction and wave reflection depend on the field strength as well
as adopted values of the diffusivities. In some cases wave reflection leads to
an increased mean flow in the field region. In addition to reproducing some of
the features of our simpler models, we find additional complex behaviour in
these more complete and realistic calculations.
