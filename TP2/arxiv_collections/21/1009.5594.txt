We present an implementation of the next-to-leading order vector boson plus
one jet production process in hadronic collision in the framework of POWHEG,
which is a method to implement NLO calculations within a Shower Monte Carlo
context. All spin correlations in the vector boson decay products have been
taken into account. The process has been implemented in the framework of the
POWHEG-BOX, an automated computer code for turning a NLO calculation into a
shower Monte Carlo program. We present phenomenological results for the case of
the Z/gamma plus one jet production process, obtained by matching the POWHEG
calculation with the shower performed by PYTHIA, for the LHC, and we compare
our results with available Tevatron data.
