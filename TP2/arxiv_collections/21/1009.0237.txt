We report the observation of a new fractional quantum Hall state in the
second Landau level of a two-dimensional electron gas at the Landau level
filling factor $\nu=2+6/13$. We find that the model of noninteracting composite
fermions can explain the magnitude of gaps of the prominent 2+1/3 and 2+2/3
states. The same model fails, however, to account for the gaps of the 2+2/5 and
the newly observed 2+6/13 states suggesting that these two states are of exotic
origin.omposite fermion model. However, the weaker 2+2/5 and 2+6/13 states
deviate significantly suggesting that these states are of exotic origin.
