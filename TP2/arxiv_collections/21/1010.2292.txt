In previous work, the authors have developed a geometric theory of
fundamental strata to study connections on the projective line with irregular
singularities of parahoric formal type. In this paper, the moduli space of
connections that contain regular fundamental strata with fixed combinatorics at
each singular point is constructed as a smooth Poisson reduction. The authors
then explicitly compute the isomonodromy equations as an integrable system.
This result generalizes work of Jimbo, Miwa, and Ueno to connections whose
singularities have parahoric formal type.
