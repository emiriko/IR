Using the Isospin Quantum Molecular Dynamics (IQMD) model we analyzed the
production of pions and kaons in the energy range of 1-2 AGeV in order to study
the question why thermal models could achieve a successful description. For
this purpose we study the variation of pion and kaon yields using different
elementary cross sections. We show that several ratios appear to be rather
robust versus their variations.
