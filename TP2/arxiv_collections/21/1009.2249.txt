A conjecture of Halmos proved by Choi and Li states that the closure of the
numerical range of a contraction on a Hilbert space is the intersection of the
closure of the numerical ranges of all its unitary dilations. We show that for
$C_0(N)$ contractions one can restrict the intersection to a smaller family of
dilations. This generalizes a finite dimensional result of Gau and Wu.
