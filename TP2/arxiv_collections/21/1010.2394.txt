We present a study of correlations among conserved charges like baryon
number, electric charge and strangeness in the framework of 2+1 flavor Polyakov
loop extended Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model at vanishing chemical potentials, up to
fourth order. Correlations up to second order have been measured in Lattice QCD
which compares well with our estimates given the inherent difference in the
pion masses in the two systems. Possible physical implications of these
correlations and their importance in understanding the matter obtained in
heavy-ion collisions are discussed. We also present comparison of the results
with the commonly used unbound effective potential in the quark sector of this
model.
