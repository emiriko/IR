It has been observed that the famous Feigenbaum-Coullet-Tresser period
doubling universality has a counterpart for area-preserving maps of ${\fR}^2$.
A renormalization approach has been used in a "hard" computer-assisted proof of
existence of an area-preserving map with orbits of all binary periods in
Eckmann et al (1984). As it is the case with all non-trivial universality
problems in non-dissipative systems in dimensions more than one, no analytic
proof of this period doubling universality exists to date.
  In this paper we attempt to reduce computer assistance in the argument, and
present a mild computer aided proof of the analyticity and compactness of the
renormalization operator in a neighborhood of a renormalization fixed point:
that is a proof that does not use generalizations of interval arithmetics to
functional spaces - but rather relies on interval arithmetics on real numbers
only to estimate otherwise explicit expressions. The proof relies on several
instance of the Contraction Mapping Principle, which is, again, verified via
mild computer assistance.
