Important information about the infrared dynamics of QCD is encoded in the
behavior of its (of-shell) Green's functions, most notably the gluon and the
ghost propagators. Due to recent improvements in the quality of lattice data
and the truncation schemes employed for the Schwinger-Dyson equations we have
now reached a point where the interplay between these two non-perturbative
tools can be most fruitful. In this talk several of the above points will be
reviewed, with particular emphasis on the implications for the ghost sector,
the non-perturbative effective charge of QCD, and the Kugo-Ojima function.
