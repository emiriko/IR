We develop a systematic theory of multi-particle excitations in strongly
interacting Fermi systems. Our work is the generalization of the time-honored
work by Jackson, Feenberg, and Campbell for bosons, that provides, in its most
advanced implementation, quantitative predictions for the dynamic structure
function in the whole experimentally accessible energy/momentum regime. Our
view is that the same physical effects -- namely fluctuations of the wave
function at an atomic length scale -- are responsible for the correct
energetics of the excitations in both Bose and Fermi fluids. Besides a
comprehensive derivation of the fermion version of the theory and discussion of
the approximations made, we present results for homogeneous He-3 and electrons
in three dimensions. We find indeed a significant lowering of the zero sound
mode in He-3 and a broadening of the collective mode due to the coupling to
particle-hole excitations in good agreement with experiments. The most visible
effect in electronic systems is the appearance of a ``double-plasmon''
excitation.
