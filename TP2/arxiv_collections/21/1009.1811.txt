Particles driven through a periodic potential by an external constant force
are known to exhibit a pronounced peak of the diffusion around a critical force
that defines the transition between locked and running states. It has recently
been shown both experimentally and numerically that this peak is greatly
enhanced if some amount of spatial disorder is superimposed on the periodic
potential. Here we show that beyond a simple enhancement lies a much more
interesting phenomenology. For some parameter regimes the system exhibits a
rich variety of behaviors from normal diffusion to superdiffusion, subdiffusion
and even subtransport.
