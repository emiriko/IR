We construct a density functional theory (DFT) for the sticky hard sphere
(SHS) fluid which, like Rosenfeld's fundamental measure theory (FMT) for the
hard sphere fluid [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 63}, 980 (1989)], is based on a set of
weighted densities and an exact result from scaled particle theory (SPT). It is
demonstrated that the excess free energy density of the inhomogeneous SHS fluid
$\Phi_{\text{SHS}}$ is uniquely defined when (a) it is solely a function of the
weighted densities from Kierlik and Rosinberg's version of FMT [Phys. Rev. A
{\bf 42}, 3382 (1990)], (b) it satisfies the SPT differential equation, and (c)
it yields any given direct correlation function (DCF) from the class of
generalized Percus-Yevick closures introduced by Gazzillo and Giacometti [J.
Chem. Phys. {\bf 120}, 4742 (2004)]. The resulting DFT is shown to be in very
good agreement with simulation data. In particular, this FMT yields the correct
contact value of the density profiles with no adjustable parameters. Rather
than requiring higher order DCFs, such as perturbative DFTs, our SHS FMT
produces them. Interestingly, although equivalent to Kierlik and Rosinberg's
FMT in the case of hard spheres, the set of weighted densities used for
Rosenfeld's original FMT is insufficient for constructing a DFT which yields
the SHS DCF.
