The equations of motion of multiple M0{brane (multiple M-wave or mM0) system
in an arbitrary D = 11 supergravity superspace, which generalize the Matrix
model equations for the case of inter- action with a generic 11D supergravity
background, are obtained in the frame of superembedding approach. We also
derive the BPS equations for supersymmetric bosonic solutions of these mM0
equations and show that the set of 1/2 BPS solutions contain a fuzzy sphere
modeling M2 brane as well as that the Nahm equation appears as a particular
case of the 1/4 BPS equations.
