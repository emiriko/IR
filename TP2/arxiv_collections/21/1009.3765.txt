This paper presents a test automation framework for Mercury programs. We
developed a method that generates runnable Mercury code from a formalized test
suite, and which code provides a report on execution about the success of test
cases. We also developed a coverage tool for the framework, which identifies
and provide a visualization of the reached parts of the program when executing
a given test suite.
