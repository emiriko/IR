Phishing is an increasingly sophisticated method to steal personal user
information using sites that pretend to be legitimate. In this paper, we take
the following steps to identify phishing URLs. First, we carefully select
lexical features of the URLs that are resistant to obfuscation techniques used
by attackers. Second, we evaluate the classification accuracy when using only
lexical features, both automatically and hand-selected, vs. when using
additional features. We show that lexical features are sufficient for all
practical purposes. Third, we thoroughly compare several classification
algorithms, and we propose to use an online method (AROW) that is able to
overcome noisy training data. Based on the insights gained from our analysis,
we propose PhishDef, a phishing detection system that uses only URL names and
combines the above three elements. PhishDef is a highly accurate method (when
compared to state-of-the-art approaches over real datasets), lightweight (thus
appropriate for online and client-side deployment), proactive (based on online
classification rather than blacklists), and resilient to training data
inaccuracies (thus enabling the use of large noisy training data).
