Through the main example of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup, the Bakry-Emery
criterion is presented as a main tool to get functional inequalities as
Poincar\'e or logarithmic Sobolev inequalities. Moreover an alternative method
using the optimal mass transportation, is also given to obtain the logarithmic
Sobolev inequality.
