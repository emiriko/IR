The Pi GHz Sky Survey (PiGSS) is a key project of the Allen Telescope Array.
PiGSS is a 3.1 GHz survey of radio continuum emission in the extragalactic sky
with an emphasis on synoptic observations that measure the static and
time-variable properties of the sky. During the 2.5-year campaign, PiGSS will
twice observe ~250,000 radio sources in the 10,000 deg^2 region of the sky with
b > 30 deg to an rms sensitivity of ~1 mJy. Additionally, sub-regions of the
sky will be observed multiple times to characterize variability on time scales
of days to years. We present here observations of a 10 deg^2 region in the
Bootes constellation overlapping the NOAO Deep Wide Field Survey field. The
PiGSS image was constructed from 75 daily observations distributed over a
4-month period and has an rms flux density between 200 and 250 microJy. This
represents a deeper image by a factor of 4 to 8 than we will achieve over the
entire 10,000 deg^2. We provide flux densities, source sizes, and spectral
indices for the 425 sources detected in the image. We identify ~100$ new flat
spectrum radio sources; we project that when completed PiGSS will identify 10^4
flat spectrum sources. We identify one source that is a possible transient
radio source. This survey provides new limits on faint radio transients and
variables with characteristic durations of months.
