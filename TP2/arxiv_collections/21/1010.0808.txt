A 'dual-field' strategy is often used for tumors with highly complex shapes
and/or with large volumes exceeding available field-size in both passive and
scanning irradiations with ion beams. Range and setup uncertainties can cause
hot and cold doses at the field junction within the target. Such uncertainties
will also cause cold doses in the peripheral region of the target. We have
developed an algorithm to reduce the sensitivity of the dual-field plan to
these uncertainties in scanning irradiations. This algorithm is composed of the
following two steps: 1) generating the expanded target volume, and 2) solving
the inverse problem where the terms suppressing the dose gradient of individual
fields are added into the objective function. The validity of this algorithm is
demonstrated through the simulation studies for three extreme cases of two
fields with unidirectional, opposing and orthogonal geometries. With the
proposed algorithm, we can obtain a more robust plan to minimize the effects of
range and setup uncertainties than the conventional plan. Compared to that for
the conventional plan, the optimization time for the robust plan increased by a
factor of approximately three.
