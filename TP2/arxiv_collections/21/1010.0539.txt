Recently it has become apparent that proto-stellar-like outflow activity
extends to the brown dwarf (BD) mass regime. While the presence of accretion
appears to be the common ingredient in all objects known to drive jets
fundamental questions remain unanswered. The more prominent being the exact
mechanism by which jets are launched, and whether this mechanism remains
universal among such a diversity of sources and scales. To address these
questions we have been investigating outflow activity in a sample of
protostellar objects that differ considerably in mass and mass accretion rate.
Central to this is our study of brown dwarf jets. To date Classical T Tauri
stars (CTTS) have offered us the best touchstone for decoding the launching
mechanism. Here we shall summarise what is understood so far of BD jets and the
important constraints observations can place on models. We will focus on the
comparison between jets driven by objects with central mass < 0.1M \odot and
those driven by CTTSs. In particular we wish to understand how the the ratio of
the mass outflow to accretion rate compares to what has been measured for
CTTSs.
