Previously developed analytic models for the evolution of cosmic string and
monopole networks are applied to networks of monopoles attached to two or more
strings; the former case is usually known as cosmic necklaces. These networks
are a common consequence of models with extra dimensions such as brane
inflation. Our quantitative analysis agrees with (and extends) previous simpler
estimates, but we will also highlight some differences. A linear scaling
solution is usually the attractor solution for both the radiation and
matter-dominated epochs, but other scaling laws can also exist, depending on
the universe's expansion rate and the network's energy loss mechanisms.
