We study the effects of interband hybridization within the framework of an
extended Falicov-Kimball model with itinerant $c$ and $f$ electrons. An
explicit interband hybridization breaks the U(1) symmetry associated with the
conservation of the difference between the total number of particles in each
band. As a result, the degeneracy between multipolar electric and chiral
orderings is lifted. We analyze the weak- and strong-coupling limits of the
$c$-$f$ electron Coulomb interaction at zero temperature, and derive the
corresponding mean-field quantum phase diagrams at half-filling for a model
defined on a square lattice.
