Peculiarities of mixed cation effect in ternary glasses whose composition
involves alkali and non-alkali unicharged ions and/or alkaline earth ions are
explored within context of defect model for mixed mobile ion effect (V.
Belostotsky, J. Non-Cryst. Solids (2007)). In mixed alkaline earth glasses
mixed cation effect is observed as in ionic diffusivity as well as in the glass
transition temperature reflecting the fact that movement of dissimilar ions of
unequal size is accompanied by formation of intrinsic defects in glass matrix
when mobile ions enter foreign sites. It is qualitatively similar to that in
mixed alkali glasses although quantitatively it is much less pronounced due to
lower mobility of alkaline earth ions. In mixed cation glasses whose
composition involves dissimilar mobile ions with ionic radii close to each
other 'classical' mixed mobile ion effect is not observed in sense we face it
in mixed alkali glasses. In alkali alkaline earth glasses like
xNa2O-(1-x)CaO-SiO2 and xK2O-(1-x)BaO-SiO2 energy landscape is comprised of
regular unicharged alkali sites and double-charged alkaline-earth sites, and
mobile ions of both types can utilize either vacant sites without their
rearrangement. This leads to increase in apparent diffusivity of alkaline-earth
species when their concentration decreases which is opposite to what is
reported for mixed alkali glasses. Mixed cation effect in the transition
temperature of such glasses is not observed which is clear indication that site
rearrangement involving generation of intrinsic defects does not occur when a
mobile ion enters a foreign site. Similar picture is observed in Na-Ag
phosphate glasses where mixed cation effect in ionic conductivity is
anomalously low because dissimilar ions have almost equal ionic radii and can
utilize either vacant sites without their rearrangement and intrinsic defect
formations in nearest glass matrix
