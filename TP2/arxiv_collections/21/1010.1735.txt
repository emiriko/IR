We present recent preliminary measurements at the Tevatron of t-tbar and
single top production cross section, top quark mass and width, top pair spin
correlations and forward-backward asymmetry. In the electroweak sector, we
present the Tevatron average of the W boson width, and preliminary measurements
of the W and Z forward-backward asymmetries and WZ, ZZ diboson production cross
sections. All measurements are based on larger amount of collision data than
previously used and are in agreement with the standard model.
