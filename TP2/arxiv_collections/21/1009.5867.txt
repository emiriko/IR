We investigate the relaxation of rectangular wrinkled thin films
intrinsically containing an initial strain gradient. A preferential rolling
direction, depending on wrinkle geometry and strain gradient, is theoretically
predicted and experimentally verified. In contrast to typical rolled-up
nanomembranes, which bend perpendicular to the longer edge of rectangular
patterns, we find a regime where rolling parallel to the long edge of the
wrinkled film is favorable. A non-uniform radius of the rolled-up film is well
reproduced by elasticity theory and simulations of the film relaxation using a
finite element method.
