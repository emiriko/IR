We simulate the experimental possibility of observing the antiferromagnetic
(AF) order in the bosonic mixtures of rubidium ($^{87}$Rb) and potassium
($^{41}$K) in a two-dimensional optical lattice in the presence of harmonic
confinement. By tuning the interspecies interactions and the lattice heights we
have found the ground states, within the mean-field approximation, that
interpolate from the phase separation to the AF order. For a moderate lattice
height the coexistence of the Mott and AF phase is possible for the Rb atoms
while the K atoms remain in the AF-superfluid phase. This observation may
provide an experimental feasibility to hitherto unobserved AF order for
$^{87}$Rb - $^{41}$K mixture.
