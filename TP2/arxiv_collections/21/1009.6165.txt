We study simultaneous X-ray and optical observations of three intermediate
polars EX Hya, V1223 Sgr and TV Col with the aim to understand the propagation
of matter in their accretion flows. We show that in all cases the power spectra
of flux variability of binary systems in X-rays and in optical band are similar
to each other and the majority of X-ray and optical fluxes are correlated with
time lag <1 sec. These findings support the idea that optical emission of
accretion disks, in these binary systems,largely originates as reprocessing of
X-ray luminosity of their white dwarfs. In the best obtained dataset of EX Hya
we see that the optical lightcurve unambiguously contains some component, which
leads the X-ray emission by ~7 sec. We interpret this in the framework of the
model of propagating fluctuations and thus deduce the time of travel of the
matter from the innermost part of the truncated accretion disk to the white
dwarf surface. This value agrees very well with the time expected for matter
threaded onto the magnetosphere of the white dwarf to fall to its surface. The
datasets of V1223 Sgr and TV Col in general confirm these findings,but have
poorer quality.
