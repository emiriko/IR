The innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) delimits the transition from
circular orbits to those that plunge into a black hole. In the test-mass limit,
well-defined ISCO conditions exist for the Kerr and Schwarzschild spacetimes.
In the finite-mass case, there are a large variety of ways to define an ISCO in
a post-Newtonian (PN) context. Here I generalize the gauge-invariant ISCO
condition of Blanchet & Iyer (2003) to the case of spinning (nonprecessing)
binaries. The Blanchet-Iyer ISCO condition has two desirable and unexpected
properties: (1) it exactly reproduces the Schwarzschild ISCO in the test-mass
limit, and (2) it accurately approximates the recently-calculated shift in the
Schwarzschild ISCO frequency due to the conservative-piece of the gravitational
self-force [Barack & Sago (2009)]. The generalization of this ISCO condition to
spinning binaries has the property that it also exactly reproduces the Kerr
ISCO in the test-mass limit (up to the order at which PN spin corrections are
currently known). The shift in the ISCO due to the spin of the test-particle is
also calculated. Remarkably, the gauge-invariant PN ISCO condition exactly
reproduces the ISCO shift predicted by the Papapetrou equations for a
fully-relativistic spinning particle. It is surprising that an analysis of the
stability of the standard PN equations of motion is able (without any form of
"resummation") to accurately describe strong-field effects of the Kerr
spacetime. The ISCO frequency shift due to the conservative self-force in Kerr
is also calculated from this new ISCO condition, as well as from the
effective-one-body Hamiltonian of Barausse & Buonanno (2010). These results
serve as a useful point-of-comparison for future gravitational self-force
calculations in the Kerr spacetime.
