A mechanically bistable single-walled carbon nanotube can act as a
variable-shaped capacitor with a voltage-controlled transition between
collapsed and inflated states. This external control parameter provides a means
to tune the system so that collapsed and inflated states are degenerate, at
which point the tube's susceptibility to diverse external stimuli--
temperature, voltage, trapped atoms -- diverges following a universal curve,
yielding an exceptionally sensitive sensor or actuator that is characterized by
a vanishing energy scale. For example, the boundary between collapsed and
inflated states can shift hundreds of Angstroms in response to the presence or
absence of a single gas atom in the core of the tube. Several potential
nano-electromechanical devices can be based on this electrically tuned
crossover between near-degenerate collapsed and inflated configurations.
