We here experimentally demonstrate that coupled gyration modes can be
resonantly excited primarily by the ac current in a pair of ferromagnetic disks
with varied separating distance. The sole gyrotropic mode clearly splits into a
higher and a lower frequency modes for different configurations of polarities
via dipolar interaction. These experimental results indicate that the
magnetostatically coupled pair of vortices behaves similar to a diatomic
molecule with bonding and anti-bonding states. These findings lead to the
possible extension of designing the magnonic band structure in a chain or an
array of vortices.
