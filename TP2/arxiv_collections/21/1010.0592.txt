The study of quantum Coulomb systems at equilibrium is important for
understanding properties of matter in many physical situations. Screening,
recombination and van der Waals forces are basic phenomena which result from
the interplay of Coulomb interactions, collective effects and quantum
mechanics. Those phenomena are introduced in the first part of this lecture,
through various physical examples. Their treatment within mean-field theories
and phenomenological approaches is also exposed, while related predictions are
discussed. This sheds light on fundamental issues, which must be analyzed
without any \textsl{a priori} approximations or modelizations. The second part
of this lecture is precisely devoted to the presentation of various exact
results for the quantum proton-electron hydrogen plasma. Such results are
derived within the Screened Cluster Representation, which is constructed by
combining the path integral representation of the Coulomb gas with Mayer-like
diagrammatical techniques. They illustrate the breakdown of Debye exponential
screening by quantum fluctuations, as well as the emergence of familiar
chemical species in suitable low-temperature and low-density limits. Also, the
amplitude of van der Waals forces is shown to be reduced by free charges.
