The manuscript presents a theoretical proof in conglomeration with new
definitions on Inaccessibility and Inside for a point S related to a simple or
self intersecting polygon P. The proposed analytical solution depicts a novel
way of solving the point in polygon problem by employing the properties of
epigraphs and hypographs, explicitly. Contrary to the ambiguous solutions given
by the cross over for the simple and self intersecting polygons and the
solution of a point being multiply inside a self intersecting polygon given by
the winding number rule, the current solution gives unambiguous and singular
result for both kinds of polygons. Finally, the current theoretical solution
proves to be mathematically correct for simple and self intersecting polygons.
