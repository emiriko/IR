Context: Empirical libraries of stellar spectra play an important role in
different fields. For example, they are used as reference for the automatic
determination of atmospheric parameters, or for building synthetic stellar
populations to study galaxies. The CFLIB (Coude-feed library, Indo-US) database
is at present one of the most complete libraries, in terms of its coverage of
the atmospheric parameters space (Teff, log g and [Fe/H]) and wavelength
coverage 3460 - 9464 A at a resolution of 1 A FWHM. Although the atmospheric
parameters of most of the stars were determined from detailed analyses of
high-resolution spectra, for nearly 300 of the 1273 stars of the library at
least one of the three parameters is missing. For the others, the measurements,
compiled from the literature, are inhomogeneous.
  Aims: In this paper, we re-determine the atmospheric parameters, directly
using the CFLIB spectra, and compare them to the previous studies.
  Methods: We use the ULySS program to derive the atmospheric parameters, using
the ELODIE library as a reference.
  Results: Based on comparisons with several previous studies we conclude that
our determinations are unbiased. For the 958 F,G, and K type stars the
precision on Teff, log g, and [Fe/H] is respectively 43 K, 0.13 dex and 0.05
dex. For the 53 M stars they are 82 K, 0.22 dex and 0.28 dex. And, for the 260
OBA type stars the relative precision on Teff is 5.1%, and on log g, and [Fe/H]
the precision is respectively 0.19 dex and 0.16 dex. These parameters will be
used to re-calibrate the CFLIB fluxes and to produce synthetic spectra of
stellar populations.
