In this work we use the Schwinger-Dyson equations to study the possibility
that an enhanced gravitational attraction triggers the formation of a right
handed neutrino condensate, inducing dynamical symmetry breaking and generating
a Majorana mass for the right handed neutrino at a scale appropriate for the
see-saw mechanism. The composite field formed by the condensate phase could
drive an early epoch of inflation. We find that to the lowest order, the theory
does not allow dynamical symmetry breaking. Nevertheless, thanks to the large
number of matter fields in the model, the suppression by additional powers in G
of higher order terms can be compensated, boosting them up to their lowest
order counterparts. This way chiral symmetry can be broken dynamically and the
infrared mass generated turns out to be in the expected range for a successful
see-saw scenario.
