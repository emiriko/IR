Type IIn Supernovae (SNe IIn) are rare events, constituting only a few
percent of all core-collapse SNe, and the current sample of well observed SNe
IIn is small. Here, we study the four SNe IIn observed by the Caltech
Core-Collapse Project (CCCP). The CCCP SN sample is unbiased to the extent that
object selection was not influenced by target SN properties. Therefore, these
events are representative of the observed population of SNe IIn. We find that a
narrow P-Cygni profile in the hydrogen Balmer lines appears to be a ubiquitous
feature of SNe IIn. Our light curves show a relatively long rise time (>20
days) followed by a slow decline stage (0.01 to 0.15 mag/day), and a typical
V-band peak magnitude of M_V=-18.4 +/- 1.0 mag. We measure the progenitor star
wind velocities (600 - 1400 km/s) for the SNe in our sample and derive
pre-explosion mass loss rates (0.026 - 0.12 solar masses per year). We compile
similar data for SNe IIn from the literature, and discuss our results in the
context of this larger sample. Our results indicate that typical SNe IIn arise
from progenitor stars that undergo LBV-like mass-loss shortly before they
explode.
