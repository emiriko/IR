Understanding and predicting the formation of shell structure from nuclear
forces is a central challenge for nuclear physics. While the magic numbers
N=2,8,20 are generally well understood, N=28 is the first standard magic number
that is not reproduced in microscopic theories with two-nucleon forces. In this
Letter, we show that three-nucleon forces give rise to repulsive interactions
between two valence neutrons that are key to explain 48Ca as a magic nucleus,
with a high 2+ excitation energy and a concentrated magnetic dipole transition
strength. The repulsive three-nucleon mechanism improves the agreement with
experimental binding energies.
