The pinch-off of an air bubble from an underwater nozzle ends in a
singularity with a remarkable sensitivity to a variety of perturbations. I
report on experiments that break both the axial (i.e., vertical) and azimuthal
symmetry of the singularity formation. The density of the inner gas influences
the axial asymmetry of the neck near pinch-off. For denser gases, flow through
the neck late in collapse changes the pinch-off dynamics. Gas density is also
implicated in the formation of satellite bubbles. The azimuthal shape
oscillations described by Schmidt et al., can be initiated by anisotropic
boundary conditions in the liquid as well as with an asymmetric nozzle shape. I
measure the n = 3 oscillatory mode, and observe the nonlinear, highly
three-dimensional outcomes of pinch-off with large azimuthal perturbations.
These are consistent with prior theory.
