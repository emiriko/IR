A positive definiteness criterion and, under the additional conditions, a
nonnegativity criterion for a self-adjoint continuous operator matrix, acting
in product of an arbitrary number of real separable Hilbert spaces, are
obtained. As application, both sufficient and necessary analytical conditions
of functional extremum of several Hilbert variables are considered.
