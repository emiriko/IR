Conserving power in mobile ad-hoc and sensor networks is a big challenge.
Most of the nodes in these networks, in general, are battery powered,
therefore, an efficient power saving protocol is required to extend the
lifetime of such networks. A lot of work has been done and several protocols
have been proposed to address this problem. Gossip based protocols, which are
based on the results of percolation theory, significantly reduce power
consumption with very little implementation overhead. However, not much work
has been done to make gossiping battery aware. In this paper we introduce a
simple gossip based battery aware sleep protocol. The protocol allows low
battery nodes to sleep more, therefore, improves overall network lifetime.
