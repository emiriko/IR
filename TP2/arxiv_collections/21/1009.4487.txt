We prove the completeness of the Bethe ansatz eigenfunctions of the Laplacian
on a Weyl alcove with repulsive boundary condition at the walls. For the root
system of type A this amounts to the result of Dorlas of the completeness of
the Bethe ansatz eigenfunctions of the quantum Bose gas on the circle with
repulsive delta-function interaction.
