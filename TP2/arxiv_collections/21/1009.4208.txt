In this work we generate two-photon hybrid entangled states (HES), where the
polarization of one photon is entangled with the transverse spatial degree of
freedom of the second photon. The photon pair is created by parametric
down-conversion in a polarization-entangled state. A birefringent double-slit
couples the polarization and spatial degrees of freedom of these photons and
finally, suitable spatial and polarization projections generate the HES. We
investigate some interesting aspects of the two-photon hybrid interference, and
present this study in the context of the complementarity relation that exists
between the visibilities of the one- and two-photon interference patterns.
