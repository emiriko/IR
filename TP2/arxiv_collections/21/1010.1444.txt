In this paper, we have considered that the universe is filled with tachyon,
hessence (or hantom) dark energies. Subsequently we have investigated the
interactions between tachyon and hessence (hantom) dark energies and calculated
the potentials considering the power law form of the scale factor. It has been
revealed that the tachyonic potential always decreases and hessence (or hantom)
potential increases with corresponding fields. Furthermore, we have considered
a correspondence between the hessence (or hantom) dark energy density and new
variable modified Chaplygin gas energy density. From this, we have found the
expressions of the arbitrary positive constants B0 and C of new variable
modified Chaplygin gas.
