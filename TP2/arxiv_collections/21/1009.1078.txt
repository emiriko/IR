We introduce a novel generalization of the discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger
equation. It supports solitons that describe how proteins fold. As an example
we scrutinize the villin headpiece HP35, an archetypal protein for testing both
experimental and theoretical approaches to protein folding. Using explicit
soliton profiles we construct its carbon backbone with an unprecedented
accuracy.
