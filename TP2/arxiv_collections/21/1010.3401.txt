Econophysics is a new research field, which makes an attempt to bring
economics in the fold of natural sciences or specifically attempts for a
"physics of economics". The term Econophysics was formally born in Kolkata in
1995. The entry on Econophysics in The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics,
2nd Ed., Vol 2, Macmillan, NY (2008), pp 729-732, begins with "... the term
'econophysics' was neologized in 1995 at the second Statphys- Kolkata
conference in Kolkata (formerly Calcutta), India ...". The Econophysics
research therefore formally completes fifteen years of research by the end of
this year! The importance and proliferation of the interdisciplinary research
of Econophysics is highlighted in the special issue of Science & Culture, which
presents a collection of twenty nine papers (giving country wise perspectives,
reviews of the recent developments and original research communications),
written by more than forty renowned experts in physics, mathematics or
economics, from all over the world. We present here the list of contents and
the editorial. The manuscript files are available at
http://fiquant.mas.ecp.fr/chakraboa for preview. This special issue will be
published online at http://www.scienceandculture-isna.org/journal.htm, at the
end of October 2010.
