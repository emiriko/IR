We develop a series of resonant short-range two-boson potentials reproducing
the same two-body low-energy observables and apply them in three- and four-body
calculations. We demonstrate that the universal behavior predicted by effective
field theory may be strongly violated and analyze the conditions for this
phenomenon.
