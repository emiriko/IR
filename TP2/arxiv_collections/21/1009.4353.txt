Motivated by a recent discovery of Supernova 2010gx and numerical results of
Fryer et al.(2010), we simulate light curves for several type I supernova
models, enshrouded by dense circumstellar shells, or "super-wind", rich in
carbon and oxygen and having no hydrogen. We demonstrate that the most luminous
events like SN2010gx can be explained by those models at moderate explosion
energies (2-3) foe if the total mass of SN ejecta and a shell is (3-5) Msun and
the radius of the shell is ~10^{16} cm.
