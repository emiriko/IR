In this paper, we study a non-linear numerical scheme arising from the
implicit time discretization of the Ba\v{z}ant-Thonguthai model for
hygro-thermal behavior of concrete at high temperatures. Existence and
uniqueness of the time-discrete solution in two dimensions is established using
the theory of pseudomonotone operators in Banach spaces. Next, the spatial
discretization is accomplished by the conforming finite element method. An
illustrative numerical example shows that the numerical model reproduces well
the rapid increase of pore pressure in wet concrete due to extreme heating.
Such phenomenon is of particular interest for the safety assessment of concrete
structures prone to thermally-induced spalling.
