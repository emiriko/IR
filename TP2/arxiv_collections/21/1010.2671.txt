Incoherent bremsstrahlung by high-energy particles in crystal is due to the
thermal spread of atoms in relation to their equilibrium positions in the
lattice. The simulation procedure developed earlier for the incoherent
radiation is applied to the case of the electrons and positrons motion in the
sinusoidally bent crystal. The results of simulation are in agreement with the
data of recent experiments carried out at the Mainz Microtron MAMI. The
possibility of use of the sinusoidally bent crystals as undulators is
discussed.
