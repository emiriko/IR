A method for analysing the risk of taking a too low reserve level by use of
Chain Ladder method is developed. We give an answer to the question of how much
safety loading in terms of the Chain Ladder standard error has to be added to
the Chain Ladder reserve in order to reach a specified security level in loss
reserving. This is an important question in the framework of integrated risk
management of an insurance company. Furthermore we investigate the relative
bias of Chain Ladder estimators. We use Monte Carlo simulation technique as
well as the collective model of risk theory in each cell of run-off table. We
analyse deviation between Chain Ladder reserves and Monte Carlo simulated
reserves statistically. Our results document dependency on claim number and
claim size distribution types and parameters.
