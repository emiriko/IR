In this article we analyze the predictions of the Einstein gravitation theory
(EGT) on black holes in the framework of the Schwarzschild geometry that is
defined in the vacuum around a spherically symmetric mass distribution, without
charge, not in rotation. The Eddington and Kruskal metrics have been also taken
unto account and the topological connections named wormholes have been
analyzed. This article was written to graduate and postgraduate students of
Physics.
