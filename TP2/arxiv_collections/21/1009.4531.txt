We use theory and simulations to investigate the existence of amorphous
glassy states in ultrasoft colloids. We combine the hyper-netted chain
approximation with mode-coupling theory to study the dynamic phase diagram of
soft repulsive spheres interacting with a Hertzian potential, focusing on low
temperatures and large densities. At constant temperature, we find that an
amorphous glassy state is entered upon compression, as in colloidal hard
spheres, but the glass unexpectedly melts when density increases further. We
attribute this re-entrant fluid-glass transition to particle softness, and
correlate this behaviour to previously reported anomalies in soft systems, thus
emphasizing its generality. The predicted fluid-glass-fluid sequence is
confirmed numerically.
