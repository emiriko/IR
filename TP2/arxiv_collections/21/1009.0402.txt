The main aim of the research was to examine educational use of Facebook. The
Computer Networks and Communication lesson was taken as the sample and the
attitudes of the students included in the study group towards Facebook were
measured in a semi-experimental setup. The students on Facebook platform were
examined for about three months and they continued their education
interactively in that virtual environment. After the-three-month-education
period, observations for the students were reported and the attitudes of the
students towards Facebook were measured by three different measurement tools.
As a result, the attitudes of the students towards educational use of Facebook
and their views were heterogeneous. When the average values of the group were
examined, it was reported that the attitudes towards educational use of
Facebook was above a moderate level. Therefore, it might be suggested that
social networks in virtual environments provide continuity in life long
learning.
