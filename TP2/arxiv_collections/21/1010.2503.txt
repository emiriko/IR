We show how the relation between $Q$-manifolds and Lie algebroids extends to
``higher'' or ``non-linear'' analogs of Lie algebroids. We study the identities
satisfied by a new algebraic structure that arises as a replacement of
operations on sections of a Lie algebroid. When the base is a point, we obtain
a generalization of Lie superalgebras.
