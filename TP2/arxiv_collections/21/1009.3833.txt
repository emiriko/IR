We derive the modified Friedmann equation corresponding to the power-law
corrected entropy-area relation $S_{\rm A}=\frac{A}{4}[1-K_{\alpha}
A^{1-\frac{\alpha}{2}}]$ which is motivated by the entanglement of quantum
fields in and out of the apparent horizon. We consider a non-flat modified FRW
universe containing an interacting viscous dark energy with dark matter and
radiation. For the selected model, we study the effect of the power-law
correction term to the entropy on the dynamics of dark energy. Furthermore, we
investigate the validity of the generalized second law (GSL) of gravitational
thermodynamics on the apparent horizon and conclude that the GSL is satisfied
for $\alpha<2$.
