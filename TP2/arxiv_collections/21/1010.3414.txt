Let k be a field of characteristic 0 and let X be a smooth geometrically
integral k-variety. In our previous paper we defined the extended Picard
complex UPic(X) as a certain complex of Galois modules in degrees 0 and 1. We
computed the isomorphism class of UPic(G) in the derived category of Galois
modules for a connected linear k-group G. In this paper we assume that X is a
homogeneous space of a connected linear k-group G with geometric stabilizer H.
We compute the isomorphism class of UPic(X) in the derived category of Galois
modules in terms of the character groups of G and H. The proof is based on the
notion of the extended equivariant Picard complex UPic_G(X) of a G-variety X.
