We present angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) studies of the
cuprate high-temperature superconductors which elucidate the relation between
superconductivity and the pseudogap and highlight low-energy quasiparticle
dynamics in the superconducting state. Our experiments suggest that the
pseudogap and superconducting gap represent distinct states, which coexist
below T$_c$. Studies on Bi-2212 demonstrate that the near-nodal and
near-antinodal regions behave differently as a function of temperature and
doping, implying that different orders dominate in different momentum-space
regions. However, the ubiquity of sharp quasiparticles all around the Fermi
surface in Bi-2212 indicates that superconductivity extends into the
momentum-space region dominated by the pseudogap, revealing subtlety in this
dichotomy. In Bi-2201, the temperature dependence of antinodal spectra reveals
particle-hole asymmetry and anomalous spectral broadening, which may constrain
the explanation for the pseudogap. Recognizing that electron-boson coupling is
an important aspect of cuprate physics, we close with a discussion of the
multiple 'kinks' in the nodal dispersion. Understanding these may be important
to establishing which excitations are important to superconductivity.
