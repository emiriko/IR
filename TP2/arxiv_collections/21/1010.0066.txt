This report studies a continuous-time version of the well-known
Hegselmann-Krause model of opinion dynamics with bounded confidence. As the
equations of this model have discontinuous right-hand side, we study their
Krasovskii solutions. We present results about existence and completeness of
solutions, and asymptotical convergence to equilibria featuring a
"clusterization" of opinions. The robustness of such equilibria to small
perturbations is also studied.
