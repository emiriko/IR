In this paper, we present new data with interstellar C2 (Phillips bands A-X),
from observations made with the Ultraviolet-Visual Echelle Spectrograph of the
European Southern Observatory. We have determined the interstellar column
densities and excitation temperatures of C2 for nine Galactic lines. For seven
of these, C2 has never been observed before, so in this case the still small
sample of interstellar clouds (26 lines of sight), where a detailed analysis of
C2 excitation has been made, has increased significantly. This paper is a
continuation of previous works where interstellar molecules (C2 and diffuse
interstellar bands) have been analysed. Because the sample of interstellar
clouds with C2 has increased, we can show that the width and shape of the
profiles of some diffuse interstellar bands (6196 and 5797 A) apparently depend
on the gas kinetic and rotational temperatures of C2; the profiles are broader
because of the higher values of the gas kinetic and rotational temperatures of
C2. There are also diffuse interstellar bands (4964 and 5850 A) for which this
effect does not exist.
