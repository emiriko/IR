The measurement of the CP violation in the b-meson system and of b-meson rare
decays provides information about the electroweak symmetry breaking in terms of
flavour structure of the CKM matrix and flavour changing neutral currents. The
deviation of the experimental observations from the Standard Model predictions
allows to constrain new physics. In this paper recent results from Tevatron are
reported.
