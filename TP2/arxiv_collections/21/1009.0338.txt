We report the result of the analysis of a dramatic repeating gravitational
microlensing event OGLE-2009-BLG-092/MOA-2009-BLG-137, for which the light
curve is characterized by two distinct peaks with perturbations near both
peaks. We find that the event is produced by the passage of the source
trajectory over the central perturbation regions associated with the individual
components of a wide-separation binary. The event is special in the sense that
the second perturbation, occurring $\sim 100$ days after the first, was
predicted by the real-time analysis conducted after the first peak,
demonstrating that real-time modeling can be routinely done for binary and
planetary events. With the data obtained from follow-up observations covering
the second peak, we are able to uniquely determine the physical parameters of
the lens system. We find that the event occurred on a bulge clump giant and it
was produced by a binary lens composed of a K and M-type main-sequence stars.
The estimated masses of the binary components are $M_1=0.69 \pm 0.11\ M_\odot$
and $M_2=0.36\pm 0.06\ M_\odot$, respectively, and they are separated in
projection by $r_\perp=10.9\pm 1.3\ {\rm AU}$. The measured distance to the
lens is $D_{\rm L}=5.6 \pm 0.7\ {\rm kpc}$. We also detect the orbital motion
of the lens system.
