Surface acoustic waves (SAW) in the GHz frequency range are exploited for the
all-elastic excitation and detection of ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) in a
ferromagnetic/ferroelectric (nickel/lithium niobate) hybrid device. We measure
the SAW magneto-transmission at room temperature as a function of frequency,
external magnetic field magnitude, and orientation. Our data are well described
by a modified Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert approach, in which a virtual,
strain-induced tickle field drives the magnetization precession. This causes a
distinct magnetic field orientation dependence of elastically driven FMR that
we observe in both model and experiment.
