We provide an 'effective theory' of tidal dissipation in extrasolar planet
systems by empirically calibrating a model for the equilibrium tide. The model
is valid to high order in eccentricity and parameterised by two constants of
bulk dissipation - one for dissipation in the planet and one for dissipation in
the host star. We are able to consistently describe the distribution of
extrasolar planetary systems in terms of period, eccentricity and mass (with a
lower limit of a Saturn mass) with this simple model. Our model is consistent
with the survival of short-period exoplanet systems, but not with the
circularisation period of equal mass stellar binaries, suggesting that the
latter systems experience a higher level of dissipation than exoplanet host
stars. Our model is also not consistent with the explanation of inflated
planetary radii as resulting from tidal dissipation. The paucity of short
period planets around evolved A stars is explained as the result of enhanced
tidal inspiral resulting from the increase in stellar radius with evolution.
