The theory of gravitational lensing is reviewed from a spacetime perspective,
without quasi-Newtonian approximations. More precisely, the review covers all
aspects of gravitational lensing where light propagation is described in terms
of lightlike geodesics of a metric of Lorentzian signature. It includes the
basic equations and the relevant techniques for calculating the position, the
shape, and the brightness of images in an arbitrary general-relativistic
spacetime. It also includes general theorems on the classification of caustics,
on criteria for multiple imaging, and on the possible number of images. The
general results are illustrated with examples of spacetimes where the lensing
features can be explicitly calculated, including the Schwarzschild spacetime,
the Kerr spacetime, the spacetime of a straight string, plane gravitational
waves, and others.
