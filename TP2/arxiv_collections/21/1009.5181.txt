The scattering solutions of the one-dimensional Schrodinger equation for the
Woods-Saxon potential are obtained within the position-dependent mass
formalism. The wave functions, transmission and reflection coefficients are
calculated in terms of Heun's function. These results are also studied for the
constant mass case in detail.
