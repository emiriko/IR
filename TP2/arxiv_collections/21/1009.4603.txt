We analyze quantization of noncommutative chiral electrodynamics in the
enveloping algebra formalism in linear order in noncommutativity parameter
$\theta$. Calculations show that divergences exist and cannot be removed by
ordinary renormalization, however they can be removed by the Seiberg-Witten
redefinition of fields. Performing the redefinitions explicitly, we obtain
renormalizable lagrangian and discuss the influence of noncommutativity on
field propagation. Noncommutativity affects the propagation of chiral fermions
only: half of the fermionic modes become massive and birefringent.
