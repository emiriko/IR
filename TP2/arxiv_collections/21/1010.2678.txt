To face the challenges lying beyond current CMOS-based technology, new
paradigms for information processing are required. Magnonics proposes to use
spin waves to carry and process information, in analogy with photonics that
relies on light waves, with several advantageous features such as potential
operation in the THz range and excellent coupling to spintronics. Several
magnonic analog and digital logic devices have been proposed, and some
demonstrated. Just as for spintronics, a key issue for magnonics is the large
power required to control/write information (conventionally achieved through
magnetic fields applied by strip lines, or by spin transfer from large
spin-polarized currents). Here we show that in BiFeO3, a room-temperature
magnetoelectric material, the spin wave frequency (>600 GHz) can be tuned
electrically by over 30%, in a non-volatile way and with virtually no power
dissipation. Theoretical calculations indicate that this effect originates from
a linear magnetoelectric effect related to spin-orbit coupling induced by the
applied electric field. We argue that these properties make BiFeO3 a promising
medium for spin wave generation, conversion and control in future magnonics
architectures.
