We report on finding variations in amplitude of the two main oscillation
frequencies found in the Be star Achernar, over a period of 5 years. They were
uncovered by analysing photometric data of the star from the SMEI instrument.
The two frequencies observed, 0.775 c/d and 0.725 c/d, were analysed in detail
and their amplitudes were found to increase and decrease significantly over the
5-year period, with the amplitude of the 0.725 c/d frequency changing by up to
a factor of eight. The nature of this event has yet to be properly understood,
but the possibility of it being due to the effects of a stellar outburst or a
stellar cycle are discussed.
