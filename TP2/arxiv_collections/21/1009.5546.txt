We derive an analytical expression, from classical electron trajectories in a
laser field, that relates the breadth of a streaked photoelectron spectrum to
the group-delay dispersion of an isolated attosecond pulse. Based on this
analytical expression, we introduce a simple, efficient and robust procedure to
instantly extract the attosecond pulse's chirp from the streaking measurement.
