Dynamics of stacked intrinsic Josephson junctions (IJJ) in the high-Tc
superconductors is theoretically investigated. We calculate the current-voltage
characteristics (CVC) of IJJ and study the breakpoint region on the outermost
branch of the CVC for the stacks with 9 IJJ. A method for investigation of the
fine structure in CVC of IJJ based on the recording the "phase-charge" diagrams
is suggested. It is demonstrated that this method reflects the main features of
the breakpoint region.
