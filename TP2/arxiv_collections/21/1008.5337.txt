The geometric measure, the logarithmic robustness and the relative entropy of
entanglement are proved to be equal for a stabilizer quantum codeword. The
entanglement upper and lower bounds are determined with the generators of code.
The entanglement of dual-containing CSS codes, Gottesman codes and the related
codes are given. An iterative algorithm is developed to determine the exact
value of the entanglement when the two bounds are not equal.
