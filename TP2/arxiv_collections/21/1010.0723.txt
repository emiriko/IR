We present one of the new generations of observatories, the Stratospheric
Observatory For Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA). This is an airborne observatory
consisting of a 2.7-m telescope mounted on a modified Boeing B747-SP airplane.
Flying at an up to 45,000 ft (14 km) altitude, SOFIA will observe above more
than 99 percent of the Earth's atmospheric water vapor allowing observations in
the normally obscured far-infrared. We outline the observatory capabilities and
goals. The first-generation science instruments flying on board SOFIA and their
main astronomical goals are also presented.
