The transition from Asymptotic Giant Branch star to Planetary Nebula is
short-lived and mysterious. Though it lasts only a few thousand years, it is
thought to be the time when the asymmetries observed in subsequent phases
arise. During this epoch, the star is shrouded in thick clouds of dust and
molecular gas; infrared observations are needed to reveal these objects at
their most pivotal moment. I present preliminary results of a Spitzer study of
targets spanning the range from post-AGB stars to Planetary Nebulae with the
goal of determining the genesis of asymmetry in these objects.
