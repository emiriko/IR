The behaviour of a di-nuclear system in the regime of strong pairing
correlations is studied with the methods of statistical mechanics. It is shown
that the thermal averaging is strong enough to assure the application of
thermodynamical methods to the energy exchange between the two nuclei in
contact. In particular, thermal averaging justifies the definition of a nuclear
temperature.
