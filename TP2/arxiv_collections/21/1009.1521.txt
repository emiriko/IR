We use the current orbital structure of large (>50km) asteroids in the main
asteroid belt to constrain the evolution of the giant planets when they
migrated from their primordial orbits to their current ones. Minton & Malhotra
(2009) showed that the orbital distribution of large asteroids in the main belt
can be reproduced by an exponentially-decaying migration of the giant planets
on a time scale of tau ~ 0.5My. However, self-consistent numerical simulations
show that the planetesimal-driven migration of the giant planets is
inconsistent with an exponential change in their semi major axes on such a
short time scale (Hahn & Malhotra, 1999). In fact, the typical time scale is
tau > 5My. When giant planet migration on this time scale is applied to the
asteroid belt, the resulting orbital distribution is incompatible with the
observed one. However, the planet migration can be significantly sped up by
planet-planet encounters. Consider an evolution where both Jupiter and Saturn
have close encounters with a Neptune-mass planet (presumably Uranus or Neptune
themselves) and where this third planet, after being scattered inwards by
Saturn, is scattered outwards by Jupiter. This scenario leads to a very rapid
increase in the orbital separation between Jupiter and Saturn that we show here
to have only mild effects on the structure of asteroid belt. This type of
evolution is called a jumping-Jupiter case. Our results suggest that the total
mass and dynamical excitation of the asteroid belt before migration were
comparable to those currently observed. Moreover, they imply that, before
migration, the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn were much less eccentric than the
current ones.
