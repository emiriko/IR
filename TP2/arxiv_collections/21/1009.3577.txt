A complex radio event was observed on January 17, 2005 with the
radio-spectrograph ARTEMIS-IV, operating at Thermopylae, Greece; it was
associated with an X3.8 SXR flare and two fast Halo CMEs in close succession.
We present dynamic spectra of this event; the high time resolution (1/100 s) of
the data in the 450-270 MHz range, makes possible the detection and analysis of
the fine structure which this major radio event exhibits. The fine structure
was found to match, almost, the comprehensive Ondrejov Catalogue which it
refers to the spectral range 0.8-2 GHz, yet seems to produce similar fine
structure with the metric range.
