This paper is concerned with the diffusion of a fluid through a viscoelastic
solid undergoing large deformations. Using ideas from the classical theory of
mixtures and a thermodynamic framework based on the notion of maximization of
the rate of entropy production, the constitutive relations for a mixture of a
viscoelastic solid and a fluid (specifically Newtonian fluid) are derived. By
prescribing forms for the specific Helmholtz potential and the rate of
dissipation, we derive the relations for the partial stress in the solid, the
partial stress in the fluid, the interaction force between the solid and the
fluid, and the evolution equation of the natural configuration of the solid. We
also use the assumption that the volume of the mixture is equal to the sum of
the volumes of the two constituents in their natural state as a constraint.
Results from the developed model are shown to be in good agreement with the
experimental data for the diffusion of various solvents through high
temperature polyimides that are used in the aircraft industry. The swelling of
a viscoelastic solid under the application of an external force is also
studied.
