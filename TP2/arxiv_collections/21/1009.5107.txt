Indirect Dark Matter searches are based on the observation of secondary
particles produced by the annihilation or decay of Dark Matter. Among them,
gamma-rays are perhaps the most promising messengers, as they do not suffer
deflection or absorption on Galactic scales, so their observation would
directly reveal the position and the energy spectrum of the emitting source.
Here, we study the detailed gamma-ray energy spectrum of Kaluza--Klein Dark
Matter in a theory with 5 Universal Extra Dimensions. We focus in particular on
the two body annihilation of Dark Matter particles into a photon and another
particle, which produces monochromatic photons, resulting in a line in the
energy spectrum of gamma rays. Previous calculations in the context of the five
dimensional UED model have computed the line signal from annihilations into
\gamma \gamma, but we extend these results to include \gamma Z and \gamma H
final states. We find that these spectral lines are subdominant compared to the
predicted \gamma \gamma signal, but they would be important as follow-up
signals in the event of the observation of the \gamma \gamma line, in order to
distinguish the 5d UED model from other theoretical scenarios.
