We systematically investigate the topological band structures of half-Heusler
compounds using first-principles calculations. The modified Becke-Johnson
exchange potential together with local density approximation for the
correlation potential (MBJLDA) has been used here to obtain accurate band
inversion strength and band order. Our results show that a large number of
half-Heusler compounds are candidates for three-dimensional topological
insulators. The difference between band structures obtained using the local
density approximation (LDA) and MBJLDA potential is also discussed.
