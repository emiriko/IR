We are carrying out a search for all radio loud Active Galactic Nuclei
observed with XMM-Newton, including targeted and field sources to perform a
multi-wavelength study of these objects. We have cross-correlated the
Veron-Cetty & Veron (2010) catalogue with the XMM-Newton Serendipitous Source
Catalogue (2XMMi) and found about 4000 matched sources. A literature search
provided radio, optical, and X-ray data for 403 sources. Here we summarize the
first results of our study.
