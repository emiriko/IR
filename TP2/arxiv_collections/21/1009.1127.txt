In this publication, an algorithm is presented that combines the ME+PS
approach to merge sequences of tree-level matrix elements into inclusive event
samples with the POWHEG method, which combines exact next-to-leading order
matrix element results with the parton shower. It was developed in parallel to
the MENLOPS technique and has been implemented in the event generator Sherpa.
The benefits of this approach are exemplified by some first predictions for a
number of processes, namely the production of jets in e+ e- annihilation, in
deep-inelastic ep scattering, in association with single W, Z or Higgs bosons,
and with vector boson pairs at hadron colliders.
