This book draft gives the theory of a new method for p dimensional adaptive
integration by repeated 2^p subdivision of simplexes and hypercubes. A new
method of constructing high order integration routines for these geometries
permits adjustable samplings of the integration region controlled by user
supplied parameters. An outline of the programs and use instructions are also
included in the draft. The fortran programs are not included, but will be
published with this draft as a book.
