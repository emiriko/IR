We study the breathing oscillations in bose-fermi mixtures with Yb isotopes
in the largely prolate deformed trap, which are realized by Kyoto group. We
choose the three combinations of the Yb isotopes, Yb170-Yb171, Yb170-Yb173 and
Yb174-Yb173, whose boson-fermion interactions are weakly repulsive, strongly
attractive and strongly repulsive. The collective oscillations in the deformed
trap are calculated in the dynamical time-development approach, which is
formulated with the time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii and the Vlasov equations.
We analyze the results in the time-development approach with the intrinsic
oscillation modes of the deformed system, which are obtained using the scaling
method, and show that the damping and forced-oscillation effects of the
intrinsic modes give time-variation of oscillations, especially, in the fermion
transverse mode.
