A simple microscopic mechanism explaining the linear dependence of the
radiative lifetime of free-moving two-dimensional excitons on their effective
temperature is suggested. It is shown that there exists a characteristic
effective temperature (of about few Kelvin) defined by the exciton-acoustic
phonon interaction at which the radiative lifetime is minimal. Below this
temperature the lifetime starts to increase with decreasing temperature. The
correspondence with previous theoretical and experimental results is discussed.
