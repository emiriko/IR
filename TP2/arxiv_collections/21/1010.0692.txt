If the minimal supersymmetric standard model is the solution to the hierarchy
problem, the scalar top quark (stop) and the Higgsino should weigh around the
electroweak scale such as 200 GeV. A low messenger scale, which results in a
light gravitino, is also suggested to suppress the quantum corrections to the
Higgs mass parameters. Therefore the minimal model for natural supersymmetry is
a system with stop/Higgsino/gravitino whereas other superparticles are heavy.
We study the LHC signatures of the minimal system and discuss the discovery
potential and methods for the mass measurements.
