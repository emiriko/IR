Exact relativistic force free fields with cylindrical symmetry are explored.
Such fields are generated in the interstellar gas via their connection to
pulsar magnetospheres both inside and outside their light cylinders. The
possibility of much enhanced interstellar fields wound on cylinders of Solar
system dimensions is discussed but these are most likely unstable.
