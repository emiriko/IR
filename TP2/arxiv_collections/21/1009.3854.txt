The coefficient of the logarithmic term in the entropy on even spheres is
re-computed by the local technique of integrating the finite temperature energy
density up to the horizon on static d--dimensional de Sitter space and thence
finding the entropy by thermodynamics. Numeric evaluation yields the known
answer i.e. (minus) the conformal anomaly on the d-sphere. The de Sitter
quantities are obtained by conformal transformation of the Rindler ones,
themselves obtained, for convenience, from those around a cosmic string. The
expressions are given in terms of generalised Bernoulli polynomials for which
an identity is derived. The arising spherical conformal anomaly is discussed
and a formula is given for it for Branson's higher GJMS Laplacian, P_2k, as an
oscillating polynomial in the level, k.
