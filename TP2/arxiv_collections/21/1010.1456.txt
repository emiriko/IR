This paper presents implementation details and empirical results for a hybrid
message passing and shared memory paralleliziation of the adaptive integral
method (AIM). AIM is implemented on a (near) petaflop supercomputing cluster of
quad-core processors and its accuracy, complexity, and scalability are
investigated by solving benchmark scattering problems. The timing and speedup
results on up to 1024 processors show that the hybrid MPI/OpenMP
parallelization of AIM exhibits better strong scalability (fixed problem size
speedup) than pure MPI parallelization of it when multiple cores are used on
each processor.
