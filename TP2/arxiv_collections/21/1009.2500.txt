The age and metallicity gradients for a sample of group and cluster galaxies
from N-body+hydrodynamical simulation are analyzed in terms of galaxy stellar
mass. Dwarf galaxies show null age gradient with a tail of high and positive
values for systems in groups and cluster outskirts. Massive systems have
generally zero age gradients which turn to positive for the most massive ones.
Metallicity gradients are distributed around zero in dwarf galaxies and become
more negative with mass; massive galaxies have steeper negative metallicity
gradients, but the trend flatten with mass. In particular, fossil groups are
characterized by a tighter distribution of both age and metallicity gradients.
We find a good agreement with both local observations and independent
simulations. The results are also discussed in terms of the central age and
metallicity, as well as the total colour, specific star formation and velocity
dispersion.
