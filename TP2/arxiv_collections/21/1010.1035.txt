We study an exactly solvable quantum spin model of Kitaev type on the kagome
lattice. We find a rich phase diagram which includes a topological (gapped)
chiral spin liquid with gapless chiral edge states, and a gapless chiral spin
liquid phase with a spin Fermi surface. The ground state of the current model
contains an odd number of electrons per unit cell which qualitatively
distinguishes it from previously studied exactly solvable models with a spin
Fermi surface. Moreover, we show that the spin Fermi surface is stable against
weak perturbations.
