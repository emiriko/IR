Since the discovery of quasi-periodic propagating oscillations with periods
of order three to ten minutes in coronal loops with TRACE and EIT (later with
EUVI and EIS), they have been almost universally interpreted as evidence for
propagating slow-mode magnetoacoustic (MA) waves in the low-beta coronal
environment. We show that this interpretation is not unique. We focus instead
on the ubiquitous faint upflows, associated with blue asymmetries of spectral
line profiles in footpoint regions of coronal loops, and as faint disturbances
propagating along coronal loops in EUV/XR imaging timeseries. The two scenarios
are difficult to differentiate using only imaging data, but careful analysis of
spectral line profiles indicates that faint upflows are likely responsible for
some of the observed quasi-periodic oscillatory signals in the corona. We show
that EIS measurements of intensity and velocity oscillations in coronal lines
(previously interpreted as direct evidence for propagating waves) are actually
accompanied by significant oscillations in the line width that are driven by a
quasi-periodically varying component of emission in the blue wing of the line.
The faint blue-shifted emission component quasi-periodically modulates the peak
intensity and line-centroid of a single Gaussian fit to the profile with the
same small amplitudes (respectively a few percent of background intensity, and
a few km/s) used to infer the presence of MA waves. Our results indicate that a
significant fraction of the quasi-periodicities observed with coronal imagers
and spectrographs, previously interpreted as propagating MA waves, are caused
by these upflows. The different physical cause for coronal oscillations would
significantly impact the prospects of successful coronal seismology using
propagating disturbances in coronal loops.
