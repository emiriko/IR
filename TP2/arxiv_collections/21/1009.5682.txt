We use the boundary effective theory (BET) approach to thermal field theory
in order to calculate the pressure of a system of massless scalar fields with
quartic interaction. The method naturally separates the infrared physics, and
is essentially non-perturbative. To lowest order, the main ingredient is the
solution of the free Euler-Lagrange equation with non-trivial (time) boundary
conditions. We derive a resummed pressure, which is in good agreement with
recent calculations found in the literature, following a very direct and
compact procedure.
