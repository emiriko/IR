A survey of the Galactic plane in the region $-60\degree \leq l \leq
30\degree$, $|b| \leq 0.25\degree$ was carried out using the seven-beam Parkes
Methanol Multibeam (MMB) receiver, which operates at a frequency of 6.5 GHz.
Three pulsars were discovered, and 16 previously known pulsars detected. In
this paper we present two previously-unpublished discoveries, both with
extremely high dispersion measures, one of which is very close, in angular
distance, to the Galactic centre. The survey data also contain the first known
detection, at radio frequencies, of the radio magnetar PSR J1550-5418. Our
survey observation was made 46 days prior to that previously published and
places constraints on the beginning of pulsed radio emission from the source.
  The detection of only three previously undiscovered pulsars argues that there
are few pulsars in the direction of the inner Galaxy whose flux density
spectrum is governed by a flat power law. However, these pulsars would be
likely to remain undetected at lower frequencies due to the large amount of
scatter broadening which affects pulsars with high values of dispersion
measure. Surveys with future telescopes at high observing frequencies will,
therefore, play an important role in the discovery of pulsars at the Galactic
centre. By simulating pulsar surveys of the Galaxy with Phase 1 SKA at
frequencies of 1.4 GHz and 10 GHz, we find that high-frequency observations are
the only way to discover and observe the Galactic-centre pulsar population.
