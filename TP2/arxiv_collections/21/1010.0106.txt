We present a detailed rate analysis for a hybrid quantum repeater assuming
perfect memories and using optimal probabilistic entanglement generation and
deterministic swapping routines. The hybrid quantum repeater protocol is based
on atomic qubit-entanglement distribution through optical coherent-state
communication. An exact, analytical formula for the rates of entanglement
generation in quantum repeaters is derived, including a study on the impacts of
entanglement purification and multiplexing strategies. More specifically, we
consider scenarios with as little purification as possible and we show that for
sufficiently low local losses, such purifications are still more powerful than
multiplexing. In a possible experimental scenario, our hybrid system can create
near-maximally entangled (F = 0.98) pairs over a distance of 1280 km at rates
of the order of 100 Hz.
