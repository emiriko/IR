We follow arguments of Verlinde and Klinkhamer, and construct two models of
the microscopic theory of a holographic screen that allow for the
thermodynamical derivation of Newton's law, with Newton's constant expressed in
terms of a minimal length scale contained in the area spectrum of the
microscopic theory. One of the models is loosely related to the quantum
structure of surfaces and isolated horizons in loop quantum gravity. Our
investigation shows that the conclusions reached by Klinkhamer regarding the
new length scale seem to be generic in all their qualitative aspects.
