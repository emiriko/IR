We discuss some social contagion processes to describe the formation and
spread of radical opinions. The dynamics of opinion spread involves local
threshold processes as well as mean field effects. We calculate and observe
phase transitions in the dynamical variables resulting in a rapidly increasing
number of passive supporters. This strongly indicates that military solutions
are inappropriate.
