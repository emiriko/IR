G292.0+1.8 is a Cas A-like supernova remnant that contains the young pulsar
PSR J1124-5916 powering a compact torus-like pulsar wind nebula visible in
X-rays. A likely counterpart to the nebula has been detected in the optical VRI
bands. To confirm the counterpart candidate nature, we examined archival
mid-infrared data obtained with the Spitzer Space Telescope. Broad-band images
taken at 4.5, 8, 24, and 70 microns were analyzed and compared with available
optical and X-ray data. The extended counterpart candidate is firmly detected
in the 4.5 and 8 micron bands. It is brighter and more extended in the bands
than in the optical, and its position and morphology agree well with the
coordinates and morphology of the torus-like pulsar wind nebula in X-rays. The
source is not visible in 24 and 70 micron images, which are dominated by bright
emission from the remnant shell and filaments. We compiled the infrared fluxes
of the nebula, which probably contains a contribution from an unresolved pulsar
in its center, with the optical and X-ray data. The resulting unabsorbed
multiwavelength spectrum is described by power laws of significantly steeper
slope in the infrared-optical than in X-rays, implying a double-knee spectral
break between the optical and X-rays. The 24 and 70 microns flux upper limits
suggest a second break and a flatter spectrum at the long wavelength limit.
These features are common to two other pulsar wind nebulae associated with the
remnants B0540-69.3 and 3C 58 and observed in all three ranges. The position,
morphology, and spectral properties of the detected source allow us to comfirm
that it is the infrared-optical counterpart to both the pulsar and its wind
nebula system in the G292.0+1.8 supernova remnant.
