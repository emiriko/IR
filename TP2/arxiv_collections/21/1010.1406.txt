High-dimensional classification has become an increasingly important problem.
In this paper we propose a "Multivariate Adaptive Stochastic Search" (MASS)
approach which first reduces the dimension of the data space and then applies a
standard classification method to the reduced space. One key advantage of MASS
is that it automatically adjusts to mimic variable selection type methods, such
as the Lasso, variable combination methods, such as PCA, or methods that
combine these two approaches. The adaptivity of MASS allows it to perform well
in situations where pure variable selection or variable combination methods
fail. Another major advantage of our approach is that MASS can accurately
project the data into very low-dimensional non-linear, as well as linear,
spaces. MASS uses a stochastic search algorithm to select a handful of optimal
projection directions from a large number of random directions in each
iteration. We provide some theoretical justification for MASS and demonstrate
its strengths on an extensive range of simulation studies and real world data
sets by comparing it to many classical and modern classification methods.
