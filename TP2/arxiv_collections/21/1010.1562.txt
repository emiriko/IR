First part of the paper is devoted to applying the confinement mechanism
proposed earlier by the author to estimate the possible parameters of the
confining SU(3)-gluonic field in neutral kaons. The estimates obtained are
consistent with the widths of the electromagnetic decays
$K^0,\bar{K}^0\to2\gamma$ too. The corresponding estimates of the gluon
concentrations, electric and magnetic colour field strengths are also adduced
for the mentioned field at the scales of the mesons under consideration. The
second part of the paper takes into account the results obtained previously by
the author to estimate the purely gluonic contribution to the masses of all the
mesons of pseudoscalar nonet and also to consider a possible relation with a
phenomenological string-like picture of confinement. Finally, the problem of
masses in particle physics is shortly discussed within the framework of
approach to the chiral symmetry breaking in quantum chromodynamics (QCD)
proposed recently by the author.
