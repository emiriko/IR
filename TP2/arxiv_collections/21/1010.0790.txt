We consider QCD at very low temperatures and non-zero quark chemical
potential from lattice Monte Carlo simulations of the two-color theory in a
very small spatial volume (the attoscale). In this regime the quark number
rises in discrete levels in qualitative agreement with what is found
analytically at one loop on S3xS1 with radius R_S3 << 1/{\Lambda}_QCD. The
detailed level degeneracy, however, cannot be accounted for using weak coupling
arguments. At each rise in the quark number there is a corresponding spike in
the Polyakov line, also in agreement with the perturbative results. In addition
the quark number susceptibility shows a similar behaviour to the Polyakov line
and appears to be a good indicator of a confinement-deconfinement type of
transition.
