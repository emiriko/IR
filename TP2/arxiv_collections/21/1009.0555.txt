The understanding of disordered quantum systems is still far from being
complete, despite many decades of research on a variety of physical systems. In
this review we discuss how Bose-Einstein condensates of ultracold atoms in
disordered potentials have opened a new window for studying fundamental
phenomena related to disorder. In particular, we point our attention to recent
experimental studies on Anderson localization and on the interplay of disorder
and weak interactions. These realize a very promising starting point for a
deeper understanding of the complex behaviour of interacting, disordered
systems.
