We present a study of the lattice response to the compressive and tensile
biaxial stress in La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 (LSMO) and SrRuO3 (SRO) thin films grown on
a variety of single crystal substrates: SrTiO3, DyScO3, NdGaO3 and
(La,Sr)(Al,Ta)O3. The results show, that in thin films under misfit strain,
both SRO and LSMO lattices, which in bulk form have orthorhombic (SRO) and
rhombohedral (LSMO) structures, assume unit cells that are monoclinic under
compressive stress and tetragonal under tensile stress. The applied stress
effectively modifies the BO6 octahedra rotations, which degree and direction
can be controlled by magnitude and sign of the misfit strain. Such lattice
distortions change the B-O-B bond angles and therefore are expected to affect
magnetic and electronic properties of the ABO3 perovskites.
