We present a complete systematically theoretical study of multifragmentation
for asymmetric colliding nuclei for heavy-ion reactions in the energy range
between 50 MeV/nucleon and 600 MeV/nucleon by using soft and hard equations of
state. This study is performed within an isospindependent quantum molecular
dynamics model. To see the effect of mass asymmetry, simulations are carried
out in the absence of Coulomb interactions. Coulomb interactions enhances the
production of fragments by about 20%. We envision an interesting outcome for
large asymmetric colliding nuclei. Although nearly symmetric nuclei depict a
well known trend for rising and falling with a peak around E= 100 MeV/nucleon,
this trend, however, is completely missing for large asymmetric nuclei.
Therefore, experiments are needed to verify this prediction.
