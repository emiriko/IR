Development of efficient business process models and determination of their
characteristic properties are subject of intense interdisciplinary research.
Here, we consider a business process model as a directed graph. Its nodes
correspond to the units identified by the modeler and the link direction
indicates the causal dependencies between units. It is of primary interest to
obtain the stationary flow on such a directed graph, which corresponds to the
steady-state of a firm during the business process. Following the ideas
developed recently for the World Wide Web, we construct the Google matrix for
our business process model and analyze its spectral properties. The importance
of nodes is characterized by Page-Rank and recently proposed CheiRank and
2DRank, respectively. The results show that this two-dimensional ranking gives
a significant information about the influence and communication properties of
business model units. We argue that the Google matrix method, described here,
provides a new efficient tool helping companies to make their decisions on how
to evolve in the exceedingly dynamic global market.
