The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) automated spectroscopic reduction
pipeline provides >1.5 million intermediate resolution, R~2000, moderate
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), SNR~15, astronomical spectra of unprecedented
homogeneity that cover the wavelength range 3800-9200AA. However, there remain
significant systematic residuals in many spectra due to the sub-optimal
subtraction of the strong OH sky emission lines longward of 6700AA. The OH sky
lines extend over almost half the wavelength range of the SDSS spectra, and the
SNR over substantial wavelength regions in many spectra is reduced by more than
a factor two over that expected from photon counting statistics. Following the
OH line subtraction procedure presented in Wild & Hewett (2005), we make
available to the community sky-residual subtracted spectra for the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey Data Relase 7. Here we summarise briefly the method,
including minor changes in the implementation of the procedure with respect to
WH05. The spectra are suitable for many science applications but we highlight
some limitations for certain investigations. Details of the data model for the
sky-residual subtracted spectra and instructions on how to access the spectra
are provided.
