Bone remodeling is regulated by pathways controlling the interplay of
osteoblasts and osteoclasts. In this work, we apply the method of generalized
modelling to systematically analyse a large class of models of bone remodeling.
Our analysis shows that osteoblast precursors can play an important role in the
regulation of bone remodeling. Further, we find that the parameter regime most
likely realized in nature lies very close to bifurcation lines, marking
qualitative changes in the dynamics. Although proximity to a bifurcation
facilitates adaptive responses to changing external conditions, it entails the
danger of losing dynamical stability. Some evidence implicates such dynamical
transitions as a potential mechanism leading to forms of Paget's disease.
