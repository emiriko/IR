Entanglement is the quintessential quantum phenomenon and a necessary
ingredient in most emerging quantum technologies, including quantum repeaters,
quantum information processing (QIP) and the strongest forms of quantum
cryptography. Spin ensembles, such as those in liquid state nuclear magnetic
resonance, have been powerful in the development of quantum control methods,
however, these demonstrations contained no entanglement and ultimately
constitute classical simulations of quantum algorithms. Here we report the
on-demand generation of entanglement between an ensemble of electron and
nuclear spins in isotopically engineered phosphorus-doped silicon. We combined
high field/low temperature electron spin resonance (3.4 T, 2.9 K) with
hyperpolarisation of the 31P nuclear spin to obtain an initial state of
sufficient purity to create a non-classical, inseparable state. The state was
verified using density matrix tomography based on geometric phase gates, and
had a fidelity of 98% compared with the ideal state at this field and
temperature. The entanglement operation was performed simultaneously, with high
fidelity, to 10^10 spin pairs, and represents an essential requirement of a
silicon-based quantum information processor.
