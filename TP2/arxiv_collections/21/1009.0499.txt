We formulate weighted graph clustering as a prediction problem: given a
subset of edge weights we analyze the ability of graph clustering to predict
the remaining edge weights. This formulation enables practical and theoretical
comparison of different approaches to graph clustering as well as comparison of
graph clustering with other possible ways to model the graph. We adapt the
PAC-Bayesian analysis of co-clustering (Seldin and Tishby, 2008; Seldin, 2009)
to derive a PAC-Bayesian generalization bound for graph clustering. The bound
shows that graph clustering should optimize a trade-off between empirical data
fit and the mutual information that clusters preserve on the graph nodes. A
similar trade-off derived from information-theoretic considerations was already
shown to produce state-of-the-art results in practice (Slonim et al., 2005;
Yom-Tov and Slonim, 2009). This paper supports the empirical evidence by
providing a better theoretical foundation, suggesting formal generalization
guarantees, and offering a more accurate way to deal with finite sample issues.
We derive a bound minimization algorithm and show that it provides good results
in real-life problems and that the derived PAC-Bayesian bound is reasonably
tight.
