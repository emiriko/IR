It is shown for the first time that the observed [Phys. Lett. A 162 (1992)
105] potential difference Phi_t between the resistor and the screen surrounding
the circuit is caused by polarization of the resistor because of the kinetic
energy of the electrons of the superconducting coil. The proportionality of
Phi_t to the square of the current and to the length of the superconducting
wire is explained. It is pointed out that measuring Phi_t makes it possible to
determine the Fermi quasimomentum of the electrons of a metal resistor.
