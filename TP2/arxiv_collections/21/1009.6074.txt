A study of elliptical flow is presented with respect to the asymmetry of
colliding nuclei using the reactions of 24Cr50 +44 Ru102, 16S32 +50 Sn120 and
8O16 +54 Xe136 at incident energies between 50 and 250 MeV/nucleon within the
framework of isospin-dependent quantum molecular dynamics model. For the
present analysis, total mass of the colliding pairs is kept fixed and asymmetry
is varied as ? = 0.2, 0.3, 0.7. The elliptical flow shows a transition from
in-plane to out-of-plane in the mid rapidity region with incident energy. The
transition energy is found to increase with the asymmetry for lighter
fragments.
