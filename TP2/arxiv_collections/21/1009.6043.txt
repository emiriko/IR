Tensile tests were carried out by deforming polycrystalline samples of
Al-2.5%Mg alloy at four different temperatures in an intermediate strain rate
regime of 2x10-4s-1 to 2x10-3s-1. The Portevin-Le Chatelier (PLC) effect was
observed throughout the strain rate and temperature region. The mean cumulative
stress drop magnitude and the mean reloading time exhibit an increasing trend
with temperature which is attributed to the enhanced solute diffusion at higher
temperature. The observed stress-time series data were analyzed using the
nonlinear dynamical methods. From the analyses, we could establish the presence
of deterministic chaos in the PLC effect throughout the temperature regime. The
dynamics goes to higher dimension at a sufficiently high temperature of 425K
but the complexity of the dynamics is not affected by the temperature.
