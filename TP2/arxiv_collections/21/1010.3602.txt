We investigate 3-dimensional globally hyperbolic AdS manifolds containing
"particles", i.e., cone singularities along a graph $\Gamma$. We impose
physically relevant conditions on the cone singularities, e.g. positivity of
mass (angle less than $2\pi$ on time-like singular segments). We construct
examples of such manifolds, describe the cone singularities that can arise and
the way they can interact (the local geometry near the vertices of $\Gamma$).
We then adapt to this setting some notions like global hyperbolicity which are
natural for Lorentz manifolds, and construct some examples of globally
hyperbolic AdS manifolds with interacting particles.
