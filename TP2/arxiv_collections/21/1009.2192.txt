The nonrelativistic limit of the centrally extended Poincar\'e group is
considered and their consequences in the modal Hamiltonian interpretation of
quantum mechanics are discussed [ O. Lombardi and M. Castagnino, Stud. Hist.
Philos. Mod. Phys 39, 380 (2008) ; J. Phys, Conf. Ser. 128, 012014 (2008) ].
Through the assumption that in quantum field theory the Casimir operators of
the Poincar\'e group actualize, the nonrelativistic limit of the latter group
yields to the actualization of the Casimir operators of the Galilei group,
which is in agreement with the actualization rule of previous versions of modal
Hamiltonian interpretation [ Ardenghi et al., Found. Phys. (submitted) ]
