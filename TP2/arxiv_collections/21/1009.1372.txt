The postulate that all massless elementary fields have conformal Weyl local
scaling symmetry has remarkable consequences for both cosmology and elementary
particle physics. Conformal symmetry couples scalar and gravitational fields.
Implications for the scalar field of a conformal Higgs model are considered
here. The energy-momentum tensor of a conformal Higgs scalar field determines a
cosmological constant. It has recently been shown that this accounts for the
observed magnitude of dark energy. The gravitational field equation forces the
energy density to be finite, which precludes spontaneous destabilization of the
vacuum state. Scalar field fluctuations would define a Higgs tachyon rather
than a massive particle, consistent with the ongoing failure to observe such a
particle.
