The PALS architecture reduces distributed, real-time asynchronous system
design to the design of a synchronous system under reasonable requirements.
Assuming logical synchrony leads to fewer system behaviors and provides a
conceptually simpler paradigm for engineering purposes. One of the current
limitations of the framework is that from a set of independent "synchronous
machines", one must compose the entire synchronous system by hand, which is
tedious and error-prone. We use Maude's meta-level to automatically generate a
synchronous composition from user-provided component machines and a description
of how the machines communicate with each other. We then use the new
capabilities to verify the correctness of a distributed topology control
protocol for wireless networks in the presence of nodes that may fail.
