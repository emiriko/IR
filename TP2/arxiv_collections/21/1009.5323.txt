We have developed a BFKL-based dipole model in impact parameter space, that
has successfully predicted a wide range of total cross sections. The model has
now been extended to a full event generator that is showing promising results.
Some of the difficulties in non-leading order BFKL are discussed, and
preliminary results are compared to CDF and ALICE data.
