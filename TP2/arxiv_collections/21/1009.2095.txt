We present a minimal model of plasma membrane heterogeneity that combines
criticality with connectivity to cortical cytoskeleton. Our model is motivated
by recent observations of micron-sized critical fluctuations in plasma membrane
vesicles that are detached from their cortical cytoskeleton. We incorporate
criticality using a conserved order parameter Ising model coupled to a simple
actin cytoskeleton interacting through point-like pinning sites. Using this
minimal model, we recapitulate several experimental observations of plasma
membrane raft heterogeneity. Small (r~20nm) and dynamic fluctuations at
physiological temperatures arise from criticality. Including connectivity to
cortical cytoskeleton disrupts large fluctuations, prevents macroscopic phase
separation at low temperatures (T<=22{\deg}C), and provides a template for long
lived fluctuations at physiological temperature (T=37{\deg}C).
Cytoskeleton-stabilized fluctuations produce significant barriers to the
diffusion of some membrane components in a manner that is weakly dependent on
the number of pinning sites and strongly dependent on criticality. More
generally, we demonstrate that critical fluctuations provide a physical
mechanism to organize and spatially segregate membrane components by providing
channels for interaction over large distances.
