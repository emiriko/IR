Jefferson Lab (JLab) 12 GeV energy upgrade provides a golden opportunity to
perform precision studies of the transverse spin and
transverse-momentum-dependent structure in the valence quark region for both
the proton and the neutron. In this paper, we focus our discussion on a
recently approved experiment on the neutron as an example of the precision
studies planned at JLab. The new experiment will perform precision measurements
of target Single Spin Asymmetries (SSA) from semi-inclusive electro-production
of charged pions from a 40-cm long transversely polarized $^3$He target in
Deep-Inelastic-Scattering kinematics using 11 and 8.8 GeV electron beams. This
new coincidence experiment in Hall A will employ a newly proposed solenoid
spectrometer (SoLID). The large acceptance spectrometer and the high polarized
luminosity will provide precise 4-D ($x$, $z$, $P_T$ and $Q^2$) data on the
Collins, Sivers, and pretzelocity asymmetries for the neutron through the
azimuthal angular dependence. The full 2$\pi$ azimuthal angular coverage in the
lab is essential in controlling the systematic uncertainties. The results from
this experiment, when combined with the proton Collins asymmetry measurement
and the Collins fragmentation function determined from the e$^+$e$^-$ collision
data, will allow for a quark flavor separation in order to achieve a
determination of the tensor charge of the d quark to a 10% accuracy. The
extracted Sivers and pretzelocity asymmetries will provide important
information to understand the correlations between the quark orbital angular
momentum and the nucleon spin and between the quark spin and nucleon spin.
