The Hall coefficient R_H of the cuprate superconductor YBa2Cu3Oy was measured
in magnetic fields up to 60 T for a hole concentration p from 0.078 to 0.152,
in the underdoped regime. In fields large enough to suppress superconductivity,
R_H(T) is seen to go from positive at high temperature to negative at low
temperature, for p > 0.08. This change of sign is attributed to the emergence
of an electron pocket in the Fermi surface at low temperature. At p < 0.08, the
normal-state R_H(T) remains positive at all temperatures, increasing
monotonically as T \to 0. We attribute the change of behaviour across p = 0.08
to a Lifshitz transition, namely a change in Fermi-surface topology occurring
at a critical concentration p_L = 0.08, where the electron pocket vanishes. The
loss of the high-mobility electron pocket across p_L coincides with a ten-fold
drop in the conductivity at low temperature, revealed in measurements of the
electrical resistivity $\rho$ at high fields, showing that the so-called
metal-insulator crossover of cuprates is in fact driven by a Lifshitz
transition. It also coincides with a jump in the in-plane anisotropy of $\rho$,
showing that without its electron pocket the Fermi surface must have strong
two-fold in-plane anisotropy. These findings are consistent with a
Fermi-surface reconstruction caused by a unidirectional spin-density wave or
stripe order.
