We study the computational difficulty of computing the ground state
degeneracy and the density of states for local Hamiltonians. We show that the
difficulty of both problems is exactly captured by a class which we call #BQP,
which is the counting version of the quantum complexity class QMA. We show that
#BQP is not harder than its classical counting counterpart #P, which in turn
implies that computing the ground state degeneracy or the density of states for
classical Hamiltonians is just as hard as it is for quantum Hamiltonians.
