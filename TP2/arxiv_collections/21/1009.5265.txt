The cross section of inclusive diffractive process ep -> eXp was measured
within a wide kinematic range in the H1 and ZEUS experiments at HERA. Results
obtained by different experiments and methods are compatible within measurement
uncertainties. The measurements were subjected to DGLAP next-to-leading order
QCD global fits and the diffractive parton distribution functions (DPDFs) of
the proton were determined with noticeably reduced uncertainties due to very
high precision of the data. The gluon density precision was much improved in
fits which also included data on dijet production in diffractive DIS.
Predictions based on the determined DPDFs are in agreement with the measured
inclusive cross-section of diffractive dijet photoproduction and charm
production in diffractive DIS at HERA. The longitudinal diffractive structure
function $F^D_L$ was measured directly for the first time.
