Relativistic heavy ion collisions provide laboratory environments from which
one can study the creation of a novel state of matter, the quark gluon plasma.
The existence of such a state is postulated to alter the mechanism and
evolution of charge production, which then becomes manifest in charge
correlations. We study the separation of balancing charges at kinetic
freeze-out by analyzing recent result on balancing charge correlations for
Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200 {GeV}$. We find that balancing charges
are emitted from significantly smaller regions in central collisions compared
to peripheral collisions. The results indicate that charge diffusion is small
and that the centrality dependence points to a change of the production
mechanism. In addition we calculate the contributions from charge-balance
correlations to STAR's local parity violation observable. We find that local
charge conservation, when combined with elliptic flow, explains much of STAR's
measurement.
