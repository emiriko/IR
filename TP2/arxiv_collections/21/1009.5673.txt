We present a catalog of photometrically variable stars discovered within two
21'.3 X 21'.3 fields centered on the Cygnus OB2 association. There have
hitherto been no deep optical variability studies of Cyg OB2 despite it being
replete with early-type massive stars, perhaps due to the high and variable
extinction (up to A_V ~ 20) that permeates much of the region. Here we provide
results of the first variability study with this combination of spatial
coverage (~ 0.5 deg) and photometric depth (R ~ 21 mag). We find 121 stars to
be variable in both R- and I-band, 116 of them newly discovered. Of the 121
variables, we identify 27 eclipsing binaries (EBs) and eclipsing binary
candidates, 20 potential Herbig Ae/Be stars, and 52 pulsating variables.
Confirming both the status and the cluster membership of the Herbig Ae/Be stars
would address the uncertainty regarding the age and star formation history of
Cyg OB2. We match our catalog to known variables and binaries in the region,
2MASS near-IR (NIR) data, and Chandra X-ray observations to find counterparts
to new variables in other wavelengths.
