We study the viability of generic Higgsless models at low energies when
compliance with EWPO and unitarity constraints up to the TeV scale are imposed.
Our analysis shows that consistency with S and T can be achieved at the
one-loop level even with a single light vector state, m_V <= 500 GeV. However,
this scenario turns out to be strongly disfavored when direct resonance
searches at the Tevatron are also taken into account. We show that a fully
consistent picture can be obtained if an axial state is introduced.
Interestingly, m_V is still predicted to be light (below 1 TeV) while typical
values of m_A span over the window 1.2 m_V <= m_A <= 1.4 m_V. Our results for
the vector channel are rather robust and well within the reach of present-day
colliders, while the axial channel is more loosely constrained.
