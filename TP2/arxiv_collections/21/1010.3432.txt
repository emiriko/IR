A method enabling automatic detection and tracking of large amounts of
individual dust particles in plasmas is presented. Individual trajectories can
be found with a good spatiotemporal resolution, even without applying any
external light source to facilitate detection. Main advantages of this method
is a high portability and the possibility of making statistical analyses of the
trajectories of a large amount of non uniformly size distributed particles,
under challenging illumination conditions and with low time and computational
resources. In order to evaluate the efficiency of different detection and
tracking strategies statistically, an experimental benchmark is proposed, and
completed by numerical simulations.
