Micromagnetic simulations are used to examine the effects of cubic and axial
anisotropy, magnetostatic interactions and temperature on M-H loops for a
collection of magnetic dipoles on fcc and sc lattices. We employ a simple model
of interacting dipoles that represent single-domain particles in an attempt to
explain recent experimental data on ordered arrays of magnetoferritin
nanoparticles that demonstrate the crucial role of interactions between
particles in a fcc lattice. Significant agreement between the simulation and
experimental results is achieved, and the impact of intra-particle degrees of
freedom and surface effects on thermal fluctuations are investigated.
