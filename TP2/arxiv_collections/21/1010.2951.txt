We present comprehensive numerical results for domain growth in the
two-dimensional {\it Random Bond Ising Model} (RBIM) with nonconserved Glauber
kinetics. We characterize the evolution via the {\it domain growth law}, and
two-time quantities like the {\it autocorrelation function} and {\it
autoresponse function}. Our results clearly establish that the growth law shows
a crossover from a pre-asymptotic regime with "power-law growth with a
disorder-dependent exponent" to an asymptotic regime with "logarithmic growth".
We compare this behavior with previous results on one-dimensional disordered
systems and we propose a unifying picture in a renormalization group framework.
We also study the corresponding crossover in the scaling functions for the
two-time quantities. Super-universality is found not to hold. Clear evidence
supporting the dimensionality dependence of the scaling exponent of the
autoresponse function is obtained.
