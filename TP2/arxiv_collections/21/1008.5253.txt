We investigate the entanglement and nonlocality properties of one- and
two-mode combination squeezed vacuum state (OTCSS, with two-parameter lamda and
gamma) by analyzing the logarithmic negativity and the Bell's inequality. It is
found that this state exhibits larger entanglement than that of the usual
two-mode squeezed vacuum state (TSVS), and that in a certain regime of lamda,
the violation of Bell's inequality becomes more obvious, which indicates that
the nonlocality of OTCSS can be stronger than that of TSVS. As an application
of OTCSS, the quantum teleportaion is examined, which shows that there is a
region spanned by lamda and gamma in which the fidelity of OTCSS channel is
larger than that of TSVS.
