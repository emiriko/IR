The theory describing the far-field emission from a dipole source embedded
inside a chiral sculptured thin film (CSTF), based on a spectral Green function
formalism, was further developed to allow for infiltration of the void regions
of the CSTF by a fluid. In doing so, the extended Bruggeman homogenization
formalism--which accommodates constituent particles that are small compared to
wavelength but not vanishingly small--was used to estimate the relative
permittivity parameters of the infiltrated CSTF. For a numerical example, we
found that left circularly polarized (LCP) light was preferentially emitted
through one face of the CSTF while right circularly polarized (RCP) light was
preferentially emitted through the opposite face, at wavelengths within the
Bragg regime. The centre wavelength for the preferential emission of LCP/RCP
light was red shifted as the refractive index of the infiltrating fluid
increased from unity, and this red shift was accentuated when the size of the
constituent particles in our homogenization model was increased. Also, the
bandwidth of the preferential LCP/RCP emission regime decreased as the
refractive index of the infiltrating fluid increased from unity.
