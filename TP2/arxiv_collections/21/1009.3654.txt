In this report we present a complex metric burst, associated with the 14 July
2000 major solar event, recorded by the ARTEMIS-IV radio spectrograph at
Thermopylae. Additional space-borne and Earth-bound observational data are
used, in order to identify and analyze the diverse, yet associated, processes
during this event. The emission at metric wavelengths consisted of broad-band
continua including a moving and a stationary type IV, impulsive bursts and
pulsating structures. The principal release of energetic electrons in the
corona was 15 20 min after the start of the flare, in a period when the flare
emission spread rapidly eastwards and a hard X-ray peak occurred. Backward
extrapolation of the CME also puts its origin in the same time interval,
however, the uncertainty of the extrapolation does not allow us to associate
the CME with any particular radio or X-ray signature. Finally, we present high
time and spectral resolution observations of pulsations and fiber bursts,
together with a preliminary statistical analysis.
