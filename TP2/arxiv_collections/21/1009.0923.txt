Inspired by the emergent membrane computing (P Systems) concepts, some
efforts are carried out introducing simulation models, some are software
oriented, and others are hardware, yet all are applied with the current vision
of the conventional computers, based on "Von Neumann architecture", which is a
sequential design in its essence. We think that these models will need "as a
consequent result" to a new architecture exposing a true parallel design, in
this paper; we try to investigate and introduce a global view for how it would
be like to have such architecture. The main goal is to point out to this
direction broadly, suggesting that it might be useful considering some aspects,
like the need for a new definition of an operating system and its programs,
which will eventually lead to a higher scope: the membrane computer.
