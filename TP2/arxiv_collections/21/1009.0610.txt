We report the existence of stable symmetric vortex-type solutions for
two-dimensional nonlinear discrete dissipative systems governed by a
cubic-quintic complex Ginzburg-Landau equation. We construct a whole family of
vortex solitons with a topological charge S = 1. Surprisingly, the dynamical
evolution of unstable solutions of this family does not alter significantly
their profile, instead their phase distribution completely changes. They
transform into two-charges swirl-vortex solitons. We dynamically excite this
novel structure showing its experimental feasibility.
