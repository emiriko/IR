We consider a two-dimensional bipartite lattice system. In such a system, the
Bloch band spectrum can have some valley points, around which Dirac fermions
appear as the low-energy excitations. Each valley point has a valley spin +1 or
-1. In such a system, there are two topological numbers counting vortices and
merons in the Brillouin zone, respectively. These numbers are equivalent, and
this fact leads to a sum rule which states that the total sum of the valley
spins is absent even in a system without time-reversal and parity symmetries.
We can see some similarity between the valley spin and chirality in the
Nielsen-Ninomiya no-go theorem in odd-spatial dimensions.
