This paper proposes an adaptive morphological dilation image coding with
context weights prediction. The new dilation method is not to use fixed models,
but to decide whether a coefficient needs to be dilated or not according to the
coefficient's predicted significance degree. It includes two key dilation
technologies: 1) controlling dilation process with context weights to reduce
the output of insignificant coefficients, and 2) using variable-length group
test coding with context weights to adjust the coding order and cost as few
bits as possible to present the events with large probability. Moreover, we
also propose a novel context weight strategy to predict coefficient's
significance degree more accurately, which serves for two dilation
technologies. Experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms
the state of the art image coding algorithms available today.
