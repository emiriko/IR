We present here results of numerical calculations demonstrating that the very
long periodic variability detected in the Cataclysmic Variable FS Aur can be
the result of eccentricity modulation of a close binary (CB) orbit induced by
the presence of a third body on a circumbinary orbit. A third component with a
substellar mass on a circular, relatively close orbit, modulates the mass
transfer rate of the binary on much longer time scales than periods within the
triple system. We also report here preliminary results of X-ray observations of
FS Aur, providing further evidence that it contains magnetic and freely
precessing white dwarf. These two findings allow us to incorporate the new and
previously stressed hypothesis on the nature of FS Aur into one consistent
model.
