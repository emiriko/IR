A set of long and nearly continuous observations of alpha Centauri A should
allow us to derive an accurate set of asteroseismic constraints to compare to
models, and make inferences on the internal structure of our closest stellar
neighbour. We intend to improve the knowledge of the interior of alpha Centauri
A by determining the nature of its core. We combined the radial velocity time
series obtained in May 2001 with three spectrographs in Chile and Australia:
CORALIE, UVES, and UCLES. The resulting combined time series has a length of
12.45 days and contains over 10,000 data points and allows to greatly reduce
the daily alias peaks in the power spectral window. We detected 44 frequencies
that are in good overall agreement with previous studies, and found that 14 of
these show possible rotational splittings. New values for the large and small
separations have been derived. A comparison with stellar models indicates that
the asteroseismic constraints determined in this study allows us to set an
upper limit to the amount of convective-core overshooting needed to model stars
of mass and metallicity similar to those of alpha Cen A.
