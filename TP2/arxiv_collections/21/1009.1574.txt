In two preceding papers (Infeld and Senatorski 2003 J. Phys.: Condens. Matter
15 5865, and Senatorski and Infeld 2004 J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 16 6589) the
authors confirmed Feynman's hypothesis on how circular vortices can be created
from oppositely polarized pairs of linear vortices (first paper), and then gave
examples of the creation of several different circular vortices from one linear
pair (second paper). Here in part III, we give two classes of examples of how
the vortices can interact. The first confirms the intuition that the
reconnection processes which join two interacting vortex lines into one,
practically do not occur. The second shows that new circular vortices can also
be created from pairs of oppositely polarized coaxial circular vortices. This
seems to contradict the results for such pairs given in Koplik and Levine 1996
