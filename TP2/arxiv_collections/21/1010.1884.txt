We have studied the optical oscillation and tunneling of light waves in
optical waveguide ladders formed by two coupled planar optical waveguide
arrays. For the band structure, a mid-zone gap is formed due to band
hybridization and its wavenumber position can be tuned throughout the whole
Brillouin zone, which is different from the Bragg gap. By imposing a gradient
in the propagation constant in each array, Bloch-Zener oscillation (BZO) is
realized with Zener tunneling between the bands occurring at mid zone, which is
contrary to the common BZO with tunneling at the center or edge of the
Brillouin zone. The occurrence of BZO is demonstrated by using the
field-evolution analysis. The tunable hybridization at mid zone enhances the
tunability of BZO in the optical waveguide ladders. This work is of general and
fundamental importance in understanding the coherent phenomena in lattice
structures.
