We present a new particle module of the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) Piernik
code. The original multi-fluid grid code based on the Relaxing Total Variation
Diminishing (RTVD) scheme has been extended by addition of dust described
within the particle approximation. The dust is now described as a system of
interacting particles. The particles can interact with gas, which is described
as a fluid. In this poster we introduce the scheme used to solve equations of
motion for the particles and present the first results coming from the module.
The results of test problems are also compared with the results coming from
fluid simulations made with Piernik-MHD code. The comparison shows the most
important differences between fluid and particle approximations used to
describe dynamical evolution of dust under astrophysical conditions.
