For von Neumann algebras M, N not isomorphic to C^2 and without type I_2
summands, we show that for an order-isomorphism f:AbSub(M)->AbSub(N) between
the posets of abelian von Neumann subalgebras of M and N, there is a unique
Jordan *-isomorphism g:M->N with the image g[S] equal to f(S) for each abelian
von Neumann subalgebra S of M. The converse also holds. This shows the Jordan
structure of a von Neumann algebra not isomorphic to C^2 and without type I_2
summands is determined by the poset of its abelian subalgebras, and has
implications in recent approaches to foundational issues in quantum mechanics.
