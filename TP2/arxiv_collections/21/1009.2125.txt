The problem of coupled Fermi-Bose mixtures of an ultracold gas near a narrow
Feshbach resonance is approached through the time-dependent and complex
Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) theory. The dynamical system is constructed using
Ginzburg-Landau-Abrikosov-Gor'kov (GLAG) path integral methods with the single
mode approximation for the composite Bosons, and the equilibrium states are
obtained in the BEC regime for adiabatic variations of the Feshbach detuning
along the stationary solutions of the dynamical system. Investigations into the
rich superfluid dynamics of this system in the shallow BEC regime yields the
onset of multiple interference patterns in the dynamics as the system is
quenched from the deep-BEC regime. This results in a partial collapse and
revival of the coherent matter wave field of the BEC, whose temporal profile is
reported.
