CONTEXT: The small radius and high density of CoRoT-7b implies that this
transiting planet belongs to a differen t species than all transiting planets
previously found. Current models suggest that this is the first transiting
rocky planet found outside the solar system. Given that the planet orbits a
solar-like star at a distance of on ly 4.5 R*, it is expected that material
released from its surface may then form an exosphere. AIMS: We constrai n the
properties of the exosphere by observing the planet in- and out-of-transit.
Detecting of the exosphere of CoRoT-7b would for the first time allow to study
the material originating in the surface of a rocky extrasolar planet. We scan
the entire optical spectrum for any lines originating from the planet, focusing
particularly on spectral lines such as those detected in Mercury, and Io in our
solar system. METHODS: Since lines originating in the exosphere are expected to
be narrow, we observed CoRoT-7b at high resolution with UVES on the VLT. By
subtracting the two spectra from each other, we search for emission and
absorption lines originating in the exosph ere of CoRoT-7b. RESULTS: In the
first step, we focus on Ca I, Ca II, Na, because these lines have been detected
in Mercury. Since the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of the spectra is as high as
300, we derive firm upper limits for the flux-range between 1.6E-18 and 3.2E-18
Wm**-2. For CaO, we find an upper limit of E-17 Wm**-2. We also search for
emission lines originating in the plasma torus fed by volcanic activity and
derive upper limits for these lines. In the whole spectrum we finally try to
identify other lines originating in the planet.
