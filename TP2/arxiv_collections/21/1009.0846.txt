We describe the current status of the design and development of a Thomson
X-ray polarimeter suitable for a small satellite mission. Currently we are
considering two detector geometries, one using rectangular detectors placed on
four sides of a scattering element and the other using a single cylindrical
detector with the scattering element at the center. The rectangular detector
configuration has been fabricated and tested. The cylindrical detector is
currently under fabrication. In order to compensate any pointing offset of the
satellite, a collimator with a flat topped response has been developed that
provides a constant effective area over an angular range. We have also
developed a double crystal monochromator/polariser for the purpose of test and
calibration of the polarimeter. Preliminary test results from the developmental
activities are presented here.
