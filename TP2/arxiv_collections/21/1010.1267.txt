We present results from Submillimeter Array (SMA) 860-micron sub-arcsec
astrometry and multiwavelength observations of the brightest millimeter
(S_1.1mm = 8.4 mJy) source, SSA22-AzTEC1, found near the core of the SSA22
protocluster that is traced by Ly\alpha emitting galaxies at z = 3.09. We
identify a 860-micron counterpart with a flux density of S_860um = 12.2 +/- 2.3
mJy and absolute positional accuracy that is better than 0.3". At the SMA
position, we find radio to mid-infrared counterparts, whilst no object is found
in Subaru optical and near-infrared deep images at wavelengths \le 1 micron (J
> 25.4 in AB, 2\sigma). The photometric redshift estimate, using flux densities
at \ge 24 microns, indicates z_phot = 3.19^{+0.26}_{-0.35}, consistent with the
protocluster redshift. We then model the near-to-mid-infrared spectral energy
distribution (SED) of SSA22-AzTEC1, and find that the SED modeling requires a
large extinction (A_V \approx 3.4 mag) of starlight from a stellar component
with M_star ~ 10^{10.9} M_sun, assuming z = 3.1. Additionally, we find a
significant X-ray counterpart with a very hard spectrum (Gamma_eff = -0.34
^{+0.57}_{-0.61}), strongly suggesting that SSA22-AzTEC1 harbors a luminous AGN
(L_X ~ 3*10^{44} ergs s^{-1}) behind a large hydrogen column (N_H ~ 10^{24}
cm^{-2}). The AGN, however, is responsible for only ~10% of the bolometric
luminosity of the host galaxy, and therefore the star-formation activity likely
dominates the submillimeter emission. It is possible that SSA22-AzTEC1 is the
first example of a protoquasar growing at the bottom of the gravitational
potential underlying the SSA22 protocluster.
