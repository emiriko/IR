A new scheme of three-dimensional (3D) all-optical (nonmagnetic) cooling and
trapping of resonant atoms, based on using of so-called rectified radiation
forces in non-monochromatic light fields is presented. It can be applied to the
atoms with a tripod-type configuration of levels: atoms (ions) with the quantum
transition F=1 \to F=0. The scheme proposed provides a long-term trapping of
such atoms in deep light-induced potential wells. Moreover, the atom
temperature can continuously be changed by varying field parameters in quite a
large range (from super-Doppler to sub-Doppler values) without violating the
localization stability.
