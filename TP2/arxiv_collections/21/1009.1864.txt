We have measured the half-life of the beta decay of 198Au to be 2.6948(9) d,
with the nuclide sited in an insulating environment. Comparing this result with
the half-life we measured previously with a metallic environment, we find the
half-lives in both environments to be the same within 0.04%, thus contradicting
a prediction that screening from a "plasma" of quasi-free electrons in a metal
increases the half-life by as much as 7%.
