Inclusive jet and multijet cross sections measured in ep collisions in
different kinematic regions by the H1 and ZEUS experiments are shown. The
measurements are used to extract the strong coupling alpha_s as a function of
the scale and at the mass of the Z-boson. Results from prompt photon production
in comparison with pQCD calculations are shown in photoproduction and
deep-inelastic scattering. Other topics address scaled momentum distributions
of charged particles, a measurement of the transverse momenta of charged
particles and the first measurement of the charge asymmetry at HERA.
