In this work we analytically calculate the time-averaged electromagnetic
energy stored inside a nondispersive magnetic isotropic cylinder which is
obliquely irradiated by an electromagnetic plane wave. An expression for the
optical-absorption efficiency in terms of the magnetic internal coefficients is
also obtained. In the low absorption limit, we derive a relation between the
normalized internal energy and the optical-absorption efficiency which is not
affected by the magnetism and the incidence angle. This mentioned relation,
indeed, seems to be independent on the shape of the scatterer. This universal
aspect of the internal energy is connected to the transport velocity and
consequently to the diffusion coefficient in the multiple scattering regime.
Magnetism favors high internal energy for low size parameter cylinders, which
leads to a low diffusion coefficient for electromagnetic propagation in 2D
random media.
