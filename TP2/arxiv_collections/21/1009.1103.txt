We use the charged tip of a low temperature scanning probe microscope to
perturb the transport through a graphene nanoconstriction. Maps of the
conductance as a function of tip position display concentric halos, and by
following the expansion of the halos with back-gate voltage we are able to
identify an elongated domain over the nanoconstriction where they originate.
Amplitude modulations of the transmission resonances are correlated with the
gradient of the tip-induced potential and we analyze this in terms of modified
coupling between localized states.
