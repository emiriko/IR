Spark ignition and subsequent flame propagation in a premixed, fuel-lean
(equivalence ratio of 0.4) H2-N2O mixture are shown in this fluid dynamics
video. High-speed schlieren photography was used to visualize the flame
propagation and the complex instabilities that developed on the flame surface.
The instabilities are a result of the competition between diffusive processes
at the flame front and hydrodynamic instability.
