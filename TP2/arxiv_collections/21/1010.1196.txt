We prove a version of the Bell's Theorem that does not assume Locality but
only the Effect After Cause Principle (EACP) according to which for any Lorentz
observer the value of an observable cannot change because of an event that
happens after the observable is measured. Since the EACP is compatible both
with Locality and with Non-Locality, Locality cannot be considered as the
common cause of the contradictions obtained in all versions of Bell's Theory.
By definition, all versions of Bell's Theorem assume Weak Realism according to
which the value of an observable needed in the discussion of Bell's Theorem is
well defined whenever the measurement could be made and some measurement is
made. As a consequence of our results, Weak Realism becomes the only hypothesis
common to the contradictions obtained in all versions of Bell's Theory. This
work indicates that it is Weak Realism, not Locality, that needs to be negated
to avoid the contradictions in microscopic Physics associated to Bell's Theory,
at least if one refuses as false the de Broglie-Bohm Hidden Variable theory
because of its essential violation of Lorentz invariance. This paper completes
with much more details the genuine Bell Theorem part of a previous paper. That
paper also offered a treatment of the GHZ entanglement, a treatment which did
not suffer from the lack of clarity of the definition of the EACP.
