We give a complete point-symmetry classification of all third-order evolution
equations of the form $u_t=F(t,x,u,u_x, u_{xx})u_{xxx}+G(t,x,u,u_x, u_{xx})$
which admit semi-simple symmetry algebras and extensions of these semi-simple
Lie algebras by solvable Lie algebras. The methods we employ are extensions and
refinements of previous techniques which have been used in such
classifications.
