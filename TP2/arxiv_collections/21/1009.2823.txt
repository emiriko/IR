This survey of methods surrounding lattice point methods for binomial ideals
begins with a leisurely treatment of the geometric combinatorics of binomial
primary decomposition. It then proceeds to three independent applications whose
motivations come from outside of commutative algebra: hypergeometric systems,
combinatorial game theory, and chemical dynamics. The exposition is aimed at
students and researchers in algebra; it includes many examples, open problems,
and elementary introductions to the motivations and background from outside of
algebra.
