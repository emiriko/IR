We present a search for the standard model Higgs boson produced with a Z
boson in 4.1 fb^-1 of data collected with the CDF II detector at the Tevatron.
In events consistent with the decay of the Higgs boson to a bottom-quark pair
and the Z boson to electrons or muons, we set 95% credibility level upper
limits on the ZH production cross section times the H -> b bbar branching
ratio. Improved analysis methods enhance signal sensitivity by 20% relative to
previous searches beyond the gain due to the larger data sample. At a Higgs
boson mass of 115 GeV/c^2 we set a limit of 5.9 times the standard model value.
