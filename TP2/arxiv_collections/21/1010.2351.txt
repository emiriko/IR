We address the coherence of the dynamics of spin-currents with components
transverse to an external magnetic field for the spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain. We
study current autocorrelations at finite temperatures and the real-time
dynamics of currents at zero temperature. Besides a coherent Larmor
oscillation, we find an additional collective oscillation at higher
frequencies, emerging as a coherent many-magnon effect at low temperatures.
Using numerical and analytical methods, we analyze the oscillation frequency
and decay time of this coherent current-mode versus temperature and magnetic
field.
