We have chosen the name of GYES, one of the mythological giants with one
hundred arms, offspring of Gaia and Uranus, for our instrument study of a
multifibre spectrograph for the prime focus of the Canada-France-Hawaii
Telescope. Such an instrument could provide an excellent ground-based
complement for the Gaia mission and a northern complement to the HERMES project
on the AAT. The CFHT is well known for providing a stable prime focus
environment, with a large field of view, which has hosted several imaging
instruments, but has never hosted a multifibre spectrograph. Building upon the
experience gained at GEPI with FLAMES-Giraffe and X-Shooter, we are
investigating the feasibility of a high multiplex spectrograph (about 500
fibres) over a field of view 1 degree in diameter. We are investigating an
instrument with resolution in the range 15000 to 30000, which should provide
accurate chemical abundances for stars down to 16th magnitude and radial
velocities, accurate to 1 km/s for fainter stars. The study is led by
GEPI-Observatoire de Paris with a contribution from Oxford for the study of the
positioner. The financing for the study comes from INSU CSAA and Observatoire
de Paris. The conceptual study will be delivered to CFHT for review by October
1st 2010.
