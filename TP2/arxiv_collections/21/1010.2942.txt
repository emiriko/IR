The lectures address some of the issues of triggering and data acquisition in
large high-energy physics experiments. Emphasis is placed on hadron-collider
experiments that present a particularly challenging environment for event
selection and data collection. However, the lectures also explain how T/DAQ
systems have evolved over the years to meet new challenges. Some examples are
given from early experience with LHC T/DAQ systems during the 2008 single-beam
operations.
