It has been proposed to study gravitational lenses from measurements of the
spectrum of the fluctuations of the output current of a quadratic detector. The
spatial correlation coefficient of the source is the fundamental parameter of
the technique. The experimental work discussed in this article confirms that
the correlation coefficient must be evaluated at the frequencies of the
spectrum of the current fluctuations. This validates a powerful yet simple
technique to find unresolved gravitational lenses and to study the lensing
event and the source. The validation is needed before starting the extensive
theoretical and observational work that must now follow.
