Our aim is to compile a catalog of white dwarfs within 40 parsecs of the Sun,
in which newly discovered objects would significantly increase the completeness
of the current census. White dwarf candidates are identified from the
SUPERBLINK proper motion database (Lepine & Shara 2005), which allows us to
investigate stars down to a proper motion limit as low as 40 mas yr-1. The
selection criteria and distance estimates are based on a combination of
color-magnitude and reduced proper motion diagrams. Candidates with distances
less than 50 parsecs are selected for spectroscopic follow-up. We present our
preliminary sample of spectroscopically confirmed white dwarfs, as well as
their atmospheric parameters. These parameters are obtained using the
spectroscopic technique developed in Bergeron et al.(1992) for DA stars. DB,
DQ, and DZ stars are also analyzed spectroscopically. For featureless spectra
as well as those showing only Halpha, we perform a detailed photometric
analysis of their energy distribution.
