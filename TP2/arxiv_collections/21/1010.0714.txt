Pion photoproduction reactions are investigated in a dynamical
coupled-channel approach based on the Juelich pi-N model, which presently
includes the hadronic pi-N and eta-N stable channels as well as the pi-Delta,
sigma-N and rho-N effective channels. This model has been quite successful in
the description of pi-N to pi-N scattering for center-of-mass energies up to
1.9 GeV. The full pion photoproduction amplitude is constructed to satisfy the
generalized Ward-Takahashi identity and hence, it is fully gauge invariant. The
calculated differential cross sections and photon spin asymmetries up to 1.65
GeV center-of-mass energy for the reactions gamma p to pi+ n, gamma p to pi0 p
and gamma n to pi- p are in good agreement with the experimental data.
