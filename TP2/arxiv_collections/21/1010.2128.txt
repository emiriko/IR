Periodic nonuniform sampling has been considered in literature as an
effective approach to reduce the sampling rate far below the Nyquist rate for
sparse spectrum multiband signals. In the presence of non-ideality the sampling
parameters play an important role on the quality of reconstructed signal. Also
the average sampling ratio is directly dependent on the sampling parameters
that they should be chosen for a minimum rate and complexity. In this paper we
consider the effect of sampling parameters on the reconstruction error and the
sampling ratio and suggest feasible approaches for achieving an optimal
sampling and reconstruction.
