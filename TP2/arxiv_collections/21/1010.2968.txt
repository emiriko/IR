A mechanism is proposed that allows to interpret the temporal evolution of a
physical system as a result of the inability of an observer to record its whole
state and a simple example is given. It is based on a review of the concepts of
information, entropy and order. It is suggested that the temporal evolution and
the choice of the "initial state" depend on the way the observer "compresses"
information.
