Alice seeks an information-theoretically secure source of private random
data. Unfortunately, she lacks a personal source and must use remote sources
controlled by other parties. Alice wants to simulate a coin flip of specified
bias $\alpha$, as a function of data she receives from $p$ sources; she seeks
privacy from any coalition of $r$ of them. We show: If $p/2 \leq r < p$, the
bias can be any rational number and nothing else; if $0 < r < p/2$, the bias
can be any algebraic number and nothing else. The proof uses projective
varieties, convex geometry, and the probabilistic method. Our results improve
on those laid out by Yao, who asserts one direction of the $r=1$ case in his
seminal paper [Yao82]. We also provide an application to secure multiparty
computation.
