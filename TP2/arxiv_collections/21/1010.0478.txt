Current-induced domain wall motion in magnetic nanowires is affected by
thermal fluctuation. In order to account for this effect, the
Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation includes a thermal fluctuation field and
literature often utilizes the fluctuation-dissipation theorem to characterize
statistical properties of the thermal fluctuation field. However, the theorem
is not applicable to the system under finite current since it is not in
equilibrium. To examine the effect of finite current on the thermal
fluctuation, we adopt the influence functional formalism developed by Feynman
and Vernon, which is known to be a useful tool to analyze effects of
dissipation and thermal fluctuation. For this purpose, we construct a quantum
mechanical effective Hamiltonian describing current-induced domain wall motion
by generalizing the Caldeira-Leggett description of quantum dissipation. We
find that even for the current-induced domain wall motion, the statistical
properties of the thermal noise is still described by the
fluctuation-dissipation theorem if the current density is sufficiently lower
than the intrinsic critical current density and thus the domain wall tilting
angle is sufficiently lower than pi/4. The relation between our result and a
recent result, which also addresses the thermal fluctuation, is discussed. We
also find interesting physical meanings of the Gilbert damping alpha and the
nonadiabaticy parameter beta; while alpha characterizes the coupling strength
between the magnetization dynamics (the domain wall motion in this paper) and
the thermal reservoir (or environment), beta characterizes the coupling
strength between the spin current and the thermal reservoir.
