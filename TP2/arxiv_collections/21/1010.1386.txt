We present an exact and complete algorithm to isolate the real solutions of a
zero-dimensional bivariate polynomial system. The proposed algorithm
constitutes an elimination method which improves upon existing approaches in a
number of points. First, the amount of purely symbolic operations is
significantly reduced, that is, only resultant computation and square-free
factorization is still needed. Second, our algorithm neither assumes generic
position of the input system nor demands for any change of the coordinate
system. The latter is due to a novel inclusion predicate to certify that a
certain region is isolating for a solution. Our implementation exploits
graphics hardware to expedite the resultant computation. Furthermore, we
integrate a number of filtering techniques to improve the overall performance.
Efficiency of the proposed method is proven by a comparison of our
implementation with two state-of-the-art implementations, that is, LPG and
Maple's isolate. For a series of challenging benchmark instances, experiments
show that our implementation outperforms both contestants.
