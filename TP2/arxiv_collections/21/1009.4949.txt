A zero-sum differential game with controlled jump-diffusion driven state is
considered, and studied using a combination of dynamic programming and
viscosity solution techniques. We prove, under certain conditions, that the
value of the game exists and is the unique viscosity solution of a fully
nonlinear integro-partial differential equation. In addition, we formulate and
prove a verification theorem for such games within the viscosity solution
framework for nonlocal equations
