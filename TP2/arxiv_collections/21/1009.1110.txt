We present analytic results for the finite diagrams contributing to the
two-loop eight-point MHV scattering amplitude of planar N=4 SYM. We use a
recently proposed representation for the integrand of the amplitude in terms of
(momentum) twistors and focus on a restricted kinematics in which the answer
depends only on two independent cross-ratios. The theory of motives can be used
to vastly simplify the results, which can be expressed as simple combinations
of classical polylogarithms.
