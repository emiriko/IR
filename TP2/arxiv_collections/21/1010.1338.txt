We present a procedure that makes use of group theory to analyze and predict
the main properties of the negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in
diamond. We focus on the relatively low temperatures limit where both the
spin-spin and spin-orbit effects are important to consider. We demonstrate that
group theory may be used to clarify several aspects of the NV structure, such
as ordering of the singlets in the ($e^2$) electronic configuration, the
spin-spin and the spin-orbit interactions in the ($ae$) electronic
configuration. We also discuss how the optical selection rules and the response
of the center to electric field can be used for spin-photon entanglement
schemes. Our general formalism is applicable to a broad class of local defects
in solids. The present results have important implications for applications in
quantum information science and nanomagnetometry.
