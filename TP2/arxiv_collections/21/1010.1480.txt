The three state contact process is the modification of the contact process at
rate $\mu$ in which first infections occur at rate $\lambda$ instead. Chapters
2 and 3 consider the three state contact process on (graphs that have as set of
sites) the integers with nearest neighbours interaction (that is, edges are
placed among sites at Euclidean distance one apart). Results in Chapter 2 are
meant to illustrate regularity of the growth of the process under the
assumption that $\mu \geq \lambda$, that is, reverse immunization. While in
Chapter 3 two results regarding the convergence rates of the process are given.
Chapter 4 is concerned with the i.i.d.\ behaviour of the right endpoint of
contact processes on the integers with symmetric, translation invariant
interaction. Finally, Chapter 5 is concerned with two monotonicity properties
of the three state contact process.
