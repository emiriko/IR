We report on an integrated photonic transmitter of up to 100 MHz repetition
rate, which emits pulses centered at 850 nm with arbitrary amplitude and
polarization. The source is suitable for free space quantum key distribution
applications. The whole transmitter, with the optical and electronic components
integrated, has reduced size and power consumption. In addition, the
optoelectronic components forming the transmitter can be space-qualified,
making it suitable for satellite and future space missions.
