The Tibetan singing bowl is a type of standing bell. Originating from
Himalayan fire cults as early as the 5th century BC, they have since been used
in religious ceremonies, for shamanic journeying, exorcism, meditation and
shakra adjustment. A singing bowl is played by striking or rubbing its rim with
a wooden or leather-wrapped mallet. The sides and rim of the bowl then vibrate
to produce a rich sound. When the bowl is filled with water, this excitation
can cause crispation of the water surface that can be followed by more
complicated surface wave patterns and ultimately the creation of droplets. We
here demonstrate the means by which the Tibetan singing bowl can levitate
droplets. This is a sample arXiv article illustrating the use of fluid dynamics
videos.
