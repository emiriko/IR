We identify models of supersymmetric hybrid inflation in which the
tensor-to-scalar ratio, a canonical measure of gravity waves produced during
inflation, can be as large as 0.03 or so, which will be tested by the Planck
satellite experiment. The scalar spectral index lies within the WMAP one sigma
bounds, while $|d n_s / d\ln k| \lesssim 0.01$.
