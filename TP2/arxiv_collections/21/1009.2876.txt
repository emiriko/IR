In this paper we study planar polynomial differential systems of this form:
dX/dt=A(X, Y), dY/dt= B(X, Y), where A,B belongs to Z[X, Y], degA \leq d, degB
\leq d, and the height of A and B is smaller than H. A lot of properties of
planar polynomial differential systems are related to irreducible Darboux
polynomials of the corresponding derivation: D =A(X, Y)dX + B(X, Y)dY . Darboux
polynomials are usually computed with the method of undetermined coefficients.
With this method we have to solve a polynomial system. We show that this
approach can give rise to the computation of an exponential number of reducible
Darboux polynomials. Here we show that the Lagutinskii-Pereira's algorithm
computes irreducible Darboux polynomials with degree smaller than N, with a
polynomial number, relatively to d, log(H) and N, binary operations. We also
give a polynomial-time method to compute, if it exists, a rational first
integral with bounded degree.
