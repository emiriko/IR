Spin one condensates in the polar (antiferromagnetic) phase in two dimensions
are shown to undergo a transition of the Ising type, in addition to the
expected Kosterlitz--Thouless (KT) transition of half vortices, due to the
quadratic Zeeman effect. We establish the phase diagram in terms of temperature
and the strength of the Zeeman effect using Monte Carlo simulations. When the
Zeeman effect is sufficiently strong the Ising and KT transitions merge. For
very strong Zeeman field the remaining transition is of the familiar integer KT
type.
