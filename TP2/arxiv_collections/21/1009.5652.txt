We adapt the simulated annealing algorithm to the search of periodic orbits
for classical multi-electron atomic systems. This is done by minimizing the
n-th return distance to the initial position on a Poincare surface of section
under an energy constraint. Here we give evidence of the feasibility of the
method by applying it to the helium atom in the ground state for one to three
spatial dimensions. We examine the structure of the dynamics and connect its
organization to the periodic orbits we have found.
