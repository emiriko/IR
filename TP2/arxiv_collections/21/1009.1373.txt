Completing Aronov et al.'s study on zero-discrepancy matrices for digital
halftoning, we determine all (m, n, k, l) for which it is possible to put mn
consecutive integers on an m-by-n board (with wrap-around) so that each k-by-l
region holds the same sum. For one of the cases where this is impossible, we
give a heuristic method to find a matrix with small discrepancy.
