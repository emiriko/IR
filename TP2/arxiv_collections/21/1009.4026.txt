For a smooth proper variety over a $p$-adic field, the Brauer group and
abelian fundamental group are related to the higher Chow groups by the
Brauer-Manin pairing and the class field theory. We generalize this relation to
smooth (possibly non-proper) varieties, using the motivic homology and the tame
version of Wiesend's ideal class group. Several examples are discussed.
