In this work we study the Silver mean sequence based on substitution rules by
means of a transfer-matrix approach. Using transfer-matrix method we find a
recurrence relation for the traces of general transfer-matrices which
characterizes electronic properties of the quasicrystal in question. We also
find an invariant of the trace-map.
