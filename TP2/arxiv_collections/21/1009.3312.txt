We study the QCD phase structure in the three-flavor Nambu--Jona-Lasinio
model, incorporating the chiral-diquark interplay due to the axial anomaly. We
demonstrate that for a certain range of model parameters, the low temperature
critical point predicted by a Ginzburg-Landau analysis appears in the phase
diagram. In addition, we show that the axial anomaly presents a new scenario
for a possible BEC-BCS crossover in the color-flavor locked phase of QCD.
