In this fluid dynamics video, we present an overview of the most important
results recently obtained in our group using an optical profilometric technique
that allows for single-shot global measurement of free-surface deformations.
This system consists of a high-resolution system composed of a videoprojector
and a digital camera. A fringe pattern of known characteristics is projected
onto the free surface and its image is registered by the camera. The deformed
fringe pattern arising from the surface deformations is later compared to the
undeformed (reference) one, leading to a phase map from which the free surface
can be reconstructed.
  Two examples are developed: (a) the study of water wave trapped modes and (b)
the impact of a drop onto a thin layer of the same liquid.
