The paper describes an abstraction for protocols that are based on multiple
rounds of Chaum's Dining Cryptographers protocol. It is proved that the
abstraction preserves a rich class of specifications in the logic of knowledge,
including specifications describing what an agent knows about other agents'
knowledge. This result can be used to optimize model checking of Dining
Cryptographers-based protocols, and applied within a methodology for
knowledge-based program implementation and verification. Some case studies of
such an application are given, for a protocol that uses the Dining
Cryptographers protocol as a primitive in an anonymous broadcast system.
Performance results are given for model checking knowledge-based specifications
in the concrete and abstract models of this protocol, and some new conclusions
about the protocol are derived.
