We investigate the Quantum-Electro-Dynamic properties of an atomic electron
close to the focus of a spherical mirror. We first show that the spontaneous
emission and excited state level shift of the atom can be fully suppressed with
mirror-atom distances of many wavelengths. A three-dimensional theory predicts
that the spectral density of vacuum fluctuations can indeed vanish within a
volume $\lambda^3$ around the atom, with the use of a far distant mirror
covering only half of the atomic emission solid angle. The modification of
these QED atomic properties is also computed as a function of the mirror size
and large effects are found for only moderate numerical apertures. We also
evaluate the long distance ground state energy shift (Casimir-Polder shift) and
find that it scales as $(\lambda/R)^2$ at the focus of a hemi-spherical mirror
of radius $R$, as opposed to the well known $(\lambda/R)^4$ scaling law for an
atom at a distance $R$ from an infinite plane mirror. Our results are relevant
for investigations of QED effects, and also free space coupling to single atoms
using high-numerical aperture lenses.
