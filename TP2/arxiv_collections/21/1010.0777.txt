The purpose of this paper is to prove that the Mirkovic-Vilonen (MV for
short) polytope corresponding to the tensor product of two arbitrary MV
polytopes is contained in the Minkowski sum of these two MV polytopes. This
generalizes the result in our previous paper [KNS], which was obtained under
the assumption that the first tensor factor is an extremal MV polytope.
