It has been predicted that superconducting vortices should be electrically
charged and that this effect is particularly enhanced for, high temperature
superconductors.\cite{kho95,bla96} Hall effect\cite{hag91} and nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) experiments\cite{kum01} suggest the existence of vortex
charging, but the effects are small and the interpretation controversial. Here
we show that the Abrikosov vortex lattice, characteristic of the mixed state of
superconductors, will become unstable at sufficiently high magnetic field if
there is charge trapped on the vortex core. Our NMR measurements of the
magnetic fields generated by vortices in Bi$_{2}$Sr$_{2}$CaCu$_{2}$O$_{8+y}$
single crystals\cite{che07} provide evidence for an electrostatically driven
vortex lattice reconstruction with the magnitude of charge on each vortex
pancake of $\mathbf{\sim 2}$x$\mathbf{10^{-3} e}$, depending on doping, in line
with theoretical estimates.\cite{kho95,kna05}
