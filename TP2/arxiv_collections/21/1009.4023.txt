We report explicitly a novel family of exact PT-symmetric solitons and
further study their spontaneous PT symmetry breaking, stabilities and
collisions in Bose-Einstein condensates trapped in a PT-symmetric harmonic trap
and a Hermite-Gaussian gain/loss potential. We observe the significant effects
of mean-field interaction by modifying the threshold point of spontaneous PT
symmetry breaking in Bose-Einstein condensates. Our scenario provides a
promising approach to study PT-related universal behaviors in non-Hermitian
quantum system based on the manipulation of gain/loss potential in
Bose-Einstein condensates.
