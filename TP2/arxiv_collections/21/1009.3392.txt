The members of the Eta Chamaleontis cluster are in an evolutionary stage in
which disks are rapidly evolving. It also presents some peculiarities, such as
the large fraction of binaries and accretion disks, probably related with the
cluster formation process. Its proximity makes this stellar group an ideal
target for studying the relation between X-ray emission and those stellar
parameters. The main objective of this work is to determine general X-ray
properties of the cluster members in terms of coronal temperature, column
density, emission measure, X-ray luminosity and variability. We also aim to
establish the relation between the X-ray luminosity of these stars and other
stellar parameters, such as binarity and presence of accretion disks. A study
of flare energies for each flare event and their relation with some stellar
parameters is also performed. We used proprietary data from a deep XMM-Newton
observation pointed at the core of the Eta Chamaleontis cluster. Specific
software for the reduction of XMM-Newton data was used for the analysis of our
observation. For the detection of sources, we used the wavelet-based code
PWDetect. General coronal properties were derived from plasma model fitting. We
also determined variability of the Eta Chamaleontis members in the EPIC
field-of-view. A total of six flare-like events were clearly detected in five
different stars. For them, we derived coronal properties during the flare
events and pseudo-quiescent state separately. In our observations, stars that
underwent a flare event have higher X-ray luminosities in the pseudo-quiescent
state than cluster members with similar spectral type with no indications of
flaring, independently whether they have an accretion disk or not. Observed
flare energies are typical of both pre-main and main-sequence M stars. We
detected no difference between flare energies of stars with and without an
accretion disk.
