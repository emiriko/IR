In this paper, a comprehensive survey of 48 filters for impulsive noise
removal from color images is presented. The filters are formulated using a
uniform notation and categorized into 8 families. The performance of these
filters is compared on a large set of images that cover a variety of domains
using three effectiveness and one efficiency criteria. In order to ensure a
fair efficiency comparison, a fast and accurate approximation for the inverse
cosine function is introduced. In addition, commonly used distance measures
(Minkowski, angular, and directional-distance) are analyzed and evaluated.
Finally, suggestions are provided on how to choose a filter given certain
requirements.
