Electrons and electron neutrinos in the inner core of the core-collapse
supernova are highly degenerate and therefore numerous during a few seconds of
explosion. In contrast, leptons of other flavors are non-degenerate and
therefore relatively scarce. This is due to lepton flavor conservation. If this
conservation law is broken by some non-standard interactions, electron
neutrinos are converted to muon and tau-neutrinos, and electrons -- to muons.
This affects the supernova dynamics and the supernova neutrino signal in
several ways. In particular, the total neutrino luminosity in the first second
of the collapse is increased due to the larger free path of the non-electron
neutrinos. This effect may have important consequences as the increase of the
neutrino luminosity is known to facilitate the explosion. We consider an
extension of the Standard Model by scalar bileptons which mediate lepton flavor
violation. It is shown that in case of TeV-mass bileptons the electron fermi
gas is equilibrated with non-electron species inside the inner supernova core
at a time-scale of order of (1-100) ms. In particular, a scalar triplet which
generates neutrino masses through the see-saw type II mechanism is considered.
Non-observation of rare decays and data on neutrino mixing and neutrino masses
restrict possible lepton flavor violation effects in this case. However a
region in the parameter space of the model exists which fits all the
experimental constraints and provides lepton flavor violation sufficient for
observable effects in supernova.
