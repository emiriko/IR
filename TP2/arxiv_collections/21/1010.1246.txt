We present measurements of J/psi yields in d+Au collisions at sqrt(s_NN) =
200 GeV recorded by the PHENIX experiment and compare with yields in p+p
collisions at the same energy per nucleon-nucleon collision. The measurements
cover a large kinematic range in J/psi rapidity (-2.2 < y < 2.4) with high
statistical precision and are compared with two theoretical models: one with
nuclear shadowing combined with final state breakup and one with coherent gluon
saturation effects. To remove model dependent systematic uncertainties we also
compare the data to a simple geometric model. We find that calculations where
the nuclear modification is linear or exponential in the density weighted
longitudinal thickness are difficult to reconcile with the forward rapidity
data.
