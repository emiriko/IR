The aim of this paper is to introduce and study quadratic Hom-Lie algebras,
which are Hom-Lie algebras with symmetric invariant nondegenerate bilinear
forms. We provide several constructions leading to examples and extend the
double extension theory to Hom-Lie algebras. We reduce the case where the twist
map is invertible to the study of involutive quadratic Lie algebras. We
establish a correspondence between the class of involutive quadratic Hom-Lie
algebras and quadratic simple Lie algebras with symmetric involution.
Centerless involutive quadratic Hom-Lie algebras are characterized. Also
elements of a representation theory for Hom-Lie algebras, including adjoint and
coadjoint representations are supplied with application to quadratic Hom-Lie
algebras.
