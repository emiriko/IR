We report on microwave (mw) radiation induced electric currents in
(Cd,Mn)Te/(Cd,Mg)Te and InAs/(In,Ga)As quantum wells subjected to an external
in-plane magnetic field. The current generation is attributed to the
spin-dependent energy relaxation of electrons heated by mw radiation. The
relaxation produces equal and oppositely directed electron flows in the spin-up
and spin-down subbands yielding a pure spin current. The Zeeman splitting of
the subbands in the magnetic field leads to the conversion of the spin flow
into a spin-polarized electric current.
