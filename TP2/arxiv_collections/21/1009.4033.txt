We propose a stochastic method for solving Schwinger-Dyson equations in
large-N quantum field theories. Expectation values of single-trace operators
are sampled by stationary probability distributions of the so-called nonlinear
random processes. The set of all histories of such processes corresponds to the
set of all planar diagrams in the perturbative expansions of the expectation
values of singlet operators. We illustrate the method on the examples of the
matrix-valued scalar field theory and the Weingarten model of random planar
surfaces on the lattice. For theories with compact field variables, such as
sigma-models or non-Abelian lattice gauge theories, the method does not
converge in the physically most interesting weak-coupling limit. In this case
one can absorb the divergences into a self-consistent redefinition of expansion
parameters. Stochastic solution of the self-consistency conditions can be
implemented as a "memory" of the random process, so that some parameters of the
process are estimated from its previous history. We illustrate this idea on the
example of two-dimensional O(N) sigma-model. Extension to non-Abelian lattice
gauge theories is discussed.
