Several double perovskite materials of the form A_2BB'O_6 exhibit high
ferromagnetic T_c, and significant low field magnetoresistance. They are also a
candidate source of spin polarized electrons. The potential usefulness of these
materials is, however, frustrated by mislocation of the B and B' ions, which do
not organise themselves in the ideal alternating structure. The result is a
strong dependence of physical properties on preparative conditions, reducing
the magnetization and destroying the half-metallicity. We provide the first
results on the impact of spatially correlated antisite disorder, as observed
experimentally, on the ferromagnetic double perovskites. The antisite domains
suppress magnetism and half-metallicity, as expected, but lead to a dramatic
enhancement of the low field magnetoresistance.
