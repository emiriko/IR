In this paper we ask which properties of a distributed network can be
computed from a little amount of local information provided by its nodes. The
distributed model we consider is a restriction of the classical CONGEST
(distributed) model and it is close to the simultaneous messages (communication
complexity) model defined by Babai, Kimmel and Lokam. More precisely, each of
these n nodes -which only knows its own ID and the IDs of its neighbors- is
allowed to send a message of O(log n) bits to some central entity, called the
referee. Is it possible for the referee to decide some basic structural
properties of the network topology G? We show that simple questions like, "does
G contain a square?", "does G contain a triangle?" or "Is the diameter of G at
most 3? cannot be solved in general. On the other hand, the referee can decode
the messages in order to have full knowledge of G when G belongs to many graph
classes such as planar graphs, bounded treewidth graphs and, more generally,
bounded degeneracy graphs. We leave open questions related to the connectivity
of arbitrary graphs.
