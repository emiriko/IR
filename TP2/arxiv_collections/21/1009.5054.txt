I address: (1) dynamical, likely local Higgs mass generation as resolution to
the 4D hierarchy and vacuum energy problems, (2) possibility that top
condensation may be explained by an interplay among the gluon and scalar
sectors, (3) the Higgs Mass Zero Crossing (HMZC) scale, most likely equal to
{\Lambda}_EWSB, in accord with standard cosmology or classic inflation, and (4)
two preferred Higgs regions centered at 116.5 GeV and 140.5 GeV with related
high energy models. I show that SM in 2D could simultaneously satisfy (a)
complete radiative generation of the Higgs mass via top loop and (b)
cancelation of the remaining leading order corrections to the scalar
propagator. The Higgs mass, m_H, parameterized with k=1 (2), in the leading
order is 113.0{\pm}1.0 GeV (143.4{\pm}1.3 GeV). I show that the SM top
condensation is consistent with the gluon and Higgs mediated top-anti top
interactions at tree level. I predict the QCD fine structure constant with the
mean value only 0.25% away from the world average value at {\sqrt}s=M_Z. The SM
driven theory at energies larger than the HMZC scale necessary includes
effective tachyonic Higgs (Popovic 2001). Here, I map the SM physical Higgs
mass to the low energy HMZC scale (0.8-1.8 TeV). I show that the very "long
lived" SM necessitates Higgs lighter than 146.5{\pm}2 GeV such that there is a
single HMZC scale at energies smaller than the Planck mass. I present candidate
m_H=138.1{\pm}1.8 GeV for the SM valid up to an energy scale, nearly equal
Planck mass, obtained from a conjecture which minimizes the parameters of the
Higgs potential. I introduce a class of models potentially exactly removing
tachyons. I analyze Composite Particles Models (CPM) (Popovic 2002) where top
quark is composite, composed of 3 fundamental fermions, and Higgs scalar is
composite, composed of 2 fundamental fermions, with m_H=2/3 m_t=115.4{\pm}0.9
GeV.
