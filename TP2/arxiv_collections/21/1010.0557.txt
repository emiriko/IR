Plasmodium of Physarum polycephalum is a single cell visible by unaided eye.
During its foraging behavior the cell spans spatially distributed sources of
nutrients with a protoplasmic network. Geometrical structure of the
protoplasmic networks allows the plasmodium to optimize transport of nutrients
between remote parts of its body. Assuming major Mexican cities are sources of
nutrients how much structure of Physarum protoplasmic network correspond to
structure of Mexican Federal highway network? To find an answer undertook a
series of laboratory experiments with living Physarum polycephalum. We
represent geographical locations of major cities by oat flakes, place a piece
of plasmodium in Mexico city area, record the plasmodium's foraging behavior
and extract topology of nutrient transport networks. Results of our experiments
show that the protoplasmic network formed by Physarum is isomorphic, subject to
limitations imposed, to a network of principle highways. Ideas and results of
the paper may contribute towards future developments in bio-inspired road
planning.
