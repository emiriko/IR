Designs of high-voltage (HV) systems for creating a drift electric field in
liquid argon TPCs are reviewed. In ongoing experiments systems capable of
approx. 100 kV are realised for a drift field of 0.5-1 kV/cm over a length of
up to 1.5 m. Two of them having different approaches are presented: (1) the
ICARUS-T600 detector having a system consisting of an external power supply, HV
feedthroughs and resistive voltage degraders and (2) the ArDM-1t detector
having a cryogenic Greinacher HV multiplier inside the liquid argon volume. For
a giant scale liquid argon TPC, a system providing 2 MV may be required to
attain a drift length of approx. 20 m. Feasibility of such a system is
evaluated by extrapolating the existing designs.
