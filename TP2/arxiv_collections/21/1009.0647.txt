We investigate the structure of quantum correlations in an expanding Bose
Einstein Condensate (BEC) through the analogue gravity framework. We consider
both a 3+1 isotropically expanding BEC as well as the experimentally relevant
case of an elongated, effectively 1+1 dimensional, expanding condensate. In
this case we include the effects of inhomogeneities in the condensate, a
feature rarely included in the analogue gravity literature. In both cases we
link the BEC expansion to a simple model for an expanding spacetime and then
study the correlation structure numerically and analytically (in suitable
approximations). We also discuss the expected strength of such correlation
patterns and experimentally feasible BEC systems in which these effects might
be detected in the near future.
