We present an inquiry lab activity on Circuit Design that was conducted in
Fall 2009 with first-year community college students majoring in Electrical
Engineering Technology. This inquiry emphasized the use of engineering process
skills, including circuit assembly and problem solving, while learning
technical content. Content goals of the inquiry emphasized understanding
voltage dividers (Kirchoff's voltage law) and analysis and optimization of
resistive networks (Thevenin equivalence). We assumed prior exposure to series
and parallel circuits and Ohm's law (the relationship between voltage, current,
and resistance) and designed the inquiry to develop these skills. The inquiry
utilized selection of engineering challenges on a specific circuit (the
Wheatstone Bridge) to realize these learning goals. Students generated
questions and observations during the starters, which were categorized into
four engineering challenges or design goals. The students formed teams and
chose one challenge to focus on during the inquiry. We created a rubric for
summative assessment which helped to clarify and solidify project goals while
designing the inquiry and aided in formative assessment during the activity.
After describing implementation, we compare and contrast engineering-oriented
inquiry design as opposed to activities geared toward science learning.
