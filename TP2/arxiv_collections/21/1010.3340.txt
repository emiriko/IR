Single crystals of electron-doped SrMnO3 with a cubic perovskite structure
have been systematically investigated as the most canonical
(orbital-degenerate) double-exchange system, whose ground states have been
still theoretically controversial. With only 1-2% electron doping by Ce
substitution for Sr, a G-type antiferromagnetic metal with a tiny spin canting
in a cubic lattice shows up as the ground state, where the Jahn-Teller polarons
with heavy mass are likely to form. Further electron doping above 4%, however,
replaces this isotropic metal with an insulator with tetragonal lattice
distortion, accompanied by a quasi-one-dimensional 3z^2-r^2 orbital ordering
with the C-type antiferromagnetism. The self-organization of such dilute
polarons may reflect the critical role of the cooperative Jahn-Teller effect
that is most effective in the originally cubic system.
