In these fluid dynamics videos, we show how bubbles flowing in a thin
microchannel interact under an acoustic field. Because of acoustic interactions
without direct contact, bubbles self-organize into periodic patterns, and
spontaneously form acoustically bound crystals. We also present the interaction
with boundaries, equivalent to the interaction with image bubbles, and unravel
the peculiar vibration modes of the confined bubbles.
