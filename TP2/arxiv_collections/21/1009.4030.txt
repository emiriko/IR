The probability distribution for finding a state of the radiation field in a
particular phase is described by a multitude of theoretical formalisms; the
phase-sensitivity of the Wigner quasi-probability distribution being one of
them. We construct a hermitian phase operator for this Wigner phase. We show
that this operator is complete and also elucidate a set of complete but
non-orthogonal states that seems to be naturally associated with such an
operator. Further we show that our operator satisfies a weak equivalence
relation with the Pegg-Barnett operator, thus showing that the essential phase
information furnished by both formalisms are the same. It is also shown that
this operator gives results which are in correct agreement with the expected
uniform phase distribution of a Fock state.
