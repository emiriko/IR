We give a construction for a self-test for any connected graph state. In
other words, for each connected graph state we give a set of non-local
correlations that can only be achieved (quantumly) by that particular graph
state and certain local measurements. The number of correlations considered is
small, being linear in the number of vertices in the graph. We also prove
robustness for the test.
