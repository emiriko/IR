In this work we apply the formalism developed in [M. Lepers \emph{et al}.,
Phys. Rev. A \textbf{77}, 043628 (2008)] to different initial conditions
corresponding to systems usually met in real-life experiments, and calculate
the observable quantities that can be used to characterize the dynamics of the
system. The position space point of view allows highly intuitive pictures of
the physics at play.
