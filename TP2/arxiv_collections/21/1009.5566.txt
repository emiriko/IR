We present an Echelle+CCD, high S/N, high resolution (R = 20\,000)
spectroscopic atlas of 108 well-known objects representative of the most common
types of peculiar and variable stars. The wavelength interval extends from 4600
to 9400 Ang, and includes the RAVE, Gaia and HERMES wavelength ranges.
Multi-epoch spectra are provided for the majority of observed stars. A total of
425 spectra of peculiar stars are presented, which have been collected during
56 observing nights between November 1998 and August 2002. The spectra are
given in FITS format and heliocentric wavelengths, with accurate subtraction of
both the sky background and the scattered light. Auxiliary material useful for
custom applications (telluric dividers, spectro-photometric stars, flat-field
tracings) is also provided. The atlas aims to provide a homogeneous database of
the spectral appearance of stellar peculiarities, a tool useful both for
classification purposes and inter-comparison studies. It could also serve the
planning for and training of automated classification algorithms designed for
RAVE, Gaia, HERMES and other large scale spectral surveys. The spectrum of XX
Oph is discussed in some detail as an example of the content of the present
atlas.
