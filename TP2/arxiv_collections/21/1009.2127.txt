We present evidence indicating that Anosov systems can be endowed with a
unique physically reasonable effective temperature. Results for the two
paradigmatic Anosov systems (i.e., the cat map and the geodesic flow on a
surface of constant negative curvature) are used to justify a proposal for
extending Ruelle's thermodynamical formalism into a comprehensive theory of
statistical physics for nonequilibrium steady states satisfying the
Gallavotti-Cohen chaotic hypothesis.
