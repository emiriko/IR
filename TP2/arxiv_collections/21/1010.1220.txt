In Amin and Choi \cite{AC09}, we show that an adiabatic quantum algorithm for
the NP-hard maximum independent set (MIS) problem on a set of special family of
graphs in which there are exponentially many local maxima would have the
exponentially small minimum spectral gap and thus would require the exponential
time, due to the first order quantum phase transition (FQPT). The problem
Hamiltonian of the adiabatic quantum algorithm for MIS is based on the
reduction to the Ising problem and has flexible parameters. In this paper, we
show numerically on the 15-vertex graph that by choosing the parameters
appropriately in the problem Hamiltonian (without changing the problem to be
solved) for MIS, we can prevent the FQPT and drastically increase the minimum
spectral gap. The result is further supported by visualization from the
Decomposed State Evolution Visualization (\desev) --- a visualization tool we
introduced. Furthermore, our result also serves to concretely clarify that it
is not sufficient to consider one specific problem Hamiltonian for proving the
failure of adiabatic quantum optimization for a problem. We also raise the
basic question about what the appropriate formulation of adiabatic running time
should be.
