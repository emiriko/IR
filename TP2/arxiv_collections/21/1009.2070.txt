We investigate the evolution of coronal loop emission in the context of the
coronal magnetic field topology. New modeling techniques allow us to
investigate the magnetic field structure and energy release in active regions.
Using these models and high resolution multi-wavelength coronal observations
from the Transition Region and Coronal Explorer (TRACE) and the X-ray Telescope
(XRT) on Hinode, we are able to establish a relationship between the light
curves of coronal loops and their associated magnetic topologies for NOAA
Active Region 10963. We examine loops that show both transient and steady
emission, and we find that loops that show many transient brightenings are
located in domains associated with a high number of separators. This topology
provides an environment for continual impulsive heating events through magnetic
reconnection at the separators. A loop with relatively constant X-ray and EUV
emission, on the other hand, is located in domains that are not associated with
separators. This result implies that larger-scale magnetic field reconnections
are not involved in heating plasma in these regions, and the heating in these
loops must come from another mechanism, such as small-scale reconnections
(i.e., nanoflares) or wave heating. Additionally, we find that loops that
undergo repeated transient brightenings are associated with separators that
have enhanced free energy. In contrast, we find one case of an isolated
transient brightening that seems to be associated with separators with a
smaller free energy.
