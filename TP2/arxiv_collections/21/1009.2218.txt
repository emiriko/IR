Given any convex $n$-gon, in this article, we: (i) prove that its vertices
can form at most $n^2/2 + \Theta(n\log n)$ isosceles trianges with two sides of
unit length and show that this bound is optimal in the first order, (ii)
conjecture that its vertices can form at most $3n^2/4 + o(n^2)$ isosceles
triangles and prove this conjecture for a special group of convex $n$-gons,
(iii) prove that its vertices can form at most $\lfloor n/k \rfloor$ regular
$k$-gons for any integer $k\ge 4$ and that this bound is optimal, and (iv)
provide a short proof that the sum of all the distances between its vertices is
at least $(n-1)/2$ and at most $\lfloor n/2 \rfloor \lceil n/2 \rceil(1/2)$ as
long as the convex $n$-gon has unit perimeter.
