This paper is the second of a series giving a self-contained way from the
Neveu-Schwarz algebra to a new series of irreducible subfactors. Here we give a
unitary complete proof of the classification of the unitary series of the
Neveu-Schwarz algebra, by the way of GKO construction, Kac determinant and FQS
criterion. We then obtain the characters directly, without Feigin-Fuchs
resolutions.
