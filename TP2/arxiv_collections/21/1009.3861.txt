James Philip Elliott, one of the towering figures of nuclear physics of the
second half of the twentieth century, died on the 21st of October 2008.
Obituaries appeared in the British press but relatively little attention was
paid by the international scientific community to Elliott's contributions.
Given their importance, in particular for theoretical nuclear physics, it seems
appropriate to reflect here, two years after his death, on the scientific
legacy left by Phil Elliott.
