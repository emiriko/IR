We present our recent results on the fragmentation by varying the mass
asymmetry of the reaction between 0.2 and 0.7 at an incident energy of 250
MeV/nucleon. For the present study, the total mass of the system is kept
constant (ATOT = 152) and mass asymmetry of the reaction is defined by the
asymmetry parameter (? = | (AT - AP)/(AT + AP) |). The measured distributions
are shown as a function of the total charge of all projectile fragments,
Zbound. We see an interesting outcome for rise and fall in the production of
intermediate mass fragments (IMFs) for large asymmetric colliding nuclei. This
trend, however, is completely missing for large asymmetric nuclei. Therefore,
experiments are needed to verify this prediction.
