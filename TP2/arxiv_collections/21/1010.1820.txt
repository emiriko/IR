In the present paper we study interval identification systems of order three.
We prove that the Rauzy induction preserves symmetry: for any symmetric
interval identification system of order three after finitely many iterations of
the Rauzy induction we always obtain a symmetric system. We also provide an
example of symmetric interval identification system of thin type.
