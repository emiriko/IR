For Crab-like pulsars we consider the synchrotron mechanism influenced by
relativistic effects of rotation to study the production of the very high
energy (VHE) pulsed radiation. The process of quasi-linear diffusion (QLD) is
applied to prevent the damping of the synchrotron emission due to extremely
strong magnetic field. By examining the kinetic equation governing the QLD,
apart from the synchrotron radiative force, we taken into account the the
so-called reaction force, that is responsible for corotation and influences
plasma processes in the nearby zone of the light cylinder (LC) surface. We have
found that the relativistic effects of rotation significantly change efficiency
of the quasi-linear diffusion. In particular, examining magnetospheric
parameters typical for Crab-like pulsars, it has been shown that unlike the
situation, where relativistic effects of rotation are not important, on the LC
surface, the relativistic electrons via the synchrotron mechanism may produce
photons even in the TeV domain. It is shown that the VHE radiation is strongly
correlated with the relatively low frequency emission.
