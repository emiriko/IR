In this paper, an intersection theory for generic differential polynomials is
presented. The intersection of an irreducible differential variety of dimension
$d$ and order $h$ with a generic differential hypersurface of order $s$ is
shown to be an irreducible variety of dimension $d-1$ and order $h+s$. As a
consequence, the dimension conjecture for generic differential polynomials is
proved. Based on the intersection theory, the Chow form for an irreducible
differential variety is defined and most of the properties of the Chow form in
the algebraic case are established for its differential counterpart.
Furthermore, the generalized differential Chow form is defined and its
properties are proved. As an application of the generalized differential Chow
form, the differential resultant of $n+1$ generic differential polynomials in
$n$ variables is defined and properties similar to that of the Macaulay
resultant for multivariate polynomials are proved.
