We report an unexpected systematic degeneracy between different multiplets in
an inversion symmetric system of two coupled Gaudin models with homogeneous
couplings, as occurring for example in the context of solid state quantum
information processing. We construct the full degenerate subspace (being of
macroscopic dimension), which turns out to lie in the kernel of the commutator
between the two Gaudin models and the coupling term. Finally we investigate to
what extend the degeneracy is related to the inversion symmetry of the system
and find that indeed there is a large class of systems showing the same type of
degeneracy.
