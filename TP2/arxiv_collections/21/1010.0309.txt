Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model with Kobayashi-Maskawa-'t Hooft (KMT) term is
one of low energy effective theory of QCD which includes the $U_A(1)$ anomaly.
We investigate nonet meson properties in this model with three flavors of
quarks. We employ two type of regularizations the dimensional and sharp cutoff
ones. The model parameters are fixed phenomenologically for each
regularization. Evaluating the kaon decay constant, the $\eta$ meson mass and
the topological susceptibility, we show the regularization dependence of the
results and discuss the applicability of the NJL model.
