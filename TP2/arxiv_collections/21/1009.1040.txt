We study vison excitations in a quantum dimer model interpolating between the
Rokhsar-Kivelson models on the square and triangular lattices. In the
square-lattice case, the model is known to be critical and characterized by
U(1) topological quantum numbers. Introducing diagonal dimers brings the model
to a Z_2 resonating-valence-bond phase. We study variationally the emergence of
vison excitations at low concentration of diagonal dimers, close to the
critical point. We find that, in this regime, vison excitations are large in
size and their structure resembles vortices in type-II superconductors.
