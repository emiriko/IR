An unified approximated solution for symmetric Skyrmions was proposed for the
SU(2) Skyrme model for baryon numbers up to 8,which take the hybrid form of a
kink-like solution and that given by the instanton method. The Skyrmion
profiles are examined by computing lowest soliton energy as well as the static
properties of nucleons within the framework of collective quantization, with a
good agreement with the exact numeric results. The comparisons with the
previous computations as well as the experimental data are also given.
