We report on magnetotransport measurements of multi-terminal suspended
graphene devices. Fully developed integer quantum Hall states appear in
magnetic fields as low as 2 T. At higher fields the formation of longitudinal
resistance minima and transverse resistance plateaus are seen corresponding to
fractional quantum Hall states, most strongly for {\nu}= 1/3. By measuring the
temperature dependence of these resistance minima, the energy gap for the 1/3
fractional state in graphene is determined to be at ~20 K at 14 T.
