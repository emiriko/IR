The temperature variations of Pauli spin paramagnetic susceptibility and the
electronic specific heat of solids, are calculated as functions of temperature
following the free electron approximation, in generalised d-dimensions. The
results are compared and become consistent with that obtained in three
dimensions. Interestingly, the Pauli spin paramagnetic susceptibility becomes
independent of temperature only in two dimensions.
