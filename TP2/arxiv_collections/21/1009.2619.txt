We studied the magnetic behavior of bilayers of multiferroic and nominally
antiferromagnetic o-YMnO$_3$ (375~nm thick) and ferromagnetic
La$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$MnO$_3$ and La$_{0.67}$Ca$_{0.33}$MnO$_3$ ($8 \ldots
225~$nm), in particular the vertical magnetization shift $M_E$ and exchange
bias field $H_E$ for different thickness and magnetic dilution of the
ferromagnetic layer at different temperatures and cooling fields. We have found
very large $M_E$ shifts equivalent to up to 100\% of the saturation value of
the o-YMO layer alone. The overall behavior indicates that the properties of
the ferromagnetic layer contribute substantially to the $M_E$ shift and that
this does not correlate straightforwardly with the measured exchange bias field
$H_E$.
