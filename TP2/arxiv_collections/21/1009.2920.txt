Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films of dialkyldithiophosphate (DDP) modified Cu
nanoparticles were prepared. The structure, microfrictional behaviors and
adhesion of the LB films were investigated by transmission electron microscopy
(TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and atomic/friction force
microscopy (AFM/FFM). Our results showed that the modified Cu nanoparticles
have a typical core-shell structure and fine film-forming ability. The images
of AFM/FFM showed that LB films of modified Cu nanoparticles were composed of
many nanoparticles arranged closely and orderly and the nanoparticles had
favorable behaviors of lower friction. The friction loop of the films indicated
that the friction force was affected prominently by the surface slope of the Cu
nanoparticles and the microfrictional behaviors showed obvious "ratchet
effect". The adhesion experiment showed that the modified Cu nanoparticle had a
very small adhesive force. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
