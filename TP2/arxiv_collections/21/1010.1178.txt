A common problem in Bell type experiments is the well-known detection
loophole: if the detection efficiencies are not perfect and if one simply
post-selects the conclusive events, one might observe a violation of a Bell
inequality, even though a local model could have explained the experimental
results. In this paper, we analyze the set of all post-selected correlations
that can be explained by a local model, and show that it forms a polytope,
larger than the Bell local polytope. We characterize the facets of this
post-selected local polytope in the CHSH scenario, where two parties have
binary inputs and outcomes. Our approach gives new insights on the detection
loophole problem.
