In the functional approach to quantum chromodynamics, the properties of
hadronic bound states are accessible via covariant integral equations, e.g. the
Bethe-Salpeter equations for mesons. In particular, one has to deal with
linear, homogeneous integral equations which, in sophisticated model setups,
use numerical representations of the solutions of other integral equations as
part of their input. Analogously, inhomogeneous equations can be constructed to
obtain off-shell information in addition to bound-state masses and other
properties obtained from the covariant analogue to a wave function of the bound
state. These can be solved very efficiently using well-known matrix algorithms
for eigenvalues (in the homogeneous case) and the solution of linear systems
(in the inhomogeneous case). We demonstrate this by solving the homogeneous and
inhomogeneous Bethe-Salpeter equations and find, e.g. that for the calculation
of the mass spectrum it is more efficient to use the inhomogeneous equation.
This is valuable insight, in particular for the study of baryons in a
three-quark setup and more involved systems.
