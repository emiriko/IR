We have grown calcium and oxygen co-doped Y1-xCaxBa2Cu3O7-{\delta} single
crystals using self-flux method. A method of fine tuning oxygen content to
reach the equilibrium state through in situ monitoring of the conductivity
change is established. Structural, compositional and electronic property
characterizations of optimally co-doped Y1-xCaxBa2Cu3O7-{\delta} crystals
indicate that they are high quality equilibrium crystals with a sharp
superconducting transition width of 0.2K.
