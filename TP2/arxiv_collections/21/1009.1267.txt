The fragmentation of quasi-projectiles from the nuclear reaction $^{40}Ca$ +
$^{12}C$ at 25 MeV/nucleon was used to produce excited states candidates to
$\alpha$-particle condensation. The experiment was performed at LNS-Catania
using the CHIMERA multidetector. Accepting the emission simultaneity and
equality among the $\alpha$-particle kinetic energies as experimental criteria
for deciding in favor of the condensate nature of an excited state, we analyze
the $0_2^+$ and $2_2^+$ states of $^{12}$C and the $0_6^+$ state of $^{16}$O. A
sub-class of events corresponding to the direct 3-$\alpha$ decay of the Hoyle
state is isolated.
