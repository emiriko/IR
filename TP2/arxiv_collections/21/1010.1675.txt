We present transverse momentum spectra, rapidity distribution and
multiplicity of Lambda-hyperons measured with the HADES spectrometer in the
reaction Ar(1.76A GeV)+KCl. The yield of Xi- is calculated from our previously
reported Xi-/(Lambda+Sigma0) ratio and compared to other strange particle
multiplicities. Employing a strangeness balance equation the multiplicities of
the yet unmeasured charged Sigma hyperons can be estimated. Finally a
statistical hadronization model is used to fit the yields of pi-, K+, K0s, K-,
phi, Lambda and Xi-. The resulting chemical freeze-out temperature of T=(76+-2)
MeV is compared to the measured slope parameters obtained from fits to the
transverse mass distributions of the particles.
