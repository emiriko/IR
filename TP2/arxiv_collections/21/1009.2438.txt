In this paper we motivate and study the possibility of an intuitionistic
quantum logic. An explicit investigation of the application of the theory of
Bruns and Lakser on distributive hulls on traditional quantum logic (as
suggested in [Coe]) leads us to a small modification of this scheme. In this
way we obtain a weak Heyting algebra (cf. [CJ]) for describing the language of
quantum mechanics.
