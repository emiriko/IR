We show that the capacity region of the broadcast channel with confidential
messages does not change when the strong security criterion is adopted instead
of the weak security criterion traditionally used. We also show a construction
method of coding for the broadcast channel with confidential messages by using
an arbitrary given coding for the broadcast channel with degraded message sets.
