We study electromagnetic perturbations around a Kerr black hole surrounded by
a thin disk on the equatorial plane. Our main purpose is to reveal the black
hole superradiance of electromagnetic waves emitted from the disk surface. The
outgoing Kerr-Schild field is used to describe the disk emission, and the
superradiant scattering is represented by a vacuum wave field which is added to
satisfy the ingoing condition on the horizon. The formula to calculate the
energy flux on the disk surface is presented, and the energy transport in the
disk-black hole system is investigated. Within the low-frequency approximation
we find that the energy extracted from the rotating black hole is mainly
transported back to the disk, and the energy spectrum of electromagnetic waves
observed at infinity is also discussed.
