The discovery of non-radial pulsations (NRP) in the Be/X binaries of the
Magellanic Clouds (MC, eg. Fabrycky 2005, Coe et al. 2005, Schmidtke & Cowley
2005) provided a new approach to understand these complex systems, and, at the
same time, favoured the synergy between two different fields: stellar
pulsations and X-ray binaries. This breakthrough was possible thanks to the
MACHO and OGLE surveys. However, in our Galaxy, only two Be/X have been
reported to show NRP: GROJ2058+42 (Kiziloglu et al. 2007) and LSI+61 235 (Sarty
et al. 2009). Our objective is to study the short-term variability of Galactic
Be/X binaries, compare them to the Be/X of the MC and to the isolated Galactic
Be observed with CoRoT and Kepler. We present preliminary results of two Be/X
stars, namely 4U0115+63 and SAXJ2103.5+4545 showing multiperiodicity and
periodicity respectively, most probably produced by non-radial pulsations.
