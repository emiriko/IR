Motivated by a recent work of us [1], we reconstruct the different
f(T)-gravity models corresponding to a set of dark energy scenarios containing
the polytropic, the standard Chaplygin, the generalized Chaplygin and the
modified Chaplygin gas models. We also derive the equation of state parameter
of the selected f(T)-gravity models and obtain the necessary conditions for
crossing the phantom-divide line.
