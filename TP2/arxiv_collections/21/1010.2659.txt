The seesaw mechanism provides a simple explanation for the lightness of the
known neutrinos. Under the standard assumption of a weak scale Dirac mass and a
heavy sterile Majorana scale the neutrino mass is naturally suppressed below
the weak scale. However, Nature may employ Dirac and Majorana scales that are
much less than typically assumed, possibly even far below the weak scale. In
this case the seesaw mechanism alone would not completely explain the lightness
of the neutrinos. In this work we consider a warped framework that realizes
this possibility by combining naturally suppressed Dirac and Majorana scales
together in a mini-seesaw mechanism to generate light neutrino masses. Via the
AdS/CFT correspondence the model is dual to a 4D theory with a hidden strongly
coupled sector containing light composite right-handed neutrinos.
