We present a comprehensive analysis of the performance of different classes
of Gaussian states in the estimation of Gaussian phase-insensitive dissipative
channels. In particular, we investigate the optimal estimation of the damping
constant and reservoir temperature. We show that, for two-mode squeezed vacuum
probe states, the quantum-limited accuracy of both parameters can be achieved
simultaneously. Moreover, we show that for both parameters two-mode squeezed
vacuum states are more efficient than either coherent, thermal or single-mode
squeezed states. This suggests that at high energy regimes two-mode squeezed
vacuum states are optimal within the Gaussian setup. This optimality result
indicates a stronger form of compatibility for the estimation of the two
parameters. Indeed, not only the minimum variance can be achieved at fixed
probe states, but also the optimal state is common to both parameters.
Additionally, we explore numerically the performance of non-Gaussian states for
particular parameter values to find that maximally entangled states within
D-dimensional cutoff subspaces perform better than any randomly sampled states
with similar energy. However, we also find that states with very similar
performance and energy exist with much less entanglement than the maximally
entangled ones.
