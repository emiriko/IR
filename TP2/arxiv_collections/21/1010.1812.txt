Electing leader is a vital issue not only in distributed computing but also
in communication network [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], centralized mutual exclusion
algorithm [6, 7], centralized control IPC, etc. A leader is required to make
synchronization between different processes. And different election algorithms
are used to elect a coordinator among the available processes in the system
such a way that there will be only one coordinator at any time. Bully election
algorithm is one of the classical and well-known approaches in coordinator
election process. This paper will present a modified version of bully election
algorithm using a new concept called election commission. This approach will
not only reduce redundant elections but also minimize total number of elections
and hence it will minimize message passing, network traffic, and complexity of
the existing system.
