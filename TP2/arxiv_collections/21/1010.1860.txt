We consider the problem of soft gluon resummation for gauge theory amplitudes
and cross sections, at next-to-eikonal order, using a Feynman diagram approach.
At the amplitude level, we prove exponentiation for the set of factorizable
contributions, and construct effective Feynman rules which can be used to
compute next-to-eikonal emissions directly in the logarithm of the amplitude,
finding agreement with earlier results obtained using path-integral methods.
For cross sections, we also consider sub-eikonal corrections to the phase space
for multiple soft-gluon emissions, which contribute to next-to-eikonal
logarithms. To clarify the discussion, we examine a class of log(1 - x) terms
in the Drell-Yan cross-section up to two loops. Our results are the first steps
towards a systematic generalization of threshold resummations to
next-to-leading power in the threshold expansion.
