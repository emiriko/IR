We present an analysis of the spatial orientations of galaxies in the 247
optically selected rich Abell clusters, having in the considered area at least
100 members. We investigated the relation between angles giving information
about galaxy angular momenta and the number of members in each structure. The
position angles of the galaxy major axes, as well as two angles describing the
spatial orientation of galaxy plane were tested for isotropy, by applying three
different statistical tests. It is found that the values of statistics increase
with the amount of galaxies' members, which is equivalent to the existence of
the relation between anisotropy and number of galaxies in cluster. The search
for connection between the galaxies alignments and Bautz - Morgan morphological
types of examined clusters gave weak dependence. The statistically marginal
relation between velocity dispersion and cluster richness was observed. In
addition, it was found that the velocity dispersion decreases with Bautz -
Morgan type at almost 3$\sigma$ level. These results shows the dependence of
alignments with respect to clusters' richness, which can be regarded as
environmental effect.
