We present the first detailed classification of the structures of Class 0
cores in a high resolution simulation of a giant molecular cloud. The simulated
cloud contains 10^4 solar masses and produces over 350 cores which allows for
meaningful statistics. Cores are classified into three types according to how
much they depart from spherical symmetry. We find that three quarters of the
cores are better described as irregular filaments than as spheres. Recent
Herschel results have shown that cores are formed within a network of
filaments, which we find has had a significant impact on the resulting core
geometries. We show that the column densities and ram pressure seen by the
protostar are not uniform and generally peak along the axes of the filament.
The angular momentum vector of the material in the cores varies both in
magnitude and direction, which will cause the rotation vector of the central
source to fluctuate during the collapse of the core. In the case of the more
massive stars, accretion from the environment outside the original core volume
is even more important than that from the core itself. This additional gas is
primarily accreted onto the cores along the dense filaments in which the cores
are embedded, and the sections of the surfaces of the cores which do not
coincide with a filament have very little additional material passing through
them. The assumption of spherical symmetry cannot be applied to the majority of
collapsing cores, and is never a good description of how stars accrete gas from
outside the original core radius. This has ramifications for our understanding
of collapsing cores, in particular their line profiles, the effect of radiation
upon them and their ability to fragment.
