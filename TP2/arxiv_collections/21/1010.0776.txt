We report on the first measurements done with the ATLAS experiment of the
characteristics of energetic jets produced in proton-proton collisions at the
center of mass energy of 7 TeV. Jets are reconstructed using the anti-kt
clustering algorithm with distance parameter R=0.6. The kinematic region
investigated in this paper corresponds to jets with transverse momentum
p_T>30$GeV and rapidity |y_jet |<2.8. A critical understanding of the jet
production is obtained by comparing the data to predictions based on
leading-order QCD matrix elements plus parton shower Monte Carlo simulated
events. The results shown are obtained on a data sample corresponding to about
1 nb**-1 of integrated luminosity delivered by the Large Hadron Collider.
