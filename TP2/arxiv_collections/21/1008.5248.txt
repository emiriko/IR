We study the problem of maximizing the broadcast rate in peer-to-peer (P2P)
systems under \emph{node degree bounds}, i.e., the number of neighbors a node
can simultaneously connect to is upper-bounded. The problem is critical for
supporting high-quality video streaming in P2P systems, and is challenging due
to its combinatorial nature. In this paper, we address this problem by
providing the first distributed solution that achieves near-optimal broadcast
rate under arbitrary node degree bounds, and over arbitrary overlay graph. It
runs on individual nodes and utilizes only the measurement from their one-hop
neighbors, making the solution easy to implement and adaptable to peer churn
and network dynamics. Our solution consists of two distributed algorithms
proposed in this paper that can be of independent interests: a network-coding
based broadcasting algorithm that optimizes the broadcast rate given a
topology, and a Markov-chain guided topology hopping algorithm that optimizes
the topology. Our distributed broadcasting algorithm achieves the optimal
broadcast rate over arbitrary P2P topology, while previously proposed
distributed algorithms obtain optimality only for P2P complete graphs. We prove
the optimality of our solution and its convergence to a neighborhood around the
optimal equilibrium under noisy measurements or without time-scale separation
assumptions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution in simulations
using uplink bandwidth statistics of Internet hosts.
