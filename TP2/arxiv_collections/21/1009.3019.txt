We imaged comet 10P/Tempel 2 on 32 nights from 1999 April through 2000 March.
R-band lightcurves were obtained on 11 of these nights from 1999 April through
1999 June, prior to both the onset of significant coma activity and perihelion.
Phasing of the data yields a double-peaked lightcurve and indicates a nucleus
rotational period of 8.941 +/- 0.002 hr with a peak-to-peak amplitude of ~0.75
mag. Our data are sufficient to rule out all other possible double-peaked
solutions as well as the single- and triple- peaked solutions. This rotation
period agrees with one of five possible solutions found in post-perihelion data
from 1994 by Mueller and Ferrin (1996, Icarus, 123, 463-477), and unambiguously
eliminates their remaining four solutions. We applied our same techniques to
published lightcurves from 1988 which were obtained at an equivalent orbital
position and viewing geometry as in 1999. We found a rotation period of 8.932
+/- 0.001 hr in 1988, consistent with the findings of previous authors and
incompatible with our 1999 solution. This reveals that Tempel 2 spun-down by
~32 s between 1988 and 1999 (two intervening perihelion passages). If the
spin-down is due to a systematic torque, then the rotation period prior to
perihelion during the 2010 apparition is expected to be an additional 32 s
longer than in 1999.
