IPHASXJ194359.5+170901 is a new high-excitation planetary nebula with
remarkable characteristics. It consists of a knotty ring expanding at a speed
of 28 km/s, and a fast collimated outflow in the form of faint lobes and caps
along the direction perpendicular to the ring. The expansion speed of the polar
caps is 100 km/s, and their kinematical age is twice as large as the age of the
ring. Time-resolved photometry of the central star of IPHASXJ194359.5+170901
reveals a sinusoidal modulation with a period of 1.16 days. This is interpreted
as evidence for binarity of the central star, the brightness variations being
related to the orbital motion of an irradiated companion. This is supported by
the spectrum of the central star in the visible range, which appears to be
dominated by emission from the irradiated zone, consisting of a warm (6000-7000
K) continuum, narrow C III, C IV, and N III emission lines, and broader lines
from a flat H I Balmer sequence in emission. IPHASXJ194359.5+170901 helps to
clarify the role of (close) binaries in the formation and shaping of planetary
nebulae. The output of the common-envelope evolution of the system is a
strongly flattened circumstellar mass deposition, a feature that seems to be
distinctive of this kind of binary system. Also, IPHASXJ194359.5+170901 is
among the first post-CE PNe for which the existence of a high-velocity polar
outflow has been demonstrated. Its kinematical age might indicate that the
polar outflow is formed before the common-envelope phase. This points to mass
transfer onto the secondary as the origin, but alternative explanations are
also considered.
