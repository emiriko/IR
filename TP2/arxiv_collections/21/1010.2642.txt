In these lectures the present status of the so-called standard cosmological
model, based on the hot Big Bang theory and the inflationary paradigm is
reviewed. Special emphasis is given to the origin of the cosmological
perturbations we see today under the form of the cosmic microwave background
anisotropies and the large scale structure and to the dark matter and dark
energy puzzles.
