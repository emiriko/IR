The presence of magnetic fields in the intra-cluster medium of galaxy
clusters is now well estabilished. It is directly revealed by the presence of
cluster-wide radio sources: radio halos and radio relics. In the last years
increasing attention has been devoted to the intra cluster magnetic field
through the study of polarized radio emission of radio galaxies, radio halos
and radio relics. Recent radio observations have revealed important features of
the intra-cluster magnetic field, allowing us to constrain its main properties
and to understand the physical processes taking place in the intra-cluster
medium. I will review the newest results on galaxy cluster magnetic fields,
both focusing on single objects and aimed at describing the magnetic field
general properties. The up-coming generation of radio telescopes, EVLA and
LOFAR, will shed light on several problematics regarding the cluster magnetic
fields and the related non-thermal emission.
