We present a systematic study of various forms of renormalization that can be
applied in the calculation of the self-energy of the Hubbard model within the
T-matrix approximation. We compare the exact solutions of the attractive and
repulsive Hubbard models, for linear chains of lengths up to eight sites, with
all possible taxonomies of the T-matrix approximation. For the attractive
Hubbard model, the success of a minimally self-consistent theory found earlier
in the atomic limit (Phys. Rev. B 71, 155111 (2005)) is not maintained for
finite clusters unless one is in the very strong correlation limit. For the
repulsive model, in the weak correlation limit at low electronic densities --
that is, where one would expect a self-consistent T-matrix theory to be
adequate -- we find the fully renormalized theory to be most successful. In our
studies we employ a modified Hubbard interaction that eliminates all Hartree
diagrams, an idea which was proposed earlier (Phys. Rev. B 63, 035104 (2000)).
