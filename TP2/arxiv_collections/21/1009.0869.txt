We comment on the general solution of the scalar field dark matter provided
in the paper "Remarks on the spherical scalar field halo in galaxies" by Kamal
K. Nandi, Ildar Valitov and Nail G. Migranov. The authors made a mistake in the
general form of the tangential pressure profile p_t(r), which deviates from the
correct profile, especially when r is small. Although this mistake does not
alter significantly the value of w(r) when the integration constant D is small,
we found that it does result in an overestimate of w(r) when D is large.
