We explore the possibility of using quantum walks on graphs to find
structural anomalies, such as extra edges or loops, on a graph. We focus our
attention on star graphs, whose edges are like spokes coming out of a central
hub. If there are $N$ spokes, we show that a quantum walk can find an extra
edge connecting two of the spokes or a spoke with a loop on it in $O(\sqrt{N})$
steps. We initially find that if all of the spokes have loops except one, the
walk will not find the spoke without a loop, but this can be fixed if we choose
the phase with which the particle is reflected from the vertex without the
loop. Consequently, quantum walks can, under some circumstances, be used to
find structural anomalies in graphs.
