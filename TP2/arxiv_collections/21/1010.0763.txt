Many-body interactions in transition-metal oxides give rise to a wide range
of functional properties, such as high-temperature superconductivity, colossal
magnetoresistance, or multiferroicity. The seminal recent discovery of a
two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) at the interface of the insulating oxides
LaAlO3 and SrTiO3 represents an important milestone towards exploiting such
properties in all-oxide devices. This conducting interface shows a number of
appealing properties, including a high electron mobility, superconductivity,
and large magnetoresistance and can be patterned on the few-nanometer length
scale. However, the microscopic origin of the interface 2DEG is poorly
understood. Here, we show that a similar 2DEG, with an electron density as
large as 8x10^13 cm^-2, can be formed at the bare SrTiO3 surface. Furthermore,
we find that the 2DEG density can be controlled through exposure of the surface
to intense ultraviolet (UV) light. Subsequent angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements reveal an unusual coexistence of a light
quasiparticle mass and signatures of strong many-body interactions.
