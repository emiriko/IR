Dijet angular distributions from the first LHC pp collisions at
center-of-mass energy sqrt(s) = 7 TeV have been measured with the ATLAS
detector. The dataset used for this analysis represents an integrated
luminosity of 3.1 pb-1. Dijet $\chi$ distributions and centrality ratios have
been measured up to dijet masses of 2.8 TeV, and found to be in good agreement
with Standard Model predictions. Analysis of the $\chi$ distributions excludes
quark contact interactions with a compositeness scale $\Lambda$ below 3.4 TeV,
at 95% confidence level, significantly exceeding previous limits.
