We present a prescription for computing the gluon fusion production rate of a
composite Higgs boson, which arises as a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson, using
effective lagrangians. The calculation incorporates three different effects due
to the composite nature of the Higgs, some of which were neglected previously.
We apply the prescription to models with and without the collective breaking
mechanism. In sharp contrast with the case of a fundamental Higgs scalar, the
rate only depends on the decay constant "f" and is not sensitive to masses of
new particles. After including electroweak constraints, there is a substantial
reduction in the rate, in the range of 10 -- 30 % or greater.
