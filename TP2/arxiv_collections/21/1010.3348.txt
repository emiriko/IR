A novel power series representation of the generalized Marcum $Q-$function of
positive order involving generalized Laguerre polynomials is presented. The
absolute convergence of the proposed power series expansion is showed, together
with a convergence speed analysis by means of truncation error. A brief review
of related studies and some numerical results are also provided.
