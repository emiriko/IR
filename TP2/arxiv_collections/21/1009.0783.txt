We present techniques for maintaining subgraph frequencies in a dynamic
graph, using data structures that are parameterized in terms of h, the h-index
of the graph. Our methods extend previous results of Eppstein and Spiro for
maintaining statistics for undirected subgraphs of size three to directed
subgraphs and to subgraphs of size four. For the directed case, we provide a
data structure to maintain counts for all 3-vertex induced subgraphs in O(h)
amortized time per update. For the undirected case, we maintain the counts of
size-four subgraphs in O(h^2) amortized time per update. These extensions
enable a number of new applications in Bioinformatics and Social Networking
research.
