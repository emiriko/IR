In this paper, we use the parameter retrieval method together with an
analytical effective medium approach to design a well-performed invisible
cloak, which is based on an empirical revised version of the reduced cloak. The
designed cloak can be implemented by silver nanowires with elliptical
cross-sections embedded in a polymethyl methacrylate host. This cloak is
numerically proved to be robust for both the inner hidden object as well as
incoming detecting waves, and is much simpler thus easier to manufacture when
compared with the earlier proposed one [Nat. Photon. 1, 224 (2007)].
