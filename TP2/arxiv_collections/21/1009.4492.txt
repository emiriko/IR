Interlayer coupling in rotationally faulted graphene multilayers breaks the
local sublattice-symmetry of the individual layers. We present a theory of this
mechanism, which reduces to an effective Dirac model with space-dependent mass
in an important limit. It thus makes a wealth of existing knowledge available
for the study of rotationally faulted graphene multilayers. We demonstrate
quantitative agreement between our theory and a recent experiment.
