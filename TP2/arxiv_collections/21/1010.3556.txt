We observe a disappearance of electron-hole asymmetry in hole and electron
doped manganites of composition Pr(1-x)Ca(x)MnO3 (x=0.36, 0.64), as reflected
in the g-parameter values. The bulk property of opposite g-shifts in room
temperature seems to have disappeared in nanoparticles. We analyze the results
in the light of ferromagnetic fluctuations and melting of charge order in
nanoparticles.
