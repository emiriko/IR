We demonstrate that a single reconnection of two quantum vortices can lead to
creation of a cascade of vortex rings. Our analysis, motivated by the
analytical solution in LIA, involves high-resolution Biot-Savart and
Gross-Pitaevskii simulations. The latter showed that the rings cascade starts
on the atomic scale, with rings diameters orders of magnitude smaller than the
characteristic line spacing in the tangle. So created vortex rings may
penetrate the tangle and annihilate on the boundaries. This provides an
efficient mechanism of the vortex tangle decay in very low temperatures.
