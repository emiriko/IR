The excitation of electrostatic wakefields in a magnetized spin quantum
plasma by the classical as well as the spin-induced ponderomotive force (CPF
and SPF, respectively) due to whistler waves is reported. The nonlinear
dynamics of the whistlers and the wakefields is shown to be governed by a
coupled set of nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger (NLS) and driven Boussinesq-like
equations. It is found that the quantum force associated with the Bohm
potential introduces two characteristic length scales, which lead to the
excitation of multiple wakefields in a strongly magnetized dense plasma (with a
typical magnetic field strength $B_{0}\gtrsim10^{9}$ T and particle density
$n_{0}\gtrsim10^{36}$ m$^{-3}$), where the SPF strongly dominates over the CPF.
In other regimes, namely $B_{0}\lesssim10^{8}$ T and $\ n_{0}\lesssim10^{35}$
m$^{-3}$, where the SPF is comparable to the CPF, a plasma wakefield can also
be excited self-consistently with one characteristic length scale. Numerical
results reveal that the wakefield amplitude is enhanced by the quantum
tunneling effect, however it is lowered by the external magnetic field. Under
appropriate conditions, the wakefields can maintain high coherence over
multiple plasma wavelengths and thereby accelerate electrons to extremely high
energies. The results could be useful for particle acceleration at short
scales, i.e. at nano- and micrometer scales, in magnetized dense plasmas where
the driver is the whistler wave instead of a laser or a particle beam.
