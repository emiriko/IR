By using a suitable set of the surface energy coefficient, nuclear radius,
and universal function, the original proximity potential 1977 is modified. The
overestimate of the data by 4 % reported in the literature is significantly
reduced. Our modified proximity potential reproduces the experimental data
nicely compared to its older versions.
