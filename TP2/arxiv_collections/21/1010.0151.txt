We present an extended set of model atmospheres and emergent spectra of X-ray
bursting neutron stars in low mass X-ray binaries. Compton scattering is taken
into account. The models were computed in LTE approximation for six different
chemical compositions: pure hydrogen and pure helium atmospheres, and
atmospheres with a solar mix of hydrogen and helium and various heavy elements
abundances: Z = 1, 0.3, 0.1, and 0.01 Z_sun, for three values of gravity, log g
=14.0, 14.3, and 14.6 and for 20 values of relative luminosity l = L/L_Edd in
the range 0.001 - 0.98. The emergent spectra of all models are fitted by
diluted blackbody spectra in the observed RXTE/PCA band 3 - 20 keV and the
corresponding values of color correction factors f_c are presented. We also
show how to use these dependencies to estimate the neutron star's basic
parameters.
