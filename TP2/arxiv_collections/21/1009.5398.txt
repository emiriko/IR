Smart homes are becoming more popular, as every day a new home appliance can
be digitally controlled. Smart Digital Homes are using a server to make
interaction with all the possible devices in one place, on a computer or
webpage. In this paper we designed and implemented a mobile application using
Windows Mobile platform that can connect to the controlling server of a Smart
Home and grants the access to the Smart Home devices and robots everywhere
possible. UML diagrams are presented to illustrate the application design
process. Robots are also considered as devices that are able to interact to
other object and devices. Scenarios are defined as a set of sequential actions
to help manage different tasks all in one place. The mobile application can
connect to the server using GPRS mobile internet and Short Message System
(SMS). Interactive home map is also designed for easier status-checking and
interacting with the devices using the mobile phones.
