Context: Infrared spectroscopy of primary and secondary eclipse events probes
the composition of exoplanet atmospheres and, using space telescopes, has
detected H2O, CH4 and CO2 in three hot Jupiters. However, the available data
from space telescopes has limited spectral resolution and does not cover the
2.4 - 5.2 micron spectral region. While large ground based telescopes have the
potential to obtain molecular-abundance-grade spectra for many exoplanets,
realizing this potential requires retrieving the astrophysical signal in the
presence of large Earth-atmospheric and instrument systematic errors. Aims:
Here we report a wavelet-assisted, selective principal component extraction
method for ground based retrieval of the dayside spectrum of HD 189733b from
data containing systematic errors. Methods: The method uses singular value
decomposition and extracts those critical points of the Rayleigh quotient which
correspond to the planet induced signal. The method does not require prior
knowledge of the planet spectrum or the physical mechanisms causing systematic
errors. Results: The spectrum obtained with our method is in excellent
agreement with space based measurements made with HST and Spitzer (Swain et al.
2009b; Charbonneau et al. 2008) and confirms the recent ground based
measurements (Swain et al. 2010) including the strong 3.3 micron emission.
