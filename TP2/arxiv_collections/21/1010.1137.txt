We analyze the full counting statistics (FCS) of a single-site quantum dot
coupled to multiple metallic electrodes in the normal state and a
superconductor for arbitrary transmission. We present an analytical solution of
the problem taking into account the full energy dependence of the transmission
coefficient. We identify two transport processes as sources of entanglement
between the current carriers by observing positive cross current correlations.
Furthermore, we consider ferromagnetic electrodes and show how they can be used
as detectors in experiments violating the Bell-Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt
inequality.
