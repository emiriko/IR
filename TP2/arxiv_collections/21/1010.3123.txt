The high cross section for the J/{\psi} production and the wide transverse
momentum spectrum accessible to ATLAS give to these events a central role in
the calibration of the ATLAS detector. The data collected during the first
months of the 2010 run at {\sqroot}s = 7 TeV p-p collisions (integrated
Luminosity up to 290 nb-1) show a clear signal with two muons in the final
state. The reconstructed invariant mass agrees with the PDG value and the peak
width is compatible with Monte Carlo expectations. The doubly differential
cross section is measured with respect to the transverse momentum and rapidity.
