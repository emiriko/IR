We investigate chameleonic Brans--Dicke model applied to the FRW universes. A
framework to study stability and attractor solutions in the phase space is
developed for the model. We show that depending on the matter field and
stability conditions, it is possible to realize phantom-like behavior without
introducing phantom filed in the model while the stability is fulfilled and
phantom crossing occurs. The statefinder parameters to the model for different
kinds of matter interacting with the chameleon scalar field are studied. We
also compare our model with present day observations.
