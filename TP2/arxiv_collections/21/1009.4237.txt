Using the effective theory pNRQCD we determine the potential energy of a
color singlet quark-antiquark pair with (fixed) distance r in three space-time
dimensions at weak coupling (alpha r << 1). The precision of our result reaches
O(alpha^3 r^2), i.e. NNLO in the multipole expansion, and NNLL in a
alpha/DeltaV expansion, where Delta V ~ alpha ln(alpha r). We even include all
logarithmic terms up to N^4LL order and compare the outcome to existing lattice
data.
