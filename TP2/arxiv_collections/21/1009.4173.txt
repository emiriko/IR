We studied the temperature and metal abundance distributions of the
intra-cluster medium (ICM) in a group of galaxies NGC 1550 observed with
Suzaku. The NGC 1550 is classified as a fossil group, which have few bright
member galaxies except for the central galaxy. Thus, such a type of galaxy is
important to investigate how the metals are enriched to the ICM. With the
Suzaku XIS instruments, we directly measured not only Si, S, and Fe lines but
also O and Mg lines and obtained those abundances to an outer region of ~0.5
r_180 for the first time, and confirmed that the metals in the ICM of such a
fossil group are indeed extending to a large radius. We found steeper gradients
for Mg, Si, S, and Fe abundances, while O showed almost flat abundance
distribution. Abundance ratios of alpha-elements to Fe were similar to those of
the other groups and poor clusters. We calculated the number ratio of type II
to type Ia supernovae for the ICM enrichment to be 2.9 +- 0.5 within 0.1 r_180,
and the value was consistent with those for the other groups and poor clusters
observed with Suzaku. We also calculated metal mass-to-light ratios (MLRs) for
Fe, O and Mg with B-band and K-band luminosities of the member galaxies of NGC
1550. The derived MLRs were comparable to those of NGC 5044 group in the r<0.1
r_180 region, while those of NGC 1550 are slightly higher than those of NGC
5044 in the outer region.
