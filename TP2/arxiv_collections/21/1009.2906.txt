We investigate the structure of hybrid stars based on two different
constructions: one is based on the Gibbs condition for phase coexistence and
considers the existence of a mixed phase (MP), and the other is based on the
Maxwell construction and no mixed phase is obtained. The hadron phase is
described by the non-linear Walecka model (NLW) and the quark phase by the
Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model (NJL). We conclude that the masses and radii obtained
are model dependent but not significantly different for both constructions.
