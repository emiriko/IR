A theoretical study is carried out in the homometallic mixed valent ludwigite
Co3O2BO3 using a modified tight binding methodology. The study focuses on the
electronic properties of bulk, 1D and molecular units to describe differences
between Co3O2BO3 and another homometallic ludwigite, Fe3O2BO3. The latter is
known to present a structural instability which has not been found in Co3O2BO3.
Our results show that bulk band structures present no significant differences.
Differences are found in the calculation of 1D stripes formed by 3+ 2+ 3+
triads, owed to different 3d occupancy of Fe and Co cations. Conditions for 1D
semiconducting transport observed in Fe3O2BO3 are not present in Co3O2BO3. More
important differences were found to be related to local octahedral geometry.
Larger distortions in Co3O2BO3 lead to higher 2+ 3+ hopping barriers in the
triads and consequent localization of charge. In Fe3O2BO3, site equivalence
provides easy paths for inter-cation hopping. The present results indicate that
local geometry of the cation sites is the main cause of differences in these
two compounds; dimerization in the triads, which characterizes the structural
change in Fe3O2BO3, could be structurally hindered in Co3O2BO3. An analogy is
made with two mixed-valent warwickites, Fe2OBO3 and Mn2OBO3, which show the
same structural stability/site equivalence relationship.
