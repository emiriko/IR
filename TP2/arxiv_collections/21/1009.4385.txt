It is shown that the seminal Horodecki 2-qutrit state belongs to the class of
states displaying symmetry governed by a commutative subgroup of the unitary
group U(3). Taking a conjugate subgroup one obtains another classes of
symmetric states and one finds equivalent representations of the Horodecki
state.
