We present complex radio bursts recorded by the radiospectrograph ARTEMIS-IV
in the active period of January 2005. The wide spectral coverage of this
recorder, in the 650-20 MHz range, permits an analysis of the radio bursts from
the base of the Solar Corona to 2 Solar Radii; it thus facilitates the
association of radio activity with other types of solar energetic phenomena.
Furthermore the ARTEMIS-IV1, high time resolution (1/100 sec) in the 450-270
MHz range, makes possible the detection and analysis of the fine structure
which most of the major radio events exhibit.
