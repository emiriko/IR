ATLAS is one of the two general purpose detectors at the world's largest
particle accelerator, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The LHC will be
colliding proton beams at a center of mass energy {\surd}s= 14 TeV and is
currently operating at {\surd}s = 7 TeV. During the commissioning phase since
September 2008, the ATLAS recorded cosmic-rays data and proton-proton
collisions at {\surd}s = 0.9 TeV. This data has extensively been used for the
alignment and calibration of various sub-detectors. The ATLAS detector has a
precision tracking system installed around the beam pipe for the measurements
of the position and momentum of charged particles emerging from the collisions.
The precise knowledge of misalignments of the tracking devices is crucial for
the important physics measurements. At the time of writing the alignment
corrections were obtained from the cosmic-rays and 0.9 TeV proton-proton
collisions data, while the large statistics of proton-proton collisions at 7
TeV was used to check the performance of the alignment. This article gives an
overview of the alignment strategy and the alignment performance using the data
collected from proton-proton collisions at 7 TeV.
