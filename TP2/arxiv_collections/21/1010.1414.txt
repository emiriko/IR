We present high-spectral-resolution, optical spectra of the Herbig Be star
MWC 147, in which we spectrally resolve several emission lines, including the
[O I] lines at 6300 and 6363\deg. Their highly symmetric, double-peaked line
profiles indicate that the emission originates in a rotating circumstellar
disk. We deconvolve the Doppler-broadened [O I] emission lines to obtain a
measure of emission as a function of distance from the central star. The
resulting radial surface brightness profiles are in agreement with a disk
structure consisting of a flat, inner, gaseous disk and a flared, outer, dust
disk. The transition between these components at 2 to 3 AU corresponds to the
estimated dust sublimation radius. The width of the double-peaked Mg II line at
4481\deg suggests that the inner disk extends to at least 0.10 AU, close to the
corotation radius.
