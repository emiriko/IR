The D0 collaboration has reported a 3.2 \sigma deviation from the Standard
Model (SM) prediction in the like-sign dimuon charge asymmetry. New physics
beyond the SM in B_s - \bar B_s mixing is needed to explain the data. In this
paper, we investigate the possible extension of the SM with one generation
color-triplet charged scalar as well as three generation Majorana fermions. We
study the implications of the model on the D0's dimuon charge asymmetry as well
as matter anti-matter asymmetry of the Universe.
