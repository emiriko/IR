Present treatments of eternal inflation regulate infinities by imposing a
geometric cutoff. We point out that some matter systems reach the cutoff in
finite time. This implies a nonzero probability for a novel type of
catastrophe. According to the most successful measure proposals, our galaxy is
likely to encounter the cutoff within the next 5 billion years.
