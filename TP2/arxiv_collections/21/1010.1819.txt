In mean-field-theory bilayer graphene's massive Dirac fermion model has a
family of broken inversion symmetry ground states with charge gaps and flavor
dependent spontaneous inter layer charge transfers. We use a lattice
Hartree-Fock model to explore some of the physics which controls whether or not
this type of broken symmetry state, which can be viewed as a pseudospin
ferromagnet, occurs in nature. We find that inversion symmetry is still broken
in the lattice model and estimate that transferred areal densities are $\sim
10^{-5}$ electrons per carbon atom, that the associated energy gaps are $\sim
10^{-2} {\rm eV}$, that the ordering condensation energies are $\sim 10^{-7}
eV$ per carbon atom, and that the energy differences between competing orders
at the neutrality point are $\sim 10^{-9} eV$ per carbon atom. We explore the
quantum phase transitions induced by external magnetic fields and by externally
controlled electric potential differences between the layers. We find, in
particular, that in an external magnetic field coupling to spontaneous orbital
moments favors broken time-reversal-symmetry states that have spontaneous
quantized anomalous Hall effects. Our theory predicts a non monotonic behavior
of the band gap at neutrality as a function of interlayer potential difference
in qualitative agreement with recent experiments.
