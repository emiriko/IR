We give (conjectural) analogs of Berenstein-Zelevinsky data for affine type
$A$. Moreover, by using these affine analogs of Berenstein-Zelevinsky data, we
realize the crystal basis of the negative part of the quantized universal
enveloping algebra of the (Langlands dual) Lie algebra of affine type $A$.
