Temperature dependence of intersubband transitions in AlN/GaN multiple
quantum wells grown with molecular beam epitaxy is investigated both by
absorption studies at different temperatures and modeling of conduction-band
electrons. For the absorption study, the sample is heated in increments up to
$400^\circ$C. The self-consistent Schr\"odinger-Poisson modeling includes
temperature effects of the band-gap and the influence of thermal expansion on
the piezoelectric field. We find that the intersubband absorption energy
decreases only by $\sim 6$ meV at $400^\circ$C relative to its room temperature
value.
