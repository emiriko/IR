The Lax pair formulation of the two-component Camassa-Holm equation (CH2) is
generalized to produce an integrable multi-component family, CH(n,k), of
equations with $n$ components and $1\le |k|\le n$ velocities. All of the
members of the CH(n,k) family show fluid-dynamics properties with coherent
solitons following particle characteristics. We determine their Lie-Poisson
Hamiltonian structures and give numerical examples of their soliton solution
behaviour. We concentrate on the CH(2,k) family with one or two velocities,
including the CH(2,-1) equation in the Dym position of the CH2 hierarchy. A
brief discussion of the CH(3,1) system reveals the underlying graded
Lie-algebraic structure of the Hamiltonian formulation for CH(n,k) when
$n\ge3$.
