Predictions for LHC physics are given for a two-Higgs-doublet model having
four generalized CP symmetries. In this maximally-CP-symmetric model (MCPM) the
first fermion family is, at tree level, uncoupled to the Higgs fields and thus
massless. The second and third fermion families have a very symmetric coupling
to the Higgs fields. But through the electroweak symmetry breaking a large mass
hierarchy is generated between these fermion families. Thus, the fermion mass
spectrum of the model presents a rough approximation to what is observed in
Nature. In the MCPM the couplings of the Higgs bosons to the fermions are
completely fixed. This allows us to present clear predictions for the
production at the LHC and for the decays of the physical Higgs bosons. As
salient feature we find rather large cross sections for Higgs-boson production
via Drell-Yan type processes. In this paper we present a short outline of the
model and extend a former study by the predictions at LHC for a center-of-mass
energy of 7 TeV.
