The apparently inimical relationship between magnetism and superconductivity
has come under increasing scrutiny in a wide range of material classes, where
the free energy landscape conspires to bring them in close proximity to each
other. This is particularly the case when these phases microscopically
interpenetrate, though the manner in which this can be accomplished remains to
be fully comprehended. Here, we present combined measurements of elastic
neutron scattering, magnetotransport, and heat capacity on a prototypical heavy
fermion system, in which antiferromagnetism and superconductivity are observed.
Monitoring the response of these states to the presence of the other, as well
as to external thermal and magnetic perturbations, points to the possibility
that they emerge from different parts of the Fermi surface. This enables a
single 4$f$ state to be both localized and itinerant, thus accounting for the
coexistence of magnetism and superconductivity.
