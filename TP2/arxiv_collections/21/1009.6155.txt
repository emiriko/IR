We study the continuous-variable quantum teleportation of states, statistical
moments of observables, and scale parameters such as squeezing. We investigate
the problem both in ideal and imperfect Vaidman-Braunstein-Kimble protocol
setups. We show how the teleportation fidelity is maximized and the difference
between output and input variances is minimized by using suitably optimized
entangled resources. Specifically, we consider the teleportation of coherent
squeezed states, exploiting squeezed Bell states as entangled resources. This
class of non-Gaussian states includes photon-added and photon-subtracted
squeezed states as special cases. At variance with the case of entangled
Gaussian resources, the use of entangled non-Gaussian squeezed Bell resources
allows for different optimization procedures that lead to inequivalent results.
Performing two independent optimization procedures one can either maximize the
state teleportation fidelity, or minimize the difference between input and
output quadrature variances. The two different procedures are compared
depending on the degrees of displacement and squeezing of the input states and
on the working conditions in ideal and non-ideal setups.
