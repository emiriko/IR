We study limits on a primordial magnetic field arising from cosmological
data, including that from big bang nucleosynthesis, cosmic microwave background
polarization plane Faraday rotation limits, and large-scale structure
formation. We show that the physically-relevant quantity is the value of the
effective magnetic field, and limits on it are independent of how the magnetic
field was generated.
