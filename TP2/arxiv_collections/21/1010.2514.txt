We propose a scheme for the realization of a quantum walker and a quantum
simulator for the Dirac equation with ultracold spinor atoms in driven optical
lattices. A precise control of the dynamics of the atomic matter wave can be
realized using time-dependent external forces. If the force depends on the spin
state of the atoms, the dynamics will entangle the inner and outer degrees of
freedom which offers unique opportunities for quantum information and quantum
simulation. Here, we introduce a method to realize a quantum walker based on
the state-dependent transport of spinor atoms and a coherent driving of the
internal state. In the limit of weak driving the dynamics is equivalent to that
of a Dirac particle in 1+1 dimensions. Thus it becomes possible to simulate
relativistic effects such as Zitterbewegung and Klein tunneling.
