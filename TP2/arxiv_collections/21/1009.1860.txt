We review recent progress in the understanding of low-energy baryon structure
by means of chiral perturbation theory. In particular, we discuss the
application of this formalism to the description of various properties such as
the baryon-octet magnetic moments, the electromagnetic structure of decuplet
resonances and the hyperon vector coupling $f_1(0)$. Moreover, we present the
results on the chiral extrapolation of recent lattice QCD results on the
lowest-lying baryon masses and we predict the corresponding baryonic
sigma-terms.
