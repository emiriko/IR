We examine theoretically the superconducting state of
BaFe$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_x$)$_2$, an isovalent doping 122 iron pnictide
superconductor. We construct a three dimensional ten orbital model from first
principles band calculation, and investigate the superconducting gap within the
spin fluctuation mediated pairing mechanism. The gap is basically $s\pm$, where
the gap changes its sign between electron and hole Fermi surfaces, but three
dimensional nodal structures appear in the largely warped hole Fermi surface
having strong $Z^2/XZ/YZ$ orbital character. The present result, together with
our previous study on 1111 systems, explains the strong material dependence of
the superconducting gap in the iron pnictides.
