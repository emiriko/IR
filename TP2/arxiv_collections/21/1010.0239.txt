We investigate the sensitivity of the composite cellular automaton of H.
Fuk\'{s} [Phys. Rev. E 55, R2081 (1997)] to noise and assess the density
classification performance of the resulting probabilistic cellular automaton
(PCA) numerically. We conclude that the composite PCA performs the density
classification task reliably only up to very small levels of noise. In
particular, it cannot outperform the noisy Gacs-Kurdyumov-Levin automaton, an
imperfect classifier, for any level of noise. While the original composite CA
is nonergodic, analyses of relaxation times indicate that its noisy version is
an ergodic automaton, with the relaxation times decaying algebraically over an
extended range of parameters with an exponent very close (possibly equal) to
the mean-field value.
