The calibration of the Radial Velocity Spectrometer (RVS) onboard the ESA
Gaia satellite (to be launched in 2012) requires a list of standard stars with
a radial velocity (RV) known with an accuracy of at least 300 m/s. The IAU
Commission 30 lists of RV standard stars are too bright and not dense enough.
We describe the selection criteria due to the RVS constraints for building an
adequate full-sky list of at least 1000 RV standards from catalogues already
published in the literature. A preliminary list of 1420 candidate standard
stars is built and its properties are shown. An important re-observation
programme has been set up in order to ensure within it the selection of objects
with a good stability until the end of the Gaia mission (around 2018). The
present list of candidate standards is available at CDS and usable for many
other projects.
