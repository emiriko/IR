We study by Monte Carlo simulations a coarse-grained model of a water layer
confined in a fixed disordered matrix of hydrophobic nanoparticles at different
particle concentrations c. For c=0 (bulk water) we find a first order
liquid-liquid phase transition (LLPT). For c>0 our simulations are consistent
with a LLPT line ending in two critical points at low and high pressure P. For
c=25% we find a dramatic decrease of compressibility K_T, thermal expansion
coefficient \alpha_P, specific heat C_P at high P and low temperature T.
Surprisingly, the effect is present also for c as low as 2.4%. We conclude that
the higher the confinement, the lower the thermodynamic fluctuations and the
more difficult it will be to detect the LLPT.
