We present an analysis of the Lambda(1405) resonance in p+p reactions at a
kinetic beam energy of 3.5 GeV, measured by the High Acceptance Di-Electron
Spectrometer (HADES). The resonance is reconstructed in the two charged decay
channels Sigma^(+/-) pi^(-/+), with help of a kinematic refit, which improves
the mass resolution. The high misidentification of pions and protons as kaons
required the development of a sophisticated sideband analysis, which can
describe the misidentification background quite well.
