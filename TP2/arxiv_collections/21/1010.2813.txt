We propose to shape biphoton wave packets with an electromagnetically induced
grating in a four-level double-$\Lambda$ cold atomic system. We show that the
induced hybrid grating plays an essential role in directing the new fields into
different angular positions, especially to the zeroth-order diffraction. A
number of interesting features appear in the shaped two-photon waveforms. For
example, broadening or narrowing the spectrum would be possible in the proposed
scheme even without the use of a cavity.
