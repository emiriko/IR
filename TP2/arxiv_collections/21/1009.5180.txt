For quantum computation, we investigate the conjecture that the superposition
of macroscopically distinct states is necessary for a large quantum speedup.
Although this conjecture was supported for a circuit-based quantum computer
performing Shor's factoring algorithm [A. Ukena and A. Shimizu, Phys. Rev. A69
(2004) 022301], it needs to be generalized for it to be applicable to a large
class of algorithms and/or other models such as measurement-based quantum
computers. To treat such general cases, we first generalize the indices for the
superposition of macroscopically distinct states. We then generalize the
conjecture, using the generalized indices, in such a way that it is
unambiguously applicable to general models if a quantum algorithm achieves
exponential speedup. On the basis of this generalized conjecture, we further
extend the conjecture to Grover's quantum search algorithm, whose speedup is
large but quadratic. It is shown that this extended conjecture is also correct.
Since Grover's algorithm is a representative algorithm for unstructured
problems, the present result further supports the conjecture.
