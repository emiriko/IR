We study the classical Euclidean wormhole solutions for the gravitational
systems with minimally coupled pure Phantom field and minimally coupled Phantom
field accompanied by perfect fluid. It is shown that such solutions do exist
and then the general forms of the Phantom field potential are obtained for
which there are classical Euclidean wormhole solutions.
