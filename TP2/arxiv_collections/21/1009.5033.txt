We study the local-in-time hydrodynamic limit of the relativistic Boltzmann
equation using a Hilbert expansion. More specifically, we prove the existence
of local solutions to the relativistic Boltzmann equation that are nearby the
local relativistic Maxwellian constructed from a class of solutions to the
relativistic Euler equations that includes a large subclass of near-constant,
non-vacuum fluid states. In particular, for small Knudsen number, these
solutions to the relativistic Boltzmann equation have dynamics that are
effectively captured by corresponding solutions to the relativistic Euler
equations.
