We aim to find similarities and differences between microflares at coronal
bright points found in quiet regions and coronal holes, and to study their
relationship with large scale flares. Coronal bright points in quiet regions
and in coronal holes were observed with Hinode/EIS using the same sequence.
Microflares associated with bright points are identified from the X-ray
lightcurve. The temporal variation of physical properties was traced in the
course of microflares. The lightcurves of microflares indicated an impulsive
peak at hot emission followed by an enhancement at cool emission, which is
compatible with the cooling model of flare loops. The density was found to
increase at the rise of the impulsive peak, supporting chromospheric
evaporation models. A notable difference is found in the surroundings of
microflares; diffuse coronal jets are produced above microflares in coronal
holes while coronal dimmings are formed in quiet regions. The microflares
associated with bright points share common characteristics to active region
flares. The difference in the surroundings of microflares are caused by open
and closed configurations of the pre-existing magnetic field.
