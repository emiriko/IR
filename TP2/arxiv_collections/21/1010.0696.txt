In this paper, a new method of H_infinity observer design for Lipschitz
nonlinear systems is proposed in the form of an LMI optimization problem. The
proposed observer has guaranteed decay rate (exponential convergence) and is
robust against unknown exogenous disturbance. In addition, thanks to the
linearity of the proposed LMIs in the admissible Lipschitz constant, it can be
maximized via LMI optimization. This adds an extra important feature to the
observer, robustness against nonlinear uncertainty. Explicit bound on the
tolerable nonlinear uncertainty is derived. The new LMI formulation also allows
optimizations over the disturbance attenuation level (H_infinity cost). Then,
the admissible Lipschitz constant and the disturbance attenuation level of the
H_infinity filter are simultaneously optimized through LMI multiobjective
optimization.
