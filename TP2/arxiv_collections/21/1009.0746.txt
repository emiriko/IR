We develop the cosmological perturbations formalism in models with a single
non-local scalar field originating from the string field theory description of
the rolling tachyon dynamics. We construct the equation for the energy density
perturbations of the non-local scalar field in the presence of the arbitrary
potential and formulate the local system of equations for perturbations in the
linearized model when both simple and double roots of the characteristic
equation are present. We carry out the general analysis related to the
curvature and entropy perturbations and consider the most specific example of
perturbations when important quantities in the model become complex.
