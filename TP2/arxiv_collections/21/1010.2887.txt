Constraint analysis of the three-dimensional massive gravity, the so- called
new massive gravity, is studied in the Palatini formalism. We show that amongst
6 components of the metric, 2 are dynamical, which is compatible with the
existence of one vector massive graviton in the linearized theory (Fierz-Pauli
theory).
