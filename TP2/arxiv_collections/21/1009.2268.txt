We report on the optical investigation of single electron spins bound to
fluorine donor impurities in ZnSe. Measurements of photon antibunching
establish the presence of single, isolated optical emitters, and
magneto-optical studies are consistent with the presence of an exciton bound to
the spin-impurity complex. The isolation of this single donor-bound exciton
complex and its potential homogeneity offer promising prospects for a scalable
semiconductor qubit with an optical interface.
