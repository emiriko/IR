In this paper we investigate the influence of the substrate material and film
thickness on the Peierls transition temperature in
tetrathiafulvalene-tetracyanoquinodimethane (TTF-TCNQ) thin films, grown by
physical vapor deposition. Our analysis shows that the substrate material and
the growth conditions strongly influence the film morphology. In particular, we
demonstrate that the Peierls transition temperature in thin films is lower than
in TTF-TCNQ single crystals. We argue that this effect arises due to defects,
which emerge in TTF-TCNQ thin films during the growth process.
