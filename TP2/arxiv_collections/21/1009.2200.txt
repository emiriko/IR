In this work we present a reactions module for "Chaos Many-Body Engine"
(Grossu et al., 2010 [1]). Following our goal of creating a customizable,
object oriented code library, the list of all possible reactions, including the
corresponding properties (particle types, probability, cross-section, particles
lifetime etc.), could be supplied as parameter, using a specific XML input
file. Inspired by the Poincare section, we propose also the "Clusterization
map", as a new intuitive analysis method of many-body systems. For
exemplification, we implemented a numerical toy-model for nuclear relativistic
collisions at 4.5 A GeV/c (the SKM200 collaboration). An encouraging agreement
with experimental data was obtained for momentum, energy, rapidity, and angular
{\pi}- distributions.
