The effect of different surface defects on the atomic and electronic
structures of cubic $\beta$-SiC(110) surface are studied by means of a first
principles calculation based on Density Functional Theory using the SIESTA
code. In the calculations, the possibility of different spin population at each
atom is allowed. We find that while adsorption of oxygen or nitrogen and
adsorption of hydrogen at the C surface carbon atoms do not induce magnetic
moments on SiC(110); Si vacancies, substitutional C at the Si site and H or F
adsorbed at the silicon surface sites induce localized magnetic moments as
large as 0.7 $\mu_{B}$ at the carbon atoms close to the defect. The local
magnetic moment arrange ment varies from ferromagnetic in the case of H
adsorption to antiferromagnetic in the Si vacancy and substitutional C cases.
The case of H adsorption at the Si surface atoms is discussed in detail. It is
concluded that magnetism is mainly due to the local character of the C valence
orbitals.
