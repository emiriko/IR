The radial structure of the continuous spectrum of shear Alfven modes is
calculated in the presence of a magnetic island in tokamak plasmas. Modes with
the same helicity of the magnetic island are considered in a slab model
approximation. In this framework, with an appropriate rotation of the
coordinates the problem reduces to 2 dimensions. Geometrical effects due to the
shape of the flux surface's cross section are retained to all orders. On the
other hand, we keep only curvature effects responsible of the beta induced gap
in the low-frequency part of the continuous spectrum. New continuum
accumulation points are found at the O-point of the magnetic island. The
beta-induced Alfven Eigenmodes (BAE) continuum accumulation point is found to
be positioned at the separatrix flux surface. The most remarkable result is the
nonlinear modification of the BAE continuum accumulation point frequency.
