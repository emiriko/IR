We briefly study the dynamics at classical level of the Carrollian limit,
with vanishing speed of light and no possible propagation of signals, for a
simply effective action in a flat space with a open string tachyon as scalar
field. The canonical analysis of the theory indicates that the equation of
motion is of Dirac type contrary to non-relativistic case where the equation is
of Schrodinger type. The ultimate intention is to analize the latter case with
electromagnetic fluxes finding that in this case the open string tachyon cannot
be interpreted as time.
