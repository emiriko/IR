Dakic, Vedral and Brukner [Physical Review Letters \tf{105},190502 (2010)]
gave a geometric measure of quantum discord in a bipartite quantum state as the
distance of the state from the closest classical quantum (or zero discord)
state and derived an explicit formula for a two qubit state. Further, S.Luo and
S.Fu [Physical Review A \tf{82}, 034302 (2010)] obtained a generic form of this
geometric measure for a general bipartite state and established a lower bound.
In this brief report we obtain a rigorous lower bound to the geometric measure
of quantum discord in a general bipartite state which dominates that obtained
by S.Luo and S.Fu.
