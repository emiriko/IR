Unusually bright type IIP supernova (SN) 2009kf is studied employing the
hydrodynamic modelling. We derived optimal values of the ejecta mass of 28.1
Msun, explosion energy of 2.2x10^{52} erg, and presupernova radius of 2x10^3
Rsun assuming that Ni-56 mass is equal to the upper limit of 0.4 Msun. We
analyzed effects of the uncertainties in the extinction and Ni-56 mass and
concluded that both the ejecta mass and explosion energy cannot be
significantly reduced compared with the optimal values. The huge explosion
energy of SN 2009kf indicates that the explosion is caused by the same
mechanism which operates in energetic SNe Ibc (hypernovae), i.e., via a rapid
disk accretion onto black hole. The ejecta mass combined with the black hole
mass and the mass lost by stellar wind yields the progenitor mass of about 36
Msun. We propose a scenario in which massive binary evolution might result in
the SN 2009kf event.
