We prove that sufficiently regular solutions to the wave equation
$\Box_{g_K}\Phi=0$ on the exterior of a sufficiently slowly rotating Kerr black
hole obey the estimates $|\Phi|\leq C (t^*)^{-3/2+\eta}$ on a compact region of
$r$. This is proved with the help of a new vector field commutator that is
analogous to the scaling vector field on Minkowski and Schwarzschild spacetime.
This result improves the known robust decay rates that are proved using the
vector field method in the region of finite $r$ and along the event horizon.
