I present an overview of the Swift mission, which was launched on November
20, 2004 to discover and observe the most energetic of astrophysical phenomena,
gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). After almost 6 years in space the Observatory is in
excellent shape, with all systems and instruments performing nominally and in
burst chasing mode for an average of 97% of the time. Swift is also a
multi-purpose multi-frequency mission with the observing time evolving from
mostly GRB targets, to mainly secondary science ones such as supernovae,
cataclysmic variables and novae, active galactic nuclei, Galactic transients,
active stars and comets. I present the most recent science highlights.
