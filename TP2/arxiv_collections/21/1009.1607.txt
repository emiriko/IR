At LHC energy, heavy quarks will be abundantly produced and the design of the
ALICE Experiment will allow us to study their production using several
channels. We investigate the feasibility of the study of D mesons reconstructed
in their exclusive hadronic decay channel. After reviewing the ALICE potential
for such studies, we will present some results for the two more promising decay
channels i.e D0->KPi and D+ -> K-Pi+Pi+ obtained with 7 TeV pp data and 5.5 A
TeV Pb-Pb Monte Carlo data .
