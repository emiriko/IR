Seventy-eight high-resolution Stokes V, Q and U spectra of the B8Iae
supergiant Rigel were obtained with the ESPaDOnS spectropolarimeter at CFHT and
its clone NARVAL at TBL in the context of the Magnetism in Massive Stars
(MiMeS) Large Program, in order to scrutinize this core-collapse supernova
progenitor for evidence of weak and/or complex magnetic fields. In this paper
we describe the reduction and analysis of the data, the constraints obtained on
any photospheric magnetic field, and the variability of photospheric and wind
lines.
