Generalized entropies and relative entropies are the subject of active
research. Similar to the standard relative entropy, the relative $q$-entropy is
generally unbounded for $q>1$. Upper bounds on the quantum relative $q$-entropy
in terms of norm distances between its arguments are obtained in
finite-dimensional context. These bounds characterize a continuity property in
the sense of Fannes.
