Before binary components interact, they evolve as single stars do. We
therefore first critically discuss massive single star processes which affect
their evolution, stellar wind mass loss and rotation in particular. Next we
consider binary processes and focus on the effect of rotation on binary
evolution and on the mass transfer during Roche lobe overflow. The third part
highlights the importance of close pairs on the comprehension of the evolution
of stellar populations in starburst regions.
