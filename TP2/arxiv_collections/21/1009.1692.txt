When the standard model is viewed as a low energy effective theory, the
neutrinos can obtain mass from higher dimensional operators. It has been known
for long that such an operator first appears at mass dimension five and that it
is unique. Here we show that the effective neutrino mass operator at every
higher dimension is unique. This general claim is established using Young
tableau, and illustrated by exhausting all potentially different operators at
dimension seven. The result is relevant to the search of new physics effects
beyond neutrino mass that can arise at a relatively low energy scale.
