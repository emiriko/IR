A simple description of superfluid hydrodynamics in the inner crust of a
neutron star is given. Particular attention is paid to the effect of the
lattice of nuclei on the properties of the superfluid neutrons, and the effects
of entrainment, the fact that some fraction of the neutrons are locked to the
motion of the protons in nuclei.
