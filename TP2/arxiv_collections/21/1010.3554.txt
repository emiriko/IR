Videos of the molecular dynamics simulations of a colliding hard disk
reactive medium. A simple event-driven algorithm is used to simulate these
colliding hard disks allowing for the study of detonations at the microscopic
level. This video was submitted as party of the Gallery of Fluid Motion for the
American Physical Society 63rd Annual DFD Meeting.
