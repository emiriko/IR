The dual attainment of the Monge--Kantorovich transport problem is analyzed
in a general setting. The spaces $X, Y$ are assumed to be polish and equipped
with Borel probability measures $\mu$ and $\nu$. The transport cost function
$c:\XY \to [0,\infty]$ is assumed to be Borel measurable. We show that a dual
optimizer always exists, provided we interpret it as a projective limit of
certain finitely additive measures. Our methods are functional analytic and
rely on Fenchel's perturbation technique.
