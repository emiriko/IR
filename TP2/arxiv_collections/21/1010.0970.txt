One of the most remarkable examples of emergent quasi-particles, is that of
the "fractionalization" of magnetic dipoles in the low energy configurations of
materials known as "spin ice", into free and unconfined magnetic monopoles
interacting via Coulomb's 1/r law [Castelnovo et. al., Nature, 451, 42-45
(2008)]. Recent experiments have shown that a Coulomb gas of magnetic charges
really does exist at low temperature in these materials and this discovery
provides a new perspective on otherwise largely inaccessible phenomenology. In
this paper, after a review of the different spin ice models, we present
detailed results describing the diffusive dynamics of monopole particles
starting both from the dipolar spin ice model and directly from a Coulomb gas
within the grand canonical ensemble. The diffusive quasi-particle dynamics of
real spin ice materials within "quantum tunneling" regime is modeled with
Metropolis dynamics, with the particles constrained to move along an underlying
network of oriented paths, which are classical analogues of the Dirac strings
connecting pairs of Dirac monopoles.
