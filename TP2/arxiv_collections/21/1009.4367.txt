The high frequency behaviour for random eigenfunctions of the spherical
Laplacian has been recently the object of considerable interest, also because
of strong motivations arising from Physics and Cosmology. In this paper, we are
concerned with the high frequency behaviour of excursion sets; in particular,
we establish a Uniform Central Limit Theorem for the empirical measure, i.e.
the proportion of spherical surface where spherical Gaussian eigenfunctions lie
below a level $z$. Our proofs borrows some techniques from the literature on
stationary long memory processes; in particular, we expand the empirical
measure into Hermite polynomials, and establish a uniform weak reduction
principle, entailing that the asymptotic behaviour is asymptotically dominated
by a single term in the expansion. As a result, we establish a functional
central limit theorem; the limiting process is fully degenerate.
