We use a new configuration-based version of linear response theory to
efficiently solve self-consistent mean field equations relating an effective
single particle potential to the induced density. The versatility and accuracy
of the method is illustrated by applications to dewetting of a hard sphere
solute in a Lennard-Jones fluid, the interplay between local hydrogen bond
structure and electrostatics for water confined between two hydrophobic walls,
and to ion pairing in ionic solutions. Simulation time has been reduced by more
than an order of magnitude over previous methods.
