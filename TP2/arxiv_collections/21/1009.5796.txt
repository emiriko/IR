We study holomorphic automorphisms on compact K\"ahler manifolds having
simple actions on the Hodge cohomology ring. We show for such automorphisms
that the main dynamical Green currents admit complex laminar structures (woven
currents) and the Green measure is the unique invariant probability measure of
maximal entropy.
