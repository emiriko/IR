Stellar physics and evolution calculations enable a broad range of research
in astrophysics. Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) is a
suite of open source libraries for a wide range of applications in
computational stellar astrophysics. A newly designed 1-D stellar evolution
module, MESA star, combines many of the numerical and physics modules for
simulations of a wide range of stellar evolution scenarios ranging from
very-low mass to massive stars, including advanced evolutionary phases. MESA
star solves the fully coupled structure and composition equations
simultaneously. It uses adaptive mesh refinement and sophisticated timestep
controls, and supports shared memory parallelism based on OpenMP. Independently
usable modules provide equation of state, opacity, nuclear reaction rates, and
atmosphere boundary conditions. Each module is constructed as a separate
Fortran 95 library with its own public interface. Examples include comparisons
to other codes and show evolutionary tracks of very low mass stars, brown
dwarfs, and gas giant planets; the complete evolution of a 1 Msun star from the
pre-main sequence to a cooling white dwarf; the Solar sound speed profile; the
evolution of intermediate mass stars through the thermal pulses on the He-shell
burning AGB phase; the interior structure of slowly pulsating B Stars and Beta
Cepheids; evolutionary tracks of massive stars from the pre-main sequence to
the onset of core collapse; stars undergoing Roche lobe overflow; and accretion
onto a neutron star. Instructions for downloading and installing MESA can be
found on the project web site (http://mesa.sourceforge.net/).
