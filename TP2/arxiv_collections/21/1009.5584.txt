We conduct 3D magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulations in order to test the
stability of the magnetic equilibrium configuration described by Duez & Mathis
(2010). This analytically-derived configuration describes the lowest energy
state for a given helicity in a stellar radiation zone. The necessity of taking
into account the non force-free property of the large-scale, global field is
here emphasized. We then show that this configuration is stable. It therefore
provides a useful model to initialize the magnetic topology in upcoming MHD
simulations and stellar evolution codes taking into account magneto-rotational
transport processes.
