We study the problem of tracking an object moving through a network of
wireless sensors. In order to conserve energy, the sensors may be put into a
sleep mode with a timer that determines their sleep duration. It is assumed
that an asleep sensor cannot be communicated with or woken up, and hence the
sleep duration needs to be determined at the time the sensor goes to sleep
based on all the information available to the sensor. Having sleeping sensors
in the network could result in degraded tracking performance, therefore, there
is a tradeoff between energy usage and tracking performance. We design sleeping
policies that attempt to optimize this tradeoff and characterize their
performance. As an extension to our previous work in this area [1], we consider
generalized models for object movement, object sensing, and tracking cost. For
discrete state spaces and continuous Gaussian observations, we derive a lower
bound on the optimal energy-tracking tradeoff. It is shown that in the low
tracking error regime, the generated policies approach the derived lower bound.
