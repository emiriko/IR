We show that technique of Dyson equation in wave multiple scattering by
spatially disordered discrete medium statistical theory leads directly to a
dielectric permittivity tensor, which is characterized by spatial dispersion
and obeys the generalized Lorentz-Lorenz formula. Introduced via this spatial
dispersion an effective magnetic permeability demonstrates the diamagnetic
property in limit of independent strongly reflected non-magnetic small
spherical particles in accordance with earlier intuitive predictions. The
revealed physical nature of the effective diamagnetic property consists in that
electric and magnetic dipoles induced in a particle by wave scattering give
different contribution into the transverse and longitudinal components of the
effective dielectric permittivity. Besides as appeared the diamagnetism under
study is enhanced by appearance of additional effective dielectric displacement
current in the medium.
