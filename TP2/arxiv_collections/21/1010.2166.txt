We propose a quantum tomography protocol to measure single electron coherence
in quantum Hall edge channels and therefore access for the first time the wave
function of single electron excitations propagating in ballistic quantum
conductors. Its implementation would open the way to quantitative studies of
single electron decoherence and would provide a quantitative tool for analyzing
single to few electron sources. We show how this protocol could be implemented
using ultrahigh sensitivity noise measurement schemes.
