The hyperfine structure and isotope shifts of the 3s23p2 3P2 to 3s3p3 3Do3
transition in silicon have been measured. The transition at 221.7 nm was
studied by laser induced fluorescence in an atomic Si beam. For 29Si, the
hyperfine A constant for the 3s23p2 3P2 level was determined to be -160.1+-1.3
MHz (1 sigma error), and the A constant for the 3s3p3 3Do3 level is -532.9+-0.6
MHz. This is the first time that these constants were measured. The isotope
shifts (relative to the abundant isotope 28Si) of the transition were
determined to be 1753.3+-1.1 MHz for 29Si and 3359.9+-0.6 MHz for 30Si. This is
an improvement by about two orders of magnitude over a previous measurement.
From these results we are able to predict the hyperfine structure and isotope
shift of the radioactive 31Si atom, which is of interest in building a scalable
quantum computer.
