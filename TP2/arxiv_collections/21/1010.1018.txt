In this brief report, we consider the equivalence between two sets of $m+1$
bipartite quantum states under local unitary transformations. For pure states,
this problem corresponds to the matrix algebra question of whether two degree
$m$ matrix polynomials are unitarily equivalent; i.e. $UA_iV^\dagger=B_i$ for
$0\leq i\leq m$ where $U$ and $V$ are unitary and $(A_i, B_i)$ are arbitrary
pairs of rectangular matrices. We present a randomized polynomial-time
algorithm that solves this problem with an arbitrarily high success probability
and outputs transforming matrices $U$ and $V$.
