Electrostatic drift instabilities driven by ion and electron temperature
gradients (ITG and ETG instabilities) are considered for the ranges of
perpendicular wave number values from the inverse ion thermal gyroradius up to
the electron thermal gyroradius. The analysis is carried out in the framework
of the local kinetic approach. Scaling laws for instability parameters are
presented. These scaling laws can be used as a basis of collisionless plasma
transport rates in magnetic traps with purely poloidal magnetic field topology.
