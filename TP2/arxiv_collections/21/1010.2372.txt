In this paper, we study the dispersive properties of the wave equation
associated with the shifted Laplace-Beltrami operator on real hyperbolic
spaces, and deduce Strichartz estimates for a large family of admissible pairs.
As an application, we obtain local well-posedness results for the nonlinear
wave equation.
