A zeptosecond multi--MeV laser pulse may either excite a "plasma" of strongly
interacting nucleons or a collective mode. We derive the conditions on laser
energy and photon number such that either of these scenarios is realized. We
use the nuclear Giant Dipole Resonance as a representative example, and a
random--matrix description of the fine--structure states and perturbation
theory as tools.
