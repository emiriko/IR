The Lagrangian velocity statistics of dissipative drift-wave turbulence are
investigated. For large values of the adiabaticity (or small collisionality),
the probability density function of the Lagrangian acceleration shows
exponential tails, as opposed to the stretched exponential or algebraic tails,
generally observed for the highly intermittent acceleration of Navier-Stokes
turbulence. This exponential distribution is shown to be a robust feature
independent of the Reynolds number. For small adiabaticity, algebraic tails are
observed, suggesting the strong influence of point-vortex-like dynamics on the
acceleration. A causal connection is found between the shape of the probability
density function and the autocorrelation of the norm of the acceleration.
