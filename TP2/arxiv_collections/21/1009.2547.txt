Serendipitous stellar occultation search is so far the only way to detect the
existence of very small, very dim, remote objects in the solar system. To date,
however, there are only very few reported detections for trans-Neptunian
objects (TNOs) in optical bands. In the X-ray band, with the RXTE/PCA data of
Sco X-1 taken from June 2007 to October 2009, we found one possible X-ray
occultation event. We discuss the veracity and properties of this event, and
suggest upper limits to the size distribution of TNOs at hectometer size and of
Main-Belt Asteroids (MBAs) at decameter size.
