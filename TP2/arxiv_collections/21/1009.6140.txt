Let $A, B$ be finite subsets of a torsion-free group $G$. We prove that for
every positive integer $k$ there is a $c(k)$ such that if $|B|\ge c(k)$ then
the inequality $|AB|\ge |A|+|B|+k$ holds unless a left translate of $A$ is
contained in a cyclic subgroup. We obtain $c(k)<c_0k^{6}$ for arbitrary
torsion-free groups, and $c(k)<c_0k^{3}$ for groups with the unique product
property, where $c_0$ is an absolute constant. We give examples to show that
$c(k)$ is at least quadratic in $k$.
