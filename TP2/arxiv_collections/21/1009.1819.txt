We experimentally study the detachment of drops of granular suspensions using
a density matched model suspension with varying volume fraction ({\phi} = 15%
to 55%) and grain diameter (d = 20 {\mu}m to 140 {\mu}m). We show that at the
beginning of the detachment process, the suspensions behave as an effective
fluid. The detachment dynamics in this regime can be entirely described by the
shear viscosity of the suspension. At later stages of the detachment the
dynamics become independent of the volume fraction and are found to be
identical to the dynamics of the interstitial fluid. Surprisingly, visual
observation reveals that at this stage particles are still present in the neck.
We suspect rearrangements of particles to locally free the neck of grains,
causing the observed dynamics. Close to the final pinch off, the detachment of
the suspensions is further accelerated, compared to the dynamics of pure
interstitial fluid. This acceleration might be due to the fact that the neck
diameter gets of the order of magnitude of the size of the grains and a
continuous thinning of the liquid thread is not possible any more. The
crossover between the different detachment regimes is function of the grain
size and the initial volume fraction. We characterize the overall acceleration
as a function of the grain size and volume fraction.
