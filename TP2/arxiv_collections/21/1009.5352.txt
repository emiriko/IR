This case study proposes a scenario with three topic-related thesauri, which
have been connected with bilateral cross-concordances as part of a major
terminology mapping initiative in the project KoMoHe (Mayr & Petras, 2008). The
thesauri have already been or will be converted to SKOS and in order to not
omit the relevant crosswalks, the mapping properties of SKOS will be used for
modeling them adequately.
