The diffuse TeV emission detected from the inner $\sim2^\circ$ of the Galaxy
appears to be strongly correlated with the distribution of molecular gas along
the Galactic ridge. Although it is not yet entirely clear whether the origin of
the TeV photons is due to hadronic or leptonic interactions, the tight
correlation of the intensity distribution with the molecular gas strongly
points to a pionic-decay process involving relativistic protons. But the
spectrum of the TeV radiation---a power law with index $\alpha\approx
-2.3$---cannot be accommodated easily with the much steeper distribution of
cosmic rays seen at Earth. In earlier work, we examined the possible sources of
these relativistic protons and concluded that neither the supermassive black
hole Sagittarius A* (identified with the HESS source J1745-290), nor several
pulsar wind nebulae dispersed along the Galactic plane, could produce a TeV
emission profile morphologically similar to that seen by HESS. We concluded
from this earlier study that only relativistic protons accelerated throughout
the inter-cloud medium could account for the observed diffuse TeV emission from
this region. In this paper, we develop a model for diffusive proton
acceleration driven by a turbulent Alfv\'enic magnetic field present throughout
the gaseous medium. Though circumstantial, this appears to be the first
evidence that at least some cosmic rays are accelerated diffusively within the
inner $\sim300$ pc of the Galaxy.
