We investigate the effect of stellar density on the ultraviolet (UV) emission
from M31's globular clusters (GCs). Published far-UV (FUV) and near-UV (NUV)
colours from Galaxy Evolution and Explorer (GALEX) observations are used as a
probe into the temperature of the horizontal branch (HB) stars in these
clusters. From these data, we demonstrate a significant relationship between
the core density of a cluster and its FUV-NUV colour, with dense clusters
having bluer ultraviolet colours. These results are consistent with a
population of (FUV bright) extreme-HB (EHB) stars, the production of which is
related to the stellar density in the clusters. Such a relationship may be
expected if the formation of EHB stars is enhanced in dense clusters due to
dynamical interactions. We also consider the contribution of low mass X-ray
binaries (LMXBs) to the integrated FUV luminosity of a cluster. We note that
two of the three metal rich clusters, identified by Rey et al. 2007 as having a
FUV excess, are known to host LMXBs in outburst. Considering the FUV luminosity
of Galactic LMXBs, we suggest that a single LMXB is unlikely to produce more
than 10% of the observed FUV luminosity of clusters that contain a significant
population of blue-HB stars.
