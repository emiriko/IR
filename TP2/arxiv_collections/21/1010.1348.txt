In this paper, we report our results on charged hadron multiplicities of
heavy quark initiated jets produced in high energy collisions. After
implementing the so-called dead cone effect in QCD evolution equations, we find
that the average multiplicity decreases significantly as compared to the
massless case. Finally, we discuss on the transverse momentum distribution of
light quark initiated jets and emphasize on the comparison between our
predictions and CDF data.
