We study the production of radioisotopes for nuclear medicine in
$(\gamma,x{\rm n}+y{\rm p})$ photonuclear reactions or ($\gamma,\gamma'$)
photoexcitation reactions with high flux [($10^{13}-10^{15}$)$\gamma$/s], small
diameter $\sim (100 \, \mu$m$)^2$ and small band width ($\Delta E/E \approx
10^{-3}-10^{-4}$) $\gamma$ beams produced by Compton back-scattering of laser
light from relativistic brilliant electron beams. We compare them to (ion,$x$n$
+ y$p) reactions with (ion=p,d,$\alpha$) from particle accelerators like
cyclotrons and (n,$\gamma$) or (n,f) reactions from nuclear reactors. For
photonuclear reactions with a narrow $\gamma$ beam the energy deposition in the
target can be managed by using a stack of thin target foils or wires, hence
avoiding direct stopping of the Compton and pair electrons (positrons).
$(\gamma,\gamma')$ isomer production via specially selected $\gamma$ cascades
allows to produce high specific activity in multiple excitations, where no
back-pumping of the isomer to the ground state occurs. We discuss in detail
many specific radioisotopes for diagnostics and therapy applications.
Photonuclear reactions with $\gamma$ beams allow to produce certain
radioisotopes, e.g. $^{47}$Sc, $^{44}$Ti, $^{67}$Cu, $^{103}$Pd, $^{117m}$Sn,
$^{169}$Er, $^{195m}$Pt or $^{225}$Ac, with higher specific activity and/or
more economically than with classical methods. This will open the way for
completely new clinical applications of radioisotopes. For example $^{195m}$Pt
could be used to verify the patient's response to chemotherapy with platinum
compounds before a complete treatment is performed. Also innovative isotopes
like $^{47}$Sc, $^{67}$Cu and $^{225}$Ac could be produced for the first time
in sufficient quantities for large-scale application in targeted radionuclide
therapy.
