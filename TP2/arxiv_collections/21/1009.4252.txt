We propose a high efficiency tomographic scheme to reconstruct an unknown
quantum state of the qubits by using a series of quantum nondemolition (QND)
measurements. The proposed QND measurements of the qubits are implemented by
probing the the stationary transmissions of the dispersively-coupled resonator.
It is shown that only one kind of QND measurements is sufficient to determine
all the diagonal elements of the density matrix of the detected quantum state.
The remaining non-diagonal elements of the density matrix can be determined by
other spectral measurements by beforehand transferring them to the diagonal
locations using a series of unitary operations. Compared with the pervious
tomographic reconstructions based on the usual destructively projective (DP)
measurements (wherein one kind of such measurements could only determine one
diagonal element of the density matrix), the present approach exhibits
significantly high efficiency for N-qubit (N > 1). Specifically, our generic
proposal is demonstrated by the experimental circuit-quantumelectrodynamics
(circuit-QED) systems with a few Josephson charge qubits.
