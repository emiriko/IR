The information-theoretic representation of quantum systems, which
complements the familiar energy description of the density-functional and
wave-function-based theories, is here discussed. According to it, the internal
disorder of the quantum-mechanical non-relativistic systems can be quantified
by various single (Fisher information, Shannon entropy) and composite (e.g.
Cramer-Rao, LMC shape and Fisher-Shannon complexity) functionals of the
Schr\"odinger probability density. First, we examine these concepts and its
application to quantum systems with central potentials. Then, we calculate
these measures for hydrogenic systems, emphasizing their predictive power for
various physical phenomena. Finally, some recent open problems are pointed out.
