Transverse Diffeomorphism (TDiff) theories are well-motivated theories of
gravity from the quantum perspective, which are based upon a gauge symmetry
principle. The main contribution of this work is to firmly establish a
correspondence between TransverseDiff and the better-known scalar-tensor
gravity --- in its more general form ---, a relation which is completely
analogous to that between unimodular gravity and General Relativity. We then
comment on observational aspects of TDiff. In connection with this proof, we
derive a very general rule that determines under what conditions the procedure
of fixing a gauge symmetry can be equivalently applied before the variational
principle leading to the equations of motion, as opposed to the standard
procedure, which takes place afterwards; this rule applies to gauge-fixing
terms without derivatives.
