Many mobile ad hoc network protocols use simple flooding, in order to adapt
to changes in time varying network topology. Most of the times, a network-wide
flood results in redundant packets and increases network congestion,
probability of packet collision, low utilization of available bandwidth, and
most important, higher power consumption. In this paper, we propose a new
cross-layer broadcast scheme to minimize broadcast traffic in mobile ad hoc
networks. Our scheme is based on use of received signal strength indicator,
RSSI, value to reduce the number of broadcast packets. The effectiveness of the
proposed technique is verified using simulations.
