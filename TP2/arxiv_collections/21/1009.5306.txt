The WASP (Wide Angle Search for Planets) project is an exoplanet transit
survey that has been automatically taking wide field images since 2004. Two
instruments, one in La Palma and the other in South Africa, continually monitor
the night sky, building up light curves of millions of unique objects. These
light curves are used to search for the characteristics of exoplanetary
transits. This first public data release (DR1) of the WASP archive makes
available all the light curve data and images from 2004 up to 2008 in both the
Northern and Southern hemispheres. A web interface (www.wasp.le.ac.uk/public/)
to the data allows easy access over the Internet. The data set contains 3 631
972 raw images and 17 970 937 light curves. In total the light curves have 119
930 299 362 data points available between them.
