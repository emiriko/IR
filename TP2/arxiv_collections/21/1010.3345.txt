Several studies have shown recently that at low metallicity B-type stars
rotate faster than in environments of high metallicity. This is a typical case
in the SMC. As a consequence, it is expected that a larger number of fast
rotators is found in the SMC than in the Galaxy, in particular a higher
fraction of Be/Oe stars. Using the ESO-WFI in its slitless mode, the data from
the SMC open clusters were examined and an occurrence of Be stars 3 to 5 times
larger than in the Galaxy was found. The evolution of the angular rotational
velocity at different metallicities seems to be the main key to understand the
specific behavior and evolution of these stars. According to the results from
this WFI study, the observational clues obtained from the SMC WR stars and
massive stars, and the theoretical predictions of the characteristics must have
the long gamma-ray burst progenitors, we have identified the low metallicity
massive Be and Oe stars as potential LGRB progenitors. To this end, the ZAMS
rotational velocities of the SMC Be/Oe stars were determined and compared to
models. The expected rates and the numbers of LGRB were then calculated and
compared to the observed ones. Thus, a high probability was found that low
metallicity Be/Oe stars can be LGRB progenitors. In this document, we describe
the different steps followed in these studies: determination of the number of
Be/Oe stars at different metallicities, identification of the clues that lead
to suppose the low metallicity Be/Oe stars as LGRB progenitors, comparison of
models with observations.
