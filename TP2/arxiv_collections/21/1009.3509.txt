A magnetic field and rotational line profile variability (lpv) is found in
the He-weak star HR2949. The field measured from metallic lines varies in a
clearly non-sinusoidal way, and shows a phase lag relative to the
morphologically similar HeI equivalent width variations. The surface abundance
patterns are strong and complex, and visible even in the hydrogen lines.
