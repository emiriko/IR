The multidimensional gas-kinetic scheme for the Navier-Stokes equations under
gravitational fields [J. Comput. Phys. 226 (2007) 2003-2027] is extended to
resistive magnetic flows. The non-magnetic part of the magnetohydrodynamics
equations is calculated by a BGK solver modified due to magnetic field. The
magnetic part is treated by the flux splitting method based gas-kinetic theory
[J. Comput. Phys. 153 (1999) 334-352 ], using a particle distribution function
constructed in the BGK solver. To include Lorentz force effects into gas
evolution stage is very important to improve the accuracy of the scheme. For
some multidimensional problems, the deviations tangential to the cell interface
from equilibrium distribution are essential to keep the scheme robust and
accurate. Besides implementation of a TVD time discretization scheme, enhancing
the dynamic dissipation a little bit is a simply and efficient way to stabilize
the calculation. One-dimensional and two-dimensional shock waves tests are
calculated to validate this new scheme. A three-dimensional turbulent
magneto-convection simulation is used to show the applicability of current
scheme to complicated astrophysical flows.
