The prompt emissions of gamma-ray bursts are seeded by radiating
ultrarelativistic electrons. Internal shocks propagating through a jet launched
by a stellar implosion, are expected to amplify the magnetic field & accelerate
electrons. We explore the effects of density asymmetry & a quasi-parallel
magnetic field on the collision of plasma clouds. A 2D relativistic PIC
simulation models the collision of two plasma clouds, in the presence of a
quasi-parallel magnetic field. The cloud density ratio is 10. The densities of
ions & electrons & the temperature of 131 keV are equal in each cloud. The mass
ratio is 250. The peak Lorentz factor of the electrons is determined, along
with the orientation & strength of the magnetic field at the cloud collision
boundary. The magnetic field component orthogonal to the initial plasma flow
direction is amplified to values that exceed those expected from shock
compression by over an order of magnitude. The forming shock is
quasi-perpendicular due to this amplification, caused by a current sheet which
develops in response to the differing deflection of the incoming upstream
electrons & ions. The electron deflection implies a charge separation of the
upstream electrons & ions; the resulting electric field drags the electrons
through the magnetic field, whereupon they acquire a relativistic mass
comparable to the ions. We demonstrate how a magnetic field structure
resembling the cross section of a flux tube grows in the current sheet of the
shock transition layer. Plasma filamentation develops, as well as signatures of
orthogonal magnetic field striping. Localized magnetic bubbles form. Energy
equipartition between the ion, electron & magnetic energy is obtained at the
shock transition layer. The electronic radiation can provide a seed photon
population that can be energized by secondary processes (e.g. inverse Compton).
