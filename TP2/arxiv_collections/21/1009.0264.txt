We present a comprehensive galaxy cluster study of XMMU J1230.3+1339 based on
a joint analysis of X-ray data, optical imaging and spectroscopy observations,
weak lensing results, and radio properties for achieving a detailed
multi-component view of this newly discovered system at z=0.975. We find an
optically very rich and massive system with
M200$\simeq$(4.2$\pm$0.8)$\times$10^14 M$\sun$, Tx$\simeq$5.3(+0.7--0.6)keV,
and Lx$\simeq$(6.5$\pm$0.7)$\times$10^44 erg/s, for which various widely used
mass proxies are measured and compared. We have identified multiple
cluster-related components including a central fly-through group close to core
passage with associated marginally extended 1.4GHz radio emission possibly
originating from the turbulent wake region of the merging event. On the cluster
outskirts we see evidence for an on-axis infalling group with a second
Brightest Cluster Galaxy (BCG) and indications for an additional off-axis group
accretion event. We trace two galaxy filaments beyond the nominal cluster
radius and provide a tentative reconstruction of the 3D-accretion geometry of
the system. In terms of total mass, ICM structure, optical richness, and the
presence of two dominant BCG-type galaxies, the newly confirmed cluster XMMU
J1230.3+1339 is likely the progenitor of a system very similar to the local
Coma cluster, differing by 7.6 Gyr of structure evolution.
