The common-envelope (CE) phase is an important stage in the evolution of
binary stellar populations. The most common way to compute the change in
orbital period during a CE is to relate the binding energy of the envelope of
the Roche-lobe filling giant to the change in orbital energy. Especially in
population-synthesis codes, where the evolution of millions of stars must be
computed and detailed evolutionary models are too expensive computationally,
simple approximations are made for the envelope binding energy. In this study,
we present accurate analytic prescriptions based on detailed stellar-evolution
models that provide the envelope binding energy for giants with metallicities
between Z = 10-4 and Z = 0.03 and masses between 0.8 Msun and 100 Msun, as a
function of the metallicity, mass, radius and evolutionary phase of the star.
Our results are also presented in the form of electronic data tables and
Fortran routines that use them. We find that the accuracy of our fits is better
than 15% for 90% of our model data points in all cases, and better than 10% for
90% of our data points in all cases except the asymptotic giant branches for
three of the six metallicities we consider. For very massive stars (M > 50
Msun), when stars lose more than ~20% of their initial mass due to stellar
winds, our fits do not describe the models as accurately. Our results are more
widely applicable - covering wider ranges of metallicity and mass - and are of
higher accuracy than those of previous studies.
