The quality of a liquid-repellent surface is quantified by both the apparent
contact angle $\theta_0$ that a sessile drop adopts on it, and the value of the
liquid pressure threshold the surface can withstand without being impaled by
the liquid, hence keeping a low-friction condition. We designed surfaces
covered with nano-wires obtained by the vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) growth
technique, that are able to repel most of the existing non-polar liquids
including those of very low surface tension, as well as many polar liquids of
moderate to high surface tension. These super-omniphobic surfaces exhibit
apparent contact angles ranging from 125 to 160$^{\circ}$ depending on the
liquid. We tested the robustness of the surfaces against impalement by carrying
out drop impact experiments. Our results show how this robustness depends on
the Young's contact angle $\theta_0$ related to the surface tension of the
liquid, and that the orientational growth of NWs is a favorable factor for
robustness.
