The relation between collective modes and the phase transition in low density
nuclear matter is examined. The dispersion relations for collective modes in a
linear approach are evaluated within a Landau-Fermi liquid scheme by assuming
coexisting phases in thermodynamical equilibrium. Temperature and isospin
composition are taken as relevant parameters. The in-medium nuclear interaction
is taken from a recently proposed density functional model. We found
significative modifications in the energy spectrum, within certain range of
temperatures and isospin asymmetry, due to the separation of matter into
independent phases. We conclude that detailed calculations should not neglect
this effect.
