Several experimental techniques have been introduced in recent years in
attempts to measure spin transfer torque in magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs).
The dependence of spin torque on bias is important for understanding
fundamental spin physics in magnetic devices and for applications. However,
previous techniques have provided only indirect measures of the torque and
their results to date for the bias dependence are qualitatively and
quantitatively inconsistent. Here we demonstrate that spin torque in MTJs can
be measured directly by using time-domain techniques to detect resonant
magnetic precession in response to an oscillating spin torque. The technique is
accurate in the high-bias regime relevant for applications, and because it
detects directly small-angle linear-response magnetic dynamics caused by spin
torque it is relatively immune to artifacts affecting competing techniques. At
high bias we find that the spin torque vector differs markedly from the simple
lowest-order Taylor series approximations commonly assumed.
