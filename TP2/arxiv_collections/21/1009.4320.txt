Although the energetic phenomena of the Sun (flares, coronal mass injections
etc.) exhibit intermittent stochastic behavior in their rate of occurrence,
they are well correlated to the variations of the solar cycle. In this work we
study the spatial and temporal characteristics of transient solar activity in
an attempt to statistically interpret the evolution of these phenomena through
the solar cycle, in terms of the self-organized criticality theory.
