A Large Ion Collider Experiment (ALICE) is the dedicated heavy-ion experiment
at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In addition to its heavy-ion physics
program, it also has a rich proton-proton physics program benefiting from a
detector with a low momentum cut-off (pT about 50 MeV/c) and a small material
budget (about 11% of a radiation length until the outer wall of the main
tracking detector, the Time-Projection Chamber). ALICE has excellent means of
particle identification (PID) with methods ranging from specific energy loss
and time of flight to transition and Cherenkov radiation. The good primary and
secondary vertex resolution allows for measurements of strangeness and heavy
flavor with low backgrounds. ALICE has taken proton-proton collision data at
0.9, 2.36, and 7 TeV. In this article results of the first minimum-bias and
soft-QCD measurements are presented. Inclusive pseudorapidity, multiplicity,
and transverse momentum distributions are discussed as well as distributions of
identified particles including strange particles. Further, results on two-pion
Bose-Einstein correlations and the antiproton-to-proton ratio in collisions at
the LHC are shown.
