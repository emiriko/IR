We present a measurement of the dynamic scalar and tensor polarizabilities of
the excited state 3D1 in atomic ytterbium. The polarizabilities were measured
by analyzing the spectral lineshape of the 408-nm 1S0->3D1 transition driven by
a standing wave of resonant light in the presence of static electric and
magnetic fields. Due to the interaction of atoms with the standing wave, the
lineshape has a characteristic polarizability-dependent distortion. A
theoretical model was used to simulate the lineshape and determine a
combination of the polarizabilities of the ground and excited states by fitting
the model to experimental data. This combination was measured with a 13%
uncertainty, only 3% of which is due to uncertainty in the simulation and
fitting procedure. The scalar and tensor polarizabilities of the state 3D1 were
measured for the first time by comparing two different combinations of
polarizabilities. We show that this technique can be applied to similar atomic
systems.
