Previous works have shown that time asymmetric forcing on the one hand, as
well as non-Gaussian noises on the other, can separately enhance the efficiency
and current of a Brownian motor. Here, we study the result of subjecting a
Brownian motor to both effects simultaneously. Our results have been compared
with those obtained for the Gaussian white noise regime in the adiabatic limit.
We find that, although the inclusion of the time asymmetry parameter increases
the efficiency value up to a certain extent, for the present case this increase
is much less appreciable than in the white noise case. We also present a
comparative study of the transport coherence in the context of colored noise.
Though the efficiency in some cases becomes higher for the non-Gaussian case,
the P\'eclet number is always higher in the Gaussian colored noise case than in
the white noise as well as non-Gaussian colored noise cases.
