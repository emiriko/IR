We report on an investigation of loading characteristics of deep microscopic
dipole traps. The dipole trap is loaded from a low density magneto optical trap
(MOT) containing $\approx 5\times 10^{6}$ atoms. We determine the loading
parameters that maximize the trapped atom number for a trap of waist 5 {\mu}m
with trap depths ranging from 3.5 mK to 10 mK. We determine the optimal trap
loading conditions and the loading rates, loss coefficients and temperature of
the trapped atoms under these conditions. We show that it is possible to load a
few hundred to thousand atoms in dipole traps of depth 3.5 mK to 8.5 mK under
the optimal loading conditions.
