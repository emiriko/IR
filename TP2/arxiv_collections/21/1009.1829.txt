The studies of the diboson production in proton-antiproton collisions at 1.96
TeV performed by CDF and D0 collaborations at the Tevatron collider are
reported in this paper. The diboson events are identified exploiting both
leptonic and semi-leptonic final states. The presented results use different
subsamples of the statistics collected by the Tevatron up to 4.8 1/fb. Measured
production cross sections are in good agreement with Standard Model predictions
and the limits on the anomalous triple gauge boson couplings are competitive
with the ones measured by experiments at the LEP.
