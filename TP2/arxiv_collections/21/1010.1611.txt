Recent theoretical advances applied to metamaterials have opened new avenues
to design a coating that hides objects from electromagnetic radiation and even
the sight. Here, we propose a new design of cloaking devices that creates
perfect invisibility in isotropic media. A combination of positive and negative
refractive indices, called plus-minus construction, is essential to achieve
perfect invisibility (i.e., no time delay and total absence of reflection).
Contrary to the common understanding that between two isotropic materials
having different refractive indices the electromagnetic reflection is
unavoidable, our method shows that surprisingly the reflection phenomena can be
completely eliminated. The invented method, different from the classical
impedance matching, may also find electromagnetic applications outside of
cloaking devices, wherever distortions are present arising from reflections.
