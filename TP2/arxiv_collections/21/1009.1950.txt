The electromagnetic form factors are the most fundamental quantities to
describe the internal structure of the nucleon and the shape of a spatially
extended particle is determined by its {\it intrinsic} quadrupole moment which
is first order moment of the charge density operator. With some experimental
indications of a deformed nucleon, we have calculated the {\it intrinsic}
quadrupole moment of the octet and decuplet baryons in the framework of chiral
constituent quark model \chiCQM which is quite successful in explaining some of
the important baryon properties in the nonperturbative regime.
