In this work a replica exchange Monte Carlo scheme which considers an
extended isobaric-isothermal ensemble with respect to pressure is applied to
study hard spheres (HS). The idea behind the proposal is expanding volume
instead of increasing temperature to let crowded systems characterized by
dominant repulsive interactions to unblock, and so, to produce sampling from
disjoint configurations. The method produces, in a single parallel run, the
complete HS equation of state. Thus, the first order fluid-solid transition is
captured. The obtained results well agree with previous calculations. This
approach seems particularly useful to treat purely entropy-driven systems such
as hard body and non-additive hard mixtures, where temperature plays a trivial
role.
