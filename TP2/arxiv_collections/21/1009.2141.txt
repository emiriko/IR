Two widely proposed kt-dependent gluon distributions in the small-x
saturation regime are investigated using two particle back-to-back correlations
in high energy scattering processes. The Weizsacker-Williams gluon
distribution, interpreted as the number density of gluon inside the nucleus, is
studied in the quark-antiquark jet correlation in deep inelastic scattering. On
the other hand, the unintegrated gluon distribution, defined as the Fourier
transform of the color-dipole cross section, is probed in the direct photon-jet
correlation in pA collisions. Dijet-correlation in pA collisions depends on
both gluon distributions through combination and convolution in the large Nc
limit.
