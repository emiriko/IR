We study in detail the structure of phase space in the neighborhood of stable
periodic orbits in a rotating 3D potential of galactic type. We have used the
color and rotation method to investigate the properties of the invariant tori
in the 4D spaces of section. We compare our results with those of previous
works and we describe the morphology of the rotational, as well as of the tube
tori in the 4D space. We find sticky chaotic orbits in the immediate
neighborhood of sets of invariant tori surrounding 3D stable periodic orbits.
Particularly useful for galactic dynamics is the behavior of chaotic orbits
trapped for long time between 4D invariant tori. We find that they support
during this time the same structure as the quasi-periodic orbits around the
stable periodic orbits, contributing however to a local increase of the
dispersion of velocities. Finally we find that the tube tori do not appear in
the 3D projections of the spaces of section in the axisymmetric Hamiltonian we
examined.
