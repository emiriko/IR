A Transaction database contains a set of transactions along with items and
their associated timestamps. Transitional patterns are the patterns which
specify the dynamic behavior of frequent patterns in a transaction database. To
discover transitional patterns and their significant milestones, first we have
to extract all frequent patterns and their supports using any frequent pattern
generation algorithm. These frequent patterns are used in the generation of
transitional patterns. The existing algorithm (TP-Mine) generates frequent
patterns, some of which cannot be used in generation of transitional patterns.
In this paper, we propose a modification to the existing algorithm, which
prunes the candidate items to be used in the generation of frequent patterns.
This method drastically reduces the number of frequent patterns which are used
in discovering transitional patterns. Extensive simulation test is done to
evaluate the proposed method.
