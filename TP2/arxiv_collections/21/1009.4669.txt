We perform transport measurements in high quality bilayer graphene pnp
junctions with suspended top gates. At a magnetic field B=0, we demonstrate
band gap opening by an applied perpendicular electric field, with an On/Off
ratio up to 20,000 at 260mK. Within the band gap, the conductance decreases
exponentially by 3 orders of magnitude with increasing electric field, and can
be accounted for by variable range hopping with a gate-tunable density of
states, effective mass, and localization length. At large B, we observe quantum
Hall conductance with fractional values, which arise from equilibration of edge
states between differentially-doped regions, and the presence of an insulating
state at filling factor {\nu}=0. Our work underscores the importance of bilayer
graphene for both fundamental interest and technological applications.
