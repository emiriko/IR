We present an algorithm for phylogenetic reconstruction using quartets that
returns the correct topology for $n$ taxa in $O(n \log n)$ time with high
probability, in a probabilistic model where a quartet is not consistent with
the true topology of the tree with constant probability, independent of other
quartets. Our incremental algorithm relies upon a search tree structure for the
phylogeny that is balanced, with high probability, no matter what the true
topology is. Our experimental results show that our method is comparable in
runtime to the fastest heuristics, while still offering consistency guarantees.
