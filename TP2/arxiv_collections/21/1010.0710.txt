Lars Onsager and Bruria Kaufman calculated the partition function of the
Ising model exactly in 1944 and 1949. Since then there have been many
developments in the exact solution of similar, but usually more complicated,
models. Here I shall mention a few, and show how some of the latest work seems
to be returning once again to the properties observed by Onsager and Kaufman.
