We report on the search for anti-neutrinos of yet unknown origin with the
Borexino detector at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso. In particular, a
hypothetical anti-neutrino flux from the Sun is investigated. Anti-neutrinos
are detected through the neutron inverse $\beta$ decay reaction in a large
liquid organic scintillator target. We set a new upper limit for a hypothetical
solar $\bar{\nu}_e$ flux of 760 ${\rm cm}^{-2}{\rm s}^{-1}$, obtained assuming
an undistorted solar $^8$B energy spectrum. This corresponds to a limit on the
transition probability of solar neutrinos to anti-neutrinos of
$1.3\times10^{-4}$ (90\% C.L.) for $E_{\bar{\nu}}>1.8$ MeV, covering the entire
$^{8}$B spectrum. Best differential limits on anti-neutrino fluxes from unknown
sources are also obtained between the detection energy threshold of 1.8 MeV and
17.8 MeV with more than 2 years of data.
