Thermally-driven atmospheric escape evolves from an organized outflow
(hydrodynamic escape) to escape on a molecule by molecules basis (Jeans escape)
with increasing Jeans parameter, the ratio of the gravitational to thermal
energy of molecules in a planet's atmosphere. This transition is described here
using the direct simulation Monte Carlo method for a single component
spherically symmetric atmosphere. When the heating is predominantly below the
lower boundary of the simulation region, R0, and well below the exobase, this
transition is shown to occur over a surprisingly narrow range of Jeans
parameters evaluated at R0: {\lambda}0 ~ 2-3. The Jeans parameter {\lambda}0 ~
2.1 roughly corresponds to the upper limit for isentropic, supersonic outflow
and for {\lambda}0 >3 escape occurs on a molecule by molecule basis. For
{\lambda}0 > ~6, it is shown that the escape rate does not deviate
significantly from the familiar Jeans rate evaluated at the nominal exobase,
contrary to what has been suggested. Scaling by the Jeans parameter and the
Knudsen number, escape calculations for Pluto and an early Earth's atmosphere
are evaluated, and the results presented here can be applied to
thermally-induced escape from a number of solar and extrasolar planetary
bodies.
