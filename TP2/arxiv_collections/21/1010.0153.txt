Recent observations of lepton cosmic rays, coming from the PAMELA and FERMI
experiments, have pushed our understanding of the interstellar medium and
cosmic rays sources to unprecedented levels. The imprint of dark matter on
lepton cosmic rays is the most exciting explanation of both PAMELA's positron
excess and FERMI's total flux of electrons. Alternatively, supernovae are
astrophysical objects with the same potential to explain these observations. In
this work, we present an updated study of the astrophysical sources of lepton
cosmic rays and the possible trace of a dark matter signal on the positron
excess and total flux of electrons.
