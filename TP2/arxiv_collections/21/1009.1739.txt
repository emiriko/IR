It is shown that one can explore the optical conductivity of graphene,
together with the ability of controlling its electronic density by an applied
gate voltage, in order to achieve resonant coupling between an external
electromagnetic radiation and surface plasmon-polaritons in the graphene layer.
This opens the possibility of electrical control of the intensity of light
reflected inside a prism placed on top of the graphene layer, by switching
between the regimes of total reflection and total absorption. The predicted
effect can be used to build graphene-based opto-electronic switches.
