I report the results of Schroedinger functional calculations in the SU(3)
gauge theory with two flavors of color sextet fermions, defined with the
Wilson-clover action using nHYP fat links. While we cannot confirm the infrared
fixed point seen with thin links, we find very slow evolution of the coupling
constant, so slow that extraction of the mass anomalous dimension is
straightforward.
