Final results from the High Resolution Fly's Eye (HiRes) on the observation
of the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin cutoff in the cosmic ray spectrum are presented.
We observe a cutoff consistent with the GZK predictions with a five sigma
significance. The nature of the cosmic ray composition near the GZK cutoff is
also discussed as well as possible correlations of the highest energy cosmic
rays with AGNs and LSS in the Northern sky.
