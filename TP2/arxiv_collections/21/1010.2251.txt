We study the effect of a dot-lead interaction on transport through a quantum
dot hybridized to two semi-infinite Luttinger-liquid leads. A bosonization
approach is applied to treat the interaction between charge fluctuations on the
dot and the dynamically generated image charge in the leads. The nonequilibrium
distribution function of the dot and the tunneling current are computed within
a master-equation approach. The presence of the excitonic dot-lead coupling is
found to enhance transport in the vicinity of the Coulomb-blockade threshold.
This behavior is in contrast to the usual power-law suppression of electronic
tunneling which is found if this interaction is ignored.
