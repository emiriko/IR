We explore the two-dimensional generalized contact process with two absorbing
states by means of large-scale Monte-Carlo simulations. In part of the phase
diagram, an infinitesimal creation rate of active sites between inactive
domains is sufficient to take the system from the inactive phase to the active
phase. The system therefore displays two different nonequilibrium phase
transitions. The critical behavior of the generic transition is compatible with
the generalized voter (GV) universality class, implying that the
symmetry-breaking and absorbing transitions coincide. In contrast, the
transition at zero domain-boundary activation rate is not critical.
