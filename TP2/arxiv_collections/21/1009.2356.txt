It is reported on an analysis of electroproduction of light mesons at small
Bjorken-x within the handbag approach. The partonic subprocesses, meson
electroproduction off quarks or gluons, are calculated within the modified
perturbative approach in which quark transverse momenta are retained. The soft
hadronic matrix elements, generalized parton distributions, are constructed by
means of double distributions. The constraints from parton distributions and
sum rules are taken into account. Various moments of these generalized parton
distributions are compared to recent results from lattice gauge theories.
