We show that the key features of the CMS result on the ridge correlation seen
for high multiplicity events in sqrt(s)=7TeV proton-proton collisions at the
LHC can be understood in the Color Glass Condensate framework of high energy
QCD. The same formalism underlies the explanation of the ridge events seen in
A+A collisions at RHIC, albeit it is likely that flow effects may enhance the
magnitude of the signal in the latter.
