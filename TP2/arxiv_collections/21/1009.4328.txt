A wide variation in the charge transport properties of
poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT-PSS) films is
attributed to the degree of phase-segregation of the excess insulating
polyanion. The results indicate that the charge transport in PEDOT-PSS can vary
from hopping to critical regime of the metal-insulator transition, depending on
the subtle details of morphology. The extent of electrical-connectivity in
films, directly obtained from a temperature dependent high-frequency transport
study, indicates various limiting factors to the transport, which are
correlated with the phase separation process. The low temperature
magnetotransport further supports this morphology-dependent transport scenario.
