We describe a lattice simulation of the masses and decay constants of the
lowest-lying vector and axial resonances, and the electroweak S parameter, in
an SU(3) gauge theory with $N_f = 2$ and 6 fermions in the fundamental
representation. The spectrum becomes more parity doubled and the S parameter
per electroweak doublet decreases when $N_f$ is increased from 2 to 6,
motivating study of these trends as $N_f$ is increased further, toward the
critical value for transition from confinement to infrared conformality.
