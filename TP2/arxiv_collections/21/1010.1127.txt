Mature neutron stars are expected to contain various kinds of superfluids in
their interiors. Modeling such stars requires the knowledge of the mutual
entrainment couplings between the different condensates. We present a unified
equation of state describing the different regions of a neutron star with
superfluid neutrons and superconducting protons in its core.
