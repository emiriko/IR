In a previous article a relationship was established between the linearized
metrics of General Relativity associated with geodesics and the Dirac Equation
of quantum mechanics. In this paper the extension of that result to arbitrary
curves is investigated. The Dirac equation is derived and shown to be related
to the Lie derivative of the momentum along the curve. In addition,the
equations of motion are derived from the Hamilton-Jacobi equation associated
with the metric and the wave equation associated with the Hamiltonian is then
shown not to commute with the Dirac operator. Finally, the Maxwell-Boltzmann
distribution is shown to be a consequence of geodesic motion.
