LUNASKA (Lunar UHE Neutrino Astrophysics with the Square Kilometre Array) is
an ongoing project conducting lunar Cherenkov observations in order to develop
techniques for detecting neutrinos with the next generation of radio
telescopes. Our current observing campaign is with the 64-metre Parkes radio
telescope, using a multibeam receiver with 300 MHz of bandwidth from 1.2-1.5
GHz. Here we provide an overview of the various factors that must be considered
in the signal processing for such an experiment. We also briefly describe the
flux limits which we expect to set with our current observations, including a
directional limit for Centaurus A.
