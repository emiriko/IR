During the course of a large spectroscopic survey of X-ray active late-type
stars in the solar neighbourhood, we discovered four lithium-rich stars packed
within just a few degrees on the sky. These very young stars are projected
several degrees away from the Cepheus-Cassiopea clouds, in front of an area
void of interstellar matter. As such, they are very good "isolated" T Tauri
star candidates. We acquired high-resolution optical spectra as well as
photometric data allowing us to investigate in detail their nature and physical
parameters with the aim of testing the "runaway" and "in-situ" formation
scenarios. We derive accurate radial and rotational velocities and perform an
automatic spectral classification. The spectral subtraction technique is used
to infer chromospheric activity level in the H-alpha line core and clean the
spectra of photospheric lines before measuring the equivalent width of the
lithium absorption line. Both physical (lithium content, magnetic activity) and
kinematical indicators show that all stars are very young (ages in the range
10-30 Myr). In particular, the spectral energy distribution of TYC4496-780-1
displays a strong near- and far-infrared excess, typical of T Tauri stars still
surrounded by an accretion disc. They also share the same Galactic motion,
proving that they form a homogeneous moving group of stars with the same
origin. The most plausible explanation of how these "isolated" T Tauri stars
formed is the "in-situ" model, although accurate distances are needed to
clarify their connection with the Cepheus-Cassiopeia complex.
