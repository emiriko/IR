Gaia will only achieve its unprecedented measurement accuracy requirements
with detailed calibration and correction for radiation damage. We present our
Silvaco 3D engineering software model of the Gaia CCD pixel and two of its
applications for Gaia: (1) physically interpreting supplementary buried channel
(SBC) capacity measurements (pocket-pumping and first pixel response) in terms
of e2v manufacturing doping alignment tolerances; and (2) deriving electron
densities within a charge packet as a function of the number of constituent
electrons and 3D position within the charge packet as input to microscopic
models being developed to simulate radiation damage.
