Bayesian optimization with Gaussian processes has become an increasingly
popular tool in the machine learning community. It is efficient and can be used
when very little is known about the objective function, making it popular in
expensive black-box optimization scenarios. It uses Bayesian methods to sample
the objective efficiently using an acquisition function which incorporates the
model's estimate of the objective and the uncertainty at any given point.
However, there are several different parameterized acquisition functions in the
literature, and it is often unclear which one to use. Instead of using a single
acquisition function, we adopt a portfolio of acquisition functions governed by
an online multi-armed bandit strategy. We propose several portfolio strategies,
the best of which we call GP-Hedge, and show that this method outperforms the
best individual acquisition function. We also provide a theoretical bound on
the algorithm's performance.
