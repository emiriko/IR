We present a comprehensive study of the optical properties of InAs/InP
self-assembled quantum dots (QDs) using an empirical pseudopotential method and
configuration interaction treatment of the many-particle effects. The results
are compared to those of InAs/GaAs QDs. The main results are: (i) The alignment
of emission lines of neutral exciton, charged exciton and biexciton in InAs/InP
QDs is quite different from that in InAs/GaAs QDs. (ii) The hidden correlation
in InAs/InP QDs is 0.7 - 0.9 meV, smaller than that in InAs/GaAs QDs. (iii) The
radiative lifetimes of neutral exciton, charged exciton and biexciton in
InAs/InP QDs are about twice longer than those in InAs/GaAs QDs. (v) The phase
diagrams of few electrons and holes in InAs/InP QDs differ greatly from those
in InAs/GaAs QDs. The filling orders of electrons and holes are shown to obey
the Hund's rule and Aufbau principle, and therefore the photoluminescence
spectra of highly charged excitons are very different from those of InAs/GaAs
QDs.
