Lyman-break galaxies are now regularly found in the high redshift Universe by
searching for the break in the galaxy spectrum caused by the Lyman-limit
redshifted into the optical or even near-IR. At lower redshift, this break is
covered by the GALEX UV channels and small samples of z ~ 1 LBGs have been
presented in the literature. Here we give results from fitting the spectral
energy distributions of a small sub-set of low redshift LBGs and demonstrate
the advantage of including photometric points derived from HST ACS slitless
grism observations. The results show these galaxies to have very young, star
forming populations, while still being massive and dusty. LBGs at low and high
redshift show remarkable similarities in their properties, indicating that the
LBG selection method picks similar galaxies throughout the Universe.
