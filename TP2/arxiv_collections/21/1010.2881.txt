In recent years, extensive research has been conducted in the area of Service
Level Agreement (SLA) for utility computing systems. An SLA is a formal
contract used to guarantee that consumers' service quality expectation can be
achieved. In utility computing systems, the level of customer satisfaction is
crucial, making SLAs significantly important in these environments. Fundamental
issue is the management of SLAs, including SLA autonomy management or trade off
among multiple Quality of Service (QoS) parameters. Many SLA languages and
frameworks have been developed as solutions; however, there is no overall
classification for these extensive works. Therefore, the aim of this chapter is
to present a comprehensive survey of how SLAs are created, managed and used in
utility computing environment. We discuss existing use cases from Grid and
Cloud computing systems to identify the level of SLA realization in
state-of-art systems and emerging challenges for future research.
