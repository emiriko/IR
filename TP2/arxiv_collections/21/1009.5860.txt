Orbital evolution of spherical interplanetary dust particles in the
Edgeworth-Kuiper belt zone is treated for semimajor axes 30-50 AU. Besides
solar gravity, also solar electromagnetic and corpuscular radiation, and, fast
interstellar gas flow are important forces influencing motion of the particles.
The solar electromagnetic radiation is represented by the Poynting-Robertson
effect and the solar corpuscular radiation corresponds to the solar wind.
Time-variability of the non-radial solar wind can significantly increase dust
lifetime in the zone. The average time for the particle stay in the zone is
more than 30-times greater than the conventional case of constant (time
independent) radial solar wind offers, for the particles of tens micrometers in
size. This holds for the most realistic material properties of the particles:
$\bar{Q}'_{pr} =$ 1, where $\bar{Q}'_{pr}$ is the dimensionless efficiency
factor for electromagnetic radiation pressure. If $\bar{Q}'_{pr} =$ 1/2, then
the average time of the particle stay in the zone is only 4-times the
conventional value. The approach used in the paper illustrates the relevance of
the solar wind action in comparison with the Poynting-Robertson effect. The
results have an important consequence for our understanding of the structure of
dust distribution in the Edgeworth-Kuiper belt zone, and, also, of dust belts
in other stellar systems.
