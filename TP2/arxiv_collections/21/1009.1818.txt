We present neutron diffraction measurements on single crystal samples of
non-superconducting Ba(Fe1-xCrx)2As2 as a function of Cr-doping for 0<=x<=0.47.
The average SDW moment is independent of concentration for x<=0.2 and decreases
rapidly for x>=0.3. For concentrations in excess of 30% chromium, we find a new
G-type antiferromagnetic phase which rapidly becomes the dominant magnetic
ground state. Strong magnetism is observed for all concentrations measured and
competition between these ordered states and superconductivity naturally
explains the absence of superconductivity in the Cr-doped materials.
