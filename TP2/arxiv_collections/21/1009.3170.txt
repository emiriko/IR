Stochastic field equations represent a powerful tool to describe the thermal
state of a trapped Bose gas. Often, such approaches are confronted with the old
problem of an ultraviolet catastrophe, which demands a cutoff at high energies.
In [arXiv:0809.1002, Phys. B 42, 081001 (2009)] we introduce a quantum
stochastic field equation, avoiding the cutoff problem through a fully quantum
approach based on the Glauber-Sudarshan P-function. For a close link to actual
experimental setups the theory is formulated for a fixed particle number and
thus based on the canonical ensemble. In this work the derivation and the
non-trivial numerical implementation of the equation is explained in detail. We
present applications for finite Bose gases trapped in a variety of potentials
and show results for ground state occupation numbers and their equilibrium
fluctuations. Moreover, we investigate spatial coherence properties by studying
correlation functions of various orders.
