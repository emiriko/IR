Using Monte Carlo simulations and finite-size scaling analysis, the critical
behavior of self-assembled rigid rods on triangular and honeycomb lattices at
intermediate density has been studied. The system is composed of monomers with
two attractive (sticky) poles that, by decreasing temperature or increasing
density, polymerize reversibly into chains with three allowed directions and,
at the same time, undergo a continuous isotropic-nematic (IN) transition. The
determination of the critical exponents, along with the behavior of Binder
cumulants, indicate that the IN transition belongs to the q=1 Potts
universality class.
