We exploit the angular and quantum correlations in the $D\bar{D}$ pairs
produced through the decay of the $\psi(3770)$ resonance in a charm factory to
investigate CP-violation in two different ways. We consider the case of
$\psi(3770)\rightarrow D\bar{D}\rightarrow (V_1V_2)(K\pi)$ decays, which
provide a new way to measure the strong phase difference $\delta$ between
Cabibbo-favored and doubly-Cabibbo suppressed $D$ decays required in the
determination of the CKM angle $\gamma$. We also build CP-violating observables
in $\psi(3770)\rightarrow D\bar{D}\rightarrow (V_1V_2)(V_3 V_4)$ to isolate
specific new physics effects in the charm sector. Neglecting the systematics,
we give a first rough estimate of the sensitivities of these measurements at
BES-III with an integrated luminosity of 20 fb$^{-1}$ at $\psi(3770)$ peak and
at a future super $\tau$-charm factory with a luminosity of $10^{35}$
cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$
