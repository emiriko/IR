We briefly review the constraints on the search for low mass wimps (< 15 GeV)
and the various experimental methods. These experiments depend on the response
of detectors to low energy signals (less than 15 KeV equivalent energy). We
then describe recent fits to the data and attempt to determine Leff, the energy
response at low energy. We find that the use of a liquid Xenon 2-phase detector
that employs the S_2 data near threshold is the most sensitive current study of
the low mass region. We rely on some talks at Dark Matter 2010.
