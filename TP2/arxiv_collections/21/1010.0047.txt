The Prisoner's Dilemma is a simple model that captures the essential
contradiction between individual rationality and global rationality. Although
the one-shot Prisoner's Dilemma is usually viewed simple, in this paper we will
categorize it into five different types. For the type-4 Prisoner's Dilemma
game, we will propose a self-enforcing algorithmic model to help
non-cooperative agents obtain Pareto-efficient payoffs. The algorithmic model
is based on an algorithm using complex numbers and can work in macro
applications.
