We present a rigorous full quantum mechanical model for the lattice heat
capacity of mesoscopic nanostructures in various dimensions. Model can be
applied to arbitrary nanostructures with known vibrational spectrum in zero,
one, two, or three dimensions. The limiting case of infinitely sized
multi-dimensional materials are also found, which are in agreement with
well-known results. As examples, we obtain the heat capacity of fullerenes.
