The ratio of ion to electron heating due to the dissipation of Alfvenic
turbulence in astrophysical plasmas is calculated based on a cascade model for
turbulence in weakly collisional plasmas. Conditions for validity of this model
are discussed, a prescription for the turbulent heating is presented, and it is
applied to predict turbulent heating in accretion disks and the interstellar
medium.
