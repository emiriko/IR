We study the fast rotating M5 giant EK Boo by means of spectropolarimetry to
obtain direct and simultaneous measurements of both the magnetic field and
activity indicators, in order to infer the origin of the activity in this
fairly evolved giant. We used the new spectropolarimeter NARVAL at the Bernard
Lyot Telescope (Observatoire du Pic du Midi, France) to obtain a series of
Stokes I and Stokes V profiles for EK Boo. Using the Least Square Deconvolution
technique we were able to detect the Zeeman signature of the magnetic field. We
measured its longitudinal component by means of the averaged Stokes V and
Stokes I profiles. The spectra also permitted us to monitor the CaII K&H
chromospheric emission lines, which are well known as indicators of stellar
magnetic activity. From ten observations obtained between April 2008 and March
2009, we deduce that EK Boo has a magnetic field, which varied in the range of
-0.1 to -8 G. We also determined the initial mass and evolutionary stage of EK
Boo, based on up-to-date stellar evolution tracks. The initial mass is in the
range of 2.0-3.6 M_sun, and EK Boo is either on the asymptotic giant branch
(AGB), at the onset of the thermal pulse phase, or at the tip of the first (or
red) giant branch (RGB). The fast rotation and activity of EK Boo might be
explained by angular momentum dredge-up from the interior, or by the merging of
a binary. In addition, we observed eight other M giants, which are known as
X-ray emitters, or to be rotating fast for their class. For one of these, beta
And, presumably also an AGB star, we have a marginal detection of magnetic
field, and a longitudinal component Bl of about 1G was measured. More
observations like this will answer the question whether EK Boo is a special
case, or whether magnetic activity is, rather, more common among M giants than
expected.
