ArgoNeuT, a Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber in the NuMI beamline at
Fermilab, has recently collected thousands of neutrino and anti-neutrino events
between 0.1 and 10 GeV. The experiment will, among other things, measure the
cross section of the neutrino and anti-neutrino Charged Current Quasi-Elastic
interaction and analyze the vertex activity associated with such events. These
topics are discussed along with ArgoNeuT's automated reconstruction software,
currently capable of fully reconstructing the muon and finding the event vertex
in neutrino interactions.
