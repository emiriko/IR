In this work we present an interpretation of experimental O K-edge x-ray
absorption near edge structure (XANES) in perovskite-type WO3 and AWO3
compounds (A = H and Na) using three different first principles approaches: (i)
full-multiple-scattering (FMS) formalism (the real-space FEFF code), (ii)
hybrid density functional theory (DFT) method with partial incorporation of
exact Hartree-Fock exchange using formalism of the linear combination of atomic
orbitals (LCAO) as implemented in the CRYSTAL code; (iii) plane-wave DFT method
using formalism of the projector-augmented waves (PAW) as implemented in the
VASP code.
