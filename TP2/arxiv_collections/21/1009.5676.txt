We present real-space dynamical mean-field theory calculations for
attractively interacting fermions in three-dimensional lattices with elongated
traps. The critical polarization is found to be 0.8, regardless of the trap
elongation. Below the critical polarization, we find unconventional superfluid
structures where the polarized superfluid and
Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov-type states emerge across the entire core
region.
