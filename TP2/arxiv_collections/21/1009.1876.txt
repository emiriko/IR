The "Newtonian" or non-relativistic decomposition of Einstein's gravitational
field is useful in the post-Newtonian approximation. We obtain the full
non-quadratic Einstein-Hilbert action in terms of these fields as well as the
harmonic gauge fixing term and find fairly simple expressions. We discuss
alternatives to the harmonic gauge.
