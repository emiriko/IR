Using kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, we study the effect of oscillatory
kinetics due to surface reconstructions on Ziff-Gulari-Barshad (ZGB) model
discontinuous phase transition. To investigate the transition, we do extensive
finite size scaling analysis. It is found that the discontinuous transition
still exists. On inclusion of desorption in the model, the order-parameter
probability distribution broadens but remains bimodal. That is, the first-order
phase transition becomes weaker with increase in desorption rate.
