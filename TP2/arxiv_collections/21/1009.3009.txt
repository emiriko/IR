The Anti-de Sitter Space/Conformal Field Theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence may
offer new and useful insights into the non-perturbative regime of strongly
coupled gauge theories such as Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). Recently a
modified soft-wall AdS/QCD model incorporated independent sources for explicit
and spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and linear confinement. This model
contains a modified dilaton and higher-order interaction terms in the
Lagrangian. Within this model we explore the radial pseudoscalar mass spectrum
using two different representations of the pion field. We find the mass
eigenvalues associated with each representation, show the equivalence between
the two, and find good agreement with the pion masses. The
Gell-Mann--Oakes--Renner relation is naturally obtained.
