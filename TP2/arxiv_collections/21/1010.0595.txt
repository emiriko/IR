This review deals with strongly disordered topological insulators and covers
some recent applications of a well established analytic theory based on the
methods of Non-Commutative Geometry (NCG) and developed for the Integer Quantum
Hall-Effect. Our main goal is to exemplify how this theory can be used to
define topological invariants in the presence of strong disorder, other than
the Chern number, and to discuss the physical properties protected by these
invariants. Working with two explicit 2-dimensional models, one for a Chern
insulator and one for a Quantum spin-Hall insulator, we first give an in-depth
account of the key bulk properties of these topological insulators in the clean
and disordered regimes. Extensive numerical simulations are employed here. A
brisk but self-contained presentation of the non-commutative theory of the
Chern number is given and a novel numerical technique to evaluate the
non-commutative Chern number is presented. The non-commutative spin-Chern
number is defined and the analytic theory together with the explicit
calculation of the topological invariants in the presence of strong disorder
are used to explain the key bulk properties seen in the numerical experiments
presented in the first part of the review.
