The collapse of a massive star's core, followed by a neutrino-driven,
asymmetric supernova explosion, can naturally lead to pulsar recoils and
neutron star kicks. Here, we present a two-dimensional, radiation-hydrodynamic
simulation in which core collapse leads to significant acceleration of a
fully-formed, nascent neutron star (NS) via an induced, neutrino-driven
explosion. During the explosion, a ~10% anisotropy in the low-mass,
high-velocity ejecta lead to recoil of the high-mass neutron star. At the end
of our simulation, the NS has achieved a velocity of ~150 km s$^{-1}$ and is
accelerating at ~350 km s$^{-2}$, but has yet to reach the ballistic regime.
The recoil is due almost entirely to hydrodynamical processes, with anisotropic
neutrino emission contributing less than 2% to the overall kick magnitude.
Since the observed distribution of neutron star kick velocities peaks at
~300-400 km s$^{-1}$, recoil due to anisotropic core-collapse supernovae
provides a natural, non-exotic mechanism with which to obtain neutron star
kicks.
