Using a new brand of commercially available carbon resistor we built a
cryogenic thermometer with an extremely good thermal contact to its thermal
environment. Because of its superior thermal contact the thermometer is
insensitive to low levels of spurious radio frequency heating. We calibrated
our thermometer down to 5mK using a quartz tuning fork He-3 viscometer and
measured its thermal resistance and thermal response time.
