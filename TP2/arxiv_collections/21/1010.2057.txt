We introduce the the Triangular Ring (TR) resonator. We show that the
difference between the clockwise and anti-clockwise resonant frequencies of a
vacuum TR resonator is sensitive to the birefringence parity-odd parameters of
the photon's sector of the minimal Standard Model Extension (mSME): the
Standard Model plus all the perturbative parameters encoding the break the
Lorentz symmetry. We report that utilizing the current technology allows for
direct measurement of these parameters with a sensitivity of the parity even
ones and improves the best current resonator bounds by couple of orders of
magnitudes.
  We note that designing an optical table that rotates perpendicular to the
gravitational equipotential surface (geoid) allows for direct measurement of
the constancy of the light speed at the vicinity of the earth in all directions
in particular perpendicular to the geoid. If this table could achieve the
precision of the ordinary tables, then it would improve the GPS bounds on the
constancy of the light speed perpendicular to geoid by about eight orders of
magnitude.
