Dynamical networks with time delays can pose a considerable challenge for
mathematical analysis. Here, we extend the approach of generalized modeling to
investigate the stability of large networks of delay-coupled delay oscillators.
When the local dynamical stability of the network is plotted as a function of
the two delays then a pattern of tongues is revealed. Exploiting a link between
structure and dynamics, we identify conditions under which perturbations of the
topology have a strong impact on the stability. If these critical regions are
avoided the local stability of large random networks can be well approximated
analytically.
