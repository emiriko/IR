We consider the geometrical addition law on the elliptic curve in Tate
coordinates. It corresponds to the general formal group law over the ring of
polynomials with integer coefficients of the parametra of the curve. We study
the structure of this law and the differential equation that determines its
exponent. We describe a 5-parametric family of Hirzebruch genera with integer
values on stably complex manifolds. We introduce the general Krichever genus,
which is given by a generalized Baker-Akhiezer function. This function has many
of the fundamental properties of the Baker-Akhiezer function, but unlike it, it
is not meromorphic, because it can have two branch points in the parallelogram
of periods.
