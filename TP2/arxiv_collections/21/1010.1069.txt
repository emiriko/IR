We consider cooperative spectrum sensing for cognitive radios. We develop an
energy efficient detector with low detection delay using sequential hypothesis
testing. Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT) is used at both the local
nodes and the fusion center. We also analyse the performance of this algorithm
and compare with the simulations. Modelling uncertainties in the distribution
parameters are considered. Slow fading with and without perfect channel state
information at the cognitive radios is taken into account.
