Light trapping for solar cells can reduce production cost and improve energy
conversion efficiency. Understanding some of the basic theoretical constraints
on light trapping is therefore of fundamental importance. Here, we develop a
general angular constraint on the absorption enhancement in light trapping. We
show that there is an upper limit for the angular integration of absorption
enhancement factors. This limit is determined by the number of accessible
resonances supported by an absorber.
