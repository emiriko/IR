We describe a new, microscopic model for diffusion that captures diffusion
induced fluctuations at scales where the concept of concentration gives way to
discrete particles. We show that in the limit as the number of particles $N \to
\infty$, our model is equivalent to the classical stochastic diffusion equation
(SDE). We test our new model and the SDE against Langevin dynamics in numerical
simulations, and show that our model successfully reproduces the correct
ensemble statistics, while the classical model fails.
