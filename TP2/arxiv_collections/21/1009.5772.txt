An experiment that confirms the Fresnel drag formalism in RF coaxial cables
is reported. The Fresnel `drag' in bulk dielectrics and in optical fibers has
previously been well established. An explanation for this formalism is given,
and it is shown that there is no actual drag phenomenon, rather that the
Fresnel drag effect is merely the consequence of a simplified description of EM
scattering within a dielectric in motion wrt the dynamical 3-space. The Fresnel
drag effect plays a critical role in the design of various light-speed
anisotropy detectors.
