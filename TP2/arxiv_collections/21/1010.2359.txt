The one-dimensional effective-mass Klein-Gordon equation for the real, and
non-\textrm{PT}-symmetric/non-Hermitian generalized Morse potential is solved
by taking a series expansion for the wave function. The energy eigenvalues, and
the corresponding eigenfunctions are obtained. They are also calculated for the
constant mass case.
