The COMPASS experiment at CERN is well designed for light-hadron spectroscopy
with emphasis on the detection of new states, in particular the search for
$J^{PC}$-exotic states and glueballs. We have collected data with 190 GeV/c
charged hadron beams on a liquid hydrogen and nuclear targets in 2008/09. The
spectrometer features good coverage by electromagnetic calorimetry and a RICH
detector further provides $\pi$ / $K$ separation, allowing for studying final
states involving neutral particles like $\pi^0$ or $\eta$ as well as hidden
strangeness, respectively. We discuss the status of ongoing analyses with
specific focus on diffractively produced $(\pi^0\pi^0\pi)^{-}$ as well as
$(K\bar{K}\pi)^{-}$ final states.
