Mobile ad-hoc network (MANET) is infrastructureless, self-organizable, multi
hop packet switched network. A number of routing protocols for MANETs have been
proposed in recent years. Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) protocol is one of the
most popular routing protocol for ad hoc networks. This paper presents a novel
method to enhance route maintenance part of DSR protocol. Our proposed route
maintenance significantly increases the efficiency of the protocol at the time
of route failures.
