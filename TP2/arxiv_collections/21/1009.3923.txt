We developed two-step solution-phase reactions to form hybrid materials of
Mn3O4 nanoparticles on reduced graphene oxide (RGO) sheets for lithium ion
battery applications. Mn3O4 nanoparticles grown selectively on RGO sheets over
free particle growth in solution allowed for the electrically insulating Mn3O4
nanoparticles wired up to a current collector through the underlying conducting
graphene network. The Mn3O4 nanoparticles formed on RGO show a high specific
capacity up to ~900mAh/g near its theoretical capacity with good rate
capability and cycling stability, owing to the intimate interactions between
the graphene substrates and the Mn3O4 nanoparticles grown atop. The Mn3O4/RGO
hybrid could be a promising candidate material for high-capacity, low-cost, and
environmentally friendly anode for lithium ion batteries. Our
growth-on-graphene approach should offer a new technique for design and
synthesis of battery electrodes based on highly insulating materials.
