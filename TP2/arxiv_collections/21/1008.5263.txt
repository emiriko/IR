The problems associated with practical implementation of the scheme proposed
for preparation of arbitrary states of polarization ququarts based on biphotons
are discussed. The influence of frequency dispersion effects are considered,
and the necessity of group velocities dispersion compensation in the frequency
non-degenerate case even for continuous pumping is demonstrated. A method for
this compensation is proposed and implemented experimentally. Physical
restrictions on the quality of prepared two-photon states are revealed.
