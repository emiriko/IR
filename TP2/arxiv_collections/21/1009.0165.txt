Defects in tight-binding lattices generally destroy the onset of Bloch
oscillations (BOs) and the periodic self-imaging of the wave packet due to the
lack of an equally-spaced Wannier-Stark ladder spectrum. Here it is shown that
localized and extended defects in the lattice can be engineered to be
transparent for BOs. Such lattices are synthesized from the defect-free lattice
by the technique of intertwining operators generally employed in supersymmetric
quantum mechanics. The energy spectrum of the synthesized lattices differs from
the Wannier-Stark ladder of the defect-free lattice because of the missing of
pairs of resonances in the ladder, thus ensuring the persistence of BOs.
