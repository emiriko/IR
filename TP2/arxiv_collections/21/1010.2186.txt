This paper studies the opinion dynamics model recently introduced by
Hegselmann and Krause: each agent in a group maintains a real number describing
its opinion; and each agent updates its opinion by averaging all other opinions
that are within some given confidence range. The confidence ranges are distinct
for each agent. This heterogeneity and state-dependent topology leads to
poorly-understood complex dynamic behavior. We classify the agents via their
interconnection topology and, accordingly, compute the equilibria of the
system. We conjecture that any trajectory of this model eventually converges to
a steady state under fixed topology. To establish this conjecture, we derive
two novel sufficient conditions: both conditions guarantee convergence and
constant topology for infinite time, while one condition also guarantees
monotonicity of the convergence. In the evolution under fixed topology for
infinite time, we define leader groups that determine the followers' rate and
direction of convergence.
