We now know firmly that neutrinos have tiny masses, but in the minimal
Standard Model there is no natural sources for such tiny masses. On the other
hand, the extra heavy Z^{\prime 0} requires the extra Higgs field, the particle
generating the mass. Here I propose that the previous 2+2 Higgs scenario could
be a natural framework for mass generations for both the neutrinos and the
extra Z^{\prime)}. These particles are classified as the "dark matter".
Hopefully all the couplings to the "visible" matter are through the neutrinos
and the extra Z^{\prime 0}, explaining naturally why the dark matter is so dark
to see.
