In this paper, by using the holographic principle, a modified equipartition
theorem where we assume that below a critical temperature the energy is not
equally divided on all bits, and the Unruh temperature, we derive MOND theory
and a modified Friedmann equation compatible with MOND theory. Furthermore, we
rederive a modified Newton's law of gravitation by employing an adequate
redefinition of the numbers of bits.
