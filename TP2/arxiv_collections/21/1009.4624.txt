By reversing the Schottky barrier-height asymmetry in hot-electron
semiconductor-metal-semiconductor ballistic spin filtering spin detectors, we
have achieved: 1. Demonstration of >50% spin polarization in silicon, resulting
from elimination of the ferromagnet/silicon interface on the transport channel
detector contact, and 2. Evidence of spin transport at temperatures as high as
260K, enabled by an increase of detector Schottky barrier height.
