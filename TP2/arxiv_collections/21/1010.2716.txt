We have studied unbarred S0 galaxies, NGC 3599 and NGC 3626, the members of
the X-ray bright group Leo II, by means of 3D spectroscopy, long-slit
spectroscopy, and imaging, with the aim to identify epoch and mechanismsof
their transformation from spirals. Both galaxies have appeared to bear a
complex of features resulting obviously from minor merging: decoupled gas
kinematics, nuclear starforming rings, and multi-tiered oval large-scale
stellar disks. The weak-emission line nucleus of NGC 3599 bears all signs of
the Seyfert activity, according to the line-ratio diagnostics of the gas
excitation mechanism. After all, we conclude that the transformation of these
lenticular galaxies has had place about 1-2 Gyr ago, through the gravitational
mechanisms not related to hot intragroup medium of Leo II.
