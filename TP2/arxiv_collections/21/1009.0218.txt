We investigate potential constraints from cosmic shear on the dark matter
particle mass, assuming all dark matter is made up of light thermal relic
particles. Given the theoretical uncertainties involved in making cosmological
predictions in such warm dark matter scenarios we use analytical fits to linear
warm dark matter power spectra and compare (i) the halo model using a mass
function evaluated from these linear power spectra and (ii) an analytical fit
to the non-linear evolution of the linear power spectra. We optimistically
ignore the competing effect of baryons for this work. We find approach (ii) to
be conservative compared to approach (i). We evaluate cosmological constraints
using these methods, marginalising over four other cosmological parameters.
Using the more conservative method we find that a Euclid-like weak lensing
survey together with constraints from the Planck cosmic microwave background
mission primary anisotropies could achieve a lower limit on the particle mass
of 2.5 keV.
