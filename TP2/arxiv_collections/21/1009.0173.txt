A measurement is presented of the flux ratio of positive and negative muons
from cosmic ray interactions in the atmosphere, using data collected by the CMS
detector at ground level and in the underground experimental cavern. The
excellent performance of the CMS detector allowed detection of muons in the
momentum range from 5GeV/c to 1TeV/c. For muon momenta below 100GeV/c the flux
ratio is measured to be a constant 1.2766 +/-0.0032(stat.) +/-0.0032(syst.),
the most precise measurement to date. At higher momenta an increase in the
charge ratio is observed, in agreement with models of muon production in cosmic
ray showers and compatible with previous measurements by deep underground
experiments.
