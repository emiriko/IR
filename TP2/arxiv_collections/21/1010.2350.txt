Monte-Carlo simulations for a resonance scan of the charmonium-like state
X(3872) at Panda are performed. Final state radiation hadronic background
reactions are taken into account. The signal reconstruction uses a realistic
pattern recognition (track finder and track fitter) and electron/pion
discrimination.
