Recent finding of an {\it unusual} in-plane resistivity anisotropy in the
underdoped 122-family at high temperature ($T$) suggests an orbital nematic
(ON) order, posing a challenge to extant theories. The {\it sign} of the
anisotropy contradicts expectations from weakly correlated as well as pure
spin-only nematic views. Here, we show how such an ON order with accompanying
structural distortion arises from {\it residual}, intersite and inter-orbital
two-body interactions in an incoherent "bad metal" close to Mottness.
Enhancement of orbital-selective incoherence is shown to be necessary for
understanding transport anisotropy. Our results suggest that ON order, with
subsequent antiferromagnetic order might be the {\it primary} competitor to
superconductivity in Fe arsenides.
