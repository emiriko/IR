In a comment on arXiv:1006.5070v1, Drechsler et al. present new
band-structure calculations suggesting that the frustrated ferromagnetic
spin-1/2 chain LiCuVO4 should be described by a strong rather than weak
ferromagnetic nearest-neighbor interaction, in contradiction with their
previous calculations. In our reply, we show that their new results are at odds
with the observed magnetic structure, that their analysis of the static
susceptibility neglects important contributions, and that their criticism of
the spin-wave analysis of the bound-state dispersion is unfounded. We further
show that their new exact diagonalization results reinforce our conclusion on
the existence of a four-spinon continuum in LiCuVO4, see Enderle et al., Phys.
