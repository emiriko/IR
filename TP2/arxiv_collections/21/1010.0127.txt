The crystallization of a metastable melt is one of the most important non
equilibrium phenomena in condensed matter physics, and hard sphere colloidal
model systems have been used for several decades to investigate this process by
experimental observation and computer simulation. Nevertheless, there is still
an unexplained discrepancy between simulation data and experimental nucleation
rate densities. In this paper we examine the nucleation process in hard spheres
using molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulation. We show that the
crystallization process is mediated by precursors of low orientational
bond-order and that our simulation data fairly match the experimental data
sets.
