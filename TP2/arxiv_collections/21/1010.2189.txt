Motivated by the relationship between symplectic fibrations and classical
Yang-Mills theories, we study the closeness of a $n$-form (n=2,3) defined on
the total space of a fibration as a simple model for an abstract field theory.
We introduce 2-plectic fibrations and interpret geometrically the corresponding
equations for coupling in terms of higher analogues of connections.
