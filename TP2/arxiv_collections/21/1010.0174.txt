The Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) collaboration recently released the
updated results of the measurement of the cosmic ray electron (CRE) spectrum
and published its first constraints on the CRE anisotropy. With respect to the
previous Fermi-LAT results, the CRE spectrum measurement was extended down from
20 to 7 GeV, thus providing a better lever arm to discriminate theoretical
models. Here we show that the new data strengthen the evidence for the presence
of two distinct electron and positron spectral components. Furthermore, we show
that under such hypothesis most relevant CRE and positron data sets are
remarkably well reproduced. Consistent fits of cosmic-ray nuclei and antiproton
data, which are crucial to validate the adopted propagation setup(s) and to fix
the solar modulation potential, are obtained for the Kraichnan and
plain-diffusion propagation setups, while the Kolmogorov one is disfavored. We
then confirm that nearby pulsars are viable source candidates of the required
$e^\pm$ extra-component. In that case, we show that the predicted CRE
anisotropy is compatible with Fermi-LAT constraints and that a positive
detection should be at hand of that observatory. Models assuming that only
nearby supernova remnants contribute to the high energy tail of the observed
CRE spectrum are in contrast with anisotropy limits.
