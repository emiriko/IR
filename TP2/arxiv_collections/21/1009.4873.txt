We study the relation between the X-ray luminosity of compact sources and the
SFR of the host galaxy. Our sample includes 38 galaxies for which a uniform set
of X-ray, infra-red and ultraviolet data from Chandra, Spitzer and GALEX has
been collected. Our primary goals are (i) to obtain a more accurate calibration
of the Lx-SFR relation and (ii) to understand the origin of the dispersion in
the Lx-SFR relation observed in previous studies. Preliminary results of this
project are reported below.
