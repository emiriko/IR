We performed optical spectroscopy measurement on single crystal of CeTe$_3$,
a rare-earth element tri-telluride charge density wave (CDW) compound. The
optical spectra are found to display very strong temperature dependence.
Besides a large and pronounced CDW energy gap being present already at room
temperature as observed in earlier studies, the present measurement revealed
the formation of another energy gap at smaller energy scale at low temperature.
The second CDW gap removes the electrons near E$_F$ which undergo stronger
scattering. The study yields evidence for the presence of multiple CDW orders
or strong fluctuations in the light rare-earth element tri-telluride.
