We introduce the notion of Lombardi graph drawings, named after the American
abstract artist Mark Lombardi. In these drawings, edges are represented as
circular arcs rather than as line segments or polylines, and the vertices have
perfect angular resolution: the edges are equally spaced around each vertex. We
describe algorithms for finding Lombardi drawings of regular graphs, graphs of
bounded degeneracy, and certain families of planar graphs.
