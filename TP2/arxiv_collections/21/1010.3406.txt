Both discrete flavour symmetries and Grand Unified symmetries explain
apparent structures in the mass sector of the Standard Model. A model that
combines both symmetries is therefore very appealing. We construct a model with
the $S_4$ flavour symmetry and the Pati-Salam unification. We show that this
model can indeed explain many observable relations between the masses of the
quarks and leptons and that it is predictive in the neutrino sector. However,
the combination of the two symmetries leads to new complications in the Higgs
sector and in the running of the renormalisation group equations.
