A new method to constrain the local non-linear coupling parameter fNL based
on a fast wavelet decomposition is presented. Using a multiresolution wavelet
adapted to the HEALPix pixelization, we have developed a method that is 10^2
times faster than previous estimators based on isotropic wavelets and 10^3
faster than the KSW bispectrum estimator, at the resolution of the Wilkinson
Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) data. The method has been applied to the WMAP
7-yr V+W combined map, imposing constraints on fNL of -69 < fNL < 65 at the 95
per cent CL. This result has been obtained after correcting for the
contribution of the residual point sources which has been estimated to be fNL =
7 +/- 6. In addition, a Gaussianity analysis of the data has been carried out
using the third order moments of the wavelet coefficients, finding consistency
with Gaussianity. Although the constrainsts imposed on fNL are less stringent
than those found with optimal estimators, we believe that a very fast method,
as the one proposed in this work, can be very useful, especially bearing in
mind the large amount of data that will be provided by future experiments, such
as the Planck satellite. Moreover, the localisation of wavelets allows one to
carry out analyses on different regions of the sky. As an application, we have
separately analysed the two hemispheres defined by the dipolar modulation
proposed by Hoftuft et al. (2009). We do not find any significant asymmetry
regarding the estimated value of fNL in those hemispheres.
