we assessed Wong's formula for its angular momentum $\ell$-summation and
"barrier modification" effects at sub-barrier energies in the dominant
fusion-evaporation and capture (equivalently, quasi-fission) reaction
cross-sections. For use of the multipole deformations (up to $\beta_4$) and
(in-plane, $\Phi$=0$^0$) orientations-dependent proximity potential in
fusion-evaporation cross-sections of $^{58}$Ni+$^{58}$Ni, $^{64}$Ni+$^{64}$Ni
and $^{100}$Mo, known for fusion hindrance phenomenon in coupled-channels
calculations, and the capture cross-sections of $^{48}$Ca+$^{238}$U, $^{244}$Pu
and $^{248}$Cm reactions, forming superheavy nuclei, though the simple $\ell$=0
barrier-based Wong formula is found inadequate, its extended version, the
$\ell$-summed Wong expression fits very well the above noted capture
cross-sections at all center-of-mass energies $E_{c.m.}$'s, but require
(additional) modifications of the barriers to fit the fusion-evaporation
cross-sections in the Ni-based reactions at below-barrier energies. Some
barrier modification effects are shown \cite{kumar09} to be already present in
Wong expression due to its inbuilt $\ell$-dependence via $\ell$-summation.
