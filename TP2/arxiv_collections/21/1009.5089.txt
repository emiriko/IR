Spin pumping is a mechanism that generates spin currents from ferromagnetic
resonance (FMR) over macroscopic interfacial areas, thereby enabling sensitive
detection of the inverse spin Hall effect that transforms spin into charge
currents in non-magnetic conductors. Here we study the spin-pumping-induced
voltages due to the inverse spin Hall effect in permalloy/normal metal bilayers
integrated into coplanar waveguides for different normal metals and as a
function of angle of the applied magnetic field direction, as well as microwave
frequency and power. We find good agreement between experimental data and a
theoretical model that includes contributions from anisotropic
magnetoresistance (AMR) and inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE). The analysis
provides consistent results over a wide range of experimental conditions as
long as the precise magnetization trajectory is taken into account. The spin
Hall angles for Pt, Pd, Au and Mo were determined with high precision to be
$0.013\pm0.002$, $0.0064\pm0.001$, $0.0035\pm0.0003$ and $-0.0005\pm0.0001$,
respectively.
