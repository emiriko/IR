We present and experimental and theoretical study of nonlinear
magneto-optical resonances observed in the fluorescence to the ground state
from the 7P_{3/2} state of cesium, which was populated directly by laser
radiation at 455 nm, and from the 6P_{1/2} and 6P_{3/2} states, which were
populated via cascade transitions that started from the 7P_{3/2} state and
passed through various intermediate states. The laser-induced fluorescence
(LIF) was observed as the magnetic field was scanned through zero. Signals were
recorded for the two orthogonal, linearly polarized components of the LIF. We
compared the measured signals with the results of calculations from a model
that was based on the optical Bloch equations and averaged over the Doppler
profile. This model was adapted from a model that had been developed for D_1
and D_2 excitation of alkali metal atoms. The calculations agree quite well
with the measurements, especially when taking into account the fact that some
experimental parameters were only estimated in the model.
