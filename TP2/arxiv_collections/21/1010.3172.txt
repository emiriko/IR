Deflection of ultra high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) by the Galactic magnetic
field (GMF) may be sufficiently strong to hinder identification of the UHECR
source distribution. A common method for determining the effect of GMF models
on source identification efforts is backtracking cosmic rays. We present the
public numerical tool CRT for propagating charged particles through Galactic
magnetic field models by numerically integrating the relativistic equation of
motion. It is capable of both forward- and back-tracking particles with varying
compositions through pre-defined and custom user-created magnetic fields. These
particles are injected from various types of sources specified and distributed
according to the user. Here, we present a description of some source and
magnetic field model implementations, as well as validation of the integration
routines.
