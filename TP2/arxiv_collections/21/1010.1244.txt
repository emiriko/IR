Schwinger-Dyson equations are used to study spontaneous chiral and parity
symmetry breaking of three dimensional quantum electrodynamics with
two-component fermions. This theory admits a topological photon mass that
explicitly breaks parity symmetry and generates a fermion mass. We show that
the pattern of symmetry breaking maintains parity but breaks chiral symmetry.
We also find that chiral symmetry is restored at a critical number of fermion
flavours in our truncation scheme. The Coleman-Hill theorem is used to
demonstrate that the results are reasonably accurate.
