We compute the quantum isometry group of the finite noncommutative geometry F
describing the internal degrees of freedom in the Standard Model of particle
physics. We show that this provides genuine quantum symmetries of the spectral
triple corresponding to M x F where M is a compact spin manifold. We also prove
that the bosonic and fermionic part of the spectral action are preserved by
these symmetries.
