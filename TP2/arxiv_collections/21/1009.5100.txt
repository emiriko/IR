Loop quantum gravity has provided us with a canonical framework especially
devised for background independent and diffeomorphism invariant gauge field
theories. In this quantization the fundamental excitations are called spin
network states, and in the context of general relativity, they give a meaning
to quantum geometry. Spin foams are a sort of path integral for spin network
states, supposed to enable the computations of transition amplitudes between
these states. The spin foam quantization has proved very efficient for
topological field theories, like 2d Yang-Mills, 3d gravity or BF theories.
Different models have also been proposed for 4-dimensional quantum gravity. In
this PhD manuscript, I discuss several methods to study spin foam models. In
particular, I present some recurrence relations on spin foam amplitudes, which
generically encode classical symmetries at the quantum level, and are likely to
help fill the gap with the Hamiltonian constraints. These relations can be
naturally interpreted in terms of elementary deformations of discrete geometric
structures, like simplicial geometries. Another interesting method consists in
exploring the way spin foam models can be written as path integrals for systems
of geometries on a lattice, taking inspiration from topological models and
Regge calculus. This leads to a very geometric view on spin foams, and gives
classical action principles which are studied in details.
