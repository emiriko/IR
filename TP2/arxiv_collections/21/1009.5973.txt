The purpose of this paper is to construct the early exercise boundary for a
class of nonlinear Black--Scholes equations with a nonlinear volatility
depending on the option price. We review a method how to transform the problem
into a solution of a time depending nonlinear parabolic equation defined on a
fixed domain. Results of numerical computation of the early exercise boundary
for various nonlinear Black--Scholes equations are also presented.
