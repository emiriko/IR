Identification of gamma-ray-emitting Galactic sources is a long-standing
problem in astrophysics. One such source, 1AGL J2022+4032, coincident with the
interior of the radio shell of the supernova remnant Gamma Cygni (SNR
G78.2+2.1) in the Cygnus Region, has recently been identified by Fermi as a
gamma-ray pulsar, LAT PSR J2021+4026. We present long-term observations of 1AGL
J2022+4032 with the AGILE gamma-ray telescope, measuring its flux and light
curve. We compare the light curve of 1AGL J2022+4032 with that of 1AGL
J2021+3652 (PSR J2021+3651), showing that the flux variability of 1AGL
J2022+4032 appears to be greater than the level predicted from statistical and
systematic effects and producing detailed simulations to estimate the
probability of the apparent observed variability. We evaluate the possibility
that the gamma-ray emission may be due to the superposition of two or more
point sources, some of which may be variable, considering a number of possible
counterparts. We consider the possibility of a nearby X-ray quiet microquasar
contributing to the flux of 1AGL J2022+4032 to be more likely than the
hypotheses of a background blazar or intrinsic gamma-ray variabilty of LAT PSR
J2021+4026.
