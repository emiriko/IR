In this paper we show that the mass-energy density of the Universe can be
fully determined in terms of the cosmological redshifts, their time drifts and
angular-diameter distance (observer area distance). Besides providing an
indirect measurement of the mass-energy density of the Universe, we show how
one can use the time-drift of the cosmological redshifts as a replacement for
the mass-energy density element in the minimally required data set to construct
an spherically symmetric Lema\^{\i}tre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) model for the
Universe in observational coordinates.
