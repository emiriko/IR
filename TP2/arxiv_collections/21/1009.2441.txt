We present a laser cooling scheme for trapped ions and atoms using a
combination of laser couplings and a magnetic gradient field. In a
Schrieffer-Wolff transformed picture, this setup cancels the carrier and blue
sideband terms completely resulting in an improved cooling behaviour compared
to standard cooling schemes (e.g. sideband cooling) and allowing cooling to the
vibrational ground state. A condition for optimal cooling rates is presented
and the cooling behaviour for different Lamb-Dicke parameters and spontaneous
decay rates is discussed. Cooling rates of one order of magnitude less than the
trapping frequency are achieved using the new cooling method. Furthermore the
scheme turns out to be robust under deviations from the optimal parameters and
moreover provides good cooling rates also in the multi particle case.
