In this paper a new solution is proposed for testing simple stwo stage
electronic circuits. It minimizes the number of tests to be performed to
determine the genuinity of the circuit. The main idea behind the present
research work is to identify the maximum number of indistinguishable faults
present in the given circuit and minimize the number of test cases based on the
number of faults that has been detected. Heuristic approach is used for test
minimization part, which identifies the essential tests from overall test
cases. From the results it is observed that, test minimization varies from 50%
to 99% with the lowest one corresponding to a circuit with four gates .Test
minimization is low in case of circuits with lesser input leads in gates
compared to greater input leads in gates for the boolean expression with same
number of symbols. Achievement of 99% reduction is due to the fact that the
large number of tests find the same faults. The new approach is implemented for
simple circuits. The results show potential for both smaller test sets and
lower cpu times.
