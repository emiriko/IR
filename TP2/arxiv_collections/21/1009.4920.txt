Photons as well as quarks and gluons are constituents of the infinite
momentum frame (IMF) wave function of an energetic particle. They are mostly
equivalent photons whose amplitude follows from the Lorentz transformation of
the particle rest frame Coulomb field into the IMF and from the conservation of
the electromagnetic current. We evaluate in a model independent way the
dominant photon contribution \propto \alpha_{em}(Z^2/A^{4/3})\ln(1/R_{A}m_{N}x)
to the nuclear structure functions as well as the term \propto \alpha_{em}Z/A.
In addition we show that the definition of x consistent with the exact
kinematics of eA scattering (with exact sum rules) works in the same direction
as the nucleus field of equivalent photons. Combined, these effects account for
the bulk of the EMC effect for x\le 0.5 where Fermi motion effects are small.
In particular for these x the hadronic mechanism contribution to the EMC effect
does not exceed \sim 3% for all nuclei. Also the A-dependence of the hadronic
mechanism of the EMC effect for x > 0.5 is significantly modified.
