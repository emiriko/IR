Investigations on the fluorescence quenching of graphene have been carried
out with two organic donor molecules, pyrene butanaoic acid succinimidyl ester
(PyBS, I) and oligo(p-phenylenevinylene) methyl ester (OPV-ester, II).
Absorption and photoluminescence spectra of I and II recorded in mixture with
increasing the concentrations of graphene showed no change in the former, but
remarkable quenching of fluorescence. The property of graphene to quench
fluorescence of these aromatic molecules is shown to be associated with
photo-induced electron transfer, on the basis of fluorescence decay and
time-resolved transient absorption spectroscopic measurements.
