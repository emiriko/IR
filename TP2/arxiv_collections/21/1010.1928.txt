Nonrelativistic equation of particle with a spin for the Lagrangian on a
nonassociative algebra is obtained. It is shown that in this model arises
Riemann-Cartan space. In the case of central symmetry in addition to the
pseudo-curvature appears torsion as pseudovector that interacts with the spin
of the particle. An estimation of the influence of torsion on the strength of
gravitational attraction in the central gravitational field is given.
