Using a 2D lattice model, we conduct Monte Carlo simulations of micellar
aggregation of linear-chain amphiphiles having two solvophilic head groups. In
the context of this simple model, we quantify how the amphiphile architecture
influences the critical micelle concentration (CMC), with a particular focus on
the role of the asymmetry of the amphiphile structure. Accordingly, we study
all possible arrangements of the head groups along amphiphile chains of fixed
length $N=12$ and 16 molecular units. This set of idealized amphiphile
architectures approximates many cases of symmetric and asymmetric gemini
surfactants, double-headed surfactants and boloform surfactants. Consistent
with earlier results, we find that the number of spacer units $s$ separating
the heads has a significant influence on the CMC, with the CMC increasing with
$s$ for $s<N/2$. In comparison, the influence of the asymmetry of the chain
architecture on the CMC is much weaker, as is also found experimentally.
