Superfluidity, the ability of a fluid to move without dissipation, is one of
the most spectacular manifestations of the quantum nature of matter. We explore
here the possibility of superfluid motion of light. Controlling the speed of a
light packet with respect to a defect, we demonstrate the presence of
superfluidity and, above a critical velocity, its breakdown through the onset
of a dissipative phase. We describe a possible experimental realization based
on the transverse motion through an array of waveguides. These results open new
perspectives in transport optimization.
