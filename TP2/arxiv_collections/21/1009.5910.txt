In this paper we consider an holographic model of dark energy, where the
length scale is the Hubble radius, in a non flat geometry. The model contains
the possibility to alleviate the cosmic coincidence problem, and also
incorporate a mechanism to obtain the transition from decelerated to an
accelerated expansion regime. We derive an analytic form for the Hubble
parameter in a non flat universe, and using it, we perform a Bayesian analysis
of this model using SNIa, BAO and CMB data. We find from this analysis that the
data favored a small value for $\Omega_k$, however high enough to still produce
cosmological consequences.
