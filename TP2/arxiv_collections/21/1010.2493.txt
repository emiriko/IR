We describe a new method to identify young, late-type stars within ~150 pc of
the Earth that employs visual or near-infrared data and the GALEX GR4/5
database. For spectral types later than K5, we demonstrate that the ratio of
GALEX near-ultraviolet (NUV) to visual and near-IR emission is larger for stars
with ages between 10 and 100 Myr than for older, main sequence stars. A search
in regions of the sky encompassing the TW Hya and Scorpius-Centaurus
Associations has returned 54 high-quality candidates for followup.
Spectroscopic observations of 24 of these M1-M5 objects reveal Li 6708 angstrom
absorption in at least 17 systems. Because GALEX surveys have covered a
significant fraction of the sky, this methodology should prove valuable for
future young star studies.
