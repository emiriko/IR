A microscopic state-of-the-art calculation of the nuclear matrix element for
neutrinoless double beta decay of $^{150}$Nd with an account for nuclear
deformation is performed. The proton-neutron quasiparticle random phase
approximation (QRPA) with a realistic residual interaction [the Brueckner $G$
matrix derived from the charge-depending Bonn (Bonn-CD) nucleon-nucleon
potential] is used as the underlying nuclear structure model. The present
calculated matrix element is suppressed by about 40% as compared with our
previous QRPA result for $^{150}$Nd obtained with neglect of deformation. By
making use of this newest nuclear matrix element, one may conclude that
neutrinoless double beta decay of $^{150}$Nd, to be measured soon by the SNO+
collaboration, provides one of the best probes of the Majorana neutrino mass.
