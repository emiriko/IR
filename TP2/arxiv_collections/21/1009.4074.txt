I review the good, the bad and the ugly of the non-projectable versions of
Horava gravity. I explain how this non-relativistic theory was constructed and
why it was touted with such excitement as a quantum theory of gravity. I then
review some of the issues facing the theory, explaining how strong coupling
occurs and why this is such a problem for both phenomenology and the question
of renormalisability. Finally I comment on possible violations of Equivalence
Principle, and explain why these could be an issue for Blas et al's "healthy
extension". This paper was presented as a talk at PASCOS 2010 in Valencia.
