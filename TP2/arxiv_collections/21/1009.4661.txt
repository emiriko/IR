This work investigates the effect of the uniaxial strain on the tunneling
conductance in a strained graphene superconductor where strain is applied in
the armchair direction. Based on the Tight-Binding model, applying strain in
the armchair direction gives rise to the asymmetric massless fermions as the
carriers. Their velocities depend on their directions controlled by strain.
Using the BTK theory, the conductances of strained graphene N/S junctions can
be determined. As a result, we find that the current flowing perpendicular to
the direction of strain depends linearly on strain, with the positive slope.
But the current flowing parallel to the direction of strain depends linearly on
strain, with the negative slope. This linear behavior is significant for
applications of superconductor-based nanomechanical electronic devices.
