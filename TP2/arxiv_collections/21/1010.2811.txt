The production of low-energy antimatter provides unique opportunities to
search for new physics in an unexplored regime. Testing gravitational
interactions with antimatter is one such opportunity. Here a scenario based on
Lorentz and CPT violation in the Standard- Model Extension is considered in
which anomalous gravitational effects in antimatter could arise.
