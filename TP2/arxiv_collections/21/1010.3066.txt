Motivated by experiments on the superfluid 3He confined in a thin slab, we
design a concrete experimental setup for observing the Majorana surface states.
We solve the quasi-classical Eilenberger equation, which is quantitatively
reliable, to evaluate several quantities, such as local density of states
(LDOS), mass current for the A-phase, and spin current for the B-phase. In
connection with realistic slab samples, we consider the upper and lower
surfaces and the side edges including the corners with several thicknesses.
Consequently the influence on the Majorana zero modes from the spatial
variation of l-vector for the A-phase in thick slabs and the energy splitting
of the zero-energy quasi-particles for the B-phase confined in thin slabs are
demonstrated. The corner of slabs in the B-phase is accompanied by the unique
zero-energy LDOS of corner modes. On the basis of the quantitative calculation,
we propose several feasible and verifiable experiments to check the existence
of the Majorana surface states, such as the measurement of specific heat, edge
current, and anisotropic spin susceptibility.
