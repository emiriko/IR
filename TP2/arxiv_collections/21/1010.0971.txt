Neutrino physics focuses on huge detectors deep underground. The Sanford Lab
in South Dakota will build a 300 kiloton water-Cherenkov detector 1500 meters
deep for muon neutrino oscillation studies of the mass hierarchy and CP
violation. This will be used by the Long Baseline experiment (LBNE) detecting
few GeV neutrinos from Fermilab, 1300 km away. The DAE{\delta}ALUS
Collaboration also plans several neutrino-production sites at closer distances
up to 20 km from the 300 kT detector, producing muon antineutrinos from stopped
pions. The complementarity with LBNE greatly enhances results, and enthusiasm
is mounting to do both experiments. DAE{\delta}ALUS needs 0.8-1 GeV
accelerators with mA proton beams. Three sites at 1.5, 8 and 20 km from the 300
kT detector require several accelerators. The cost per machine must be below
1/10 of existing megawatt-class proton machines. Beyond high power and energy,
beam parameters are modest. Challenges are reliability, control of beam loss
and minimizing activation. Options being studied are: a compact superconducting
cyclotron; a ring cyclotron accelerating H2+ (with stripping extraction); and a
stacked cyclotron with up to 9 planes sharing the same magnet yoke and rf
systems.
