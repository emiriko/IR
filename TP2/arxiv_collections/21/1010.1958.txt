The small r variation of the probability density P(r) for end-to-end
separations of a -CH2CH3 capped (-OCH2CH2-)n oligomer in water is computed to
be closely similar to the CH4 ... CH4 potential of mean force under the same
circumstances. Since the aqueous solution CH4 ... CH4 potential of mean force
is the natural physical definition of a primitive hydrophobic bond, the present
result identifies an experimentally accessible circumstance for direct
observation of a hydrophobic bond which has not been observed previously
because of the low solubility of CH4 in water. The physical picture is that the
soluble chain molecule carries the capping groups into aqueous solution, and
permits them to find one another with reasonable frequency. Comparison with the
corresponding results without the solvent shows that hydration of the solute
oxygen atoms swells the chain molecule globule. This supports the view that the
chain molecule globule might have a secondary effect on the hydrophobic
interaction which is of first interest here. The volume of the chain molecule
globule is important for comparing the probabilities with and without solvent
because it characterizes the local concentration of capping groups. Study of
other capping groups to enable X-ray and neutron diffraction measurements of
P(r) is discussed.
