We study the effect of isospin degree of freedom on balance energy throughout
the mass range between 50 and 350 for two sets of isobaric systems with N/A =
0.5 and 0.58. Our fndings indicate that different values of balance energy for
two isobaric systems may be mainly due to the Coulomb repulsion. We also
demonstrate clearly the dominance of Coulomb repulsion over symmetry energy.
