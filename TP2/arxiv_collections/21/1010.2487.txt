Assuming the holographic principle, the gravitational force can be formulated
thermodynamically as an entropic force, but the mechanism by which the
attraction between two masses occurs is not clear. The physical basis for the
holographic principle is also unknown. My primary assumption is that empty
space consists of discrete countable units that have on the order of one bit of
entropy per cubic Planck unit. The basic idea here is simply that rather than
matter just occupying empty space, the presence of matter excludes discrete
units of space that have entropy. I argue that this volume exclusion of empty
space leads to an attractive gravitational force and to the holographic
principle.
