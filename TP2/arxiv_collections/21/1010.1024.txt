We introduce a new combinatorial structure: the superselector. We show that
superselectors subsume several important combinatorial structures used in the
past few years to solve problems in group testing, compressed sensing,
multi-channel conflict resolution and data security. We prove close upper and
lower bounds on the size of superselectors and we provide efficient algorithms
for their constructions. Albeit our bounds are very general, when they are
instantiated on the combinatorial structures that are particular cases of
superselectors (e.g., (p,k,n)-selectors, (d,\ell)-list-disjunct matrices,
MUT_k(r)-families, FUT(k, a)-families, etc.) they match the best known bounds
in terms of size of the structures (the relevant parameter in the
applications). For appropriate values of parameters, our results also provide
the first efficient deterministic algorithms for the construction of such
structures.
