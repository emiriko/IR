We study the representation growth of alternating and symmetric groups in
positive characteristic and restricted representation growth for the finite
groups of Lie type. We show that the the number of representations of dimension
at most n is bounded by a low degree polynomial in n. As a consequence, we show
that the number of conjugacy classes of maximal subgroups of a finite almost
simple group G is at most O(log|G|).
