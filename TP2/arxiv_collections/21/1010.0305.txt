Log-concave distributions are an attractive choice for modeling and
inference, for several reasons: The class of log-concave distributions contains
most of the commonly used parametric distributions and thus is a rich and
flexible nonparametric class of distributions. Further, the MLE exists and can
be computed with readily available algorithms. Thus, no tuning parameter, such
as a bandwidth, is necessary for estimation. Due to these attractive
properties, there has been considerable recent research activity concerning the
theory and applications of log-concave distributions. This article gives a
review of these results.
