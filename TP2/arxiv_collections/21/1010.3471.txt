Closed form expressions in terms of multi-sums of products have been given in
\cite{Tranclosedform, KRQ} of integrals of sine-Gordon, modified Korteweg-de
Vries and potential Korteweg-de Vries maps obtained as so-called
$(p,-1)$-traveling wave reductions of the corresponding partial difference
equations. We prove the involutivity of these integrals with respect to
recently found symplectic structures for those maps. The proof is based on
explicit formulae for the Poisson brackets between multi-sums of products.
