We discuss the evidence for the presence of QCD saturation effects in the
data collected in d+Au collisions at RHIC. In particular we focus our analysis
on forward hadron yields and azimuthal correlations. Approaches alternative to
the CGC description of these two observables are discussed in parallel.
