We present an anisotropy of the hysteretic transport around the spin
transition point at Landau level filling factor $\nu=2/3$ in tilted magnetic
field. When the direction of the in-plane component of the magnetic field
$B_{\parallel}$ is normal to the probe current $I$, a strong hysteretic
transport due to the current-induced nuclear spin polarization occurs. When
$B_{\parallel}$ is parallel to $I$, on the other hand, the hysteresis almost
disappears. We also demonstrate that the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate
$T_{1}^{-1}$ at the transition point increases with decreasing angle between
the directions of $B_{\parallel}$ and $I$. These results suggest that the
morphology of electron spin domains around $\nu =2/3$ is affected by the
current direction.
