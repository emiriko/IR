We present a mechanism that naturally produces light Dirac neutrinos. The
basic idea is that the right-handed neutrinos are composite. Any realistic
composite model must involve `hidden flavor' chiral symmetries. In general some
of these symmetries may survive confinement, and in particular, one of them
manifests itself at low energy as an exact $B-L$ symmetry. Dirac neutrinos are
therefore produced. The neutrinos are naturally light due to compositeness. In
general, sterile states are present in the model, some of them can naturally be
warm dark matter candidates.
