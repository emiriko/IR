Image segmentation has been a very active research topic in image analysis
area. Currently, most of the image segmentation algorithms are designed based
on the idea that images are partitioned into a set of regions preserving
homogeneous intra-regions and inhomogeneous inter-regions. However, human
visual intuition does not always follow this pattern. A new image segmentation
method named Visual-Hint Boundary to Segment (VHBS) is introduced, which is
more consistent with human perceptions. VHBS abides by two visual hint rules
based on human perceptions: (i) the global scale boundaries tend to be the real
boundaries of the objects; (ii) two adjacent regions with quite different
colors or textures tend to result in the real boundaries between them. It has
been demonstrated by experiments that, compared with traditional image
segmentation method, VHBS has better performance and also preserves higher
computational efficiency.
