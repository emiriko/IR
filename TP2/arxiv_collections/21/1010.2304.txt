Topological insulators have gapless edge/surface states with novel transport
properties. Among these, there are two classes of perfectly conducting channels
which are free from backscattering: the edge states of two-dimensional
topological insulators and the one-dimensional states localized on dislocations
of certain three-dimensional topological insulators. We show how these novel
states affect thermoelectric properties of the systems and discuss
possibilities to improve the thermoelectric figure of merit using these
materials with perfectly conducting channels.
