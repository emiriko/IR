Engaging mobility with file sharing is considered very promising in today's
run Anywhere, Anytime, Anything (3As) environments. The Bittorrent file sharing
protocol can be rarely combined with the mobility scenario framework since
resources are not available due to the dynamically changing topology network.
As a result, mobility in P2P-oriented file sharing platforms, degrades the
end-to-end efficiency and the system's performance. This work proposes a new
hybridized model, which takes into account the mobility characteristics of the
combined Bittorrent protocol in a centralized manner enabling partial mobility
characteristics, where the clients of the network use a distinct technique to
differentiate between mobile and static nodes. Many parameters were taken into
consideration like the round trip delays, the diffusion process, and the
seeding techniques, targeting the maximization of the average throughput in the
clustered swarms containing mobile peers. Partial mobility characteristics are
set in a peer-tracker and peer-peer communication enhancement schema with
partial mobility, allowing an optimistic approach to attain high availability
and throughput response as simulation results show.
