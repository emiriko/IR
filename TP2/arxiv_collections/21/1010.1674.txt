The existence of a characteristic coherence length in FEL SASE Physics
determines the independent lasing of different portions, namely the slices, of
the electron bunch. Each slice may be characterized by different phase space
properties (not necessarily equal emittances and Twiss coefficients). This fact
opens new questions on the concept of beam matching and how the various
portions of the beam contribute to the performances of the output radiation,
including those associated with the transverse coherence.
