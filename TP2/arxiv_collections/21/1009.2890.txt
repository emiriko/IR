A thorough search of the OGLE-III microlensing project has more than doubled
the total sample of PNe known to have close binary central stars. These
discoveries have enabled close binary induced morphological trends to be
revealed for the first time. Canonical bipolar nebulae, low-ionisation
structures and polar outflows are all identified within the sample and are
provisionally associated with binarity. We have embarked upon a large
photometric monitoring program using the Flemish Mercator telescope to
simultaneously test the predictive power of these morphological features and to
find more close binaries. Early results are very positive with at least five
binaries found so far. This suggests our method is an effective means to
expedite the construction of a statistically significant sample of close binary
shaped nebulae. Such an authoritative sample will be essential to quantify the
degree to which close binary nuclei may shape PNe.
