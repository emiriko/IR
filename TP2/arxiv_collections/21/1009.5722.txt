Condensate clouds are a salient feature of L dwarf atmospheres, but have been
assumed to play little role in shaping the spectra of the coldest T-type brown
dwarfs. Here we report evidence of condensate opacity in the near-infrared
spectrum of the brown dwarf candidate Ross 458C, obtained with the Folded-Port
Infrared Echellette (FIRE) spectrograph at the Magellan Telescopes. These data
verify the low-temperature nature of this source, indicating a T8 spectral
classification, log Lbol/Lsun = -5.62+/-0.03, Teff = 650+/-25 K, and a mass at
or below the deuterium burning limit. The data also reveal enhanced emission at
K-band associated with youth (low surface gravity) and supersolar metallicity,
reflecting the properties of the Ross 458 system (age = 150-800 Myr, [Fe/H] =
+0.2 to +0.3). We present fits of FIRE data for Ross 458C, the T9 dwarf ULAS
J133553.45+113005.2, and the blue T7.5 dwarf SDSS J141624.08+134826.7B, to
cloudless and cloudy spectral models from Saumon & Marley. For Ross 458C we
confirm a low surface gravity and supersolar metallicity, while the temperature
differs depending on the presence (635 [+25,-35] K) or absence (760 [+70,-45]
K) of cloud extinction. ULAS J1335+1130 and SDSS J1416+1348B have similar
temperatures (595 [+25,-45] K), but distinct surface gravities (log g = 4.0-4.5
cgs versus 5.0-5.5 cgs) and metallicities ([M/H] ~ +0.2 versus -0.2). In all
three cases, cloudy models provide better fits to the spectral data,
significantly so for Ross 458C. These results indicate that clouds are an
important opacity source in the spectra of young cold T dwarfs, and should be
considered when characterizing the spectra of planetary-mass objects in young
clusters and directly-imaged exoplanets. The characteristics of Ross 458C
suggest it could itself be regarded as a planet, albeit one whose cosmogony
does not conform with current planet formation theories.
