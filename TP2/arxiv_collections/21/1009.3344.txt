A rather new approach employing Monte Carlo GEANT simulation for converting
the experimentally measured fold distribution to angular momentum distribution
has been described. The technique has been successfully utilized to measure the
angular momentum of the compound nucleus formed in the reaction 4He + 115In -->
119Sb at E_Lab = 35 MeV. A 50 element gamma multiplicity filter, fabricated
in-house, was used to measure experimentally the required fold distribution.
The present method has been compared with the other ones exiting in the
literature and relative merits have been discussed.
