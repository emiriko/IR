We continue the analysis of quantum two-particle bound systems we have
started in (Kholmetskii, A.L., Missevitch, O.V. and Yarman, T. Phys. Scr., 82
(2010), 045301), where we re-postulated the Dirac equation for the bound
electron in an external EM field based on the requirement of total momentum
conservation, when its EM radiation is prohibited. It has been shown that the
modified expression for the energy levels of hydrogenic atoms within such a
pure bound field theory (PBFT) provides the same gross and fine structure of
energy levels like the standard theory. Now we apply the PBFT to the analysis
of hyperfine interactions and show the appearance of some important corrections
to the energy levels (the 1S-2S interval and hyperfine spin-spin splitting in
positronium, 1S and 2S-2P Lamb shift in hydrogen), which remedies considerably
the discrepancy between theoretical predictions and experimental results. In
particular, the corrected 1S-2S interval and the spin-spin splitting in
positronium practically eliminate the available up to date deviation between
theoretical and experimental data. The re-estimated classic 2S-2P Lamb shift as
well as ground state Lamb shift in the hydrogen atom lead to the proton charge
radius rp=0.837(8) fm (from 2S-2P Lamb shift), and rp=0.840(24) fm (from 1S
Lamb shift), which corresponds to the latest estimation of proton size via the
measurement of 2S-2P Lamb shift in muonic hydrogen, i.e. rp=0.84184(67) fm. We
also emphasize the universal character of PBFT, which is applicable to heavy
atoms, too, and analyze 2S-2P interval in Li-like uranium. We show that the
corrections we introduced provide a better correspondence between the
calculated and experimental data than that furnished by the standard approach.
The results obtained support our principal idea of the enhancement of the bound
EM field in the absence of EM radiation for quantum bound systems.
