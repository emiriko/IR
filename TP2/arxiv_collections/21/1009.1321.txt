Ceramics ZnO:Zn of 20mm diameter and 1.6mm thickness with an optical
transparency up to 0.33 in the visible region have been prepared by hot
pressing technique. Scintillating and luminescent characteristics such as
emission spectra, decay time, yield, and TSL glow curve have been measured
under X-ray excitation. Two emission bands peaking at 500 and 380 nm were
detected, the light output was about 80% of that for standard BGO scintillator,
main decay constant was 10.4 +/- 0.1 ns. The obtained data allow us to consider
the ZnO:Zn ceramics as a perspective scintillator. Finally, the investigation
shows that other ZnO-based fast scintillators can be fabricated in the form of
optical ceramics.
