The magnetization and anisotropic electrical transport properties have been
measured in high quality Cu0.03TaS2 single crystal. A pronounced peak effect
has been observed, indicating that the high quality and homogeneity are vital
to peak effect. A kink has been observed in the magnetic field H dependence of
the in-plane resistivity {\rho}ab for H || c, which corresponds to a transition
from activated to diffusive behavior of vortex liquid phase. In the diffusive
regime of the vortex liquid phase, the in-plane resistivity {\rho}ab shows
{\rho}ab $\propto$ H0.3 relation, which does not follow the Bardeen-Stephen law
for free flux flow. Finally, a simplified vortex phase diagram of Cu0.03TaS2
for H || c is given.
