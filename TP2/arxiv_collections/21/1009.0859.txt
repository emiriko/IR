We present searches for Higgs bosons decaying to the di-photon final state
using up to 5.4/fb of data at a center-of-mass energy of 1.96 TeV at the
Fermilab Tevatron collider. Whilst the branching ratio to the di-photon final
state is small in the Standard Model, this channel contributes appreciably to
the overall Higgs sensitivity at the Tevatron. In parallel, the limit is
re-interpreted in fermiophobic models where the di-photon branching ratio is
considerably larger. This decay channel will be of major importance in the
light mass Standard Model Higgs search at the LHC.
