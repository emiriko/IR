In the context of the so-called Gauss-Bonnet gravity, where the gravitational
action includes function of the Gauss-Bonnet invariant, we study cosmological
solutions, especially the well-known $\Lambda$CDM model. It is shown that the
dark energy contribution and even the inflationary epoch can be explained in
the frame of this kind of theories with no need of any other kind of component.
Other cosmological solutions are constructed and the rich properties that this
kind of theories provide are explored.
