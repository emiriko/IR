The systematics of one-quasiparticle configurations in neutron-rich Sr, Zr,
and Mo odd isotopes is studied within the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov plus Equal
Filling Approximation method preserving both axial and time reversal
symmetries. Calculations based on the Gogny energy density functional with both
the standard D1S parametrization and the new D1M incarnation of this functional
are included in our analysis. The nuclear deformation and shape coexistence
inherent to this mass region are shown to play a relevant role in the
understanding of the spectroscopic features of the ground and low-lying
one-quasineutron states.
