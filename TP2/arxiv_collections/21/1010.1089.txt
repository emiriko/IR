We study the effect of isospin degree of freedom on the balance energy
(E$_{bal}$) as well as its mass dependence throughout the mass range 48-270 for
two sets of isobaric systems with N/Z = 1 and 1.4 at different colliding
geometries ranging from central to peripheral ones. Our findings reveal the
dominance of Coulomb repulsion in isospin effects on E$_{bal}$ as well as its
mass dependence throughout the range of the colliding geometry. Our results
also indicate that the effect of symmetry energy and nucleon-nucleon cross
section on E$_{bal}$ is uniform throughout the mass range and throughout the
colliding geometry. We also present the counter balancing of nucleon-nucleon
collisions and mean field by reducing the Coulomb and the counter balancing of
Coulomb and mean filed by removing the nucleon-nucleon collisions.
