We have measured magnetic response of second-generation high temperature
superconductor YBa2Cu3Ox wire and Nb thin film in perpendicular ac field as a
function of temperature. We compare experimental complex ac susceptibility to
the calculated susceptibility based on the model of Bean's critical-state
response in two-dimensional (2D) disk in perpendicular field. The harmonic
analysis is needed for comparison between the model and the experimental data.
We present a method of linking model and experimental susceptibility. Good
agreement of experimental susceptibility with model susceptibility of 2D disk
allows contactless estimation of critical depinning current density and its
temperature dependence.
