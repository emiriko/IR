We present experimental studies on the generation and detection of pulsed,
relative-intensity squeezed light in a warm rubidium vapor. The noise
correlations between a pulsed probe beam and its conjugate -generated through
nearly-degenerate four-wave mixing in a double-lambda system- are studied via
time-resolved balanced detection. We observe -0.96 dB of time-resolved relative
intensity squeezing with 50 nanosecond pulses at 1 MHz repetition rate. (-1.34
dB corrected for loss).
