We show that every graph of maximum degree three can be drawn in three
dimensions with at most two bends per edge, and with 120-degree angles between
any two edge segments meeting at a vertex or a bend. We show that every graph
of maximum degree four can be drawn in three dimensions with at most three
bends per edge, and with 109.5-degree angles, i.e., the angular resolution of
the diamond lattice, between any two edge segments meeting at a vertex or bend.
