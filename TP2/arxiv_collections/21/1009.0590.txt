Thermal fluctuations of the order parameter in an ultrathin triangular shaped
superconducting structure are studied near $T_{c}$, in zero applied field. We
find that the order parameter is prone to much larger fluctuations in the
corners of the structure as compared to its interior. This geometry-induced
localization of thermal fluctuations is attributed to the fact that condensate
confinement in the corners is characterised by a lower effective
dimensionality, which favors stronger fluctuations.
