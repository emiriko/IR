Recently several type Ib supernovae (SNe; with the prototypical SN 2005E)
have been shown to have atypical properties. These SNe are faint (absolute peak
magnitude of ~ -15) and fast SNe that show unique composition. They are
inferred to have low ejecta mass (a few tenths of a solar mass) and to be
highly enriched in calcium, but poor in silicon elements and nickel. These SNe
were therefore suggested to belong to a new class of calcium-rich faint SNe
explosions. Their properties were proposed to be the result of helium
detonations that may occur on helium accreting white dwarfs. In this paper we
theoretically study the scenario of helium detonations, and focus on the
results of detonations in accreted helium layers on low mass carbon-oxygen (CO)
cores. We present new results from one dimensional simulations of such
explosions, including their light curves and spectra. We find that when the
density of the helium layer is low enough the helium detonation produces large
amounts of intermediate elements, such as calcium and titanium, together with a
large amount of unburnt helium. Our results suggest that the properties of
calcium-rich faint SNe could indeed be consistent with the helium-detonation
scenario on small CO cores. Above a certain density (larger CO cores) the
detonation leaves mainly 56Ni and unburnt helium, and the predicted spectrum
will unlikely fit the unique features of this class of SNe. Finally, none of
our studied models reproduces the bright, fast evolving light curves of another
type of peculiar SNe suggested to originate in helium detonations (SNe 1885A,
1939B and 2002bj).
