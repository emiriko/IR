Analyzing simulated EAS events generated with the CORSIKA code, the
characteristics of lateral distribution of electrons in EAS around the knee
energy region of the primary energy spectrum have been studied and compared
with experimental observations. The differences between the EGS4 and the NKG
output of CORSIKA in respect to electron radial density distribution have been
investigated. The relation between lateral and longitudinal age parameters has
been studied after introducing the notion of the local age parameter that
reflects the profile of the lateral distribution of electrons in EAS. The
present analysis motivates the inclusion of the lateral shower age in a
multiparameter study of EAS to extract information on hadronic interactions and
primary composition.
