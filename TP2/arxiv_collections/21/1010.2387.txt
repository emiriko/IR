We prove propagation of weighted Sobolev regularity for solutions of the
hyperboloidal Cauchy problem for a class of quasi-linear symmetric hyperbolic
systems, under structure conditions compatible with the Einstein-Maxwell
equations in space-time dimensions $n+1\ge 7$. Similarly we prove propagation
of polyhomogeneity in dimensions $n+1\ge 9$. As a byproduct we obtain, in those
last dimensions, polyhomogeneity at null infinity of small data solutions of
vacuum Einstein, or Einstein-Maxwell equations evolving out of initial data
which are stationary outside of a ball.
