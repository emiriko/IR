Given a point set S and an unknown metric d on S, we study the problem of
efficiently partitioning S into k clusters while querying few distances between
the points. In our model we assume that we have access to one versus all
queries that given a point s in S return the distances between s and all other
points. We show that given a natural assumption about the structure of the
instance, we can efficiently find an accurate clustering using only O(k)
distance queries. Our algorithm uses an active selection strategy to choose a
small set of points that we call landmarks, and considers only the distances
between landmarks and other points to produce a clustering. We use our
algorithm to cluster proteins by sequence similarity. This setting nicely fits
our model because we can use a fast sequence database search program to query a
sequence against an entire dataset. We conduct an empirical study that shows
that even though we query a small fraction of the distances between the points,
we produce clusterings that are close to a desired clustering given by manual
classification.
