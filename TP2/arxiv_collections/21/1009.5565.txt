We report on the manipulation of the center-of-mass motion (`sloshing') of a
Bose Einstein condensate in a time-averaged orbiting potential (TOP) trap. We
start with a condensate at rest in the center of a static trapping potential.
When suddenly replacing the static trap with a TOP trap centered about the same
position, the condensate starts to slosh with an amplitude much larger than the
TOP micromotion. We show, both theoretically and experimentally, that the
direction of sloshing is related to the initial phase of the rotating magnetic
field of the TOP. We show further that the sloshing can be quenched by applying
a carefully timed and sized jump in the phase of the rotating field.
