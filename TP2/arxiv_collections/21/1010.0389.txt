A coarse-grained molecular model, which consists of a spherical particle and
an orientation vector, is proposed to simulate lipid membrane on a large length
scale. The solvent is implicitly represented by an effective attractive
interaction between particles. A bilayer structure is formed by
orientation-dependent (tilt and bending) potentials. In this model, the
membrane properties (bending rigidity, line tension of membrane edge, area
compression modulus, lateral diffusion coefficient, and flip-flop rate) can be
varied over broad ranges. The stability of the bilayer membrane is investigated
via droplet-vesicle transition. The rupture of the bilayer and worm-like
micelle formation can be induced by an increase in the spontaneous curvature of
the monolayer membrane.
