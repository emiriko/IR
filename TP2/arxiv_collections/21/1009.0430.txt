We discuss the functional renormalization group and pion condensation in the
presence of a finite isospin chemical potential $\mu_I$. We calculate the phase
diagram as function of temperature $T$ and $\mu_I$. While the exact effective
average action is invariant under certain gauge transformations, the effective
action in the local-potential approximation is not. As a consequence, the
critical chemical potential $\mu_I^c$ for Bose-Einstein condensation at T=0 is
no longer equal to the mass of the condensing mode. We discuss possible
solutions to this problem.
