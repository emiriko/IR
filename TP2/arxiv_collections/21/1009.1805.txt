We present the first detailed spatio-kinematical analysis and modelling of
the planetary nebula Abell~41, which is known to contain the well-studied
close-binary system MT Ser. This object represents an important test case in
the study of the evolution of planetary nebulae with binary central stars as
current evolutionary theories predict that the binary plane should be aligned
perpendicular to the symmetry axis of the nebula.
  Longslit observations of the \NII\ emission from Abell~41 were obtained using
the Manchester Echelle Spectrometer on the 2.1-m San Pedro M\'artir Telescope.
These spectra, combined with deep, narrowband imagery acquired using ACAM on
the William Herschel Telescope, were used to develop a spatio-kinematical model
of \NII\ emission from Abell~41. The best fitting model reveals Abell~41 to
have a waisted, bipolar structure with an expansion velocity of $\sim$40\kms{}
at the waist. The symmetry axis of the model nebula is within 5$^\circ$ of
perpendicular to the orbital plane of the central binary system. This provides
strong evidence that the close-binary system, MT Ser, has directly affected the
shaping of its host nebula, Abell~41.
