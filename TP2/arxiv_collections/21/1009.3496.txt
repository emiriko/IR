We show that the standard Dirac phase factor is not the only solution of the
gauge transformation equations. The full form of a general gauge function (that
connects systems that move in different sets of scalar and vector potentials),
apart from Dirac phases also contains terms of classical fields that act
nonlocally (in spacetime) on the local solutions of the time-dependent
Schr\"odinger equation: the phases of wavefunctions in the Schr\"odinger
picture are affected nonlocally by spatially and temporally remote magnetic and
electric fields, in ways that are fully explored. These contributions go beyond
the usual Aharonov-Bohm effects (magnetic or electric). (i) Application to
cases of particles passing through static magnetic or electric fields leads to
cancellations of Aharonov-Bohm phases at the observation point; these are
linked to behaviors at the semiclassical level (to the old Werner & Brill
experimental observations, or their "electric analogs" - or to recent reports
of Batelaan & Tonomura) but are shown to be far more general (true not only for
narrow wavepackets but also for completely delocalized quantum states). By
using these cancellations, certain previously unnoticed sign-errors in the
literature are corrected. (ii) Application to time-dependent situations
provides a remedy for erroneous results in the literature (on improper uses of
Dirac phase factors) and leads to phases that contain an Aharonov-Bohm part and
a field-nonlocal part: their competition is shown to recover Relativistic
Causality in earlier "paradoxes" (such as the van Kampen thought-experiment),
while a more general consideration indicates that the temporal nonlocalities
found here demonstrate in part a causal propagation of phases of quantum
mechanical wavefunctions in the Schr\"odinger picture. This may open a direct
way to address time-dependent double-slit experiments and the associated causal
issues
