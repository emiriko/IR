We investigate in a general form entanglement of biphoton qutrits and
ququarts, i.e. states formed in the processes of collinear and,
correspondingly, degenerate and non-degenerate Spontaneous Parametric
Down-Conversion. Indistinguishability of photons and, for ququarts, joint
presence of the frequency and and polarization entanglement are fully taken
into account. In the case of qutrits the most general 3-parametric families of
maximally entangled and non-entangled states are found, and anti-correlation of
the degree of entanglement and polarization is shown to occur and to be
characterized by a rather simple formula. Biphoton ququarts are shown to be
two-qudits with the single-photon Hilbert space dimensionality $d=4$, which
differs them significantly from the often used two-qubit model ($d=2$). New
expressions for entanglement quantifiers of biphoton ququarts are derived and
discussed. Rather simple procedures for a direct measurement of the degree of
entanglement are described for both qutrits and ququarts.
