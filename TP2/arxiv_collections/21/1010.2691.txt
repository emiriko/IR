We explain the exact solution of the 1+1 dimensional Kardar-Parisi-Zhang
equation with sharp wedge initial conditions. Thereby it is confirmed that the
continuum model belongs to the KPZ universality class, not only as regards to
scaling exponents but also as regards to the full probability distribution of
the height in the long time limit.
