It has been recently argued that adiabatic quantum optimization would fail in
solving NP-complete problems because of the occurrence of exponentially small
gaps due to crossing of local minima of the final Hamiltonian with its global
minimum near the end of the adiabatic evolution. Using perturbation expansion,
we analytically show that for the NP-hard problem of maximum independent set
there always exist adiabatic paths along which no such crossings occur.
Therefore, in order to prove that adiabatic quantum optimization fails for any
NP-complete problem, one must prove that it is impossible to find any such path
in polynomial time.
