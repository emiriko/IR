Theoretical studies suggest that C/O and Mg/Si are the most important
elemental ratios in determining the mineralogy of terrestrial planets. The C/O
ratio controls the distribution of Si among carbide and oxide species, while
Mg/Si gives information about the silicate mineralogy. We present a detailed
and uniform study of C, O, Mg and Si abundances for 61 stars with detected
planets and 270 stars without detected planets from the homogeneous
high-quality unbiased HARPS GTO sample, together with 39 more planet-host stars
from other surveys. We determine these important mineralogical ratios and
investigate the nature of the possible terrestrial planets that could have
formed in those planetary systems. We find mineralogical ratios quite different
from those of the Sun, showing that there is a wide variety of planetary
systems which are not similar to Solar System. Many of planetary host stars
present a Mg/Si value lower than 1, so their planets will have a high Si
content to form species such as MgSiO$_{3}$. This type of composition can have
important implications for planetary processes like plate tectonics,
atmospheric composition or volcanism.
