If $\lambda$ is a positive real number strictly less than $\log3$, there is a
positive number $V_\lambda$ such that every orientable hyperbolic 3-manifold of
volume greater than $V_\lambda$ admits $\lambda$ as a Margulis number. If
$\lambda<(\log3)/2$, such a $V_\lambda$ can be specified explicitly, and is
bounded above by
$$\lambda\bigg(6+\frac{880}{\log3-2\lambda}\log{1\over\log3-2\lambda}\bigg),$$
where $\log$ denotes the natural logarithm. These results imply that for
$\lambda<\log3$, an orientable hyperbolic 3-manifold that does not have
$\lambda$ as a Margulis number has a rank-2 subgroup of bounded index in its
fundamental group, and in particular has a fundamental group of bounded rank.
Again, the bounds in these corollaries can be made explicit if
$\lambda<(\log3)/2$.
