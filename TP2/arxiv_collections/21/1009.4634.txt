Event horizons of astrophysical black holes and gravitational analogues have
been predicted to excite the quantum vacuum and give rise to the emission of
quanta, known as Hawking radiation. We experimentally create such a
gravitational analogue using ultrashort laser pulse filaments and our
measurements demonstrate a spontaneous emission of photons that confirms
theoretical predictions.
