We review recent claims of the existence of deeply bound kaonic states in
nuclei. Also we study in details the (K-,p) reaction on C12 with 1 GeV/c
momentum kaon beam, based on which a deep kaon nucleus optical potential was
claimed in [1]. In our Monte Carlo simulation of this reaction we include not
only the quasi-elastic K- p scattering, as in [1], but also K- absorption by
one and two nucleons followed by the decay of the hyperon in pi N, which can
also produce strength in the region of interest. The final state interactions
in terms of multiple scattering of the K-, p and all other primary particles on
their way out of the nucleus is also considered. We will show that all these
additional mechanisms allow us to explain the observed spectrum with a
"standard" shallow kaon nucleus optical potential obtained in chiral models.
