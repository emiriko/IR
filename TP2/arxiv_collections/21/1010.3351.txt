Variation of magnetocaloric (MC) effects has been systematically investigated
for colossal magnetoresistive (CMR) manganites R0.6Sr0.4MnO3 (R=La-Gd). As the
one-electron bandwidth is reduced, the temperature profile of MC effect, i.e.,
field-induced entropy change, exhibits a steeper drop below the ferromagnetic
transition temperature due to its first-order nature promoted by a competing
charge-orbital ordering instability. For these small-bandwidth systems adjacent
to the metal-insulator phase boundary, a rectangular-shaped profile for the
entropy change emerges with an anomalously wide temperature range and a
considerable magnitude. Model calculations have indicated that the fluctuation
enhanced in the phase-competing region has a strong impact on such MC features,
which can be extensively controlled by the chemical composition.
