We propose a relation between the elliptic SL(N,C) top and Toda systems and
obtain a new class of integrable systems in a specific limit of the elliptic
SL(N,C) top. The relation is based on the Inozemtsev limit (IL) and a
symplectic map from the elliptic Calogero-Moser system to the elliptic SL(N,C)
top. In the case when N=2 we use an explicit form of a symplectic map from the
phase space of the elliptic Calogero-Moser system to the phase space of the
elliptic SL(2,C) top and show that the limiting tops are equivalent to the Toda
chains. In the case when N>2 we generalize the above procedure using only the
limiting behavior of Lax matrices. In a specific limit we also obtain a more
general class of systems and prove the integrability in the Liouville sense of
a certain subclass of these systems. This class is described by a classical
r-matrix obtained from an elliptic r-matrix.
