We report the discovery of seven new, very bright gravitational lens systems
from our ongoing gravitational lens search, the Sloan Bright Arcs Survey
(SBAS). Two of the systems are confirmed to have high source redshifts z=2.19
and z=2.94. Three other systems lie at intermediate redshift with
z=1.33,1.82,1.93 and two systems are at low redshift z=0.66,0.86. The lensed
source galaxies in all of these systems are bright, with i-band magnitudes
ranging from 19.73-22.06. We present the spectrum of each of the source
galaxies in these systems along with estimates of the Einstein radius for each
system. The foreground lens in most systems is identified by a red sequence
based cluster finder as a galaxy group; one system is identified as a
moderately rich cluster. In total the SBAS has now discovered 19 strong lens
systems in the SDSS imaging data, 8 of which are among the highest surface
brightness z\simeq2-3 galaxies known.
