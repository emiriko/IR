We present a fluid dynamics video showing how capillary rafts sink. Small
objects trapped at an interface are very common in Nature (insects walking on
water, ant rafts, bubbles or pollen at the water-air interface, membranes...)
and are found in many multiphase industrial processes. Thanks to Archimedes
principle we can easily predict whether an object sinks or floats. But what
happens when several small particles are placed at an interface between two
fluids. In this case surface tension also plays an important role. These
particles self-assemble by capillarity and thus form what we call a "capillary
raft". We show how such capillary rafts sink for varying sizes of particles and
define how this parameter affects the sinking process.
