One of the objectives of the physics programme of the WASA-at-COSY facility
is to study the isospin violating eta hadronic decays into pi+pi-pi0$ systems
driven by the term of QCD Lagrangian which depends on the d and u quark mass
difference. These studies can be made in terms of the Dalitz plot parameters
describing the density population which is proportional to the square of the
amplitude |A(x,y)|^2. This contribution describes the current status of the
analysis of the eta->pi+pi-pi0 decay in the pd->3He eta and as well in the
pp->pp eta reaction with WASA-at-COSY.
