We present Mantis, a new framework that automatically predicts program
performance with high accuracy. Mantis integrates techniques from programming
language and machine learning for performance modeling, and is a radical
departure from traditional approaches. Mantis extracts program features, which
are information about program execution runs, through program instrumentation.
It uses machine learning techniques to select features relevant to performance
and creates prediction models as a function of the selected features. Through
program analysis, it then generates compact code slices that compute these
feature values for prediction. Our evaluation shows that Mantis can achieve
more than 93% accuracy with less than 10% training data set, which is a
significant improvement over models that are oblivious to program features. The
system generates code slices that are cheap to compute feature values.
