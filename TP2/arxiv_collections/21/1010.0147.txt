The van der Waals and Casimir-Polder interaction of different atoms with
graphene is investigated using the Dirac model which assumes that the energy of
quasiparticles is linear with respect to the momentum. The obtained results for
the van der Waals coefficients of hydrogen atoms and molecules and atoms of
metastable He${}^{\ast}$ and Na as a function of separation are compared with
respective results found using the hydrodynamic model of graphene. It is shown
that, regardless of the value of the gap parameter, the Dirac model leads to
much smaller values of the van der Waals coefficients than the hydrodynamic
model. The experiment on quantum reflection of metastable He${}^{\ast}$ and Na
atoms on graphene is proposed which is capable to discriminate between the two
models of the electronic structure of graphene. In this respect the parameters
of the phenomenological potential for both these atoms interacting with
graphene described by different models are determined.
