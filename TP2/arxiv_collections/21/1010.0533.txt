We present a systematic ab initio study based on density-functional
calculations to understand impurity effects in iron-based superconductors.
Effective tight-binding Hamiltonians for the d-bands of LaFeAsO with various
transition-metal impurities such as Mn, Co, Ni, Zn, and Ru are constructed
using maximally-localized Wannier orbitals. Local electronic structures around
the impurity are quantitatively characterized by their onsite potential and
transfer hoppings to neighboring sites. We found that the impurities are
classified into three groups according to the derived parameters: For Mn, Co,
and Ni, their impurity-3d levels measured from the Fe-3d level are nearly 0.3
eV, -0.3 eV, and -0.8 eV, respectively, while, for the Zn case, the d level is
considerably deep as -8 eV. For the Ru case, although the onsite-level
difference is much smaller as O(0.1) eV, the transfer integrals around the
impurity site are larger than those of the pure system by 20% \sim 30%, due to
the large spatial spread of the Ru-4d orbitals. We also show that, while excess
carriers are tightly trapped around the impurity site (due to the Friedel sum
rule), there is a rigid shift of band structure near the Fermi level, which has
the same effect as carrier doping.
