We consider the matrix completion problem under a form of row/column weighted
entrywise sampling, including the case of uniform entrywise sampling as a
special case. We analyze the associated random observation operator, and prove
that with high probability, it satisfies a form of restricted strong convexity
with respect to weighted Frobenius norm. Using this property, we obtain as
corollaries a number of error bounds on matrix completion in the weighted
Frobenius norm under noisy sampling and for both exact and near low-rank
matrices. Our results are based on measures of the "spikiness" and
"low-rankness" of matrices that are less restrictive than the incoherence
conditions imposed in previous work. Our technique involves an $M$-estimator
that includes controls on both the rank and spikiness of the solution, and we
establish non-asymptotic error bounds in weighted Frobenius norm for recovering
matrices lying with $\ell_q$-"balls" of bounded spikiness. Using
information-theoretic methods, we show that no algorithm can achieve better
estimates (up to a logarithmic factor) over these same sets, showing that our
conditions on matrices and associated rates are essentially optimal.
