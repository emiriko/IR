We study a spinor condensate of alkali atoms in F = 1 hyperfine state under
the presence of an oscillating magnetic field. We find resonances which, due to
the dipolar interactions, magnify the transfer of atoms from mF = 1 to mF = 0
Zeeman sublevel. These resonances occur at magnetic fields of the order of
milligaus and are broad enough to enable observation of the famous Einstein-de
Haas effect, which is solely a dipolar effect, in systems of cold alkali gases.
