The quantum mechanical tunneling through multiple quantum barriers is a
long-standing and well-known problem. Three methods proposed earlier to
calculate the tunneling probabilities and energy splitting: (1). Instanton
Method (2) WKb Approximation (3) Numerical Calculation.Instaton method is
helpful to understand the physical insight of quantum tunneling but the
validity is restricted to the case of large separation between the two
potential minima. WKB approximation is widely used in its simple mathematical
form, but the result is inaccurate due to its inherent defect in connection
formula. Recently WKB approximation has been developed by changing the phase
lose at the classical turning points but no above approximation have provide
the perfect result to the best of knowledge of Author. Using numerical methods,
one can get the solution up to the desired accuracy, but a considerable deal of
physical insight is lost in this process. In this paper, the Author presented
the developmentof models of multiple quantum wells or barriers potential by
using analytical Transfer matrix method (TMM), which has been applied to any
arbitrary potential wells and barriers successfully. The author applied the
above theory to three electronic device models and got satisfactory results.
