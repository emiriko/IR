A completely new approach to the problem of energy distribution in
statistical mechanics is developed that results in a general, combinatorial
formula for the density of states. Relying on the approach the energy
equipartition principle is reexamined and a new perspective on the theory of
phase transitions (as resulting from nontrivial patterns of energy distribution
characterized by the well-defined classes of forbidden microstates) is given.
