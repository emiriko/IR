A unified model is proposed for the radio and X-ray outburst of nova CI Cam
1998 which suggests the shock interaction of nova shell with the circumstellar
gas. The spherical model is able to describe kinematics of the radio shell
together with the evolution of the radio and X-ray fluxes. However, the X-ray
spectrum in this model is harder than the observed one. Better agreement with
observations demonstrates the model in which the spherical shell interacts with
the nonspherical circumstellar medium. The latter is made up of the broad
bipolar jets with the openning angle of $120^{\circ}$ and the dense equatorial
wind. In the optimal model the kinetic energy of the nova shell is
$\sim8\times10^{43}$ erg, while the shell mass lies in the range of
$(1-5)\times10^{-7} M_{\odot}$.
