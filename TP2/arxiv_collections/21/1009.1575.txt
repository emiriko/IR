We describe an incremental algorithm to enumerate the isomorphism classes of
double pseudoline arrangements. The correction of our algorithm is based on the
connectedness under mutations of the spaces of one-extensions of double
pseudoline arrangements, proved in this paper. Counting results derived from an
implementation of our algorithm are also reported.
