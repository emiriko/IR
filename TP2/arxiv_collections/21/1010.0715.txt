We prove two results with regard to rational inner functions in the
Schur-Agler class of the tridisk. Every rational inner function of degree
(n,1,1) is in the Schur-Agler class, and every rational inner function of
degree (n,m,1) is in the Schur-Agler class after multiplication by a monomial
of sufficiently high degree.
