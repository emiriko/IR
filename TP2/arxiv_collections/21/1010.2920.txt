We discuss the analogy of the behaviour of films and drops of liquid on a
rotating horizontal cylinder on the one hand and substrates with regular
one-dimensional wettability patterns on the other hand. Based on the similarity
between the respective governing long-wave equations we show that a drop of
partially wetting liquid on a rotating cylinder undergoes a depinning
transition when the rotation speed is increased. The transition occurs via a
sniper bifurcation as in a recently described scenario for drops depinning on
heterogeneous substrates.
