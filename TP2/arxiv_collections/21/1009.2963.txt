We have developed an all particle Fock-space relativistic coupled-cluster
method for two-valence atomic systems. We then describe a scheme to employ the
coupled-cluster wave function to calculate atomic properties. Based on these
developments we calculate the excitation energies, magnetic hyperfine constants
and electric dipole matrix elements of Sr, Ba and Yb. Further more, we
calculate the electric quadrupole HFS constants and the electric dipole matrix
elements of Sr$^+$, Ba$^+$ and Yb$^+$. For these we use the one-valence
coupled-cluster wave functions obtained as an intermediate in the two-valence
calculations. We also calculate the magnetic dipole hyperfine constants of
Yb$^+$.
