Although helioseismology has been used as an effective tool for studying the
physical mechanisms acting in most of the solar interior, the microscopic and
dynamics of the deep core is still not well understood. Helioseismological
anomalies may be partially resolved if the Sun captures light, non-annihilating
dark matter particles, a currently discussed dark matter candidate that is
motivated by recent direct detection limits. Once trapped, such particles (4-10
GeV) naturally fill the solar core. With the use of a well-defined stellar
evolution code that takes into account an accurate description of the capture
of dark matter particles by the Sun, we investigate the impact of such
particles in its inner core. Even a relatively small amount of dark matter
particles in the solar core will leave an imprint on the absolute frequency
values of gravity modes, as well as the equidistant spacing between modes of
the same degree. The period separation for gravity modes could reveal changes
of up to 3% for annihilating dark matter and of up to 20% for non-annihilating
dark matter. This effect is most pronounced in the case of the gravity dipole
(l=1) modes.
