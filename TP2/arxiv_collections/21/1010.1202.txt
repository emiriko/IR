We review the field of top-quark physics with an emphasis on experimental
techniques. The role of the top quark in the Standard Model of particle physics
is summarized and the basic phenomenology of top-quark production and decay is
introduced. We discuss how contributions from physics beyond the Standard Model
could affect top-quark properties or event samples. The many measurements made
at the Fermilab Tevatron, which test the Standard Model predictions or probe
for direct evidence of new physics using the top-quark event samples, are
reviewed here.
