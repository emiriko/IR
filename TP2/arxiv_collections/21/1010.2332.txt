Third-order nonlinear absorption and refraction coefficients of a few-layer
boron carbon nitride (BCN) and reduced graphene oxide (RGO) suspensions have
been measured at 3.2 eV in the femtosecond regime. Optical limiting behavior is
exhibited by BCN as compared to saturable absorption in RGO. Nondegenerate
time-resolved differential transmissions from BCN and RGO show different
relaxation times. These differences in the optical nonlinearity and carrier
dynamics are discussed in the light of semiconducting electronic band structure
of BCN vis-\`a-vis the Dirac linear band structure of graphene.
