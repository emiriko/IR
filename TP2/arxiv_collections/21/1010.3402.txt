We present a detailed study of the entanglement dynamics of a two-qubit
system coupled to independent non-Markovian environments, employing hierarchy
equations. This recently developed theoretical treatment can conveniently solve
non-Markovian problems and take into consideration the correlation between the
system and bath in an initial state. We concentrate on calculating the death
and rebirth time points of the entanglement to obtain a general view of the
concurrence curve and explore the behavior of entanglement dynamics with
respect to the coupling strength, the characteristic frequency of the noise
bath and the environment temperature.
