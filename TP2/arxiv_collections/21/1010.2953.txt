Four leading scientists in the field of the glass transition answer to a
series of questions formulated by the Editors (L. Berthier, G. Biroli, J.-P.
Bouchaud, L. Cipelletti, W. van Saarloos). No specific format has been imposed
to their answers: the scientists were free to answer or not to any given
question, using how much space they felt appropriate. After a first round of
answers, each author was given the opportunity to read the answers by his
colleagues and to adjust his own answers accordingly.
