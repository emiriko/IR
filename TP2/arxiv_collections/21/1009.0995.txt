By identifying non-local effects in systems of identical Bosonic qubits
through correlations of their commuting observables, we show that entanglement
is not necessary to violate certain squeezing inequalities that hold for
distinguishable qubits and that spin squeezing may not be necessary to achieve
sub-shot noise accuracies in ultra-cold atom interferometry.
