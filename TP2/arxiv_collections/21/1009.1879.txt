We study the dynamics of large dust grains >1 micron with orbits outside of
the heliosphere (beyond 250 AU). Motion of the Solar System through the
interstellar medium (ISM) at a velocity of 26 km/s subjects these particles to
gas and Coulomb drag (grains are expected to be photoelectrically charged) as
well as the Lorentz force and the electric force caused by the induction
electric field. We show that to zeroth order the combined effect of these
forces can be well described in the framework of the classical Stark problem:
particle motion in a Keplerian potential subject to an additional constant
force. Based on this analogy, we elucidate the circumstances in which the
motion becomes unbound, and show that under local ISM conditions dust grains
smaller than ~100 microns originating in the Oort Cloud (e.g. in collisions of
comets) beyond 10000 AU are ejected from the Solar System under the action of
the electric force. Orbital motion of larger, bound grains is described
analytically using the orbit-averaged Hamiltonian approach and consists of
orbital plane precession at a fixed semi-major axis, accompanied by the
periodic variations of the inclination and eccentricity (the latter may
approach unity in some cases). A more detailed analysis of the combined effect
of gas and Coulomb drag shows it is possible to reduce particle semi-major
axes, but that the degree of orbital decay is limited (a factor of several at
best) by passages through atomic and molecular clouds, which easily eject small
particles.
