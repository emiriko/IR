In this note we derive a solution to the Schr\"odinger-type backward equation
which satisfies a necessary boundary condition used in hitting-time problems
[as described in Hern\'andez-del-Valle (2010a)]. We do so by using an idea
introduced by Bluman and Shtelen (1996) which is worked out in
Hern\'andez-del-Valle (2010b). This example is interesting since it is
independent of the parameter $\lambda$, namely: \kappa(s,x)=\frac{x}{\sqrt{2\pi
s}}\exp{-\frac{(x+\int_0^sf'(u))^2}{2s}}. and suggest a procedure to generating
more vanishing solutions and $x=0$.
