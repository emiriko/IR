We analytically and numerically investigate the possibility that a still
undiscovered body X, moving along an unbound hyperbolic path from outside the
solar system, may penetrate its inner regions in the next few years posing a
threat to the Earth. By conservatively using as initial position the lower
bounds on the present-day distance dX of X dynamically inferred from the
gravitational perturbations induced by it on the orbital motions of the planets
of the solar system, both the analyses show that, in order to reach the Earth's
orbit in the next 2 yr, X should move at a highly unrealistic speed v, whatever
its mass MX is. For example, by assuming for it a solar (MX =M_Sun) or brown
dwarf mass (MX = 80mJup), now at not less than dX = 11-6 kau (1 kau=1000
astronomical units), v would be of the order of 6-10% and 3-5% of the speed of
light c, respectively. By assuming larger present-day distances for X, on the
basis of the lacking of direct observational evidences of electromagnetic
origin for it, its speed would be even higher. Instead, the fastest solitary
massive objects known so far, like hypervelocity stars (HVSs) and supernova
remnants (SRs), travel at v = 0.002-0.005c, having acquired so huge velocities
in some of the most violent astrophysical phenomena like interactions with
supermassive galactic black holes and supernova explosions. It turns out that
the orbit of the Earth would not be macroscopically altered by a close (0.2 au)
passage of such an ultrafast body X in the next 2 yr. On the contrary, our
planet would be hurled into the space if a Sun-sized body X would encounter it
by moving at v/c = 10^-4. On the other hand, this would imply that such a X
should be now at just 20-30 au, contrary to all direct observational and
indirect dynamical evidences.
