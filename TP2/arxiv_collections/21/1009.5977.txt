Phase diagram of the chiral random matrix model with U(1)A breaking term is
studied with the quark chemical potentials varied independently at zero
temperature, by taking the chiral and meson condensates as the order
parameters. Although, without the U(1)A breaking term, chiral transition of
each flavor can happen separately responding to its chemical potential, the
U(1)A breaking terms mix the chiral condensates and correlate the phase
transitions. In the three flavor case, we find that there are mixings between
the meson and chiral condensates due to the U(1)A anomaly, which makes the
meson condensed phase more stable. Increasing the hypercharge chemical
potential ($\mu_Y$) with the isospin and quark chemical potentials ($\mu_I$,
$\mu_q$) kept small, we observe that the kaon condensed phase becomes the
ground state and at the larger $\mu_Y$ the pion condense phase appears
unexpectedly, which is caused by the competition between the chiral restoration
and the meson condensation. The similar happens when $\mu_Y$ and $\mu_I$ are
exchanged, and the kaon condensed phase becomes the ground state at larger
$\mu_I$ below the full chiral restoration.
