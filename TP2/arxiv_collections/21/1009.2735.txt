Oblivious transfer is the cryptographic primitive where Alice sends one of
two bits to Bob but is oblivious to the bit received. Using quantum
communication, we can build oblivious transfer protocols with security provably
better than any protocol built using classical communication. However, with
imperfect apparatus one needs to consider other attacks. In this paper we
present an oblivious transfer protocol which is impervious to lost messages.
