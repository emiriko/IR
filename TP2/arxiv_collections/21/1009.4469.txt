The CCD Modeling Activity was designed to supplement the curriculum of the
Electrical and Computing Engineering Technology program at the Maui Community
College. The activity was designed to help learners understand how a Charge
Coupled Device (CCD) works. A team of visiting graduate students was invited to
teach an activity through the Teaching and Curriculum Collaborative (TeCC) as
part of the Center for Adaptive Optics/Institute for Science and Engineer
Educators Professional Development Program. One of the primary goals was to
have students gain an understanding of the function of a CCD by constructing a
model representing the CCD readout process. In this paper we discuss the design
and implementation of the activity and the challenges we faced.
