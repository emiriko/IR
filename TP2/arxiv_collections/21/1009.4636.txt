The standard model of planet formation considers an initial phase in which
planetesimals form from a dust disk, followed by a phase of mutual
planetesimal-planetesimal collisions, leading eventually to the formation of
planetary embryos. However, there is a potential transition phase (which we
call the "snowball phase"), between the formation of the first planetesimals
and the onset of mutual collisions amongst them, which has often been either
ignored or underestimated in previous studies. In this snowball phase, isolated
planetesimals move on Keplerian orbits and grow solely via the direct accretion
of sub-cm sized dust entrained with the gas in the protoplanetary disk. Using a
simplified model in which planetesimals are progressively produced from the
dust, we consider the expected sizes to which the planetesimals can grow before
mutual collisions commence and derive the dependence of this size on a number
of critical parameters, including the degree of disk turbulence, the
planetesimal size at birth and the rate of planetesimal creation. For systems
in which turbulence is weak and the planetesimals are created at a low rate and
with relatively small birth size, we show that the snowball growth phase can be
very important, allowing planetesimals to grow by a factor of 10^6 in mass
before mutual collisions take over. In such cases, the snowball growth phase
can be the dominant mode to transfer mass from the dust to planetesimals.
Moreover, such growth can take place within the typical lifetime of a
protoplanetary gas disk. A noteworthy result is that ... ...(see the paper).
For the specific case of close binaries such as Alpha Centauri ... ... (see the
paper). From a more general perspective, these preliminary results suggest that
an efficient snowball growth phase provides a large amount of "room at the
bottom" for theories of planet formation.
