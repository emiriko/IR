The unparticle effects on the $\Bs$-$\Bsbar$ mixing is revisited. Taking into
account the unitarity constraints on the unparticle operators, we find that the
contribution of the vector unparticle is very suppressed compared to that of
the scalar unparticle. This is due to the fact that the lower bound of the
scaling dimension of the vector-unparticle operator is larger. It is also shown
that the mixing phase from the scalar unparticle is negative, and unparticles
can produce large mixing phase.
