We present some phenomenology of the Higgs sector of the Minimal $B-L$ U(1)
Extension of the Standard Model at the Large Hadron Collider. In this model,
the existence of an extra gauge boson ($Z'$) and an extra scalar (heavy Higgs)
are predicted as naturally related with the breaking of the $B-L$ (baryon minus
lepton number) symmetry. For this, we have started by deriving the unitarity
bounds in the high energy limit for the Minimal $B-L$ Model parameter space.
This was accomplished by analysing the full class of Higgs and would-be
Goldstone boson two-to-two scatterings at tree level (exploiting the
Equivalence Theorem). Hence, we studied some peculiar signature that could be
observed at the CERN machine in the search of both light and heavy Higgs
bosons.
