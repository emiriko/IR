It is explained why the interpretation of the resonances $f_{2}(1270),$
$a_{1}(1260)$ and $f_{0}(1370)$ as quark-antiquark states is legitimate. The
result of the quark model and of recently performed Bethe-Salpeter studies are
not (necessarily) in conflict and can be understood as two different approaches
toward the description of the same quark-antiquark resonances.
