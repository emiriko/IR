We report about a combined structural and magnetometric characterization of
self-assembled magnetic nanoparticle arrays. Monodisperse iron oxide
nanoparticles with a diameter of 20 nm were synthesized by thermal
decomposition. The nanoparticle suspension was spin-coated on Si substrates to
achieve self-organized arrays of particles and subsequently annealed at various
conditions. The samples were characterized by x-ray diffraction, bright and
dark field high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The
structural analysis is compared to the magnetic behavior investigated by
superconducting interference device (SQUID) magnetometry. We can identify
either multi-phase FeO/g-Fe2O3 or multi-phase FeO/Fe3O4 nanoparticles. The
FeO/g-Fe2O3 system shows a pronounced exchange bias effect which explains the
peculiar magnetization data obtained for this system.
