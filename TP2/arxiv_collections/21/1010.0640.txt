We use the theory of finite W-algebras associated to nilpotent orbits in the
Lie algebra g = gl_N(C) to give another proof of Moeglin's theorem about
completely prime primitive ideals in the enveloping algebra U(g). We also make
some new observations about Joseph's Goldie rank polynomials in Cartan type A.
