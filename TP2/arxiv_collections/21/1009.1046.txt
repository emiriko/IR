The search for the Standard Model Higgs boson in proton-antiproton collisions
at 1.96 TeV performed by CDF and D0 collaborations at the Tevatron collider is
reported in this paper. The Higgs candidate events are reconstructed using
different final states in order to optimize the sensitivity in the full range
of the Higgs mass. The presented results use different statistical samples
collected by the Tevatron up to 5.9 1/fb. Combining the most updated limits
provided by the two experiments for all the final states analysed, the Standard
Model Higgs boson is excluded at 95% C.L. in the mass range 158 - 175 GeV/c^2,
in good agreement with the prediction for the analysed data sample.
