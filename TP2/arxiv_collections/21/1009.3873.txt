We studied the reflectivity spectra of amorphous silicon dioxide detected
under vacuum UV synchrotron radiation as a function of temperature between 10
and 300 K. Kramers-Kronig dispersion analysis of reflectivity spectra allowed
us to determine the absorption coefficient in the range from 8 to 17.5 eV.
Spectra show four main peaks, the spectral positions of which are consistent
with literature data. An appreciable dependence of the line-shape on
temperature is observed for the first two peaks only. We demonstrate the
exciton peak at 10.4 eV to have a very good Lorentzian band-shape at all the
examined temperatures. Based on existing theoretical models, this allows to
argue excitons in SiO2 to be weakly scattered by phonons, thus retaining their
mobility properties notwithstanding the effects of exciton-phonon coupling and
of intrinsic structural disorder of amorphous SiO2. Moreover, the observed
temperature dependence of the peak position together with the features of the
Urbach absorption tail and of self-trapped exciton emission allow us to
estimate the main parameters ruling exciton dynamics in SiO2. The features of
the intrinsic Urbach absorption tail can be satisfactorily explained as a
consequence of those of the first excitonic peak, supporting the interpretation
of the Urbach tail in SiO2 as a consequence of the momentary self-trapping of
the 10.4 eV exciton. Finally, the characteristics of the other energy peaks are
discussed and an excitonic origin also for the 11.6 eV peak is put forward. On
the whole, our results show that exciton dynamics accounts for all optical
properties of pure silicon dioxide from 8 up to 11 eV.
