We test the methods for computing the Picard group of a $K3$ surface in a
situation of high rank. The examples chosen are resolutions of quartics in
$\bP^3$ having 14 singularities of type $A_1$. Our computations show that the
method of R. van Luijk works well when sufficiently large primes are used.
