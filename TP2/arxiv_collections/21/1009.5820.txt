The Kennard-type uncertainty relation $\Delta x\Delta p >\frac{\hbar}{2}$ is
formulated for a free particle with given momentum < \hat{p}>$ inside a box
with periodic boundary conditions in the large box limit. Our construction of a
free particle state is analogous to that of the Bloch wave in a periodic
potential. A simple Robertson-type relation, which minimizes the effect of the
box boundary and may be useful in some practical applications, is also
presented.
