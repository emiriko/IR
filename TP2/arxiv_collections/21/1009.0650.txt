Several ways are demonstrated of how periodic potentials can be exploited for
sorting molecules or other small objects which only differ by their chirality.
With the help of a static bias force, the two chiral partners can be made to
move along orthogonal directions. Time-periodic external forces even lead to
motion into exactly opposite directions.
