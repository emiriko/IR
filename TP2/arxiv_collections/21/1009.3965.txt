The exact treatment of nuclei starting from the constituent nucleons and the
fundamental interactions among them has been a long-standing goal in nuclear
physics. Above all nuclear scattering and reactions, which require the solution
of the many-body quantum-mechanical problem in the continuum, represent a
theoretical and computational challenge for ab initio approaches. After a brief
overview of the field, we present a new ab initio many-body approach capable of
describing simultaneously both bound and scattering states in light nuclei. By
combining the resonating-group method with the ab initio no-core shell model,
we complement a microscopic cluster technique with the use of realistic
interactions and a microscopic and consistent description of the clusters. We
show results for neutron and proton scattering on light nuclei, including p-7Be
and n-8He. We also highlight the first results of the d-3He and d-3H fusion
calculations obtained within this approach.
