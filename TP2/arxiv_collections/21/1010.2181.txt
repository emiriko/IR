We prove the existence of an Abelian variety $A$ of dimension $g$ over $\Qa$
which is not isogenous to any Jacobian, subject to the necessary condition
$g>3$. Recently, C.Chai and F.Oort gave such a proof assuming the Andr\'e-Oort
conjecture. We modify their proof by constructing a special sequence of CM
points for which we can avoid any unproven hypotheses. We make use of various
techniques from the recent work of Klingler-Yafaev et al.
