The corrections to the gravitational potential due to a Sol extra dimensional
compact manifold, denoted as $M_A^3$, are studied. The total spacetime is
$M^4\times M_A^3$. We compare the range of the corrections to the range of the
$T^3$ corrections. It is found that for small values of the radius of the extra
dimensions ($R<10^{-6}$) the the Sol manifold corrections are large compared to
the 3-torus corrections. Also, Sol manifolds corrections can be larger,
comparable or smaller compared to the 3-torus case, for larger $R$.
