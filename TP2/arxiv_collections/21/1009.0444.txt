This course is aimed at graduate students in physics in mathematics and
designed to give a comprehensive introduction to Weyl quantization and
semiclassics via Egorov's theorem.
  Chapter 2 gives a quick overview of classical and quantum mechanics on R^d.
Some mathematical preliminaries concerning Hilbert space theory, operator
theory and tempered distributions are detailed in Chapters 3-5. Weyl
quantization and semiclassics are the content of Chapters 6 and 7. Finally, an
application of Weyl calculus to Born-Oppenheimer systems is discussed in
Chapter 8.
