Particle-gamma coincidences from the 46Ti(p,p' gamma)46Ti inelastic
scattering reaction with 15-MeV protons are utilized to obtain gamma-ray
spectra as a function of excitation energy. The rich data set allows analyzing
the coincidence data with various gates on excitation energy. This enables, for
many independent data sets, a simultaneous extraction of level density and
radiative strength function (RSF). The results are consistent with one common
level density. The data seem to exhibit a universal RSF as the deduced RSFs
from different excitation energies show only small fluctuations provided that
only excitation energies above 3 MeV are taken into account. If transitions to
well-separated low-energy levels are included, the deduced RSF may change by a
factor of 2-3, which might be expected due to the involved Porter-Thomas
fluctuations.
