There have been significant recent advances in mobile networks, specifically
in multi-hop wireless networks including DTNs and sensor networks. It is
critical to have a testing environment to realistically evaluate such networks
and their protocols and services. Towards this goal, we propose a novel, mobile
testbed of two main components. The first consists of a network of robots with
personality- mimicking, human-encounter behaviors, which will be the focus of
this demo. The personality is build upon behavioral profiling of mobile users
based on extensive wireless-network measurements and analysis. The second
component combines the testbed with the human society using a new concept that
we refer to as participatory testing utilizing crowd sourcing.
