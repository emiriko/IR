By solving the first-order algebraic field equations which arise in the dual
formulation of the D=2 principal chiral model (PCM) we construct an integrated
Lax formalism built explicitly on the dual fields of the model rather than the
currents. The Lagrangian of the dual scalar field theory is also constructed.
Furthermore we present the first-order PDE system for an exponential
parametrization of the solutions and discuss the Frobenious integrability of
this system.
