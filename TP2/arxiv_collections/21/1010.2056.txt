Following Wolszczan's landmark discovery of planets in orbit around pulsar
PSR B1257+12 in 1991, over 300 planets in more than 200 planetary systems have
been found. Therefore, the meaning of Wolszczan's discovery cannot be
overestimated. In this paper we aim to convince the reader that the objects
accompanying pulsar PSR B1257+12 are more exotic than thought so far. They
might not be ordinary planets but dwarf strange quark stars, whereas the pulsar
might be a quark star with standard mass, not a neutron star. If this was the
case, it would indicate that strange quark matter is the ground state of
matter.
