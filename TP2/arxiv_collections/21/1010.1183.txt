The crystal structure and the magnetism of BaMn$_2$O$_3$ have been studied by
thermodynamic and by diffraction techniques using large single crystals and
powders. BaMn$_2$O$_3$ is a realization of a $S = 5/2$ spin ladder as the
magnetic interaction is dominant along 180$^\circ$ Mn-O-Mn bonds forming the
legs and the rungs of a ladder. The temperature dependence of the magnetic
susceptibility exhibits well-defined maxima for all directions proving the
low-dimensional magnetic character in BaMn$_2$O$_3$. The susceptibility and
powder neutron diffraction data, however, show that BaMn$_2$O$_3$ exhibits a
transition to antiferromagnetic order at 184 K, in spite of a full frustration
of the nearest-neighbor inter-ladder coupling in the orthorhombic
high-temperature phase. This frustration is lifted by a remarkably strong
monoclinic distortion which accompanies the magnetic transition.
