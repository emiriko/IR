Major progress has been made over the last few years in understanding
hydrodynamical processes on cosmological scales, in particular how galaxies get
their baryons. There is increasing recognition that a large part of the baryons
accrete smoothly onto galaxies, and that internal evolution processes play a
major role in shaping galaxies - mergers are not necessarily the dominant
process. However, predictions from the various assembly mechanisms are still in
large disagreement with the observed properties of galaxies in the nearby
Universe. Small-scale processes have a major impact on the global evolution of
galaxies over a Hubble time and the usual sub-grid models account for them in a
far too uncertain way. Understanding when, where and at which rate galaxies
formed their stars becomes crucial to understand the formation of galaxy
populations. I discuss recent improvements and current limitations in
"resolved" modelling of star formation, aiming at explicitely capturing
star-forming instabilities, in cosmological and galaxy-sized simulations. Such
models need to develop three-dimensional turbulence in the ISM, which requires
parsec-scale resolution at redshift zero.
