Coronal holes are the coolest and darkest regions of the solar atmosphere, as
observed both on the solar disk and above the solar limb. Coronal holes are
associated with rapidly expanding open magnetic fields and the acceleration of
the high-speed solar wind. During the years of the solar minima, coronal holes
are generally confined to the Sun's polar regions, while at solar maxima they
can also be found at lower latitudes. Waves, observed via remote sensing and
detected in-situ in the wind streams, are most likely responsible for the wind
and several theoretical models describe the role of MHD waves in the
acceleration of the fast solar wind. This paper reviews the observational
evidences of detection of propa- gating waves in these regions. The
characteristics of the waves, like periodicities, amplitude, speed provide
input parameters and also act as constraints on theoretical models of coronal
heating and solar wind acceleration.
