We discuss formulations of boundary conditions in a quantum graph vertex and
demonstrate that the so-called $ST$-form can be further reduced up to a form
more effective in certain applications: In particular, in identifying the
number of independent parameters for given ranks of two connection matrices, or
in calculating the scattering matrix when both matrices are singular. The new
form of boundary conditions, called the $PQRS$-form, also gives a natural
scheme to design generalized low and high pass quantum filters.
