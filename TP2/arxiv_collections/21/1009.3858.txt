We study the commutation relations within the Pauli groups built on all
decompositions of a given Hilbert space dimension $q$, containing a square,
into its factors. Illustrative low dimensional examples are the quartit ($q=4$)
and two-qubit ($q=2^2$) systems, the octit ($q=8$), qubit/quartit ($q=2\times
4$) and three-qubit ($q=2^3$) systems, and so on. In the single qudit case,
e.g. $q=4,8,12,...$, one defines a bijection between the $\sigma (q)$ maximal
commuting sets [with $\sigma[q)$ the sum of divisors of $q$] of Pauli
observables and the maximal submodules of the modular ring $\mathbb{Z}_q^2$,
that arrange into the projective line $P_1(\mathbb{Z}_q)$ and a independent set
of size $\sigma (q)-\psi(q)$ [with $\psi(q)$ the Dedekind psi function]. In the
multiple qudit case, e.g. $q=2^2, 2^3, 3^2,...$, the Pauli graphs rely on
symplectic polar spaces such as the generalized quadrangles GQ(2,2) (if
$q=2^2$) and GQ(3,3) (if $q=3^2$). More precisely, in dimension $p^n$ ($p$ a
prime) of the Hilbert space, the observables of the Pauli group (modulo the
center) are seen as the elements of the $2n$-dimensional vector space over the
field $\mathbb{F}_p$. In this space, one makes use of the commutator to define
a symplectic polar space $W_{2n-1}(p)$ of cardinality $\sigma(p^{2n-1})$, that
encodes the maximal commuting sets of the Pauli group by its totally isotropic
subspaces. Building blocks of $W_{2n-1}(p)$ are punctured polar spaces (i.e. a
observable and all maximum cliques passing to it are removed) of size given by
the Dedekind psi function $\psi(p^{2n-1})$. For multiple qudit mixtures (e.g.
qubit/quartit, qubit/octit and so on), one finds multiple copies of polar
spaces, ponctured polar spaces, hypercube geometries and other intricate
structures. Such structures play a role in the science of quantum information.
