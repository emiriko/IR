We present two new luminous blue variable (LBV) candidate stars discovered in
the M33 galaxy. We identified these stars (Valeev et al. 2010) as massive star
candidates at the final stages of evolution, presumably with a notable
interstellar extinction. The candidates were selected from the Massey et al.
(2006) catalog based on the following criteria: emission in Halpha, V<18.5 and
0.35<(B-V)<1.2. The spectra of both stars reveal a broad and strong Halpha
emission with extended wings (770 and 1000 km/s). Based on the spectra we
estimated the main parameters of the stars. Object N45901 has a bolometric
luminosity log(L/Lsun)=6.0-6.2 with the value of interstellar extinction
Av=2.3+-0.1. The temperature of the star's photosphere is estimated as
Tstar~13000-15000K its probable mass on the Zero Age Main Sequence is
M~60-80Msun. The infrared excess in N45901 corresponds to the emission of warm
dust with the temperature Twarm~1000K, and amounts to 0.1% of the bolometric
luminosity. A comparison of stellar magnitude estimates from different catalogs
points to the probable variability of the object N45901. Bolometric luminosity
of the second object, N125093, is log(L/Lsun)=6.3-6.6, the value of
interstellar extinction is Av=2.75+-0.15. We estimate its photosphere's
temperature as Tstar~13000-16000K, the initial mass as M~90-120Msun. The
infrared excess in N125093 amounts to 5-6% of the bolometric luminosity. Its
spectral energy distribution reveals two thermal components with the
temperatures Twarm~1000K and Tcold~480K. The [CaII] lines (7291A and 7323A),
observed in LBV-like stars VarA and N93351 in M33, are also present in the
spectrum of N125093. These lines indicate relatively recent gas eruptions and
dust activity linked with them. High bolometric luminosity of these stars and
broad Halpha emissions allow classifying the studied objects as LBV candidates.
