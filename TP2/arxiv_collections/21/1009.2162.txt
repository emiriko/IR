By studying the 109Xe-->105Te-->101Sn superallowed alpha-decay chain, we
observe low-lying states in 101Sn, the one-neutron system outside doubly magic
100Sn. We find that the spins of the ground state (J = 7=2) and first excited
state (J = 5=2) in 101Sn are reversed with respect to the traditional level
ordering postulated for 103Sn and the heavier tin isotopes. Through simple
arguments and state-of-the-art shell model calculations we explain this
unexpected switch in terms of a transition from the single-particle regime to
the collective mode in which orbital-dependent pairing correlations, dominate.
