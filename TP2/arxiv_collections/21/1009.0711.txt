We consider a holographic model of QCD, obtained by a very simple
modification of the original construction, which describes at the same time the
pion mass, the QCD anomalies and the baryons as topological solitons. We study
in detail its phenomenological implications in both the mesonic and baryonic
sectors and compare with the observations.
