This short note suggests a heuristic method for detecting the dependence of
random time series that can be used in the case when this dependence is
relatively weak and such that the traditional methods are not effective. The
method requires to compare some special functionals on the sample
characteristic functions with the same functionals computed for the benchmark
time series with a known degree of correlation. Some experiments for financial
time series are presented.
