In P2P systems, large volumes of data are declustered naturally across a
large number of peers. But it is very difficult to control the initial data
distribution because every user has the freedom to share any data with other
users. The system scalability can be improved by distributing the load across
multiple servers which is proposed by replication. The large scale content
distribution systems were improved broadly using the replication techniques.
The demanded contents can be brought closer to the clients by multiplying the
source of information geographically, which in turn reduce both the access
latency and the network traffic. In addition to this, due to the intrinsic
dynamism of the P2P environment, static data distribution cannot be expected to
guarantee good load balancing. If the hot peers become bottleneck, it leads to
increased user response time and significant performance degradation of the
system. Hence an effective load balancing mechanism is necessary in such cases
and it can be attained efficiently by intelligent data replication. In this
paper, we propose a cluster based replication architecture for load-balancing
in peer-to-peer content distribution systems. In addition to an intelligent
replica placement technique, it also consists of an effective load balancing
technique. In the intelligent replica placement technique, peers are grouped
into strong and weak clusters based on their weight vector which comprises
available capacity, CPU speed, access latency and memory size. In order to
achieve complete load balancing across the system, an intracluster and
inter-cluster load balancing algorithms are proposed. We are able to show that
our proposed architecture attains less latency and better throughput with
reduced bandwidth usage, through the simulation results.
