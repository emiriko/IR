We consider theoretically tunneling characteristic of a junction between a
normal metal and a chain of coupled Majorana bound states generated at
crossings between topological and non-topological superconducting sections, as
a result of, for example, disorder in nanowires. While an isolated Majorana
state supports a resonant Andreev process, yielding a zero bias differential
conductance peak of height 2e^2/h, the situation with more coupled Majorana
states is distinctively different with both zeros and 2e^2/h peaks in the
differential conductance. We derive a general expression for the current
between a normal metal and a network of coupled Majorana bound states and
describe the differential conductance spectra for a generic set of situations,
including regular, disordered, and infinite chains of bound states.
