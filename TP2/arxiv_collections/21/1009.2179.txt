We study dynamics of entropy perturbations in the two-field assisted dark
energy model. Based on the scenario of assisted dark energy, in which one
scalar field is subdominant compared with the other in the early epoch, we show
that the entropy perturbations in this two-field system tend to be constant on
large scales in the early epoch and hence survive until the present era for a
generic evolution of both fields during the radiation and matter eras. This
behaviour of the entropy perturbations is preserved even when the fields are
coupled via kinetic interaction. Since, for assisted dark energy, the
subdominant field in the early epoch becomes dominant at late time, the entropy
perturbations can significantly influence the dynamics of density perturbations
in the universe. Assuming correlations between the entropy and curvature
perturbations, the entropy perturbations can enhance the integrated Sachs-Wolfe
(ISW) effect if the signs of the contributions from entropy perturbations and
curvature perturbations are opposite after the matter era, otherwise the ISW
contribution is suppressed. For canonical scalar field the effect of entropy
perturbations on ISW effect is small because the initial value of the entropy
perturbations estimated during inflation cannot be sufficiently large. However,
in the case of k-essence, the initial value of the entropy perturbations can be
large enough to affect the ISW effect to leave a significant imprint on the CMB
power spectrum.
