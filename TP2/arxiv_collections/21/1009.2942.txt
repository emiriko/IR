We propose a statistical mechanical derivation of Kahler-Einstein metrics,
i.e. solutions to Einstein's vacuum field equations in Euclidean signature
(with a cosmological constant) on a compact Kahler manifold X. The microscopic
theory is given by a canonical free fermion gas on X whose one-particle states
are pluricanonical holomorphic sections on X (coinciding with higher spin
states in the case of a Riemann surface). A heuristic, but hopefully physically
illuminating, argument for the convergence in the thermodynamical (large N)
limit is given, based on a recent mathematically rigorous result about
exponentially small fluctuations of Slater determinants. Relations to effective
bosonization and the Yau-Tian-Donaldson program in Kahler geometry are pointed
out. The precise mathematical details will be investigated elsewhere.
