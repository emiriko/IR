We review recent activity searching for variations in the fundamental
constants of nature in quasar absorption spectra and in the laboratory. While
research in this direction has been ongoing for many decades, the topic has
recently been stimulated by astronomical evidence for spatial variation in the
fine-structure constant, alpha. This result could be confirmed using different
quasar data and atomic clock measurements, but there are significant challenges
to obtain the required accuracy. We review existing measurements and discuss
some of the most promising systems where any variations would be strongly
enhanced.
