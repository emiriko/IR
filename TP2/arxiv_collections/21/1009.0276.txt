Sequences of Nilsson type appear in abundance in Algebraic Geometry,
Enumerative Combinatorics, Mathematical Physics and Quantum Topology. We give
an elementary introduction on this subject, including the definition of
sequences of Nilsson type and the uniqueness, existence, and effective
computation of their asymptotic expansion.
