We present here results of an optical spectroscopic study of a new
Cataclysmic Variable SDSS J001856.93+345444.3. We demonstrate that the most
probable value of the orbital period of the system is Porb = 0.6051 \pm 0.022
days (=14.5226 hours), based on the measurements of radial velocity of a
complex of absorption features emanating from the K2-K4V type secondary
component. However, the radial velocity measurements from the emission lines
are best folded with the period Pem = 0.5743day (=13.78 hours). The
gamma-velocity of the emission lines varies significantly from epoch to epoch.
There is an underlying broader and weaker component to the emission lines,
which we could not resolve. Based on the appearance of the emission lines, the
presence of very strong He II lines and the moderate polarization detected by
Dillon et al. (2008), we conclude that SDSS J0018+3454 is an asynchronous
magnetic CV (Polar).
