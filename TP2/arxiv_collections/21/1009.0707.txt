In the context of Markov evolution, we present two original approaches to
obtain Generalized Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorems (GFDT), by using the
language of stochastic derivatives and by using a family of exponential
martingales functionals. We show that GFDT are perturbative versions of
relations verified by these exponential martingales. Along the way, we prove
GFDT and Fluctuation Relations (FR) for general Markov processes, beyond the
usual proof for diffusion and pure jump processes. Finally, we relate the FR to
a family of backward and forward exponential martingales.
