In this work one shows that a generalized non-minimal coupling between
geometry and matter is compatible with Starobinsky inflation and leads to a
successful process of preheating, a reheating scenario based on the production
of massive particles via parametric resonance. The model naturally extends the
usual preheating mechanism, which resorts to an {\it ad-hoc} scalar
curvature-dependent mass term for a scalar field $\chi$, and also encompasses a
previously studied preheating channel based upon a non-standard kinetic term.
