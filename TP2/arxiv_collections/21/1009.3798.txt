Inference in probabilistic logic languages such as ProbLog, an extension of
Prolog with probabilistic facts, is often based on a reduction to a
propositional formula in DNF. Calculating the probability of such a formula
involves the disjoint-sum-problem, which is computationally hard. In this work
we introduce a new approximation method for ProbLog inference which exploits
the DNF to focus sampling. While this DNF sampling technique has been applied
to a variety of tasks before, to the best of our knowledge it has not been used
for inference in probabilistic logic systems. The paper also presents an
experimental comparison with another sampling based inference method previously
introduced for ProbLog.
