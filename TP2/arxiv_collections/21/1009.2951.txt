Observations from the Hinode X-ray telescope (XRT) are used to study the
structure of X-ray bright points (XBPs), sources of coronal jets. Several jet
events are found to erupt from S-shaped bright points, suggesting that coronal
micro-sigmoids are progenitors of the jets. The observations may help to
explain numerous characteristics of coronal jets, such as helical structures
and shapes. They also suggest that solar activity may be self-similar within a
wide range of scales in terms of both properties and evolution of the observed
coronal structures.
