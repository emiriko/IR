Using the recent results for the two-parton light-cone distribution
amplitudes of the tensor meson, we calculate the form factors for the decays of
$B_{u,d,s}$ into the light $J^{PC}=2^{++}$ tensor mesons via the
vector/axial-vector/tensor current with the light-cone sum rules. We also
obtain the $q^2$-dependence of the form factors.
