We present a brief overview of axion models associated to anomalous abelian
(gauge) symmetries, discussing their main phenomenological features. Among
these, the mechanism of vacuum misalignment introduced at the QCD and at the
electroweak phase transitions, with the appearance of periodic potentials,
responsible for the generation of a mass for these types of axions.
