We develop a proto-model of an off-axis reflective telescope for infrared
wide-field observations based on the design of Schwarzschild-Chang type
telescope. With only two mirrors, this design achieves an entrance pupil
diameter of 50 mm and an effective focal length of 100 mm. We can apply this
design to a mid-infrared telescope with a field of view of 8 deg X 8 deg. In
spite of the substantial advantages of off-axis telescopes in the infrared
compared to refractive or on-axis reflective telescopes, it is known to be
difficult to align the mirrors in off-axis systems because of their asymmetric
structures. Off-axis mirrors of our telescope are manufactured at the Korea
Basic Science Institute (KBSI). We analyze the fabricated mirror surfaces by
fitting polynomial functions to the measured data. We accomplish alignment of
this two-mirror off-axis system using a ray tracing method. A simple imaging
test is performed to compare a pinhole image with a simulated prediction.
