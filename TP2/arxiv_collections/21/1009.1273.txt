The two dimensional electron gas formed between the two band insulators
SrTiO3 and LaAlO3 exhibits a variety of interesting physical properties which
make it an appealing material for use in future spintronics and/or quantum
computing devices. For this kind of applications electrons have to retain their
phase memory for sufficiently long times or length. Using a mesoscopic size
device we were able to extract the phase coherence length, and its temperature
variation. We find the dephasing rate to have a power law dependence on
temperature. The power depends on the temperature range studied and sheet
resistance as expected from dephasing due to strong electron-electron
interactions.
