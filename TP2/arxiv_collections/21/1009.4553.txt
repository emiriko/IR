Two granular gases separated by an adiabatic piston and initially in the same
macroscopic state are considered. It is found that a phase transition with an
spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs. When the mass of the piston is increased
beyond a critical value, the piston moves to a stationary position different
from the middle of the system. The transition is accurately described by a
simple kinetic model that takes into account the velocity fluctuations of the
piston. Interestingly, the final state is not characterized by the equality of
the temperatures of the subsystems but by the cooling rates being the same.
Some relevant consequences of this feature are discussed.
