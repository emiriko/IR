We study high-order harmonic generation in aligned molecules close to the
ionization threshold. Two distinct contributions to the harmonic signal are
observed, which show very different responses to molecular alignment and
ellipticity of the driving field. We perform a classical electron trajectory
analysis, taking into account the significant influence of the Coulomb
potential on the strong-field-driven electron dynamics. The two contributions
are related to primary ionization and excitation processes, offering a deeper
understanding of the origin of high harmonics near the ionization threshold.
This work shows that high harmonic spectroscopy can be extended to the
near-threshold spectral range, which is in general spectroscopically rich.
