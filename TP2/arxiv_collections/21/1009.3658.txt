We calculate the strong coupling constants of light pseudoscalar mesons with
heavy baryons within the light cone QCD sum rules method. It is shown that
sextet--sextet, sextet--antitriplet and antitriplet--antitriplet transitions
are described by one universal invariant function for each class. A comparison
of our results on the coupling constants with the predictions existing in
literature is also presented.
