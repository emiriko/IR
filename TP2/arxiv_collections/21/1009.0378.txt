Gyrokinetic theory is based on an asymptotic expansion in the small parameter
$\epsilon$, defined as the ratio of the gyroradius and the characteristic
length of variation of the magnetic field. In this article, this ordering is
strictly implemented to compute the electrostatic gyrokinetic phase-space
Lagrangian in general magnetic geometry to order $\epsilon^2$. In particular, a
new expression for the complete second-order gyrokinetic Hamiltonian is
provided, showing that in a rigorous treatment of gyrokinetic theory magnetic
geometry and turbulence cannot be dealt with independently. The new phase-space
gyrokinetic Lagrangian gives a Vlasov equation accurate to order $\epsilon^2$
and a Poisson equation accurate to order $\epsilon$. The final expressions are
explicit and can be implemented into any simulation without further
computations.
