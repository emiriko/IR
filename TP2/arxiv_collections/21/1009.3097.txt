The procedure of comprehensive analysis of instability of current sheathes in
a wide range of frequencies and wave lengths in the electrically neutral
approximation has been developed. This comprehensive analysis of instability is
based on the consecutive solution of the kinetic equation with a
self-consistent electromagnetic field (Vlasov's equation). For the first time
the dispersion equation for the sharply inhomogeneous plasma of current sheath
is introduced and the tensor of dielectric permeability is calculated.
