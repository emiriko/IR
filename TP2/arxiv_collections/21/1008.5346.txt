A recent publication [D.G. Jenkins, Phys. Rev. C \textbf{80}, 054303 (2009)]
claims to discredit the experimental observation of two-proton decay of the
(21$^+$) high-spin isomer in $^{94}$Ag [I. Mukha \emph{et al.,} Nature (London)
\textbf{439}, 298 (2006)]. Its conclusion, which would require a
reestablishment of the two-proton emission, is made on the basis of unwarranted
assumptions by Jenkins concerning the data analysis of the original work. We
provide proof that these assumptions do not correspond to reality, and that
therefore the conclusion of the paper is misleading.
