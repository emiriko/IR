We consider a simple stochastic differential equation for modeling bubbles in
social context. A prime example is bubbles in asset pricing, but similar
mechanisms may control a range of social phenomena driven by psychological
factors (for example, popularity of rock groups, or a number of students
pursuing a given major). Our goal is to study the simplest possible model in
which every term has a clear meaning and which demonstrates several key
behaviors. The main factors that enter are tendency of mean reversion to a
stable value, speculative social response triggered by trend following and
random fluctuations. The interplay of these three forces may lead to bubble
formation and collapse. Numerical simulations show that the equation has
distinct regimes depending on the values of the parameters. We perform rigorous
analysis of the weakly random regime, and study the role of change in
fundamentals in igniting the bubble.
