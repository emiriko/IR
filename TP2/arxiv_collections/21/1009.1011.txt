We propose to turn two resonant distant cavities effectively into one by
coupling them via an optical fiber which is coated with two-level atoms
[Franson et al., Phys. Rev. A 70, 062302 (2004)]. The purpose of the atoms is
to destructively measure the evanescent electric field of the fiber on a time
scale which is long compared to the time it takes a photon to travel from one
cavity to the other. Moreover, the boundary conditions imposed by the setup
should support a small range of standing waves inside the fiber, including one
at the frequency of the cavities. In this way, the fiber provides an additional
decay channel for one common cavity field mode but not for the other. If the
corresponding decay rate is sufficiently large, this mode decouples effectively
from the system dynamics. A single non-local resonator mode is created.
