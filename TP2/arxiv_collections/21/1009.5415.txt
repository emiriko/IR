More often than not, models of flavor symmetry rely on the use of
nonrenormalizable operators (in the guise of flavons) to accomplish the
phenomenologically successful tribimaximal mixing of neutrinos. We show instead
how a simple renormalizable two-parameter neutrino mass model of tribimaximal
mixing can be constructed with the non-Abelian discrete symmetry T_7 and the
gauging of B-L. This is also achieved without the addition of auxiliary
symmetries and particles present in almost all other proposals. Most
importantly, it is verifiable at the Large Hadron Collider.
