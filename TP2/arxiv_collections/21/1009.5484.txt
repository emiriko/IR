The structure of the pion wave function in the relativistic constituent quark
model is investigated in the explicitly covariant formulation of light-front
dynamics. We calculate the two relativistic components of the pion wave
function in a simple one-gluon exchange model and investigate various physical
observables: decay constant, charge radius, electromagnetic and transition form
factors. We discuss the influence of the full relativistic structure of the
pion wave function for an overall good description of all these observables,
including both low and high momentum scales.
