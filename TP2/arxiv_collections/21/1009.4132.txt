It has been widely thought that measuring the misalignment angle between the
orbital plane of a transiting exoplanet and the spin of its host star was a
good discriminator between different migration processes for hot-Jupiters.
Specifically, well-aligned hot-Jupiter systems (as measured by the
Rossiter-McLaughlin effect) were thought to have formed via migration through
interaction with a viscous disk, while misaligned systems were thought to have
undergone a more violent dynamical history. These conclusions were based on the
assumption that the planet-forming disk was well-aligned with the host star.
Recent work by a number of authors has challenged this assumption by proposing
mechanisms that act to drive the star-disk interaction out of alignment during
the pre-main sequence phase. We have estimated the stellar rotation axis of a
sample of stars which host spatially resolved debris disks. Comparison of our
derived stellar rotation axis inclination angles with the geometrically
measured debris-disk inclinations shows no evidence for a misalignment between
the two.
