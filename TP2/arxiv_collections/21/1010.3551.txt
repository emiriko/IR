The {\ell}-summed Wong expression is applied in the semiclassical extended
Thomas Fermi (ETF) method of Skyrme energy density formalism (SEDF), using both
the sudden and frozen-density approximations, to the case of 64Ni+64Ni reaction
data. We find that a very much improved fit (almost exact, point to point) to
the data is obtained for the frozen-density approximation with {\ell}max
(Ec.m.) varying smoothly. On the other hand, the same could not be achieved in
the sudden case, still requiring a modification of the barrier at both the
below- and above-barrier energies. This result means to say that the phenomenon
of hindrance, observed in coupled channel calculations for 64Ni+64Ni reaction,
could be explained simply on the basis of the {\ell}-summed Wong expression, at
least for the frozen-density approximation in ETF method of SEDF.
