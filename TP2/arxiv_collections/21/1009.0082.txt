We present an overview of recent work that focuses on understanding the
radiative feedback processes that are potentially important during Population
III star formation. Specifically, we examine the effect of the Lyman-Werner
(photodissociating) background on the early stages of primordial star
formation, which serves to delay the onset of star formation in a given halo
but never suppresses it entirely. We also examine the effect that both
photodissociating and ionizing radiation in I-fronts from nearby stellar
systems have on the formation of primordial protostellar clouds. Depending on
the strength of the incoming radiation field and the central density of the
halos, Pop III star formation can be suppressed, unaffected, or even enhanced.
Understanding these and other effects is crucial to modeling Population III
star formation and to building the earliest generations of galaxies in the
Universe.
