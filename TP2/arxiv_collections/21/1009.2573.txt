We report the design and development of a piezoelectric sample rotation
system, and its integration into an Oxford Instruments Kelvinox 100 dilution
refrigerator, for orientation-dependent studies of quantum transport in
semiconductor nanodevices at millikelvin temperatures in magnetic fields up to
10T. Our apparatus allows for continuous in situ rotation of a device through
>100deg in two possible configurations. The first enables rotation of the field
within the plane of the device, and the second allows the field to be rotated
from in-plane to perpendicular to the device plane. An integrated angle sensor
coupled with a closed-loop feedback system allows the device orientation to be
known to within +/-0.03deg whilst maintaining the sample temperature below
100mK.
