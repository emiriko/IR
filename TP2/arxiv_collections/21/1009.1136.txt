Several lines of evidence hint that quantum gravity at very small distances
may be effectively two-dimensional. I summarize the evidence for such
``spontaneous dimensional reduction,'' and suggest an additional argument
coming from the strong-coupling limit of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation. If this
description proves to be correct, it suggests a fascinating relationship
between small-scale quantum spacetime and the behavior of cosmologies near an
asymptotically silent singularity.
