We present a new numerical code, X-ECHO, for general relativistic
magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) in dynamical spacetimes. This is aimed at studying
astrophysical situations where strong gravity and magnetic fields are both
supposed to play an important role, such as for the evolution of magnetized
neutron stars or for the gravitational collapse of the magnetized rotating
cores of massive stars, which is the astrophysical scenario believed to
eventually lead to (long) GRB events. The code is based on the extension of the
Eulerian conservative high-order (ECHO) scheme [Del Zanna et al., A&A 473, 11
(2007)] for GRMHD, here coupled to a novel solver for the Einstein equations in
the extended conformally flat condition (XCFC). We fully exploit the 3+1
Eulerian formalism, so that all the equations are written in terms of familiar
3D vectors and tensors alone, we adopt spherical coordinates for the conformal
background metric, and we consider axisymmetric spacetimes and fluid
configurations. The GRMHD conservation laws are solved by means of
shock-capturing methods within a finite-difference discretization, whereas, on
the same numerical grid, the Einstein elliptic equations are treated by
resorting to spherical harmonics decomposition and solved, for each harmonic,
by inverting band diagonal matrices. As a side product, we build and make
available to the community a code to produce GRMHD axisymmetric equilibria for
polytropic relativistic stars in the presence of differential rotation and a
purely toroidal magnetic field. This uses the same XCFC metric solver of the
main code and has been named XNS. Both XNS and the full X-ECHO codes are
validated through several tests of astrophysical interest.
