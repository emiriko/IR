The first part of this note contains a review of basic properties of the
variety of lines contained in an embedded projective variety and passing
through a general point. In particular we provide a detailed proof that for
varieties defined by quadratic equations the base locus of the projective
second fundamental form at a general point coincides, as a scheme, with the
variety of lines. The second part concerns the problem of extending embedded
projective manifolds, using the geometry of the variety of lines. Some
applications to the case of homogeneous manifolds are included.
