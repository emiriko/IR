Unless the scale of electroweak symmetry breaking is stabilized dynamically,
most of the universes in a multiverse theory will lack an observable weak
nuclear interaction. Such "weakless universes" could support intelligent life
based on organic chemistry, as long as other parameters are properly adjusted.
By taking into account the seemingly-unrelated flavor dynamics that address the
hierarchy of quark masses and mixings, we show that such weakless (but
hospitable) universes can be far more common than universes like ours. The
gauge hierarchy problem therefore calls for a dynamical (rather than anthropic)
solution.
