In this work, we use the Hamiltonian of a modified Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
model and investigate the perfect transfer of the quantum state on the spin
networks. In this paper, we calculate fidelity in which fidelity depends on
magnetic field and another parameters. Then, by using the numerical analysis we
show that the fidelity of the transferred state is determined by magnetic field
$B$, exchange coupling $J$ and the Dzyaloshinskii- Moriya interaction $D$. We
also found that the perfect transfer of the quantum state is possible with
condition $B \gg \Gamma^2\omega^{N/2}$ where $\Gamma =((J+iD)/2)$ and
$\omega=\Gamma^*/ \Gamma$.
