We propose a device with a positive isotropic refractive index that creates
an approximate magnified perfect real image of an optically homogeneous
three-dimensional region of space within geometrical optics. Its key ingredient
is a new refractive index profile that can work as an approximate perfect lens
on its own, having a very moderate index range.
