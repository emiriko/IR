We discuss supersymmetric scenarios in which neutrino masses arise from
effective d=6 operators in the Kahler potential (including SUSY-breaking
insertions). Simple explicit realizations of those Kahler operators are
presented in the context of the type II seesaw. An appealing scenario emerges
upon identifying the seesaw mediators with SUSY-breaking messengers.
