In this paper we study $3+1$ holographic superconductors with Weyl
corrections. We find that the critical temperature of a superconductor with
Weyl corrections increases as we amplify the Weyl coupling parameter $\gamma$,
indicating the condensation will be harder when the parameter $\gamma$
decreases. We also calculate the conductivity and the ratio of gap frequency
over critical temperature $\omega_{g}/T_{c}$ numerically for various coupling
parameters. We find that the ratio $\omega_g/T_c$ becomes larger when the Weyl
coupling parameter $\gamma$ decreases. We also notice that when $\gamma< 0$
there is an extra spike that appears inside the gap.
