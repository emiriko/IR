Asymptotics-based configuration-interaction (CI) methods [G. Friesecke and B.
D. Goddard, Multiscale Model. Simul. 7, 1876 (2009)] are a class of CI methods
for atoms which reproduce, at fixed finite subspace dimension, the exact
Schr\"odinger eigenstates in the limit of fixed electron number and large
nuclear charge. Here we develop, implement, and apply to 3d transition metal
atoms an efficient and accurate algorithm for asymptotics-based CI.
  Efficiency gains come from exact (symbolic) decomposition of the CI space
into irreducible symmetry subspaces at essentially linear computational cost in
the number of radial subshells with fixed angular momentum, use of reduced
density matrices in order to avoid having to store wavefunctions, and use of
Slater-type orbitals (STO's). The required Coulomb integrals for STO's are
evaluated in closed form, with the help of Hankel matrices, Fourier analysis,
and residue calculus.
  Applications to 3d transition metal atoms are in good agreement with
experimental data. In particular we reproduce the anomalous magnetic moment and
orbital filling of Chromium in the otherwise regular series Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr.
