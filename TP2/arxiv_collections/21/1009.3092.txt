Solvent structure and dynamics of acetonitrile at its liquid-vapor (LV)
interface and at the acetonitrile-silica (LS) interface are studied by means of
molecular dynamics simulations. We set up the interfacial system and treat the
long-ranged electrostatics carefully to obtain both stable LV and LS interfaces
within the same system. Single molecule (singlet) and correlated density
orientational profiles and singlet and collective reorientational dynamics are
reported for both interfaces. At the LS interface acetonitrile forms layers.
The closest sublayer is dominated by nitrogen atoms bonding to the hydrogen
sites of the silica surface. The singlet molecular reorientation is strongly
hindered when close to the silica surface, but at the LV interface it relaxes
much faster than in the bulk. Antiparallel correlations between acetonitrile
molecules at the LV interface are even stronger than in the bulk liquid phase.
This strong antiparallel correlation disappears at the LS interface. The
collective reorientational relaxation of the first layer acetonitrile is much
faster than the singlet reorientational relaxation but it is still slower than
in the bulk. These results are interpreted with reference to a variety of
recent experiments.
  We found that defining interface properties based on the distribution of
positions of different choices of atoms or sites within the molecule leads to
apparently different orientational profiles, especially at the LV interface. We
provide a general formulation showing that this ambiguity arises when the size
of the molecule is comparable to the interfacial width and is particularly
significant when there is a large difference in density at the upper and lower
boundaries of the interface. We finally analyze the effect of electrostatics to
show the necessity of properly treating long-ranged electrostatics for
simulations of interfacial systems.
