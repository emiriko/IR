We derive predictions for Yukawa coupling ratios within GUTs generated from
operators with mass dimension four and five. These relations are a
characteristic property of unified flavour models and can reduce the large
number of free parameters related to the flavour sector of the SM. The Yukawa
couplings of the down-type quarks and charged leptons are affected within SUSY
models by tan beta-enhanced threshold corrections. We analyse these corrections
and give simple analytic expressions and numerical estimates for them. The
threshold corrections sensitively depend on the soft SUSY breaking parameters.
Especially, they determine if the affected Yukawa couplings are enhanced or
suppressed. In a first approach, we make some plausible assumptions about the
soft SUSY parameters. In a second, more sophisticated approach we use three
common breaking schemes in which all the soft breaking parameters at the
electroweak scale can be calculated from only a handful of parameters. Within
this approach, we apply various phenomenological constraints on the
supersymmetric parameters and find in this way new viable Yukawa coupling
relations, for example y_mu/y_s = 9/2 or 6 or y_tau/y_b = 3/2 in SU(5).
Furthermore, we study a special class of quark mass matrix textures for small
tan beta where theta_13^u = theta_13^d = 0. We derive sum rules for the quark
mixing parameters and find a simple relation between the two phases delta_12^u
and delta_12^d and the right unitarity triangle angle alpha which suggests a
simple phase structure for the quark mass matrices. To complement the
aforementioned considerations, we give two explicit examples in an SU(5)
context, one for large and one for small tan beta which implement the Yukawa
coupling relations mentioned before. The models have interesting
phenomenological consequences like, for example, quasi-degenerate neutrino
masses in the case of small tan beta.
