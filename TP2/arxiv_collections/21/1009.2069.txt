Bilayer graphene has attracted considerable interest due to the important
role played by many-body effects, particularly at low energies. Here we report
local compressibility measurements of a suspended graphene bilayer. We find
that the energy gaps at filling factors v = 4 do not vanish at low fields, but
instead merge into an incompressible region near the charge neutrality point at
zero electric and magnetic field. These results indicate the existence of a
zero-field ordered state and are consistent with the formation of either an
anomalous quantum Hall state or a nematic phase with broken rotational
symmetry. At higher fields, we measure the intrinsic energy gaps of
broken-symmetry states at v = 0, 1 and 2, and find that they scale linearly
with magnetic field, yet another manifestation of the strong Coulomb
interactions in bilayer graphene.
