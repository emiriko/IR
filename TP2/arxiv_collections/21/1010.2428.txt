We study the anisotropic Big Bang cosmology for a general non-linear equation
of state (EoS) in standard general relativity cosmology in early times.
According to brane world cosmology and loop quantum gravity which introduce a
quadratic term in the energy density, we study a non-linear EoS with a general
nonlinear term in the energy density. We show that this general non-linear term
isotropize the universe at early times. And also, we find out this model has a
phantom like behavior for special case.
