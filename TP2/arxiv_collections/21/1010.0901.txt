We simulate SU(2) gauge theory with six massless fundamental Dirac fermions.
By using the Schr\"odinger Functional method we measure the running of the
coupling and the fermion mass over a wide range of length scales. We observe
very slow running of the coupling and construct an estimator for the fermion
mass anomalous dimension giving $0.135 <\gamma< 1.03$ in the region compatible
with an IR fixed point.
