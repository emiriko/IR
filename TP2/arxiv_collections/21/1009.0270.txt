We present a new paradigm for dark matter in which a dark matter asymmetry is
established in the early universe that is then transferred to ordinary matter.
We show this scenario can fit naturally into weak scale physics models, with a
dark matter candidate mass of this order. We present several natural
suppression mechanisms, including bleeding dark matter number density into
lepton number, which occurs naturally in models with lepton-violating operators
transferring the asymmetry.
