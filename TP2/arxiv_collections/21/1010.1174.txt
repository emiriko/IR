We have used the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment 12 m telescope to detect
circumstellar CO emission from MP Mus (K1 IVe), a nearby (D ~ 100 pc), actively
accreting, ~7 Myr-old pre-main sequence (pre-MS) star. The CO emission line
profile measured for MP Mus is indicative of an orbiting disk with radius ~120
AU, assuming the central star mass is 1.2 solar masses and the disk inclination
is ~30 degrees, and the inferred disk molecular gas mass is ~3 Earth masses. MP
Mus thereby joins TW Hya and V4046 Sgr as the only late-type (low-mass), pre-MS
star systems within ~100 pc of Earth that are known to retain orbiting,
molecular disks. We also report the nondetection (with the Institut de Radio
Astronomie Millimetrique 30 m telescope) of CO emission from another ten nearby
(D ~ 100 pc or less), dusty, young (age ~10-100 Myr) field stars of spectral
type A-G. We discuss the implications of these results for the timescales for
stellar and Jovian planet accretion from, and dissipation of, molecular disks
around young stars.
