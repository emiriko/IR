Since the discovery of superfluidity in He4 and Landau's phenomenological
theory, the relationship between Bose condensation and superfluidity has been
intensely debated. He4 is known by now to be both superfluid and condensed at
low temperature, and more generally, in dimension D\geq2, all superfluid
bosonic models realized in experiments are condensed in their ground-state, the
most recent example being provided by ultracold bosonic atoms trapped in an
optical lattice. In this paper, it is shown that a 2D gas of bosons which is
not condensed at T=0 can be achieved by populating a layer through a frustrated
proximity effect from a superfluid reservoir. This condensate-free bosonic
fluid is further shown to be a superfluid with incommensurate correlations.
