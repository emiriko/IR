This paper presents a rewriting-logic-based modeling and analysis technique
for physical systems, with focus on thermal systems. The contributions of this
paper can be summarized as follows: (i) providing a framework for modeling and
executing physical systems, where both the physical components and their
physical interactions are treated as first-class citizens; (ii) showing how
heat transfer problems in thermal systems can be modeled in Real-Time Maude;
(iii) giving the implementation in Real-Time Maude of a basic numerical
technique for executing continuous behaviors in object-oriented hybrid systems;
and (iv) illustrating these techniques with a set of incremental case studies
using realistic physical parameters, with examples of simulation and model
checking analyses.
