The thick disc contains stars formed within the first Gyr of Galactic
history, and little is known about their planetary systems. The Spitzer MIPS
instrument was used to search 11 of the closest of these old low-metal stars
for circumstellar debris, as a signpost that bodies at least as large as
planetesimals were formed. A total of 22 thick disc stars has now been
observed, after including archival data, but dust is not found in any of the
systems. The data rule out a high incidence of debris among star systems from
early in the Galaxy's formation. However, some stars of this very old
population do host giant planets, at possibly more than the general incidence
among low-metal Sun-like stars. As the Solar System contains gas giants but
little cometary dust, the thick disc could host analogue systems that formed
many Gyr before the Sun.
