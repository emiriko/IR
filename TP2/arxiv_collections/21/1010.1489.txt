We use SPH simulations with an approximate radiative cooling prescription to
model evolution of a massive and large ($\sim 100$ AU) very young
protoplanetary disc. We also model dust growth and gas-grain dynamics with a
second fluid approach. It is found that the disc fragments onto a large number
of $\sim 10$ Jupiter mass clumps that cool and contract slowly. Some of the
clumps evolve onto eccentric orbits delivering them into the inner tens of AU,
where they are disrupted by tidal forces from the star. Dust grows and
sediments inside the clumps, displaying a very strong segregation, with the
largest particles forming dense cores in the centres. The density of the dust
cores may exceed that of the gas and is limited only by the numerical
constraints, indicating that these cores should collapse into rocky planetary
cores. One particular giant planet embryo migrates inward close enough to be
disrupted at about 10 AU, leaving a self-bound solid core of about 7.5
$\mearth$ mass on a low eccentricity orbit at a radius of $\sim$ 8 AU. These
simulations support the recent suggestions that terrestrial and giant planets
may be the remnants of tidally disrupted giant planet embryos.
