We present a method for the determination of [alpha/Fe] ratios from
low-resolution (R = 2000) SDSS/SEGUE stellar spectra. By means of a
star-by-star comparison with degraded spectra from the ELODIE spectral library
and with a set of moderately high-resolution (R = 15,000) and medium-resolution
(R = 6000) spectra of SDSS/SEGUE stars, we demonstrate that we are able to
measure [alpha/Fe] from SDSS/SEGUE spectra (with S/N > 20/1) to a precision of
better than 0.1 dex, for stars with atmospheric parameters in the range Teff =
[4500, 7000] K, log g = [1.5, 5.0], and [Fe/H] = [-1.4, +0.3], over the range
[alpha/Fe] = [-0.1, +0.6]. For stars with [Fe/H] < -1.4, our method requires
spectra with slightly higher signal-to-noise to achieve this precision (S/N >
25/1). Over the full temperature range considered, the lowest metallicity star
for which a confident estimate of [alpha/Fe] can be obtained from our approach
is [Fe/H] ~ -2.5; preliminary tests indicate that a metallicity limit as low as
[Fe/H] ~ -3.0 may apply to cooler stars. As a further validation of this
approach, weighted averages of [alpha/Fe] obtained for SEGUE spectra of likely
member stars of Galactic globular clusters (M15, M13, and M71) and open
clusters (NGC 2420, M67, and NGC 6791) exhibit good agreement with the values
of [alpha/Fe] from previous studies. The results of the comparison with NGC
6791 imply that the metallicity range for the method may extend to ~ +0.5.
