Color centers in diamond as single photon emitters, are leading candidates
for future quantum devices due to their room temperature operation and
photostability. The recently discovered chromium related centers are
particularly attractive since they possess narrow bandwidth emission and a very
short lifetime. In this paper we investigate the fabrication methodologies to
engineer these centers in monolithic diamond. We show that the emitters can be
successfully fabricated by ion implantation of chromium in conjunction with
oxygen or sulfur. Furthermore, our results indicate that the background
nitrogen concentration is an important parameter, which governs the probability
of success to generate these centers.
