This article offers a comprehensive survey of results obtained for solitons
and complex nonlinear wave patterns supported by purely nonlinear lattices
(NLs), which represent a spatially periodic modulation of the local strength
and sign of the nonlinearity, and their combinations with linear lattices. A
majority of the results obtained, thus far, in this field and reviewed in this
article are theoretical. Nevertheless, relevant experimental settings are
surveyed too, with emphasis on perspectives for implementation of the
theoretical predictions in the experiment. Physical systems discussed in the
review belong to the realms of nonlinear optics (including artificial optical
media, such as photonic crystals, and plasmonics) and Bose-Einstein
condensation (BEC). The solitons are considered in one, two, and three
dimensions (1D, 2D, and 3D). Basic properties of the solitons presented in the
review are their existence, stability, and mobility. Although the field is
still far from completion, general conclusions can be drawn. In particular, a
novel fundamental property of 1D solitons, which does not occur in the absence
of NLs, is a finite threshold value of the soliton norm, necessary for their
existence. In multidimensional settings, the stability of solitons supported by
the spatial modulation of the nonlinearity is a truly challenging problem, for
the theoretical and experimental studies alike. In both the 1D and 2D cases,
the mechanism which creates solitons in NLs is principally different from its
counterpart in linear lattices, as the solitons are created directly, rather
than bifurcating from Bloch modes of linear lattices.
