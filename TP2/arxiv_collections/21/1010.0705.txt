Sensitive measurements of the linearly polarized spectra of stars can be used
to deduce geometric properties of their otherwise unresolved circumstellar
environments. This paper describes some of the evidence for optical pumping and
absorptive linear polarization and explores some interesting applications of
linear spectropolarimetry for obtaining spatial information from imbedded
stars.
