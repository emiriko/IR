In this paper, we present a loss-tolerant quantum strong coin flipping
protocol with bias 0.359. This is an improvement over Berlin etal's protocol
[BBBG08] which achieves a bias of 0.4. To achieve this, we extend Berlin et
al.'s protocol by adding an encryption step that hides some information to Bob
until he confirms that he successfully measured. We also show using numerical
analysis that a we cannot improve this bias by considering a k-fold repetition
of Berlin etal's protocol for k > 2.
