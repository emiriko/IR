Symmetry is a common feature of many combinatorial problems. Unfortunately
eliminating all symmetry from a problem is often computationally intractable.
This paper argues that recent parameterized complexity results provide insight
into that intractability and help identify special cases in which symmetry can
be dealt with more tractably
