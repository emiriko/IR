We introduce a new method to price American-style options on underlying
investments governed by stochastic volatility (SV) models. The method does not
require the volatility process to be observed. Instead, it exploits the fact
that the optimal decision functions in the corresponding dynamic programming
problem can be expressed as functions of conditional distributions of
volatility, given observed data. By constructing statistics summarizing
information about these conditional distributions, one can obtain high quality
approximate solutions. Although the required conditional distributions are in
general intractable, they can be arbitrarily precisely approximated using
sequential Monte Carlo schemes. The drawback, as with many Monte Carlo schemes,
is potentially heavy computational demand. We present two variants of the
algorithm, one closely related to the well-known least-squares Monte Carlo
algorithm of Longstaff and Schwartz [The Review of Financial Studies 14 (2001)
113-147], and the other solving the same problem using a "brute force" gridding
approach. We estimate an illustrative SV model using Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) methods for three equities. We also demonstrate the use of our algorithm
by estimating the posterior distribution of the market price of volatility risk
for each of the three equities.
