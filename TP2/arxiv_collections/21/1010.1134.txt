We analyze the charge and spin pumping in an interacting dot within the
almost adiabatic limit. By using a non-equilibrium Green's function technique
within the time-dependent slave boson approximation, we analyze the pumped
current in terms of the dynamical constraints in the infinite-U regime. The
results show the presence of parasitic pumping currents due to the additional
phases of the constraints. The behavior of the pumped current through the
quantum dot is illustrated in the spin-insensitive and in the spin-sensitive
case relevant for spintronics applications.
