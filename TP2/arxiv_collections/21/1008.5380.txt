Various authors have considered schemes for {\it quantum tagging}, that is,
authenticating the classical location of a classical tagging device by sending
and receiving quantum signals from suitably located distant sites, in an
environment controlled by an adversary whose quantum information processing and
transmitting power is potentially unbounded. This task raises some interesting
new questions about cryptographic security assumptions, as relatively subtle
details in the security model can dramatically affect the security attainable.
We consider here the case in which the tag is cryptographically secure, and
show how to implement tagging securely within this model.
