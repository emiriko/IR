The JMMC Calibrator Workgroup has long developed methods to ascertain the
angular diameter of stars, and provides this expertise in the SearchCal
software. SearchCal dynamically finds calibrators near science objects by
querying CDS hosted catalogs according to observational parameters. Initially
limited to bright objects (K magnitude </- 5.5), it has been upgraded with a
new method providing calibrators without any magnitude limit but those of
queried catalogs. We introduce here a new static catalog of stellar diameters,
containing more than 38000 entries, obtained from SearchCal results aggregation
on the whole celestial sphere, complete for all stars with HIPPARCOS
parallaxes. We detail the methods and tools used to produce and study this
catalog, and compare the static catalog approach with the dynamical querying
provided by SearchCal engine. We also introduce a new Virtual Observatory
service, enabling the reporting of, and querying about, stars flagged as "bad
calibrators" by astronomers, adding this ever-growing database to our SearchCal
service.
