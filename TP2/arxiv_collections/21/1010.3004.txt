We give a one-dimensional interpretation of the four-dimensional twisted N=1
superYang-Mills theory on a Kaehler manifold by performing an appropriate
dimensional reduction. We prove the existence of a 6-generator superalgebra,
which does not possess any invariant Lagrangian but contains two different
subalgebras that determine the twisted and untwisted formulations of the N=1
superYang-Mills theory.
