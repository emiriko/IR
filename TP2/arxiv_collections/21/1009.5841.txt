The purpose of this note is to scrutinize the proof of Burago and Zalgaller
regarding the existence of $PL$ isometric embeddings of $PL$ compact surfaces
into $\mathbb{R}^3$. We conclude that their proof does not admit a direct
extension to higher dimensions. Moreover, we show that, in general, $PL$
manifolds of dimension $n \geq 3$ admit no nontrivial $PL$ embeddings in
$\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ that are close to conformality. We also extend the result of
Burago and Zalgaller to a large class of noncompact $PL$ 2-manifolds. The
relation between intrinsic and extrinsic curvatures is also examined, and we
propose a $PL$ version of the Gauss compatibility equation for smooth surfaces.
