The following open problems, which concern a fundamental limit on coding
properties of quantum codes with realistic physical constraints, are analyzed
and partially answered here: (a) the upper bound on code distances of quantum
error-correcting codes with geometrically local generators, (b) the feasibility
of a self-correcting quantum memory. To investigate these problems, we study
stabilizer codes supported by local interaction terms with translation and
scale symmetries on a $D$-dimensional lattice. Our analysis uses the notion of
topology emerging in geometric shapes of logical operators, which sheds a
surprising new light on theory of quantum codes with physical constraints.
