Relationships between the X-ray and radio behavior of black hole X-ray
binaries during outbursts have established a fundamental coupling between the
accretion disks and radio jets in these systems. We begin by reviewing the
prevailing paradigm for this disk-jet coupling, also highlighting what we know
about similarities and differences with neutron star and white dwarf binaries.
Until recently, this paradigm had not been directly tested with dedicated
high-angular resolution radio imaging over entire outbursts. Moreover, such
high-resolution monitoring campaigns had not previously targetted outbursts in
which the compact object was either a neutron star or a white dwarf. To address
this issue, we have embarked on the Jet Acceleration and Collimation Probe Of
Transient X-Ray Binaries (JACPOT XRB) project, which aims to use high angular
resolution observations to compare disk-jet coupling across the stellar mass
scale, with the goal of probing the importance of the depth of the
gravitational potential well, the stellar surface and the stellar magnetic
field, on jet formation. Our team has recently concluded its first monitoring
series, including (E)VLA, VLBA, X-ray, optical, and near-infrared observations
of entire outbursts of the black hole candidate H1743-322, the neutron star
system Aquila X-1, and the white dwarf system SS Cyg. Here we present
preliminary results from this work, largely confirming the current paradigm,
but highlighting some intriguing new behavior, and suggesting a possible
difference in the jet formation process between neutron star and black hole
systems.
