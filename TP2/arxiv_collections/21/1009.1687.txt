We study the mathematical model of thermoacoustic and photoacoustic
tomography when the sound speed has a jump across a smooth surface. This models
the change of the sound speed in the skull when trying to image the human
brain. We derive an explicit inversion formula in the form of a convergent
Neumann series under the assumptions that all singularities from the support of
the source reach the boundary.
