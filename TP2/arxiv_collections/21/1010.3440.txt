We report the discovery of a new cataclysmic variable (CV) among unidentified
objects from the ASCA Galactic Plane Survey made using the Virtual Observatory
data mining. First, we identified AX J194939+2631 with IPHAS
J194938.39+263149.2, the only prominent H-alpha emitter among 400 sources in a
1 arcmin field of the IPHAS survey, then secured as a single faint X-ray source
found in an archival Chandra dataset. Spectroscopic follow-up with the 3.5-m
Calar Alto telescope confirmed its classification as a CV, possibly of magnetic
nature. Our analysis suggests that AX J194939+2631 is a medium distance system
(d ~ 0.6 kpc) containing a late-K or early-M type dwarf as a secondary
component and a partially disrupted accretion disc revealed by the
double-peaked H-alpha line. However, additional deep observations are needed to
confirm our tentative classification of this object as an intermediate polar.
