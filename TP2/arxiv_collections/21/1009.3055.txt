Close binarity can play a significant role in the shaping of planetary
nebulae (PNe) as the system evolves through the common-envelope phase. We
present the detection of two of the shortest orbital periods among PN binary
central stars. These are Hen 2-428, a bipolar PN, and V458 Vul, a recent nova
surrounded by a mildly bipolar planetary nebula. The properties of the central
stars of these systems, of their nebulae and their possible fate are discussed.
