It is shown that an Aharonov-Casher vector potential in a two-dimensional
geometry can lead to helical edge states. The Aharonov-Casher vector potential
is the electromagnetic dual of the magnetic vector potential, and leads to
traveling states at the sample edge in analogy to the integer quantum Hall
effect. The helical edge states are predicted to appear in a narrow channel
geometry with parabolic or sufficiently symmetric confinement potential. The
implications of the helical Aharonov-Casher edge states and experimental
considerations in specific materials systems are discussed.
