We study some aspects of equilibrium and off equilibrium quantum dynamics of
dilute bosonic gases in the presence of a trapping potential. We consider
systems with a fixed number of particles N and study their scaling behavior
with increasing the trap size. We focus on one-dimensional (1D) bosonic
systems, such as gases described by the Lieb-Liniger model and its
Tonks-Girardeau limit of impenetrable bosons, and gases constrained in optical
lattices as described by the Bose-Hubbard model. We study their quantum
(zero-temperature) behavior at equilibrium and off equilibrium during the
unitary time evolution arising from changes of the trapping potential, which
may be instantaneous or described by a power-law time dependence, starting from
the equilibrium ground state for a initial trap size. Renormalization-group
scaling arguments, analytical and numerical calculations show that the
trap-size dependence of the equilibrium and off-equilibrium dynamics can be
cast in the form of a trap-size scaling in the low-density regime,
characterized by universal power laws of the trap size, in dilute gases with
repulsive contact interactions and lattice systems described by the
Bose-Hubbard model. The scaling functions corresponding to several physically
interesting observables are computed. Our results are of experimental relevance
for systems of cold atomic gases trapped by tunable confining potentials.
