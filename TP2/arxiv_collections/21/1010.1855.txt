Within the framework of Bianchi type-II (BII) cosmological model the behavior
of matter distribution has been considered. It is shown that the non-zero
off-diagonal component of Einstein tensor implies some severe restriction on
the choice of matter distribution. In particular for a locally rotationally
symmetric Bianchi type-II (LRS BII) space-time it is proved that the matter
distribution should be strictly isotropic if the corresponding matter field
possesses only non-zero diagonal components of the energy-momentum tensor.
