In this paper we study the heterotic type IIA duality when fluxes are turned
on. We show that many of the known fluxes are dual to each other and claim that
certain fluxes on the heterotic side require that the type IIA picture is
lifted to M or even F-theory compactifications with geometric fluxes.
