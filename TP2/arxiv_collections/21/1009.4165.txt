The updated CDF measurement of the forward-backward asymmetry (FBA) in the
top quark production p{bar p} -> t{bar t} at Tevatron (with the CMS energy 1.96
TeV) shows a deviation of 2*sigma from the value predicted by the Standard QCD
Model. We present calculation of this quantity in the scenario where colored
unparticle physics contributes to the s-channel of the process, and obtain the
regions in the plane of the unparticle parameters lambda and dU which give the
values of the FBA and of the total t{bar t} production cross section compatible
with the present measurements.
