We have detected new HD absorption systems at high redshifts, z_abs=2.626 and
z_abs=1.777, identified in the spectra of the quasars J0812+3208 and Q1331+170,
respectively. Each of these systems consists of two subsystems. The HD column
densities have been determined: log(N(HD),A)=15.70+/-0.07 for z_A=2.626443(2)
and log(N(HD),B)=12.98+/-0.22 for z_B=2.626276(2) in the spectrum of J0812+3208
and log(N(HD),C)=14.83+/-0.15 for z_C=1.77637(2) and log(N(HD),D)=14.61+/-0.20
for z_D=1.77670(3) in the spectrum of Q1331+170. The measured HD/H2 ratio for
three of these subsystems has been found to be considerably higher than its
values typical of clouds in our Galaxy. We discuss the problem of determining
the primordial deuterium abundance, which is most sensitive to the baryon
density of the Universe \Omega_{b}. Using a well-known model for the chemistry
of a molecular cloud, we have estimated the isotopic ratio
D/H=HD/2H_2=(2.97+/-0.55)x10^{-5} and the corresponding baryon density
\Omega_{b}h^2=0.0205^{+0.0025}_{-0.0020}. This value is in good agreement with
\Omega_{b}h^2=0.0226^{+0.0006}_{-0.0006} obtained by analyzing the cosmic
microwave background radiation anisotropy. However, in high-redshift clouds,
under conditions of low metallicity and low dust content, hydrogen may be
incompletely molecularized even in the case of self-shielding. In this
situation, the HD/2H_2 ratio may not correspond to the actual D/H isotopic
ratio. We have estimated the cloud molecularization dynamics and the influence
of cosmological evolutionary effects on it.
