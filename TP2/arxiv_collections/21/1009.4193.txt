We directly compare the concordance LCDM model to the inhomogeneous
matter-only alternative represented by LTB void models. To achieve a
"democratic" confrontation we explore LLTB models with non-vanishing
cosmological constant and perform a global likelihood analysis in the parameter
space of cosmological constant and void radius. In our analysis we carefully
consider SNe, Hubble constant, CMB and BAO measurements, marginalizing over
spectral index, age of the universe and background curvature. We find that the
LCDM model is not the only possibility compatible with the observations, and
that a matter-only void model is a viable alternative to the concordance model
only if the BAO constraints are relaxed. Moreover, we will show that the areas
of the parameter space which give a good fit to the observations are always
disconnected with the result that a small local void does not significantly
affect the parameter extraction for LCDM models.
