On 28 January 2010, the recurrent nova U Scorpii had its long predicted
eruption; prior preparation allowed for this to become the all-time best
observed nova event. The coverage included daily and hourly spectra in the
X-ray, ultraviolet, optical, and infrared, plus daily and hourly photometry in
the X-ray, ultraviolet, U, B, V, y, R, I, J, H, K, and middle infrared,
including roughly 35,000 V-band magnitudes (an average of better than once
every three minutes) throughout the entire 67 days of the eruption. This
unprecedented coverage has allowed for the discovery of three new phenomena;
the early fast optical flares (with no known explanation), ejecta velocities at
10,000 km/s (velocities that previously had only been seen in supernovae), and
deep transient dips in optical and X-ray brightness lasting for hours (for
which I point to X-ray dippers as having the same cause).
