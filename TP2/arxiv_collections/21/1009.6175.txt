A triangular ansatz for the seesaw mechanism and baryogenesis via
leptogenesis is explored. In a basis where both the charged lepton and the
Majorana mass matrix are diagonal, the Dirac mass matrix can generally be
written as the product of a unitary times a triangular matrix. We assume the
unitary matrix to be the identity and then an upper triangular Dirac matrix.
Constraints from bilarge lepton mixing and leptogenesis are studied.
