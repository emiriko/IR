The direct observation of gravitational waves will provide a unique tool for
probing the dynamical properties of highly compact astrophysical objects,
mapping ultra-relativistic regions of space-time, and testing Einstein's
general theory of relativity. LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna), a
joint NASA-ESA mission to be launched in the next decade, will perform these
scientific tasks by detecting and studying low-frequency cosmic gravitational
waves through their influence on the phases of six modulated laser beams
exchanged between three remote spacecraft. By directly measuring the
polarization components of the waves LISA will detect, we will be able to test
Einstein's theory of relativity with good sensitivity. Since a gravitational
wave signal predicted by the most general relativistic metric theory of gravity
accounts for {\it six} polarization modes (the usual two Einstein's tensor
polarizations as well as two vector and two scalar wave components), we have
derived the LISA Time-Delay Interferometric responses and estimated their
sensitivities to vector- and scalar-type waves. We find that (i) at frequencies
larger than roughly the inverse of the one-way light time ($\approx 6 \times
10^{-2} $ Hz.) LISA is more than ten times sensitive to scalar-longitudinal and
vector signals than to tensor and scalar-transverse waves, and (ii) in the low
part of its frequency band is equally sensitive to tensor and vector waves and
somewhat less sensitive to scalar signals.
