We present a class of non-standard numerical schemes which are modifications
of the discrete gradient method. They preserve the energy integral exactly (up
to the round-off error). The considered class contains locally exact discrete
gradient schemes and integrators of arbitrary high order. In numerical
experiments we compare our integrators with some other numerical schemes,
including the standard discrete gradient method, the leap-frog scheme and a
symplectic scheme of 4th order. We study the error accumulation for very long
time and the conservation of the energy integral.
