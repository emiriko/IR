Using a previous extraction of the quark Boer-Mulders distributions from
semiinclusive deep inelastic scattering data, we fit the unpolarized Drell-Yan
data on the $\cos 2 \phi$ asymmetry, determining the antiquark Boer-Mulders
distributions. A good agreement with the data is found in the region of low
$q_T$, where the transverse-momentum factorization approach applies.
