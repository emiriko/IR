We review current status of the study of parity and time invariance phenomena
in atoms, nuclei and molecules. We focus on three most promising areas of
research: (i) parity non-conservation in a chain of isotopes, (ii) search for
nuclear anapole moments, and (iii) search for permanent electric dipole moments
(EDM) of atoms and molecules which are caused by either, electron EDM or
nuclear $T,P$-odd moments such as nuclear EDM and nuclear Schiff moment.
