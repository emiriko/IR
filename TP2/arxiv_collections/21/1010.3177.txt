The iDian (previously named as the Operation Agent System) is a framework
designed to enable computer users to operate software in natural language.
Distinct from current speech-recognition systems, our solution supports
format-free combinations of orders, and is open to both developers and
customers. We used a multi-layer structure to build the entire framework,
approached rule-based natural language processing, and implemented demos
narrowing down to Windows, text-editing and a few other applications. This
essay will firstly give an overview of the entire system, and then scrutinize
the functions and structure of the system, and finally discuss the prospective
de-velopment, esp. on-line interaction functions.
