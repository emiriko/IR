A recent study of dissipative collapse considered a contracting sphere in
which the areal and proper radii are equal throughout its evolution. The
interior spacetime was matched to the exterior Vaidya spacetime which generated
a temporal evolution equation at the boundary of the collapsing sphere. We
present a solution of the boundary condition which allows the study of the
gravitational and thermodynamical behaviour of this particular radiating model.
