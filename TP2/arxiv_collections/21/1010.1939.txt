New progress in loop gravity has lead to a simple model of `general-covariant
quantum field theory'. I sum up the definition of the model in self-contained
form, in terms accessible to those outside the subfield. I emphasize its
formulation as a generalized topological quantum field theory with an infinite
number of degrees of freedom, and its relation to lattice theory. I list the
indications supporting the conjecture that the model is related to general
relativity and UV finite.
