We demonstrate the use of dynamic decoupling techniques to extend the
coherence time of a single memory qubit by nearly two orders of magnitude. By
extending the Hahn spin-echo technique to correct for unknown, arbitrary
polynomial variations in the qubit precession frequency, we show analytically
that the required sequence of pi-pulses is identical to the Uhrig dynamic
decoupling (UDD) sequence. We compare UDD and CPMG sequences applied to a
single Ca-43 trapped-ion qubit and find that they afford comparable protection
in our ambient noise environment.
