Let (M,\omega) be a symplectic 2n-manifold and h_1,...,h_n be functionally
independent commuting functions on M. We present a geometric criterion for a
singular point P\in M (i.e. such that {dh_i(P)}_{i=1}^n are linearly dependent)
to be non-degenerate in the sence of Vey-Eliasson.
  Then we apply Fomenko's theory to study the neighborhood U of the singular
Liouville fiber containing saddle-saddle singularities of the Manakov top.
Namely, we describe the singular Liouville foliation on U and the
`Bohr-Sommerfeld' lattices on the momentum map image of U. A relation with the
quantum Manakov top studied by Sinitsyn and Zhilinskii (SIGMA 3 2007,
arXiv:math-ph/0703045) is discussed.
