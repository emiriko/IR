The existence and origin of line tension has remained controversial in
literature. To address this issue we compute the shape of Lennard-Jones
nanodrops using molecular dynamics and compare them to density functional
theory in the approximation of the sharp kink interface. We show that the
deviation from Young's law is very small and would correspond to a typical line
tension length scale (defined as line tension divided by surface tension)
similar to the molecular size and decreasing with Young's angle. We propose an
alternative interpretation based on the geometry of the interface at the
molecular scale.
