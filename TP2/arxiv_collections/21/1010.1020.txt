A study of the performance of the ATLAS tau and missing energy triggers with
data collected in spring 2010 at {\surd}s = 7 TeV proton-proton collisions at
the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is presented. A comparison was performed
between data and Monte Carlo simulations for the tau and missing transverse
energy triggers. As well as a comparison between missing transverse energy
trigger quantities and their offline reconstructed counterparts. Tau trigger
results compare well with predictions from Monte Carlo simulations. Slight
deviations are observed for tau shower shape quantities. Possible sources
contributing to the discrepancy such as the simulation of the underlying event
are currently being studied. The missing transverse energy reconstructed by the
Event Filter is well correlated with the offline result. In addition, there is
good agreement between the results obtained with collision data and Monte Carlo
simulations.
