We studied the quantum correlation between the photon pairs generated by
biexciton cascade decays of self-assembled quantum dots, and determined the
temperature behavior associated with so-called sudden change of the quantum
correlation. The relationship between the fine structure splitting and the
sudden change temperature is also provided. Our study indicates that this
correlation behavior sudden change temperature is independent on the back
ground noise in the system and far lower than entanglement sudden death
temperature, therefore it should be easier to observe the phenomenon of
correlation sudden change in experiments than to observe entanglement sudden
death.
