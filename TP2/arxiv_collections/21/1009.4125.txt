A general relativistic model for the formation and acceleration of low
mass-loaded jets from systems containing accreting black holes is presented.
The model is based on previous numerical results and theoretical studies in the
Newtonian regime, but modified to include the effects of space-time curvature
in the vicinity of the event horizon of a spinning black hole. It is argued
that the boundary layer between the Keplerian accretion disk and the event
horizon is best suited for the formation and acceleration of the
accretion-powered jets in active galactic nuclei and micro-quasars.
  The model is based on matching the solutions of three different regions: i- a
weakly magnetized Keplerian accretion disk in the outer part, where the
transport of angular momentum is mediated through the magentorotational
instability, ii- a strongly magnetized, advection-dominated and turbulent-free
boundary layer (BL) between the outer cold accretion disk and the event
horizon, where the plasma rotates sub-Keplerian and iii- a transition zone (TZ)
between the BL and the overlying corona, where the electrons and protons are
thermally uncoupled, highly dissipative and rotate super-Keplerian.
  Our model predicts the known correlation between the Lorentz-factor and the
spin parameter of the BH. It also shows that the effective surface of the BL,
through which the baryons flow into the TZ, shrinks with increasing the spin
parameter, implying therefore that low mass-loaded jets most likely originate
from around Kerr black holes.
  When applying our model to the jet in the elliptical galaxy M87, we find a
spin parameter in the range 0.99 - 0.998, a transition radius of about 30
gravitational radii and a fraction of 0.05 - 0.1 of the mass accretion rate
goes into the TZ, where the plasma speeds up its outward-oriented motion to
reach a Lorentz factor of 2.5 - 5.0 at the transition radius.
