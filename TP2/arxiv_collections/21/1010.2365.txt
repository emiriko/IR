In this paper, we suppose that the universe has an information processing
layer, which coveys the informational contents accompanying the physical
events. In this manner, universe is considered to be composed of several
associative layers such that one rises on the other layer. Preliminary, we
present a method for the analytical treatment of the amount of information
processed by universe itself, and then we try to show its correspondence with
theories developed for the time dilation and gravitational forces.
