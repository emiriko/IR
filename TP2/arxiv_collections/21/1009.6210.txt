We report a process to fabricate carbon nanotubes (CNT) by chemical vapor
deposition at predetermined location. This process was enabled by patterning
catalyst nanoparticles directly on silicon substrates with nanometer-scale
precision using Dip Pen Nanolithography(R) (DPN(R)). A multi-pen writing method
was employed to increase the patterning rate. The development of new molecular
inks for the deposition of the precursor catalyst resulted in a high yield of
isolated carbon nanotubes, ideal for subsequent device fabrication. Here, we
demonstrate the advantages of the new method for producing high quality
isolated CNT in scalable array geometries.
