We compute the amplitudes for the insertion of various operators in a quark
2-point function at one loop in the RI' symmetric momentum scheme, RI'/SMOM.
Specifically we focus on the moments n = 2 and 3 of the flavour non-singlet
twist-2 operators used in deep inelastic scattering as these are required for
lattice computations.
