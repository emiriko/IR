In earlier work we gave a characterisation of pregeometries which are `basic'
(that is, admit no `non-degenerate' quotients) relative to two different kinds
of quotient operations, namely imprimitive quotients and normal quotients. Each
basic geometry was shown to involve a faithful group action, which is primitive
or quasiprimitive respectively, on the set of elements of each type. For each
O'Nan-Scott type of primitive group, we construct a new infinite family of
geometries, which are thick and of unbounded rank, and which admit a
flag-transitive automorphism group acting faithfully on the set of elements of
each type as a primitive group of the given O'Nan-Scott type.
