The earliest results of CMS exhibit central pseudo rapidity densities larger
than the predictions of the different models. Introducing on this basis new
guidelines with larger multiplicities of secondaries in the models implemented
in the simulations, we examine the consequences in $\gamma$ ray families
(spikes in rapidity distribution, coplanar emission) and very large EAS
(penetration power in the atmosphere)
