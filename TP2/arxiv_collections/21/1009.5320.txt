The coupling constants $g_{D^{\ast}_{s}D K^{\ast}(892)}$ and
$g_{B^{\ast}_{s}B K^{\ast}(892)}$ are calculated in the framework of
three-point QCD sum rules. The correlation functions responsible for these
coupling constants are evaluated considering contributions of both $D(B)$ and
$K^*(892)$ mesons as off-shell states, but in the absence of radiative
corrections. The results, $g_{D^{\ast}_{s}D K^{\ast}(892)}=(4.31\pm1.42)
GeV^{-1}$ and $g_{B^{\ast}_{s}B K^{\ast}(892)}=(3.24\pm1.08) GeV^{-1}$ are
obtained for the considered strong coupling constants.
