This paper describes the rationale, curriculum and subject matter of a new
MSc module being taught on an MSc Finance and Information Management course at
the University of Wales Institute in Cardiff. Academic research on spreadsheet
risks now has some penetration in academic literature and there is a growing
body of knowledge on the subjects of spreadsheet error, human factors,
spreadsheet engineering, "best practice", spreadsheet risk management and
various techniques used to mitigate spreadsheet errors. This new MSc module in
End User Computing Risk Management is an attempt to pull all of this research
and practitioner experience together to arm the next generation of finance
spreadsheet champions with the relevant knowledge, techniques and critical
perspective on an emerging discipline.
