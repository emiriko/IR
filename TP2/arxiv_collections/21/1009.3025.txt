On January 17, 2005 a complex radio event associated with an X3.8 SXR flare
and two fast Halo CMEs (CME1 & CME2 henceforward) in close succession was
observed. We present combined ARTEMIS-IV & WIND WAVES dynamic spectra which
provide a complete view of the radio emission induced by shock waves and
electron beams from the low corona to about 1 A.U. These are supplemented with
data, from the Nan\c{c}ay Radioheliograph (NRH), GOES, EIT and LASCO for the
study of the associated flare and CME activity.
