A theorem due to Bob Geroch and Pong Soo Jang ["Motion of a Body in General
Relativity." Journal of Mathematical Physics 16(1), (1975)] provides the sense
in which the geodesic principle has the status of a theorem in General
Relativity (GR). Here we show that a similar theorem holds in the context of
geometrized Newtonian gravitation (often called Newton-Cartan theory). It
follows that in Newtonian gravitation, as in GR, inertial motion can be derived
from other central principles of the theory.
