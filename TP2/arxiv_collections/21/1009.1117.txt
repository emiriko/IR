Lexicon-Grammar tables are a very rich syntactic lexicon for the French
language. This linguistic database is nevertheless not directly suitable for
use by computer programs, as it is incomplete and lacks consistency. Tables are
defined on the basis of features which are not explicitly recorded in the
lexicon. These features are only described in literature. Our aim is to define
for each tables these essential properties to make them usable in various
Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications, such as parsing.
