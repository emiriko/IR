We analyze more explicitly four sectors of 1/4 BPS geometries and 1/8 BPS
geometries, corresponding to BPS states in N=4 SYM, constructed previously.
These include the states with several SO(6) angular momenta as well as those
with SO(4) AdS spins. We also discuss their relations to the dual gauge theory.
