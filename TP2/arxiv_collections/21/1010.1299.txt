In addition to the BLINC/MIRAC IR science instruments, the Magellan adaptive
secondary AO system will have an EEV CCD47 that can be used both for visible AO
science and as a wide-field acquisition camera. The effects of atmospheric
dispersion on the elongation of the diffraction limited Magellan adaptive
optics system point spread function (PSF) are significant in the near IR. This
elongation becomes particularly egregious at visible wavelengths, culminating
in a PSF that is 2000\{mu}m long in one direction and diffraction limited
(30-60 \{mu}m) in the other over the wavelength band 0.5-1.0\{mu}m for a source
at 45\pm zenith angle. The planned Magellan AO system consists of a deformable
secondary mirror with 585 actuators. This number of actuators should be
sufficient to nyquist sample the atmospheric turbulence and correct images to
the diffraction limit at wavelengths as short as 0.7\{mu}m, with useful science
being possible as low as 0.5\{mu}m. In order to achieve diffraction limited
performance over this broad band, 2000\{mu}m of lateral color must be corrected
to better than 10\{mu}m. The traditional atmospheric dispersion corrector (ADC)
consists of two identical counter-rotating cemented doublet prisms that correct
the primary chromatic aberration. We propose two new ADC designs: the first
consisting of two identical counter-rotating prism triplets, and the second
consisting of two pairs of cemented counter-rotating prism doublets that use
both normal dispersion and anomalous dispersion glass in order to correct both
primary and secondary chromatic aberration. The two designs perform 58% and
68%, respectively, better than the traditional two-doublet design. We also
present our design for a custom removable wide-field lens that will allow our
CCD47 to switch back and forth between an 8.6" FOV for AO science and a 28.5"
FOV for acquisition.
