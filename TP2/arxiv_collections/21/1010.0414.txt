Gowers norms have been studied extensively both in the direct sense, starting
with a function and understanding the associated norm, and in the inverse
sense, starting with the norm and deducing properties of the function. Instead
of focusing on the norms themselves, we study associated dual norms and dual
functions. Combining this study with a variant of the Szemeredi Regularity
Lemma, we give a decomposition theorem for dual functions, linking the dual
norms to classical norms and indicating that the dual norm is easier to
understand than the norm itself. Using the dual functions, we introduce higher
order algebras that are analogs of the classical Fourier algebra, which in turn
can be used to further characterize the dual functions.
