Over the last decade {\it ab initio} modeling of material properties has
become widespread in diverse fields of research. It has proved to be a powerful
tool for predicting various properties of matter under extreme conditions. We
apply modern computational chemistry and materials science methods, including
density functional theory (DFT), to solve lingering problems in the modeling of
the dense atmospheres of cool white dwarfs ($T_{\rm eff}\rm <7000 \, K$). Our
work on the revision and improvements of the absorption mechanisms in the
hydrogen and helium dominated atmospheres resulted in a new set of atmosphere
models. By inclusion of the Ly-$\rm \alpha$ red wing opacity we successfully
fitted the entire spectral energy distributions of known cool DA stars. In the
subsequent work we fitted the majority of the coolest stars with hydrogen-rich
models. This finding challenges our understanding of the spectral evolution of
cool white dwarfs. We discuss a few examples, including the cool companion to
the pulsar PSR J0437-4715. The two problems important for the understanding of
cool white dwarfs are the behavior of negative hydrogen ion and molecular
carbon in a fluid-like, helium dominated medium. Using {\it ab initio} methods
we investigate the stability and opacity of these two species in dense helium.
Our investigation of $\rm C_2$ indicates that the absorption features observed
in the ``peculiar'' DQp white dwarfs resemble the absorption of perturbed $\rm
C_2$ in dense helium.
