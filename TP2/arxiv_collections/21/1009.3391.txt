The need to deal with vague information in Semantic Web languages is rising
in importance and, thus, calls for a standard way to represent such
information. We may address this issue by either extending current Semantic Web
languages to cope with vagueness, or by providing a procedure to represent such
information within current standard languages and tools. In this work, we
follow the latter approach, by identifying the syntactic differences that a
fuzzy ontology language has to cope with, and by proposing a concrete
methodology to represent fuzzy ontologies using OWL 2 annotation properties. We
also report on the prototypical implementations.
