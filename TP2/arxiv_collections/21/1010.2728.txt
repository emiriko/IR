We present a continuous-space version of Infotaxis, a search algorithm where
a searcher greedily moves to maximize the gain in information about the
position of the target to be found. Using a combination of analytical and
numerical tools we study the nature of the trajectories in two and three
dimensions. The probability that the search is successful and the running time
of the search are estimated. A possible extension to non-greedy search is
suggested.
