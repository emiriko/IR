The analytical nonautonomous rogons are reported for the inhomogeneous
nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with variable coefficients in terms of
rational-like functions by using the similarity transformation and direct
ansatz. These obtained solutions can be used to describe the possible formation
mechanisms for optical, oceanic, and matter rogue wave phenomenon in optical
fibres, the deep ocean, and Bose-Einstein condensates, respectively. Moreover,
the snake propagation traces and the fascinating interactions of two
nonautonomous rogons are generated for the chosen different parameters. The
obtained nonautonomous rogons may excite the possibility of relative
experiments and potential applications for the rogue wave phenomenon in the
field of nonlinear science.
