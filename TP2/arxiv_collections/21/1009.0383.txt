We study the stellar response in a spectrum of potentials describing the
barred spiral galaxy NGC 1300. These potentials have been presented in a
previous paper and correspond to three different assumptions as regards the
geometry of the galaxy. For each potential we consider a wide range of
$\Omega_p$ pattern speed values. Our goal is to discover the geometries and the
$\Omega_p$ supporting specific morphological features of NGC 1300. For this
purpose we use the method of response models. In order to compare the images of
NGC 1300 with the density maps of our models, we define a new index which is a
generalization of the Hausdorff distance. This index helps us to find out
quantitatively which cases reproduce specific features of NGC 1300 in an
objective way. Furthermore, we construct alternative models following a
Schwarzschild type technique. By this method we vary the weights of the various
energy levels, and thus the orbital contribution of each energy, in order to
minimize the differences between the response density and that deduced from the
surface density of the galaxy, under certain assumptions. We find that the
models corresponding to $\Omega_p\approx16$\ksk and $\Omega_p\approx22$\ksk are
able to reproduce efficiently certain morphological features of NGC 1300, with
each one having its advantages and drawbacks.
