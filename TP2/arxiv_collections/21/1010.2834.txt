The calculation of the nucleon strangeness form factors from N_f=2+1 clover
fermion lattice QCD is presented. Disconnected insertions are evaluated using
the Z(4) stochastic method, along with unbiased subtractions from the hopping
parameter expansion. We find that increasing the number of nucleon sources for
each configuration improves the signal significantly. We obtain G_M^s(0) =
-0.017(25)(07), which is consistent with experimental values, and has an order
of magnitude smaller error. Preliminary results for the strangeness
contribution to the second moment of the parton distribution function are also
presented.
