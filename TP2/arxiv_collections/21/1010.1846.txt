In this paper we consider asymptotic behavior of a hybrid action of f(R)
gravity model which proposed by Saffari and Rahvar (2008), in solar system
scale, which can explain Pioneer anomalous acceleration. We use the potential
coming from this hybrid action in weak field limit to test its impacts on Solar
system dynamics, by comparing the theoretical precession of perihelion of a
test particle, $\dot{\varpi}$ with corrections to the standard Newtonian -
Einsteinian precession of perihelia of some planets, recently estimated by
Pitjeva. Here we show that obtained results of the asymptotic behavior of
hybrid action, are in more accordance with observation relative to the other
modifications such as power law and logarithmic corrections Iorio (2008). We
also show that an extra additional lensing of the prediction of General
Relativity is reproduced. Finally we obtain the stability condition of
planetary orbits.
