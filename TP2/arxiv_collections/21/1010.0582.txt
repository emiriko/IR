The width of the neutrino decay into the electron and $W$ boson in a strong
external magnetic field is obtained from the imaginary part of the neutrino
self-energy. This result corrects the formulae existing in the literature. The
mean free path of an ultra-high energy neutrino in a strong magnetic field is
calculated. An energy cutoff for neutrinos propagating in a strong field is
defined.
