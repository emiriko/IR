Two 5 square degree regions around the NGC 7332/9 galaxy pair and the
isolated galaxy NGC 1156 have been mapped in the 21-cm line of neutral hydrogen
(HI) with the Arecibo L-band Feed Array out to a redshift of ~0.065$ (~20,000$
km/s) as part of the Arecibo Galaxy Environment Survey. One of the aims of this
survey is to investigate the environment of galaxies by identifying dwarf
companions and interaction remnants; both of these areas provide the potential
for such discoveries. The neutral hydrogen observations were complemented by
optical and radio follow-up observations with a number of telescopes. A total
of 87 galaxies were found, of which 39 (45 per cent) were previously cataloged
and 15 (17 per cent) have prior redshifts. Two dwarf galaxies have been
discovered in the NGC 7332 group and a single dwarf galaxy in the vicinity NGC
1156 . A parallel optical search of the area revealed one further possible
dwarf galaxy near NGC 7332.
