The high-density star formation typical of the merger/starburst events that
power the large IR luminosities of Ultra Luminous
  Infrared Galaxies (ULIRGs) (L_{IR}>10^{12}Lsol) throughout the Universe
results to extraordinarily high cosmic ray (CR) energy densities of
U_CR~(few)x(10^3--10^4)U_{CR,Gal} permeating their interstellar medium (ISM), a
direct consequence of the large supernovae remnants (SNRs) number densities in
such systems. Unlike far-UV photons emanating from their numerous star forming
sites, these large CR energy densities in ULIRGs will volumetrically heat and
raise the ionization fraction of dense (n>10^4 cm^{-3}) UV-shielded gas cores
throughout their compact star-forming volumes. Such conditions can turn most of
the large molecular gas masses found in such systems and their high redshift
counterparts (M(H2)~10^9-10^10 M_{sol}) into giant CR-dominated Regions (CRDRs)
rather than ensembles of Photon-dominated Regions (PDRs) which dominate in less
IR-luminous systems where star formation and molecular gas distributions are
much more extended. The molecular gas in CRDRs will have a {\it minimum}
temperature of T_{kin}~(80--160)K, and very high ionization fractions of
x(e)>10^{-6} throughout its UV-shielded dense cores, which in turn will {\it
fundamentally alter the initial conditions for star formation in such
systems.}. Observational tests of CRDRs can be provided by ......
