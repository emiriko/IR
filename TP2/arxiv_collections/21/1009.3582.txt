We present an updated UBVRI photometric catalog containing 970 objects in the
field of M31, selected from the Revised Bologna Catalog (RBC v.4.0), including
965, 967, 965, 953, and 827 sources in the individual UBVRI bands,
respectively, of which 205, 123, 14, 126, and 109 objects do not have
previously published photometry. Photometry is performed using archival images
from the Local Group Galaxies Survey, which covers 2.2 deg^2 along the major
axis of M31. We focus on 445 confirmed `globular-like' clusters and candidates,
comprising typical globular and young massive clusters. The ages and masses of
these objects are derived by comparison of their observed spectral-energy
distributions with simple stellar population synthesis. Approximately half of
the clusters are younger than 2 Gyr, suggesting that there has been significant
recent active star formation in M31, which is consistent with previous results.
We note that clusters in the halo (r_ projected>30kpc) are composed of two
different components, older clusters with ages >10 Gyr and younger clusters
with ages around 1 Gyr. The spatial distributions show that the young clusters
(<2 Gyr) are spatially coincident with the galaxy's disk, including the `10 kpc
ring,' the `outer ring,' and the halo of M31, while the old clusters (> 2 Gyr)
are spatially correlated with the bulge and halo. We also estimate the masses
of the 445 confirmed clusters and candidates in M31 and find that our estimates
agree well with previously published values. We find that none of the young
disk clusters can survive the inevitable encounters with giant molecular clouds
in the galaxy's disk and that they will eventually disrupt on timescales of a
few Gyr. Specifically, young disk clusters with a mass of 10^4 M_\odot are
expected to dissolve within 3.0 Gyr and will, thus, not evolve to become
globular clusters.
