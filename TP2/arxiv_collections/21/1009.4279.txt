Conditions are presented for different types of identifiability of discrete
variable models generated over an undirected graph in which one node represents
a binary hidden variable. These models can be seen as extensions of the latent
class model to allow for conditional associations between the observable random
variables. Since local identification corresponds to full rank of the
parametrization map, we establish a necessary and sufficient condition for the
rank to be full everywhere in the parameter space. The condition is based on
the topology of the undirected graph associated to the model. For non-full rank
models, the obtained characterization allows us to find the subset of the
parameter space where the identifiability breaks down.
