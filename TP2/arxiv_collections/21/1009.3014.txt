The discovery of noncentrosymmetric superconductors, such as CePt$_3$Si, and
chiral superconductors, such as Sr$_2$RuO$_4$, calls for experimental methods
to identify the presence of spin-triplet pairing. We here demonstrate a method
which accomplishes this in an appealingly simple manner: a spin-sensitive
proximity effect in a ferromagnet$\mid$triplet superconductor bilayer. It is
shown how the orientation of the field can be used to unambiguously distinguish
between different spin-triplet states. Moreover, the proximity effect becomes
long-ranged in spite of the presence of an exchange field and even without any
magnetic inhomogeneities, in contrast to conventional S$\mid$F junctions. Our
results can be verified by STM-spectroscopy and could be useful as a tool to
characterize the pairing state in unconventional superconducting materials.
