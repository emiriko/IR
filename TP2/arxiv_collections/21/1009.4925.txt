A new method for constructing a Hamiltonian for configuration interaction
calculations with constraints to energies of spherical configurations obtained
with energy-density-functional (EDF) methods is presented. This results in a
unified model that reproduced the EDF binding-energy in the limit of
single-Slater determinants, but can also be used for obtaining energy spectra
and correlation energies with renormalized nucleon-nucleon interactions. The
three-body and/or density-dependent terms that are necessary for good nuclear
saturation properties are contained in the EDF. Applications to binding
energies and spectra of nuclei in the region above 208Pb are given.
