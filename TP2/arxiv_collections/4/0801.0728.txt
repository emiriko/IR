In recent years, sum-product estimates in Euclidean space and finite fields
have been studied using a variety of combinatorial, number theoretic and
analytic methods. Erdos type problems involving the distribution of distances,
areas and volumes have also received much attention. In this paper we prove a
relatively straightforward function version of an incidence results for points
and planes previously established in \cite{HI07} and \cite{HIKR07}. As a
consequence of our methods, we obtain sharp or near sharp results on the
distribution of volumes determined by subsets of vector spaces over finite
fields and the associated arithmetic expressions.
  In particular, our machinery enables us to prove that if $E \subset {\Bbb
F}_q^d$, $d \ge 4$, the $d$-dimensional vector space over a finite field ${\Bbb
F}_q$, of size much greater than $q^{\frac{d}{2}}$, and if $E$ is a product
set, then the set of volumes of $d$-dimensional parallelepipeds determined by
$E$ covers ${\Bbb F}_q$. This result is sharp as can be seen by taking $E$ to
equal to $A \times A \times ... \times A$, where $A$ is a sub-field of ${\Bbb
F}_q$ of size $\sqrt{q}$. In three dimensions we establish the same result if
$|E| \gtrsim q^{{15/8}}$. We prove in three dimensions that the set of volumes
covers a positive proportion of ${\Bbb F}_q$ if $|E| \ge Cq^{{3/2}}$. Finally
we show that in three dimensions the set of volumes covers a positive
proportion of ${\Bbb F}_q$ if $|E| \ge Cq^2$, without any further assumptions
on $E$, which is again sharp as taking $E$ to be a 2-plane through the origin
shows.
