Hyperspherical Partial Wave Theory has been applied to calculate T-matrix
elements and Single Differential Cross-Section (SDCS) results for
electron-hydrogen ionization process within Temkin-Poet model potential. We
considered three different values of step length to compute the radial part of
final state wave function. Numerical outcomes show that T-matrix elements and
SDCS values depend on the step length h. Here, we have presented T-matrix
elements and the corresponding SDCS results for 0.0075 a.u., 0.009 a.u. and
0.01 a.u. values of h and for 27.2eV, 40.8ev and 54.4eV impact energies. With
the help of the calculated data for three different step lengths, we have been
able to evaluate a two-term error function depending on the step length h.
Finally, two-term error corrected T-matrix elements and the corresponding SDCS
values have been computed. We fitted our two-term error corrected SDCS results
by a suitable curve and compared with the benchmark results of Jones et al.
[Phys. Rev. A, 66, 032717 (2002)]. Our fitted curves agree very well with the
calculated results of Jones et al. and two-term error corrected SDCS results
somewhere agree with the benchmark results. Two-term error corrected SDCS
results are significantly better than the calculated SDCS results of different
step lengths.
