In this lecture I give a short introduction to the high energy limit of
hadronic interactions. The elements of the Regge theory, Pomeron in QCD and
high energy scattering in AdS/CFT correspondence are presented. I discuss the
resummation of the hard Pomeron which in the case of the fixed coupling leads
to the value of intercept equal to two in the limit of the strong coupling.
