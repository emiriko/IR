Applying the Clausius relation, $\delta Q=TdS$, to the apparent horizon of
FRW universe in brane world scenarios, we show that an explicit entropy
expression associated with the apparent horizon can be obtained. On the
apparent horizon, the relation, $dE=TdS +WdV$, also holds in the brane world
scenarios. We show these results in the RSII model, warped DGP model and the
more general case with a Gauss-Bonnet term in the bulk and an intrinsic
curvature term on the brane.
