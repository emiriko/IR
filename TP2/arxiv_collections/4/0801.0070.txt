This talk reviews some key developments that have taken place in
hadron-collider jet finding over the past couple of years, including: technical
advances such as the complete formulation of an infrared safe seedless cone
algorithm and fast computational approaches to sequential recombination jet
finders like the kt algorithm, together with universal methods for subtracting
pileup; progress in understanding the sensitivity of jet algorithms to the
underlying event and hadronisation; and work that exploits our knowledge of QCD
divergences to better define and predict heavy-flavour jet cross sections.
