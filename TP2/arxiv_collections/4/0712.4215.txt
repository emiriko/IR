Despite all visible dividers, the Internet is getting us closer and closer,
but with a great price. Our security is the price. The international community
is fully aware of the urgent need to secure the cyberspace as you see the
multiplication of security standards and national schemes interpreting them
beyond borders: ISO 15408, ISO 17799, and ISO 27001. Even though some
countries, including the Security Big Six (SB6), are equipped with their
security books and may feel relatively safe; this remains a wrong sense of
security as long as they share their networks with entities of less security.
The standards impose security best practices and system specifications for the
development of information security management systems. Partners beyond borders
have to be secure as this is only possible if all entities connected to the
partnership remain secure. Unfortunately, there is no way to verify the
continuous security of partners without periodic security auditing and
certification, and members who do not comply should be barred from the
partnership. This concept also applies to the cyber space or the electronic
society. In order to clean our society from cyber crimes and cyber terrorism we
need to impose strict security policies and enforce them in a cooperative
manner. The paper discusses a country's effort in the development of a national
security strategy given its security economic intelligence position, its
security readiness, and its adverse exposure.
