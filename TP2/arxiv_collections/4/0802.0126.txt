On the basis of a general formula obtained earlier via fourth-order
erturbation theory within the framework of macroscopic quantum electrodynamics,
the van der Waals potential between two neutral, unpolarized, ground-state
atoms in the presence of a homogeneous, dispersing and absorbing
magnetoelectric sphere is studied. When the radius of the sphere becomes
sufficiently large, the result asymptotically agrees with that for two atoms
near a planar interface. In the opposite limit of a very small sphere, the
sphere can effectively be regarded as being a third ground-state atom, and the
nonadditive three-atom van der Waals potential is recovered. To illustrate the
effect of a sphere of arbitrary radius, numerical results are presented for the
triangular arrangement where the atoms are at equidistance from the sphere, and
for the linear arrangement where the atoms and the sphere are aligned along a
straight line. As demonstrated, the enhancement or reduction of the interaction
potential in the presence of purely electric or magnetic spheres can be
physically understood in terms of image charges.
