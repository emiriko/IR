We present a simple nonlinear resonant analog circuit which demonstrates
quantization of resonating amplitudes, for a given excitation level. The system
is a simple RLC resonator where C is an active capacitor whose value is related
to the current in the circuit. This variation is energetically equivalent to a
variation of the potential energy and the circuit acts as a pendulum in the
gravitational field. The excitation voltage, synchronously switched at the
current frequency, enables electrical supply and keeping the oscillation of the
system. The excitation frequency has been set to high harmonic of the
fundamental oscillation so that anisochronicity can keep constant the amplitude
of the circuit voltage and current. The behavior of the circuit is unusual:
different stable amplitudes have been measured depending on initial conditions
and excitation frequency, for the same amplitude of the excitation. The
excitation frequency is naturally divided by the circuit and the ratio is kept
constant without external disturbance. Moreover, a variation of the dumping
does not affect significantly the amplitudes as long as the oscillation is
observed. And lastly, electrical pulses can change, as in quantum systems, the
operating amplitude which is auto-stable without disturbances. Many
applications of this circuit can be imagined in microelectronics (including
computing), energy conversion and time and frequency domains.
