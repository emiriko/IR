Understanding the earth's climate system and how it might be changing is a
preeminent scientific challenge. Global climate models are used to simulate
past, present, and future climates, and experiments are executed continuously
on an array of distributed supercomputers. The resulting data archive, spread
over several sites, currently contains upwards of 100 TB of simulation data and
is growing rapidly. Looking toward mid-decade and beyond, we must anticipate
and prepare for distributed climate research data holdings of many petabytes.
The Earth System Grid (ESG) is a collaborative interdisciplinary project aimed
at addressing the challenge of enabling management, discovery, access, and
analysis of these critically important datasets in a distributed and
heterogeneous computational environment. The problem is fundamentally a Grid
problem. Building upon the Globus toolkit and a variety of other technologies,
ESG is developing an environment that addresses authentication, authorization
for data access, large-scale data transport and management, services and
abstractions for high-performance remote data access, mechanisms for scalable
data replication, cataloging with rich semantic and syntactic information, data
discovery, distributed monitoring, and Web-based portals for using the system.
