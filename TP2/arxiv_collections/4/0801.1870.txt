It is shown in this comment that considering the Mauna Loa observation of the
atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration and the mean near surface temperature
anomalies for the period from the beginning of the seventies to recent years
only is, clearly, a source of misinterpretation. If we consider the whole
period of available data (1958 - 2004), we obtain results which differ from
those presented by Rahmstorf et al. It is also shown that in 1988 when the
Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change (IPCC) of the United Nations and the
World Meteorological Organization (WMO) was established there was certainly no
correlation between the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration and the mean
near surface temperature anomalies, neither on the annual time scale nor on the
monthly time scale.
