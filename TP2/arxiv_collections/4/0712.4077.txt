A magnetic inclusion inside a superconductor gives rise to a fascinating
complex of {\it vortex loops}. Our calculations, done in the framework of the
Ginzburg-Landau theory, reveal that {\it loops always nucleate in triplets}
around the magnetic core. In a mesoscopic superconducting sphere, the final
superconducting state is characterized by those confined vortex loops and the
ones that eventually spring to the surface of the sphere, evolving into {\it
vortex pairs} piercing through the sample surface.
