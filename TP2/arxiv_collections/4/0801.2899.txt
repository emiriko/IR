We develop a theory of Malliavin calculus for Banach space valued random
variables. Using radonifying operators instead of symmetric tensor products we
extend the Wiener-Ito isometry to Banach spaces. In the white noise case we
obtain two sided L^p-estimates for multiple stochastic integrals in arbitrary
Banach spaces. It is shown that the Malliavin derivative is bounded on
vector-valued Wiener-Ito chaoses. Our main tools are decoupling inequalities
for vector-valued random variables. In the opposite direction we use Meyer's
inequalities to give a new proof of a decoupling result for Gaussian chaoses in
UMD Banach spaces.
