We report on the first measurement of the thermal conductivity of a suspended
single layer graphene. The measurements were performed using a non-contact
optical technique. The near room-temperature values of the thermal conductivity
in the range ~ 4840 to 5300 W/mK were extracted for a single-layer graphene.
The extremely high value of the thermal conductivity suggests that graphene can
outperform carbon nanotubes in heat conduction.
