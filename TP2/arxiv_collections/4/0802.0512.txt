The Thurston compactification of Teichmuller spaces has been generalized to
many different representation spaces by J. Morgan, P. Shalen, M. Bestvina, F.
Paulin, A. Parreau and others. In the simplest case of representations of
fundamental groups of closed hyperbolic surfaces in PSL(2,R), we prove that
this compactification is very degenerated: the nice behaviour of the Thurston
compactification of the Teichmuller space contrasts with wild phenomena
happening on the boundary of the other connected components of these
representation spaces. We prove that it is more natural to consider a
refinement of this compactification, which remembers the orientation of the
hyperbolic plane. The ideal points of this compactification are fat R-trees,
i.e., R-trees equipped with a planar structure.
