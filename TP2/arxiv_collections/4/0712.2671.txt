Given a parametrization of a rational plane algebraic curve C, some explicit
adjoint pencils on C are described in terms of determinants. Moreover, some
generators of the Rees algebra associated to this parametrization are
presented. The main ingredient developed in this paper is a detailed study of
the elimination ideal of two homogeneous polynomials in two homogeneous
variables that form a regular sequence.
