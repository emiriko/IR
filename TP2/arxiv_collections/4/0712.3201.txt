I report on recent results for the total production cross section of the
process e- e+ -> mu- nubar_mu u dbar X near the W-pair production threshold up
to next-to-leading order in GammaW/MW alpha v^2 obtained in the framework of
unstable-particle effective field theory. Remaining theoretical uncertainties
and their impact on the experimental determination of the W mass are discussed.
