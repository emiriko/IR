The observer dependence of the quasi-local energy (QLE) and momentum in the
Schwarzschild geometry is illustrated. Using the Brown-York prescription, the
QLE for families of non-geodesic and geodesic observers penetrating the event
horizon is obtained. An explicit shell-building process is presented and the
binding energy is computed in terms of the QLE measured by a static observer
field at a radius outside the horizon radius. The QLE for a radially geodesic
observer field freely-falling from infinity is shown to vanish. Finally, a
simple relation for the dynamics of the quasi-local momentum density for a
geodesic observer field is noted.
