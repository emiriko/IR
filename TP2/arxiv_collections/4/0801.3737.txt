We present Raman scattering studies of the structural and magnetic phases
that accompany temperature- and field-dependent melting of charge- and
orbital-order (COO) in La0.5Ca0.5MnO3 and La0.25Pr0.375Ca0.375MnO3. Our results
show that thermal and field-induced COO melting in La0.5Ca0.5MnO3 exhibits
three stages in a heterogeneous melting process associated with a structural
change: a long-range, strongly JT distorted/COO regime; a coexistence regime;
and weakly JT distorted/PM or FM phase. We provide a complete structural phase
diagram of La0.5Ca0.5MnO3 for the temperature and field ranges 6<=T<=170 K and
0<=H<=9 T. We also investigate thermal and field-induced melting in
La0.25Pr0.375Ca0.375MnO3 to elucidate the role of disorder in melting of COO.
We find that while thermal melting of COO in La0.25Pr0.375Ca0.375MnO3 is quite
similar to that in La0.5Ca0.5MnO3, the field-induced transition from the COO
phase to the weakly JT-distorted/FM phase in La0.25Pr0.375Ca0.375MnO3 is very
abrupt, and occurs at significantly lower fields (H~2 T at T~0 K) than in
La0.5Ca0.5MnO3 (H~30 T at T=0 K). Moreover, the critical field H_c increases
with increasing temperature in La0.25Pr0.375Ca0.375MnO3 in contrast to
La0.5Ca0.5MnO3. To explain these differences, we propose that field-induced
melting of COO in La0.25Pr0.375Ca0.375MnO3 is best described as the
field-induced percolation of FM domains, and we suggest that Griffiths phase
physics may be an appropriate theoretical model for describing the unusual
temperature- and field- dependent transitions observed in
La0.25Pr0.375Ca0.375MnO3.
