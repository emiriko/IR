This paper explores the process of validation for the abstract syntax of a
graphical notation. We define an unified specification for five of the UML
diagrams used by the Discovery Method and, in this document, we illustrate how
diagrams can be represented in Alloy and checked against our specification in
order to know if these are valid under the Discovery notation.
