A complete knowledge of its excitation spectrum could greatly benefit efforts
to understand the unusual form of superconductivity occurring in the lightly
hole-doped copper-oxides. Here we use tunnelling spectroscopy to measure the
T\to 0 spectrum of electronic excitations N(E) over a wide range of
hole-density p in superconducting Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{8+/delta}. We
introduce a parameterization for N(E) based upon an anisotropic energy-gap
/Delta (\vec k)=/Delta_{1}(Cos(k_{x})-Cos(k_{y}))/2 plus an effective
scattering rate which varies linearly with energy /Gamma_{2}(E) . We
demonstrate that this form of N(E) allows successful fitting of differential
tunnelling conductance spectra throughout much of the
Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{8+/delta} phase diagram. The resulting average
/Delta_{1} values rise with falling p along the familiar trajectory of
excitations to the 'pseudogap' energy, while the key scattering rate
/Gamma_{2}^{*}=/Gamma_{2}(E=/Delta_{1}) increases from below ~1meV to a value
approaching 25meV as the system is underdoped from p~16% to p<10%. Thus, a
single, particle-hole symmetric, anisotropic energy-gap, in combination with a
strongly energy and doping dependent effective scattering rate, can describe
the spectra without recourse to another ordered state. Nevertheless we also
observe two distinct and diverging energy scales in the system: the energy-gap
maximum /Delta_{1} and a lower energy scale /Delta_{0} separating the spatially
homogeneous and heterogeneous electronic structures.
