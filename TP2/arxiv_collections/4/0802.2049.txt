In 78' M. Kashiwara and Vergne conjectured some property on the
Campbell-Hausdorff series in such way a trace formula is satisfied. They
proposed an explicit solution in the case of solvable Lie algebras. In this
note we prove that this "solvable solution" is not universal. Our method is
based on computer calculation. Furthermore our programs prove up to degree 16,
Drinfeld's Lie algebra $\mathfrak{grt}_1$ coincides with the Lie algebra
$\hat{kv_2}$ defined in \cite{AT}.
