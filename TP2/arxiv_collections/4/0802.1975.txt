A genuine tripartite entanglement monotone is presented for $(2\otimes
2\otimes n)$-dimensional tripartite pure states by introducing a new
entanglement measure for bipartite pure states. As an application, we consider
the genuine tripartite entanglement of the ground state of the exactly solvable
isotropic spin-1/2 chain with three-spin interaction. It is shown that the
singular behavior of the genuine tripartite entanglement exactly signals a
quantum phase transition.
