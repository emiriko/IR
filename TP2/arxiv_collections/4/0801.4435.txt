Mathematical arguments are presented that give a unique answer to the
question in the title. Subsequently, the mathematical analysis is extended
using results of detailed model calculations that, in addition, throw further
light on the consequences of the analysis. Finally, through a comparison with
various recent studies, many of the latter are given a new interpretation.
