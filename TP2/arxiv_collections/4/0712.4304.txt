KIF1A kinesins are single-headed motor proteins which move on cylindrical
nano-tubes called microtubules (MT). A normal MT consists of 13 protofilaments
on which the equispaced motor binding sites form a periodic array. The
collective movement of the kinesins on a MT is, therefore, analogous to
vehicular traffic on multi-lane highways where each protofilament is the
analogue of a single lane. Does lane-changing increase or decrease the motor
flux per lane? We address this fundamental question here by appropriately
extending a recent model [{\it Phys. Rev. E {\bf 75}, 041905 (2007)}]. By
carrying out analytical calculations and computer simulations of this extended
model, we predict that the flux per lane can increase or decrease with the
increasing rate of lane changing, depending on the concentrations of motors and
the rate of hydrolysis of ATP, the ``fuel'' molecules. Our predictions can be
tested, in principle, by carrying out {\it in-vitro} experiments with
fluorescently labelled KIF1A molecules.
