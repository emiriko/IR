We investigate the spectral properties of a hole moving in a two-dimensional
Hubbard model for strongly correlated t_2g electrons. Although superexchange
interactions are Ising-like, a quasi-one-dimensional coherent hole motion
arises due to effective three-site terms. This mechanism is fundamentally
different from the hole motion via quantum fluctuations in the conventional
spin model with SU(2) symmetry. The orbital model describes also propagation of
a hole in some e_g compounds, and we argue that orbital degeneracy alone does
not lead to hole self-localization.
