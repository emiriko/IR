Optical atomic clocks promise timekeeping at the highest precision and
accuracy, owing to their high operating frequencies. Rigorous evaluations of
these clocks require direct comparisons between them. We have realized a
high-performance remote comparison of optical clocks over km-scale urban
distances, a key step for development, dissemination, and application of these
optical standards. Through this remote comparison and a proper design of
lattice-confined neutral atoms for clock operation, we evaluate the uncertainty
of a strontium (Sr) optical lattice clock at the 1x10-16 fractional level,
surpassing the best current evaluations of cesium (Cs) primary standards. We
also report on the observation of density-dependent effects in the
spin-polarized fermionic sample and discuss the current limiting effect of
blackbody radiation-induced frequency shifts.
