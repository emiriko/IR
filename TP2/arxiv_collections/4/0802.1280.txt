The noise power spectral density of a thermal current between two macroscopic
dielectric bodies held at different temperatures and connected only at a
quantum point contact is calculated. Assuming the thermal energy is carried
only by phonons, we model the quantum point contact as a mechanical link,
having a harmonic spring potential. In the weak coupling, or weak-link limit,
we find the thermal current analog of the well-known electronic shot-noise
expression.
