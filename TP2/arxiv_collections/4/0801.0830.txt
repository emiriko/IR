Central pattern generators (CPGs), with a basis is neurophysiological
studies, are a type of neural network for the generation of rhythmic motion.
While CPGs are being increasingly used in robot control, most applications are
hand-tuned for a specific task and it is acknowledged in the field that generic
methods and design principles for creating individual networks for a given task
are lacking. This study presents an approach where the connectivity and
oscillatory parameters of a CPG network are determined by an evolutionary
algorithm with fitness evaluations in a realistic simulation with accurate
physics. We apply this technique to a five-link planar walking mechanism to
demonstrate its feasibility and performance. In addition, to see whether
results from simulation can be acceptably transferred to real robot hardware,
the best evolved CPG network is also tested on a real mechanism. Our results
also confirm that the biologically inspired CPG model is well suited for legged
locomotion, since a diverse manifestation of networks have been observed to
succeed in fitness simulations during evolution.
