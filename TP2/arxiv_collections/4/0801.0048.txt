The concept of rejecting the null hypothesis for definitively detecting a
signal was extended to relaxation spectrum space for multiexponential
reconstruction. The novel test was applied to the problem of detecting the
myelin signal, which is believed to have a time constant below 40ms, in T2
decays from MRI's of the human brain. It was demonstrated that the test allowed
the detection of a signal in a relaxation spectrum using only the information
in the data, thus avoiding any potentially unreliable prior information. The
test was implemented both explicitly and implicitly for simulated T2
measurements. For the explicit implementation, the null hypothesis was that a
relaxation spectrum existed that had no signal below 40ms and that was
consistent with the T2 decay. The confidence level by which the null hypothesis
could be rejected gave the confidence level that there was signal below the
40ms time constant. The explicit implementation assessed the test's performance
with and without prior information where the prior information was the
nonnegative relaxation spectrum assumption. The test was also implemented
implicitly with a data conserving multiexponential reconstruction algorithm
that used left invertible matrices and that has been published previously. The
implicit and explicit implementations demonstrated similar characteristics in
detecting the myelin signal in both the simulated and experimental T2 decays,
providing additional evidence to support the close link between the two tests.
