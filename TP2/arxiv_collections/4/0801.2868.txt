Using the instant form dynamics of Poincar\'e invariant quantum mechanics and
the modified relativistic impulse approximation proposed previously we
calculate asymptotics of electromagnetic form factors for the deuteron
considered as two--nucleon system. We show that today experiment on the elastic
$ed$-scattering has reached asymptotic regime. The possible range of momentum
transfer when the quark degrees of freedom could be seen in future JLab
experiments is estimated. The explicit relation between the behavior of
deuteron wave function at $r=0$ and the form factors asymptotics is obtained.
The conditions on wave functions to give the asymptotics predicted by QCD and
quark counting rules are formulated.
