It has been suggested about 20 years ago that the liquid close to the inner
core boundary (ICB) is supercooled and that a sizable mushy layer has developed
during the growth of the inner core. The morphological instability of the
liquid-solid interface which usually results in the formation of a mushy zone
has been intensively studied in metallurgy, but the freezing of the inner core
occurs in very unusual conditions: the growth rate is very small, and the
pressure gradient has a key role, the newly formed solid being hotter than the
adjacent liquid. We investigate the linear stability of a solidification front
under such conditions, pointing out the destabilizing role of the thermal and
solutal fields, and the stabilizing role of the pressure gradient. The main
consequence of the very small solidification rate is the importance of
advective transport of solute in liquid, which tends to remove light solute
from the vicinity of the ICB and to suppress supercooling, thus acting against
the destabilization of the solidification front. For plausible phase diagrams
of the core mixture, we nevertheless found that the ICB is likely to be
morphologically unstable, and that a mushy zone might have developed at the
ICB. The thermodynamic thickness of the resulting mushy zone can be
significant, from $\sim100$ km to the entire inner core radius, depending on
the phase diagram of the core mixture. However, such a thick mushy zone is
predicted to collapse under its own weight, on a much smaller length scale
($\lesssim 1$ km). We estimate that the interdendritic spacing is probably
smaller than a few tens of meter, and possibly only a few meters.
