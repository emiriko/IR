This tutorial is intended to give an accessible introduction to Hopf
algebras. The mathematical context is that of representation theory, and we
also illustrate the structures with examples taken from combinatorics and
quantum physics, showing that in this latter case the axioms of Hopf algebra
arise naturally. The text contains many exercises, some taken from physics,
aimed at expanding and exemplifying the concepts introduced.
