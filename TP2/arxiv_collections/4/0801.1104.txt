We propose a scheme for continuous-variable telecloning with phase-conjugate
inputs (PCI). Two cases of PCI telecloning are considered. The first case is
where PCI telecloning produces $M$ clones nonlocally and $M$ anticlones
locally, or vice versa. This kind of PCI telecloning requires only one EPR
(Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen) entangled, two-mode squeezed state as a resource for
building the appropriate multi-mode, multipartite entangled state via linear
optics. The other case is a PCI telecloning protocol in which both clones and
anticlones are created nonlocally. Such a scheme requires two EPR entangled
states for the generation of a suitable multipartite entangled state. As our
schemes are reversible, optimal cloning fidelities are achieved in the limit of
infinite squeezing.
