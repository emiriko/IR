The magnetic properties of as-grown Ga$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$As have been
investigated by the systematic measurements of temperature and magnetic field
dependent soft x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD). The {\it intrinsic}
XMCD intensity at high temperatures obeys the Curie-Weiss law, but residual
spin magnetic moment appears already around 100 K, significantly above Curie
temperature ($T_C$), suggesting that short-range ferromagnetic correlations are
developed above $T_C$. The present results also suggest that antiferromagnetic
interaction between the substitutional and interstitial Mn (Mn$_{int}$) ions
exists and that the amount of the Mn$_{int}$ affects $T_C$.
