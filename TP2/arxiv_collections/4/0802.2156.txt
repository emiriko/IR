We show that an unknown quantum state in phase space can be teleported via
three-mode entanglement generated by continuous variable quantum cloning
machine (transformation). Further, proceeding with our teleportation protocol
we are able to improve the fidelity of teleportation obtained by Loock et.al.
[Phys.Rev.Lett. 84, 3482(2000)]. Also we study here the entanglement between
the two output copies from cloning machine.
