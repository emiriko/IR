I apply the equations of motion derived in the accompanying manuscript for
the classical approximation of the vsl-path integral to the Newtonian
gravitational field in simple geometries. The vsl classical-action, a complex
quantity in this case, yields modified Euler-Lagrange equations. This, in turn,
leads to the emergence of two equations of motions that must be satisfied
concomitantly in order to minimize the complex action. The solutions obtained
to the doublet equation of motion include the MOND force law, a
dark-energy-like omni-present repulsive gravitational force, a pioneer-like
anomaly at the solar system level, and additional predictions, which can be
verified with either careful observations or via additional probes to the outer
solar system. The exercise carried out in this paper exemplifies the
explanatory potential of the vsl-approach, pointing to a potentially new
physics paradigm. Finally, the vsl-approach is not only predictive, but highly
falsifiable, an important ingredient of any physics theory.
