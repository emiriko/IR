Let G = Sp (2n) be the symplectic group over Z. We present a certain kind of
deformation of the nilpotent cone of G with G-action. This enables us to make
direct links between the Springer correspondence of sp_{2n} over C, that over
characteristic two, and our exotic Springer correspondence. As a by-product, we
obtain a complete description of our exotic Springer correspondence.
