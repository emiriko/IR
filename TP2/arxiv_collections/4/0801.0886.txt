We demonstrate dynamic voltage control of the magnetic anisotropy of a
(Ga,Mn)As device bonded to a piezoelectric transducer. The application of a
uniaxial strain leads to a large reorientation of the magnetic easy axis which
is detected by measuring longitudinal and transverse anisotropic
magnetoresistance coefficients. Calculations based on the mean-field
kinetic-exchange model of (Ga,Mn)As provide microscopic understanding of the
measured effect. Electrically induced magnetization switching and detection of
unconventional crystalline components of the anisotropic magnetoresistance are
presented, illustrating the generic utility of the piezo voltage control to
provide new device functionalities and in the research of micromagnetic and
magnetotransport phenomena in diluted magnetic semiconductors.
