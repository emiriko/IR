We investigate the connection between sub-Planck structure in the Wigner
function and the output fidelity of continuous-variable teleportation
protocols. When the teleporting parties share a two-mode squeezed state as an
entangled resource, high fidelity in the output state requires a squeezing
large enough that the smallest sub-Planck structures in an input pure state are
teleported faithfully. We formulate this relationship, which leads to an
explicit relation between the fine-scale structure in the Wigner function and
large-scale extent of the Wigner function, and we treat specific examples,
including coherent, number, and random states and states produced by chaotic
dynamics. We generalize the pure-state results to teleportation of mixed
states.
