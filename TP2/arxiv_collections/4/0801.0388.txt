Using a single-plaquette approximation, novel magnetoinductance effects in
Josephson junction arrays (JJAs) are predicted, including the appearance of
steps in the temperature behavior of magnetic susceptibility. The number of
steps (as well as their size) is controlled by the kinetic inductance of the
plaquette whose field dependence is governed by the Abrikosov vortices
penetrating superconducting regions of the array. The experimental conditions
under which the predicted effects should manifest themselves in artificially
prepared JJAs are discussed.
