Various parametrizations of sigma(gamma p) are tried out on the small-x fixed
target and HERA data. A two-Pomeron type parametrization is found to give the
best reproduction of the data. The data indicate that the value of lambda(eff)
for parametrizations of the form sigma(gamma p)~l^lambda(eff) approaches a
constant value at high Q^2. The extrapolated values of sigma(gamma p) to very
long coherence lengths are found to cross in some parametrizations for l>10^7
fm, indicating the possibility that sigma(gamma p) becomes Q^2 independent at
large values of the coherence length l.
