Prime reciprocals have applications in coding and cryptography and for
generation of random sequences. This paper investigates the structural
redundancy of prime reciprocals in base 10 in a manner that parallels an
earlier study for binary prime reciprocals. Several different kinds of
structural relationships amongst the digits in reciprocal sequences are
classified with respect to the digit in the least significant place of the
prime. It is also shown that the frequency of digit 0 exceeds that of every
other digit when the entire set of prime reciprocal sequences is considered.
