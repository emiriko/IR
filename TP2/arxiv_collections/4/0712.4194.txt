The solvable quantum mechanical model for the relativistic two-body system
composed of spin-1/2 and spin-0 particles is constructed. The model includes
the oscillator-type interaction through a combination of Lorentz-vector and
-tensor potentials. The analytical expressions for the wave functions and the
order of the energy levels are discussed.
