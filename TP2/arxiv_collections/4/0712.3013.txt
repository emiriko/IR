In this talk I summarize recent findings made on the description of axial
vector mesons as dynamically generated states from the interaction of
peseudoscalar mesons and vector mesons, dedicating some attention to the two
$K_1(1270)$ states. Then I review the generation of open and hidden charm
scalar and axial states. Finally, I present recent results showing that the low
lying $1/2^+$ baryon resonances for S=-1 can be obtained as bound states or
resonances of two mesons and one baryon in coupled channels dynamics.
