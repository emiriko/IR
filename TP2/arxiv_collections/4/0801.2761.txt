A review of protective measurements. Protective measurement is a method for
measuring an expectation value of an observable on a single quantum system. The
quantum state of the system can be protected by a potential, when the state is
a nondegenerate energy eigenstate with a known gap to neighboring states, or
via Zeno effect by frequent projection measurements.
