We investigate the properties of strongly interacting heteronuclear
boson-boson mixtures loaded in realistic optical lattices, with particular
emphasis on the physics of interfaces. In particular, we numerically reproduce
the recent experimental observation that the addition of a small fraction of K
induces a significant loss of coherence in Rb, providing a simple explanation.
We then investigate the robustness against the inhomogeneity typical of
realistic experimental realizations of the glassy quantum emulsions recently
predicted to occur in strongly interacting boson-boson mixtures on ideal
homogeneous lattices.
