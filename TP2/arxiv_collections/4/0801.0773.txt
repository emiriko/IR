Molecular dynamics calculations of the vibrational behavior of atoms in a
Lennard-Jones 147-atom cluster revealed that the relaxation and the stability
of the collective vibration of atoms in the cluster depend on the extent of the
mechanical disturbance. A relatively larger-scale perturbation will cause a
faster decay of the vibration magnitude, the potential and the kinetic energy
compared to the vibration stimulated by a small-scale stimulus.
