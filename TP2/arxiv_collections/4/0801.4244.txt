The electronic structure of In$_{2-x}$V$_x$O$_3$ ($x=0.08$) has been
investigated using photoemission spectroscopy (PES) and x-ray absorption
spectroscopy (XAS). The V $2p$ core-level PES and XAS spectra revealed
trivalent electronic state of the V ion, consistent with the substitution of
the V ion for the In site. The V 3d partial density of states obtained by the
resonant PES technique showed a sharp peak above the O $2p$ band. While the O
$1s$ XAS spectrum of In$_{2-x}$V$_x$O$_3$ was similar to that of In$_2$O$_3$,
there were differences in the In $3p$ and 3d XAS spectra between V-doped and
pure In$_2$O$_3$. The observations give clear evidence for hybridization
between the In conduction band and the V 3d orbitals in In$_{2-x}$V$_x$O$_3$.
