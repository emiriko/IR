We present extensive Monte Carlo simulations for the thermodynamic and
structural properties of a planar bilayer of dipolar hard spheres for a wide
range of densities, dipole moments and layer separations. Expressions for the
stress and pressure tensors of the bilayer system are derived. For all
thermodynamic states considered the interlayer energy is shown to be attractive
and much smaller than the intralayer contribution to the energy. It vanishes at
layer separations of the order of two hard sphere diameters. The normal
pressure is negative and decays as a function of layer separation $h$ as
$-1/h^5$. Intralayer and interlayer pair distribution functions and angular
correlation functions are presented. Despite the weak interlayer energy strong
positional and orientational correlations exist between particles in the two
layers.
