Using the CLEO-c detector at the Cornell Electron Storage Ring, we have
measured inclusive and exclusive cross sections for the production of D+, D0
and Ds+ mesons in e+e- annihilations at thirteen center-of-mass energies
between 3.97 and 4.26 GeV. Exclusive cross sections are presented for final
states consisting of two charm mesons (DD, D*D, D*D*, Ds+Ds-, Ds*+Ds-, and
Ds*+Ds*-) and for processes in which the charm-meson pair is accompanied by a
pion. No enhancement in any final state is observed at the energy of the
Y(4260).
