We have previously described a mathematical formulation for a parton shower
based on the approximation of strongly ordered virtualities of successive
parton splittings. Quantum interference, including interference among different
color and spin states, is included. In this paper, we add the further
approximations of taking only the leading color limit and averaging over spins,
as is common in parton shower Monte Carlo event generators. Soft gluon
interference effects remain with this approximation. We find that the leading
color, spin averaged shower in our formalism is similar to that in other shower
formulations. We discuss some of the differences.
