The Ising-like anisotropy parameter $\delta$ in the Kondo necklace model is
analyzed using the bond-operator method at zero and finite temperatures for
arbitrary $d$ dimensions. A decoupling scheme on the double time Green's
functions is used to find the dispersion relation for the excitations of the
system. At zero temperature and in the paramagnetic side of the phase diagram,
we determine the spin gap exponent $\nu z\approx0.5$ in three dimensions and
anisotropy between $0\leq\delta\leq1$, a result consistent with the dynamic
exponent $z=1$ for the Gaussian character of the bond-operator treatment. At
low but finite temperatures, in the antiferromagnetic phase, the line of Neel
transitions is calculated for $\delta\ll1$ and $\delta\approx1$. For $d>2$ it
is only re-normalized by the anisotropy parameter and varies with the distance
to the quantum critical point QCP $|g|$ as, $T_N \propto |g|^{\psi}$ where the
shift exponent $\psi=1/(d-1)$. Nevertheless, in two dimensions, long range
magnetic order occurs only at T=0 for any $\delta$. In the paramagnetic phase,
we find a power law temperature dependence on the specific heat at the
\textit{quantum liquid trajectory} $J/t=(J/t)_{c}$, $T\to0$. It behaves as
$C_{V}\propto T^{d}$ for $\delta\leq 1$ and $\delta\approx1$, in concordance
with the scaling theory for $z=1$.
