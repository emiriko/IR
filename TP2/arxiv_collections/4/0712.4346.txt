The electronic spectra for double-wall zigzag and armchair nanotubes are
found. The influence of nanotube curvatures on the electronic spectra is also
calculated. Our finding that the outer shell is hole doped by the inner shell
is in the difference between Fermi levels of individual shells which originate
from the different hybridization of pi-orbital. The shift and rotation of the
inner nanotube with respect to the outer nanotube are investigated. We found
stable semimetal characteristics of the armchair DWNTs in regard of the shift
and rotation of the inner nanotube. We predict the shift of k_F towards the
bigger wave vectors with decreasing of the radius of the armchair nanotube.
