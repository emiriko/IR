We deal with symmetry properties for solutions of nonlocal equations of the
type $(-\Delta)^s v= f(v)\qquad {in $\R^n$,}$ where $s \in (0,1)$ and the
operator $(-\Delta)^s$ is the so-called fractional Laplacian. The study of this
nonlocal equation is made via a careful analysis of the following degenerate
elliptic equation
  ${-div (x^\a \nabla u)=0 \qquad {on $\R^n\times(0,+\infty)$}
  -x^\a u_x = f(u) \qquad {on $\R^n\times\{0\}$} $
  where $\a \in (-1,1)$. This equation is related to the fractional Laplacian
since the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator $\Gamma_\a: u|_{\partial \R^{n+1}_+}
\mapsto -x^\a u_x |_{\partial \R^{n+1}_+} $ is $(-\Delta)^{\frac{1-\a}{2}}$.
This equation is related to the fractional Laplacian since the
Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator $\Gamma_\a: u|_{\partial \R^{n+1}_+} \mapsto
-x^\a u_x |_{\partial \R^{n+1}_+} $ is $(-\Delta)^{\frac{1-\a}{2}}$. More
generally, we study the so-called boundary reaction equations given by
  ${-div (\mu(x) \nabla u)+g(x,u)=0 {on $\R^n\times(0,+\infty)$}
  - \mu(x) u_x = f(u) {on $\R^n\times{0}$}$
  under some natural assumptions on the diffusion coefficient $\mu$ and on the
nonlinearities $f$ and $g$. We prove a geometric formula of Poincar\'e-type for
stable solutions, from which we derive a symmetry result in the spirit of a
conjecture of De Giorgi.
