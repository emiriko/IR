We consider trigonometric solutions of WDVV equations and derive geometric
conditions when a collection of vectors with multiplicities determines such a
solution. We incorporate these conditions into the notion of trigonometric
Veselov system ($\vee$-system) and we determine all trigonometric
$\vee$-systems with up to five vectors. We show that generalized
Calogero-Moser-Sutherland operator admits a factorized eigenfunction if and
only if it corresponds to the trigonometric $\vee$-system; this inverts a
one-way implication observed by Veselov for the rational solutions.
