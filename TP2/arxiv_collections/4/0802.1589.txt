We describe a non-supersymmetric orbifold GUT based on SU(5) symmetry. It is
a modification of Kawamura's 5-D orbifold GUT model. The difference lies in the
choice of Higgs scalars as we have allowed only 5-plets of SU(5) in the GUT
scale. This variant was originally proposed by Brahmachari and Raychoudhuri.
Proton decay problem and the doublet triplet splitting problems are solved by
extra dimensional mechanism. The unification scale is around $5.0 \times
10^{13}$ GeVs. In low energy there are nine Higgs doublets. One at the 100 GeV
region and eight others degenerate at around 1.4 TeV. It is an attractive
non-supersymmetric extension of standard model with very rich collider physics
phenomenology.
