We derive a controlled expansion into mean field plus fluctuations for the
extended Bose-Hubbard model, involving interactions with many neighbors on an
arbitrary periodic lattice, and study the superfluid-supersolid phase
transition. Near the critical point, the impact of (thermal and quantum)
fluctuations on top of the mean field grows, which entails striking effects,
such as negative superfluid densities and thermodynamical instability of the
superfluid phase -- earlier as expected from mean-field dynamics. We also
predict the existence of long-lived "supercooled" states with anomalously large
quantum fluctuations.
