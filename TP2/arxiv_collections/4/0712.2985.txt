The structure of spacetime, quantum field theory, and thermodynamics are all
connected through the concepts of the Hawking and Unruh temperatures. The
possible detection of the related radiation constitutes a fundamental test of
such subtle connections. Here a scheme is presented for the detection of Unruh
radiation based on currently available laser systems. By separating the
classical radiation from the Unruh-response in frequency space, it is found
that the detection of Unruh radiation is possible in terms of soft x-ray
photons using current laser-electron beam technology. The experimental
constraints are discussed and a proposal for an experimental design is given.
