Magnetization, resistivity and specific heat measurements were performed on
the solution-grown, single crystals of six GdT$_2$Zn$_{20}$ (T = Fe, Ru, Os,
Co, Rh and Ir) compounds, as well as their Y analogues. For the Gd compounds,
the Fe column members manifest a ferromagnetic (FM) ground state (with an
enhanced Curie temperature, $T_{\mathrm{C}}$, for T = Fe and Ru), whereas the
Co column members manifest an antiferromagnetic (AFM) ground state.
Thermodynamic measurements on the YT$_2$Zn$_{20}$ revealed that the enhanced
$T_{\mathrm{C}}$ for GdFe$_2$Zn$_{20}$ and GdRu$_2$Zn$_{20}$ can be understood
within the framework of Heisenberg moments embedded in a nearly ferromagnetic
Fermi liquid. Furthermore, electronic structure calculations indicate that this
significant enhancement is due to large, close to the Stoner FM criterion,
transition metal partial density of states at Fermi level, whereas the change
of FM to AFM ordering is associated with filling of electronic states with two
additional electrons per formula unit. The degree of this sensitivity is
addressed by the studies of the pseudo-ternary compounds
Gd(Fe$_x$Co$_{1-x}$)$_2$Zn$_{20}$ and Y(Fe$_x$Co$_{1-x}$)$_2$Zn$_{20}$ which
clearly reveal the effect of 3d band filling on their magnetic properties.
