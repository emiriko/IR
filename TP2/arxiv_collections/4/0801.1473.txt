We examine the compatibility of the Einstein minimally coupled
self-interacting scalar field theory with the local tests of gravity. We find
that apart from the trivial case of the Schwarzschild-de Sitter solution with
constant scalar field the theory does not admit any other static solution,
which is consistent with the solar system tests of gravity.
