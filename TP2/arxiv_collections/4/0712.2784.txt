We describe a new scheme to fully control the joint spectrum of paired
photons generated in spontaneous parametric down-conversion. We show the
capability of this method to generate frequency-uncorrelated photon pairs that
are pure and indistinguishable, and whose bandwidth can be readily tuned.
Importantly, the scheme we propose here can be implemented in any nonlinear
crystal and frequency band of interest.
