We calculate the current cross-correlation for two weakly interacting
mesoscopic conductors. Our derivation is based on the two-particle scattering
matrix derived in Goorden and B\"uttiker [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 99}, 146801
(2007)]. We include the Fermi sea in the leads into the theory and show how to
calculate transport quantities and specifically cross-correlations. We focus on
the zero-frequency current cross-correlation of two chaotic quantum dots and
calculate the magnitude of its fluctuations with the help of Random Matrix
Theory.
