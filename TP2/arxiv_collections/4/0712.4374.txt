We analyze the plasmonic modes of a metal nanoparticle circular array. Closed
form solutions to the eigenmode problem are given. For each polarization, the
plasmonic mode with the highest quality is found to be an antiphase mode. We
found that the significant suppression in radiative loss can be understood as
the cancellation of the dipolar radiation term in the radiative linewidth. The
remaining finite radiative linewidth decreases exponentially as the number of
particle increases.
