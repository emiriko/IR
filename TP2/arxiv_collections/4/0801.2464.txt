We reinvestigate the kappa-symmetry-fixed Green-Schwarz action in the AdS_5 x
S^5 background in a version of the light-cone gauge. In the generalized
light-cone gauge, the action has been written in the phase space variables. We
convert it into the standard action written in terms of the fields and their
derivatives. We obtain a Nambu-Goto type action which has the correct
flat-space limit.
