In the present paper we introduce a notion of homotopy of two Volterra
operators which is related to fixed points of such operators. It is establish a
criterion when two Volterra operators are homotopic, as a consequence we obtain
that the corresponding tournaments of that operators are the same. This, due to
\cite{Ga1}, gives us a possibility to know some information about the
trajectory of homotopic Volterra operators. Moreover, it is shown that any
Volterra q.s.o. given on a face has at least two homotopic extension to the
whole simplex.
