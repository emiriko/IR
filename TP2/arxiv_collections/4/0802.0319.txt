We study double Higgs production at the future Linear Collider in the
framework of the Two Higgs Doublet Models through the following channels:
$e^+e^- \to \Phi_i \Phi_j Z$, $\Phi_i=h^0, H^0, A^0, H^\pm$. All these
processes are sensitive to triple Higgs couplings. Hence observations of them
provide information on the triple Higgs couplings that help reconstructing the
scalar potential. We also discuss the double Higgs-strahlung $e^+e^- \to h^0
h^0 Z$ in the decoupling limit where $h^0$ mimics the SM Higgs boson. The
processes $e^+e^- \to h^0 h^0 Z$ and $e^+e^- \to h^0 H^0 Z$ are also discussed
in the fermiophobic limit where distinctive signatures such as $4\gamma +X$,
$2\gamma +X$ and $6\gamma +X$ are expected in the Type-I Two Higgs Doublet
Model.
