A spatiotemporal noise is assumed to reflect the environmental fluctuation in
a spatially extended tumor system. We introduce firstly the structure factor to
reveal the invasive tumor growth quantitatively. The homogenous environment can
lead to an expansive growth of the tumor cells, while the inhomogenous
environment underlies an infiltrative growth. The different responses of above
two cases are separated by a characteristic critical intensity of the
spatiotemporal noise. Theoretical and numerical results present a close
annotation to the clinical images.
