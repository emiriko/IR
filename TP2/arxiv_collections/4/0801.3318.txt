We consider a polymer brush grafted to a surface (acting as an electrode) and
bearing a charged group at its free end. Using a second distant electrode, the
brush is subject to a constant electric field. Based on a coarse-grained
continuum model, we calculate the average brush height and find that the brush
can stretch or compress depending on the applied field and charge end-group. We
further look at an undulation mode of the flat polymer brush and find that the
electrostatic energy scales linearly with the undulation wavenumber, $q$.
Competition with surface tension, scaling as $q^2$, tends to stabilize a
lateral $q$-mode of the polymer brush with a well-defined wavelength. This
wavelength depends on the brush height, surface separation, and several system
parameters.
