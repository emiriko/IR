We show how continuous variable systems can allow the direct communication of
messages with an acceptable degree of privacy. This is possible by combining a
suitable phase-space encoding of the plain message with real-time checks of the
quantum communication channel. The resulting protocol works properly when a
small amount of noise affects the quantum channel. If this noise is
non-tolerable, the protocol stops leaving a limited amount of information to a
potential eavesdropper.
