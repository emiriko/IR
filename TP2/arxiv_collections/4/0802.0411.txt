We investigate the maximal violations for both sides of the $d$-dimensional
CGLMP inequality by using the Bell operator method. It turns out that the
maximal violations have a decelerating increase as the dimension increases and
tend to a finite value at infinity. The numerical values are given out up to
$d=10^6$ for positively maximal violations and $d=2\times 10^5$ for negatively
maximal violations. Counterintuitively, the negatively maximal violations tend
to be a little stronger than the positively maximal violations. Further we show
the states corresponding to these maximal violations and compare them with the
maximally entangled states by utilizing entangled degree defined by von Neumann
entropy. It shows that their entangled degree tends to some nonmaximal value as
the dimension increases.
