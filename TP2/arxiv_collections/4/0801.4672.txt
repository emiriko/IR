We calculate the single-particle spectral function for the one-band
Bose-Hubbard model within the random phase approximation (RPA). In the strongly
correlated superfluid, in addition to the gapless phonon excitations, we find
extra gapped modes which become particularly relevant near the superfluid-Mott
quantum phase transition (QPT). The strength in one of the gapped modes, a
precursor of the Mott phase, grows as the QPT is approached and evolves into a
hole (particle) excitation in the Mott insulator depending on whether the
chemical potential is above (below) the tip of the lobe. The sound velocity of
the Goldstone modes remains finite when the transition is approached at a
constant density, otherwise, it vanishes at the transition. It agrees well with
Bogoliubov theory except close to the transition. We also calculate the spatial
correlations for bosons in an inhomogeneous trapping potential creating
alternating shells of Mott insulator and superfluid. Finally, we discuss the
capability of the RPA approximation to correctly account for quantum
fluctuations in the vicinity of the QPT.
