Explicit expressions for one point moments corresponding to stochastic
Verhulst model driven by Markovian coloured dichotomous noise are presented. It
is shown that the moments are the given functions of a decreasing exponent. The
asymptotic behavior (for large time) of the moments is described by a single
decreasing exponent.
