This paper introduces an analogue of the Solomon descent algebra for the
complex reflection groups of type $G(r,1,n)$. As with the Solomon descent
algebra, our algebra has a basis given by sums of `distinguished' coset
representatives for certain `reflection subgroups'. We explicitly describe the
structure constants with respect to this basis and show that they are
polynomials in $r$. This allows us to define a deformation, or $q$-analogue, of
these algebras which depends on a parameter $q$. We determine the irreducible
representations of all of these algebras and give a basis for their radicals.
Finally, we show that the direct sum of cyclotomic Solomon algebras is
canonically isomorphic to a concatenation Hopf algebra.
