B.S. in mathematics at the City College of New York in 1947. After receiving an
M.A. in mathematical statistics from Columbia in 1949, he completed his
graduate studies in the Department of Statistics at the University of North
Carolina in 1951. His dissertation was written under the direction of S. N. Roy

University in 1951 as an Assistant Professor, subsequently being promoted to
Professor. In 1960, he took a position as Chair of the Department of Statistics
at the University of Minnesota. He moved to Stanford University in 1961 to take
a joint position as Professor of Statistics and Professor of Education; he was
also Chair of the Department of Statistics from 1973--1976. In 2007, Ingram
became Professor Emeritus. Ingram was Editor of the Annals of Mathematical
Statistics (1971--1972) and served as the first editor of the Annals of
Statistics from 1972--1974. He was a primary force in the founding of the
Journal of Educational Statistics, for which he was also Associate Editor
during 1977--1985. In 1984, he was President of the Institute of Mathematical
Statistics. Among his many professional activities, he has served as Chair of
the Committee of Presidents of Statistical Societies (COPSS), Chair of the
Committee on Applied and Theoretical Statistics of the National Research
Council, Chair of the Management Board of the American Education Research
Association, and as Trustee for the National Institute of Statistical Sciences.
He has been honored by the American Statistical Association (ASA) with a Wilks
Medal (1992) and a Founder's Award (1992). The American Psychological
Association gave him a Lifetime Contribution Award (1997) and he was elected to

the City University of New York gave him a Townsend Harris Medal. An author of
5 books, an editor of 10 books, and an author of more than 200 publications,
Ingram has made major contributions to statistics and education. His research
has focused on multivariate analysis, majorization and inequalities,
distribution theory, and meta-analysis. A volume in celebration of Ingram's
65th birthday contains a brief biography and an interview [Gleser, Perlman,
Press and Sampson (1989)]. Ingram was chosen in 1997 to participate in the
American Statistical Association Distinguished Statistician Video Series and a
videotaped conversation and a lecture (Olkin, 1997) are available from the ASA
(1997, DS041, DS042).
