The probability distribution of sums of iterates of the logistic map at the
edge of chaos has been recently shown [see U. Tirnakli, C. Beck and C. Tsallis,
Phys. Rev. E 75, 040106(R) (2007)] to be numerically consistent with a
q-Gaussian, the distribution which, under appropriate constraints, maximizes
the nonadditive entropy S_q, the basis of nonextensive statistical mechanics.
This analysis was based on a study of the tails of the distribution. We now
check the entire distribution, in particular its central part. This is
important in view of a recent q-generalization of the Central Limit Theorem,
which states that for certain classes of strongly correlated random variables
the rescaled sum approaches a q-Gaussian limit distribution. We numerically
investigate for the logistic map with a parameter in a small vicinity of the
critical point under which conditions there is convergence to a q-Gaussian both
in the central region and in the tail region, and find a scaling law involving
the Feigenbaum constant delta. Our results are consistent with a large number
of already available analytical and numerical evidences that the edge of chaos
is well described in terms of the entropy S_q and its associated concepts.
