In this work we study the dynamical generation of mass in the massless N=1
Wess-Zumino model in a three dimensional spacetime. Using the tadpole method to
compute the effective potential, we observe that supersymmetry is dynamicaly
broken together with the discrete symmetry A(x) -> - A(x). We show that this
model, differently from non-supersymmetric scalar models, exhibits a consistent
perturbative dynamical generation of mass after two loop corrections to the
effective potential.
