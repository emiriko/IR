We compute an effective action for a composite Higgs boson formed by new
fermions belonging to a general technicolor non-Abelian gauge theory, using a
quite general expression for the fermionic self-energy that depends on a
certain parameter (alpha), that defines the technicolor theory from the extreme
walking behavior up to the one with a standard operator product expansion
behavior. We discuss the values of the trilinear and quadrilinear scalar
couplings. Our calculation spans all the possible physical possibilities for
mass and couplings of the composite system. In the case of extreme walking
technicolor theories we verify that it is possible to have a composite Higgs
boson with a mass as light as the present experimental limit, contrary to the
usual expectation of a heavy mass for the composite Higgs boson. In this case
we obtain an upper limit for the Higgs boson mass, M_H ~ 700GeV for SU(2)_TC,
and the experimental data on the Higgs boson mass constrain SU(N)_TC
technicolor gauge groups to be smaller than SU(10)_TC.
