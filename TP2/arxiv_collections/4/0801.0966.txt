We propose a universal transformation from a many-boson state to a
corresponding many-fermion state in the lowest Landau level approximation of
rotating many-body systems, inspired by the Laughlin wave function and by the
Jain composite-fermion construction. We employ the exact-diagonalization
technique for finding the many-body states. The overlap between the transformed
boson ground state and the true fermion ground state is calculated in order to
measure the quality of the transformation. For very small and high angular
momenta, the overlap is typically above 90%. For intermediate angular momenta,
mixing between states complicates the picture and leads to small ground-state
overlaps at some angular momenta.
