We consider the spin-1/2 isotropic XY chain in a (z) transverse magnetic
field with the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction directed along the z-axis in
spin space and examine the effects of the latter interaction on the zz, xx (yy)
and xy (yx) dynamic structure factors. The Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction
does not manifest itself in the zz dynamic quantities. In contrast, the xx (yy)
and xy (yx) dynamic structure factors show dramatical changes owing to the
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Implications of our results for electron
spin resonance experiments are briefly discussed.
