RZBENCH is a benchmark suite that was specifically developed to reflect the
requirements of scientific supercomputer users at the University of
Erlangen-Nuremberg (FAU). It comprises a number of application and low-level
codes under a common build infrastructure that fosters maintainability and
expandability. This paper reviews the structure of the suite and briefly
introduces the most relevant benchmarks. In addition, some widely known
standard benchmark codes are reviewed in order to emphasize the need for a
critical review of often-cited performance results. Benchmark data is presented
for the HLRB-II at LRZ Munich and a local InfiniBand Woodcrest cluster as well
as two uncommon system architectures: A bandwidth-optimized InfiniBand cluster
based on single socket nodes ("Port Townsend") and an early version of Sun's
highly threaded T2 architecture ("Niagara 2").
