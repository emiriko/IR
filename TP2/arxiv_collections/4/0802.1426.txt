The present paper is devoted to the investigation of properties of Cartan
subalgebras and regular elements in Leibniz $n$-algebras. The relationship
between Cartan subalgebras and regular elements of given Leibniz $n$-algebra
and Cartan subalgebras and regular elements of the corresponding factor $n$-Lie
algebra is established.
