A simple manner to describe the diffusive relaxation of a colloidal fluid
adsorbed in a porous medium is to model the porous medium as a set of spherical
particles fixed in space at random positions with prescribed statistical
structural properties. Within this model one may describe the relaxation of
concentration fluctuations of the adsorbed fluid by simply setting to zero the
short-time mobility of one species (the porous matrix) in a theory of the
dynamics of equilibrium colloidal mixtures, or by extending such dynamic theory
to explicitly consider the porous matrix as a random external field. Here we
consider the first approach and employ the self-consistent generalized Langevin
equation (SCGLE) theory of the dynamics of equilibrium colloidal mixtures, to
describe the dynamics of the mobile component. We conclude that if the correct
static structure factors are provided as input, the SCGLE theory correctly
predicts the main features of the dynamics of the permeating fluid.
