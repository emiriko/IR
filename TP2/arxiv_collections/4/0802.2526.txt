Bistability of MAP kinase (MAPK) activity has been suggested to contribute to
several cellular processes, including differentiation and long-term synaptic
potentiation. A recent model (48) predicts bistability due to interactions of
the kinases and phosphatases in the MAPK pathway, without feedback from MAPK to
earlier reactions. Using this model and enzyme concentrations appropriate for
neurons, we simulated bistable MAPK activity, but bistability only was present
within a relatively narrow range of activity of Raf, the first pathway kinase.
Stochastic fluctuations in molecule numbers eliminated bistability for small
molecule numbers, such as are expected in the volume of a dendritic spine.
However, positive feedback loops have been posited from MAPK up to Raf
activation. One proposed loop in which MAPK directly activates Raf was
incorporated into the model. We found that such feedback greatly enhanced the
robustness of both stable states of MAPK activity to stochastic fluctuations
and to parameter variations. Bistability was robust for molecule numbers
plausible for a dendritic spine volume. The upper state of MAPK activity was
resistant to inhibition of MEK activation for > 1 h, suggesting inhibitor
experiments have not sufficed to rule out a role for persistent MAPK activity
in LTP maintenance. These simulations suggest that persistent MAPK activity and
consequent upregulation of translation may contribute to LTP maintenance and to
long-term memory. Experiments using a fluorescent MAPK substrate may further
test this hypothesis.
