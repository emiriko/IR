This paper defines a theory of conformal parametrization of digital surfaces
made of surfels equipped with a normal vector. The main idea is to locally
project each surfel to the tangent plane, therefore deforming its aspect-ratio.
It is a generalization of the theory known for polyhedral surfaces. The main
difference is that the conformal ratios that appear are no longer real in
general. It yields a generalization of the standard Laplacian on weighted
graphs.
