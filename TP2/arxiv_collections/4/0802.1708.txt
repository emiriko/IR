We classify the completely-positive maps acting on two $d$-dimensional
systems which commute with all $U\otimes U$ unitaries, where $U\in SU(d)$. This
set of operations map Werner states to Werner states. We find a simple
condition for a map being implementable by stochastic local operations and
classical communication (SLOCC). We show that all PPT-preserving maps can be
implemented by SLOCC. This can be used to prove that the entanglement of Werner
states cannot be stochastically increased, even if we allow PPT entanglement
for free.
