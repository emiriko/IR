We present a general criterion for the existence of open book structures
defined by real map germs $(\bR^m, 0) \to (\bR^p, 0)$, where $m> p \ge 2$, with
isolated critical point. We show that this is satisfied by weighted-homogeneous
maps. We also derive sufficient conditions in case of map germs with isolated
critical value.
