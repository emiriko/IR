The discovery potentials of non-standard physics (NSP) which might be
possessed by neutrinos are examined by taking a concrete setting of
Tokai-to-Kamioka-Korea (T2KK) two detector complex which receives neutrino
superbeam from J-PARC. We restrict ourselves into \nu_{\mu} and \bar{\nu}_{\mu}
disappearance measurement. We describe here only the non-standard interactions
(NSI) of neutrinos with matter and the quantum decoherence. It is shown in some
favorable cases T2KK can significantly improve the current bounds on NSP. For
NSI, for example, epsilon_{\mu\tau} < 0.03, which is a factor 5 severer than
the current one.
