The level-set method of topology optimization is used to design isotropic
two-phase periodic multifunctional composites in three dimensions. One phase is
stiff and insulating whereas the other is conductive and mechanically
compliant. The optimization objective is to maximize a linear combination of
the effective bulk modulus and conductivity of the composite. Composites with
the Schwartz primitive and diamond minimal surfaces as the phase interface have
been shown to have maximal bulk modulus and conductivity. Since these
composites are not elastically isotropic their stiffness under uniaxial loading
varies with the direction of the load. An isotropic composite is presented with
similar conductivity which is at least 23% stiffer under uniaxial loading than
the Schwartz structures when loaded uniaxially along their weakest direction.
Other new near-optimal isotropic composites are presented, proving the
capablities of the level-set method for microstructure design.
