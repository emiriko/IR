A two-sphere ("Bloch" or "Poincare") is familiar for describing the dynamics
of a spin-1/2 particle or light polarization. Analogous objects are derived for
unitary groups larger than SU(2) through an iterative procedure that constructs
evolution operators for higher-dimensional SU in terms of lower-dimensional
ones. We focus, in particular, on the SU(4) of two qubits which describes all
possible logic gates in quantum computation. For a general Hamiltonian of SU(4)
with 15 parameters, and for Hamiltonians of its various sub-groups so that
fewer parameters suffice, we derive Bloch-like rotation of unit vectors
analogous to the one familiar for a single spin in a magnetic field. The
unitary evolution of a quantal spin pair is thereby expressed as rotations of
real vectors. Correspondingly, the manifolds involved are Bloch two-spheres
along with higher dimensional manifolds such as a four-sphere for the SO(5)
sub-group and an eight-dimensional Grassmannian manifold for the general SU(4).
This latter may also be viewed as two, mutually orthogonal, real
six-dimensional unit vectors moving on a five-sphere with an additional phase
constraint.
