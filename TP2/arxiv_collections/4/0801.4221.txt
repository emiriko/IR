The appearance of Marshall and Olkin's 1979 book on inequalities with special
emphasis on majorization generated a surge of interest in potential
applications of majorization and Schur convexity in a broad spectrum of fields.
After 25 years this continues to be the case. The present article presents a
sampling of the diverse areas in which majorization has been found to be useful
in the past 25 years.
