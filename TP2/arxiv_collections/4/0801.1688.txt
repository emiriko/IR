Weak ferromagnetism in Fe1-xCoxSb2 is studied by magnetization and Mossbauer
measurements. A small spontaneous magnetic moment of the order of 10^-3 uB
appears along the b-axis for 0.2<= x <= 0.4. Based on the structural analysis,
we argue against extrinsic sources of weak ferromagnetism. We discuss our
results in the framework of the nearly magnetic electronic structure of the
parent compound FeSb2.
