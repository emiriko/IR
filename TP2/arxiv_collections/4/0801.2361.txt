We study the possibility of discovering neutral scalar Higgs bosons in the
$U(1)'$-extended supersymmetric standard model (USSM) at the CERN Large Hadron
Collider (LHC), by examining their productions via the exotic quark loop in the
gluon fusion process at leading order. It is possible in some parameter region
that the neutral scalar Higgs bosons may have stronger couplings with the
exotic quarks than with top quark. In this case, the exotic quarks may
contribute more significantly than top quark in productions of the neutral
scalar Higgs bosons in the gluon fusion process. We find that there is indeed
some parameter region in the USSM that supports our speculations.
