In a recent paper, Buniy et al. have argued that a possible discretization of
spacetime leads to an unavoidable discretization of the state space of quantum
mechanics. In this paper, we show that this conclusion is not limited to
quantum theory: in any classical, quantum, or more general probabilistic
theory, states (i.e. probabilities or corresponding amplitudes) become discrete
or fuzzy for observers, as long as time evolution is reversible and entropy is
locally bounded.
  Specifically, we show that the Bekenstein bound suggests that probabilities
in small closed regions of space carry an uncertainty inversely proportional to
the the square root of the system's effective radius and energy.
