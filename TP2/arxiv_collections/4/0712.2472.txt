We investigate the late time behavior of a scalar field on a fixed Kerr
background using a 2+1 dimensional pseudospectral evolution code. We compare
evolutions of pure axisymmetric multipoles in both Kerr-Schild and
Boyer-Lindquist coordinates. We find that the late-time power-law decay rate
depends upon the slicing of the background, confirming previous theoretical
predictions for those decay rates. The accuracy of the numerical evolutions is
sufficient to decide unambiguously between competing claims in the literature.
