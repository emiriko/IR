It is shown that for every splitting of a polynomial with noncommutative
coefficients into linear factors $(X-a_{k})$ with $a_{k}$'s commuting with
coefficients, any cyclic permutation of linear factors gives the same result
and all $a_{k}$ are roots of that polynomial. Examples are given and analyzed
from Galois theory point of view.
