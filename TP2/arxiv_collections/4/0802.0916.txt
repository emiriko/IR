The mixing between third and second (or first) generation squarks is very
small in supersymmetric models with minimal flavor violation such as gauge-,
anomaly- or gaugino-mediation. An opportunity to measure this mixing will arise
if the lightest stop is close enough in mass to the lightest neutralino, so
that the decays into third generation quarks are kinematically forbidden. We
analyze under which circumstances it might become possible to measure at the
Large Hadron Collider (LHC) the rate of the flavor changing stop decays.
