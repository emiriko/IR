Epitaxial heterostructures of La0.6Sr0.4MnO3 0.7Pb(Mg0.33Nb0.67)O3 0.3PbTiO3
were fabricated on LaNiO3 coated LaAlO3 (100) substrates by pulsed laser
ablation. Ferromagnetic and ferroelectric hysteresis established their
biferroic nature. Dielectric behviour studied under different magnetic fields
over a wide range of frequency and temperatures revealed that the capacitance
in these heterostructures varies with the applied magnetic field. Appearance of
magnetocapacitance and its dependence on magnetic fields, magnetic layer
thickness, temperature and frequency indicated a combined contribution of
strain mediated magnetoelectric coupling, magnetoresistance of the magnetic
layer and Maxwell Wagner effect on the observed properties.
