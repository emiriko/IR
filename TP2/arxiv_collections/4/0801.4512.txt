The energy and angular dependence of double differential cross sections was
measured for p,d,t,He,Li,Be, and B isotopes produced in collisions of 1.2 and
1.9 GeV protons with Au target. The shape of the spectra and angular
distributions almost does not change in the beam energy range from 1.2 to 2.5
GeV, however, the absolute value of the cross sections increases for all
ejectiles. A phenomenological model of two emitting, moving sources reproduces
very well spectra and angular distributions of intermediate mass fragments.
Double differential cross sections for light charged particles (LCP) were
analyzed in the frame of the microscopic model of intranuclear cascade (INC)
with coalescence of nucleons and statistical model for evaporation of particles
from excited residual nuclei. Energy and angular dependencies of data agree
satisfactorily neither with predictions of microscopic intranuclear cascade
calculations for protons, nor with coalescence calculations for other LCP.
Phenomenological inclusion of another reaction mechanism - emission of LCP from
a "fireball", i.e., fast and hot moving source - combined with the microscopic
model calculations of INC, coalescence and evaporation of particles leads to
very good description of the data. It was found that nonequilibrium processes
are very important for production of LCP. They exhaust 40-80% of the total
cross sections - depending on the emitted particles. Coalescence and "fireball"
emission give comparable contributions to the cross sections with exception of
3He data where coalescence clearly dominates. The ratio of sum of all
nonequilibrium processes to those proceeding through stage of statistical
equilibrium does almost not change in the beam energy range from 1.2 GeV to 2.5
GeV for all light charged particles.
