We have developed a mathematical model of regulation of expression of the
Escherichia coli lac operon, and have investigated bistability in its
steady-state induction behavior in the absence of external glucose. Numerical
analysis of equations describing regulation by artificial inducers revealed two
natural bistability parameters that can be used to control the range of inducer
concentrations over which the model exhibits bistability. By tuning these
bistability parameters, we found a family of biophysically reasonable systems
that are consistent with an experimentally determined bistable region for
induction by thio-methylgalactoside (Ozbudak et al. Nature 427:737, 2004). The
model predicts that bistability can be abolished when passive transport or
permease export becomes sufficiently large; the former case is especially
relevant to induction by isopropyl-beta, D-thiogalactopyranoside. To model
regulation by lactose, we developed similar equations in which allolactose, a
metabolic intermediate in lactose metabolism and a natural inducer of lac, is
the inducer. For biophysically reasonable parameter values, these equations
yield no bistability in response to induction by lactose; however, systems with
an unphysically small permease-dependent export effect can exhibit small
amounts of bistability for limited ranges of parameter values. These results
cast doubt on the relevance of bistability in the lac operon within the natural
context of E. coli, and help shed light on the controversy among existing
theoretical studies that address this issue. The results also suggest an
experimental approach to address the relevance of bistability in the lac operon
within the natural context of E. coli.
