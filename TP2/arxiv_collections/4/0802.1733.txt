An Artin HNN-extension is an HNN-extension of an Artin group in which the
stable letter conjugates a pair of suitably chosen subsets of the standard
generating set. We show that some finite index subgroup of an Artin
HNN-extension embeds in an Artin group. We also obtain an analogous result for
Coxeter groups.
