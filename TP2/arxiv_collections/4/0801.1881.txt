The motion of spinning relativistic particles in external electromagnetic and
gravitational fields is considered. A simple derivation of the spin interaction
with gravitational field is presented. The self-consistent description of the
spin corrections to the equations of motion is built with the noncovariant
description of spin and with the usual, ``naive'' definition of the coordinate
of a relativistic particle.
