A study by infrared spectroscopy of the physisorbed region of catalysis
demonstrated that the intermediates of catalysis exist on the surface as a two
dimensional gas. Data in the Atomic Energy Level tables show that of the
thousands of positive ions tabulated only approximately one hundred have the
low-lying excited states that produce surface electric fields with a fractional
charge. The specific catalyst for a reaction has the electric field with the
fractional charge which when imparted to the two reactants changes the
frequency of the fields at the sites of reaction on each so that they are
harmonically equal, that is their ratio is a power of two. When the two
reactants meet in the electric field of the catalyst resonance occurs. It is
during resonance that electrons are shared, paired and exchanged and bonds are
broken and made. This analysis of catalysis explains the most extraordinary
observation that a catalyst is Not consumed when used because the catalyst is
the electric fields. These discoveries are applied to explain such diverse
reactions as the oxidation and chlorination of carbon monoxide and the
destruction of nitric oxide in automobile exhaust. The use of electric fields
to produce reactions may have application not only in chemistry but in biology
and mechanics as well.
