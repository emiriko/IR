A negative-positive-negative switching behavior of magnetoresistance (MR)
with temperature is observed in a ferromagnetic shape memory alloy
Ni_1.75Mn_1.25Ga. In the austenitic phase between 300 and 120 K, MR is negative
due to s-d scattering. Curiously, below 120K MR is positive, while at still
lower temperatures in the martensitic phase, MR is negative again. The positive
MR cannot be explained by Lorentz contribution and is related to a magnetic
transition. Evidence for this is obtained from ab initio density functional
theory, a decrease in magnetization and resistivity upturn at 120 K. Theory
shows that a ferrimagnetic state with anti-ferromagnetic alignment between the
local magnetic moments of the Mn atoms is the energetically favoured ground
state. In the martensitic phase, there are two competing factors that govern
the MR behavior: a dominant negative trend up to the saturation field due to
the decrease of electron scattering at twin and domain boundaries; and a weaker
positive trend due to the ferrimagnetic nature of the magnetic state. MR
exhibits a hysteresis between heating and cooling that is related to the first
order nature of the martensitic phase transition.
