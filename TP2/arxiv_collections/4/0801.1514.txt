Recent research has highlighted the high incidence of errors in spreadsheet
models used in industry. In an attempt to reduce the incidence of such errors,
a teaching approach has been devised which aids students to reduce their
likelihood of making common errors during development. The approach comprises
of spreadsheet checking methods based on the commonly accepted educational
paradigms of peer assessment and self-assessment. However, these paradigms are
here based upon practical techniques commonly used by the internal audit
function such as peer audit and control and risk self-assessment. The result of
this symbiosis between educational assessment and professional audit is a
method that educates students in a set of structured, transferable skills for
spreadsheet error-checking which are useful for increasing error-awareness in
the classroom and for reducing business risk in the workplace.
