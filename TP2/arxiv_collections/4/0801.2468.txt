The CMS Silicon Strip tracker is a very large scale tracker entirely based on
silicon strip detectors technology. The integration of modules, electronics,
mechanics and services has been completed within the last eighteen months;
first large standalone sub-structures (shells, disks, rods, petals depending on
the tracker subdetector) have been integrated and verified; then they have been
brought together into the final configuration. The CMS silicon tracker design
and its construction is reviewed with particular emphasis on the procedures and
quality checks deployed to successfully assembly several silicon strip modules
and all ancillary components into these large sub-structures. An overview of
the results and the lesson learned from the tracker integration are given, also
in terms of failure and damage rates.
