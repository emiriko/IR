Zero-knowledge proof system is an important protocol that can be used as a
basic block for construction of other more complex cryptographic protocols.
Quantum zero-knowledge protocols have been proposed but, since their
implementation requires advanced quantum technology devices, experimental
implementation of zero-knowledge protocols have not being reported. In this
work, we present a quantum zero-knowledge protocol based on a quantum bit
commitment protocol that can be implemented with today technology. Hence, our
quantum zero-knowledge protocol can be readily implemented.
