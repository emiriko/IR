In this paper we study the density noise correlations of the two component
Fermi gas in optical lattices. Three different type of phases, the BCS-state
(Bardeen, Cooper, and Schieffer), the FFLO-state (Fulde, Ferrel, Larkin, and
Ovchinnikov), and BP (breach pair) state, are considered. We show how these
states differ in their noise correlations. The noise correlations are
calculated not only at zero temperature, but also at non-zero temperatures
paying particular attention to how much the finite temperature effects might
complicate the detection of different phases. Since one-dimensional systems
have been shown to be very promising candidates to observe FFLO states, we
apply our results also to the computation of correlation signals in a
one-dimensional lattice. We find that the density noise correlations reveal
important information about the structure of the underlying order parameter as
well as about the quasiparticle dispersions.
