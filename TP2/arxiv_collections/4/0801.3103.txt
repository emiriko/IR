This is a concise introduction to Fomin-Zelevinsky's cluster algebras and
their links with the representation theory of quivers in the acyclic case. We
review the definition of cluster algebras (geometric, without coefficients),
construct the cluster category and present the bijection between cluster
variables and rigid indecomposable objects of the cluster category.
