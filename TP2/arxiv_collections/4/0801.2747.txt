Using two different numerical methods, we study the behavior of two-component
Fermi gases interacting through short-range s-wave interactions in a harmonic
trap. A correlated Gaussian basis-set expansion technique is used to determine
the energies and structural properties, i.e., the radial one-body densities and
pair distribution functions, for small systems with either even or odd $N$, as
functions of the s-wave scattering length and the mass ratio $\kappa$ of the
two species. Particular emphasis is put on a discussion of the angular momentum
of the system in the BEC-BCS crossover regime. At unitarity, the excitation
spectrum of the four-particle system with total angular momentum L=0 is
calculated as a function of the mass ratio $\kappa$. The results are analyzed
from a hyperspherical perspective, which offers new insights into the problem.
Additionally, fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo calculations are performed for
equal-mass Fermi gases with up to N=30 atoms. We focus on the odd-even
oscillations of the ground state energy of the equal-mass unitary system having
up to N=30 particles, which are related to the excitation gap of the system.
Furthermore, we present a detailed analysis of the structural properties of
these systems.
