Three-body and four-body interactions have been directly measured in a
colloidal system comprised of three (or four) charged colloidal particles. Two
of the particles have been confined by means of a scanned laser tweezers to a
line-shaped optical trap where they diffused due to thermal fluctuations. By
means of an additional focused optical trap a third particle has been
approached and attractive three-body interactions have been observed. These
observations are in qualitative agreement with additionally performed nonlinear
Poissson-Boltzmann calculations. Two configurations of four particles have been
studied experimentally as well and in both cases a repulsive four-body
interaction term has been observed.
