Motivated by the recent measurement of the activation energy at the quantum
Hall state at the filling factor f=1 in graphene we discuss the scaling of the
interaction-induced gaps in vicinity of the Dirac point with the magnetic
field. The gap at f=1 is shown to be bounded from above by E(1)/C, where E(n)
are the Landau level energies and C = 5.985 + O(1/N) is a universal number. The
universal scaling functions are computed exactly for a large number of Dirac
fermions N. We find a sublinear dependence of the gap at the laboratory
magnetic fields for realistic values of short-range repulsion between
electrons, and in quantitative agreement with observation.
