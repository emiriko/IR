In the present article we introduce a quantum mechanism which is able to
describe the creation of correlations in the evaluation of random independent
events: such correlations, known as positive and negative recency, correspond
respectively to the hot hand's and to the gambler's fallacies. Thus we propose
a description of these effects in terms of qubits, which may become entangled,
forming a system which can not be described completely only in terms of its
constituents. We show that such formalism is able to describe and interpret the
experimental results, thus providing a general and unifying framework for the
cognitive heuristics.
