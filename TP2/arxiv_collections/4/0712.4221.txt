When a chaotic system is to be stabilized to a unstable orbit, delayed
measurement of the system limits the applicability of chaos control techniqes.
These limitations are analyzed and control schemes as linear predictive logging
control (LPLC) and memory difference control (MDC) are introduced which can
overcome those limitations for chaos control schemes that act in the
Poincar\'{e} section as Ott-Grebogi-Yorke (OGY) control and
Bielawski-Derozier_Glorieux control (difference control).
