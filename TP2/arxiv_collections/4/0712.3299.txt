The author reviews the computer and robotic tools available to urologists to
help in diagnosis and technical procedures. The first part concerns the
contribution of robotics and presents several systems at various stages of
development (laboratory prototypes, systems under validation or marketed
systems). The second part describes image fusion tools and navigation systems
currently under development or evaluation. Several studies on computerized
simulation of urological procedures are also presented.
