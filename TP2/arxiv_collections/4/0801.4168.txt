An overview is given about the capabilities provided by the JLab 12 GeV
Upgrade to measure deeply virtual exclusive processes with high statistics and
covering a large kinematics range in the parameters that are needed to allow
reconstruction of a spatial image of the nucleon's quark structure. The
measurements planned with CLAS12 will cross section asymmetries with polarized
beams and with longitudinally and transversely polarized proton targets in the
constrained kinematics $x = \pm \xi$. In addition, unpolarized DVCS cross
sections, and doubly polarized beam target asymmetries will be measured as
well. In this talk only the beam and target asymmetries will be discussed.
