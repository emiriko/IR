The international Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment (MICE) will carry out a
systematic investigation of ionization cooling of a muon beam. As the emittance
measurement will be done on a particle-by-particle basis, a sophisticated beam
instrumentation is needed to measure particle coordinates and timing vs RF. The
MICE time-of-flight system will measure timings with a resolution better than
70 ps per plane, in a harsh environment due to high particle rates, fringe
magnetic fields and electron backgrounds from RF dark noise.
