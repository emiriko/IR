Krueger some years ago proposed a cluster LiBeBCNOF, now called periodane.
His ground-state isomer proposal has recently been refined by Bera et al. using
DFT. Here, we take the approach of molecules in such a cluster as starting
point. We first study therefore the triangular molecule LiOB by coupled cluster
theory (CCSD) and thereby specify accurately its equilibrium geometry in free
space. The second fragment we consider is FBeCN, but treated now by restricted
Hartree-Fock (RHF) theory. This four-center species is found to be linear, and
the bond lengths are obtained from both RHF and CCSD calculations. Finally, we
bring these two entities together and find that while LiOB remains largely
intact, FBeCN becomes bent by the interaction with LiOB. Hartree-Fock and CCSD
theories then predict precisely the same lowest isomer found by Bera et al.
solely on the basis of DFT.
