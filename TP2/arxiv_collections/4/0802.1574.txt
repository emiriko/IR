We report experimental and theoretical studies of magnetic domain walls in an
in-plane magnetized (Ga,Mn)As dilute moment ferromagnetic semiconductor. Our
high-resolution electron holography technique provides direct images of domain
wall magnetization profiles. The experiments are interpreted based on
microscopic calculations of the micromagnetic parameters and
Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert simulations. We find that the competition of uniaxial
and biaxial magnetocrystalline anisotropies in the film is directly reflected
in orientation dependent wall widths, ranging from approximately 40 nm to 120
nm. The domain walls are of the N\'eel type and evolve from near-$90^{\circ}$
walls at low-temperatures to large angle [1$\bar{1}$0]-oriented walls and small
angle [110]-oriented walls at higher temperatures.
