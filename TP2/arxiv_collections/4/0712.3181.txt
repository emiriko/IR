We study the critical behavior of magnetic thin films as a function of the
film thickness. We use the ferromagnetic Ising model with the high-resolution
multiple histogram Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. We show that though the 2D
behavior remains dominant at small thicknesses, there is a systematic
continuous deviation of the critical exponents from their 2D values. We observe
that in the same range of varying thickness the deviation of the exponent $\nu$
is rather small, while exponent $\beta$ suffers a larger deviation. We explain
these deviations using the concept of "effective" exponents suggested by
Capehart and Fisher in a finite-size analysis. The shift of the critical
temperature with the film thickness obtained here by MC simulation is in an
excellent agreement with their prediction.
