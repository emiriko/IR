Based on high-order harmonic generation (HHG) spectra obtained from solving
the time-dependent Schrodinger equation for atoms, we established
quantitatively that the HHG yield can be expressed as the product of a
returning electron wave packet and the photo-recombination cross sections, and
the shape of the returning wave packet is shown to be largely independent of
the species. By comparing the HHG spectra generated from different targets
under identical laser pulses, accurate structural information, including the
phase of the recombination amplitude, can be retrieved. This result opens up
the possibility of studying the target structure of complex systems, including
their time evolution, from the HHG spectra generated by short laser pulses.
