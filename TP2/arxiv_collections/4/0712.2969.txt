Bhabha scattering is one of the processes at the ILC where high precision
data will be expected. The complete NNLO corrections include radiative loop
corrections, with contributions from Feynman diagrams with five external legs.
We take these diagrams as an example and discuss several features of the
evaluation of pentagon diagrams. The tensor functions are usually reduced to
simpler scalar functions. Here we study, as an alternative, the application of
Mellin-Barnes representations to 5-point functions. There is no evidence for an
improved numerical evaluation of their finite, physical parts. However, the
approach gives interesting insights into the treatment of the IR-singularities.
