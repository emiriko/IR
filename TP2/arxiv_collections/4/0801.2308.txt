An experimental device was developed to monitor the field soil suction using
miniature tensiometer. This device consists of a double tube system that
ensures a good contact between the tensiometer and the soil surface at the
bottom of the testing borehole. This system also ensures the tensiometer
periodical retrieving without disturbing the surrounding soil. This device was
used to monitor the soil suction at the site of Boissy-le-Ch\^atel, France. The
measurement was performed at two depths (25 and 45 cm) during two months (May
and June 2004). The recorded suction data are analyzed by comparing with the
volumetric water content data recorded using TDR (Time Domain Reflectometer)
probes as well as the meteorological data. A good agreement between these
results was observed, showing a satisfactory performance of the developed
device.
