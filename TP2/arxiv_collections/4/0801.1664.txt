We study the evolution of entangled coherent states of the two quantized
electromagnetic fields under dissipation. Characteristic time scales for the
decay of the negativity are found in the case of large values of the phase
space distance among the states of each mode. We also study how the
entanglement emerges among the reservoirs.
