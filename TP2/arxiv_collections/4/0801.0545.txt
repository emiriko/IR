Hydraulic tension fractures were produced in porous limestones using a
specially designed hydraulic cell. The 3D geometry of the samples was imaged
using X-ray computed microtomography before and after fracturation. Using these
data, it was possible to estimate the permeability tensor of the core samples,
extract the path of the rupture and compare it to the heterogeneities initially
present in the rock.
