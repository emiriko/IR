Escort mean values (or $q$-moments) constitute useful theoretical tools for
describing basic features of some probability densities such as those which
asymptotically decay like {\it power laws}. They naturally appear in the study
of many complex dynamical systems, particularly those obeying nonextensive
statistical mechanics, a current generalization of the Boltzmann-Gibbs theory.
They recover standard mean values (or moments) for $q=1$. Here we discuss the
characterization of a (non-negative) probability density by a suitable set of
all its escort mean values together with the set of all associated normalizing
quantities, provided that all of them converge. This opens the door to a
natural extension of the well known characterization, for the $q=1$ instance,
of a distribution in terms of the standard moments, provided that {\it all} of
them have {\it finite} values. This question would be specially relevant in
connection with probability densities having {\it divergent} values for all
nonvanishing standard moments higher than a given one (e.g., probability
densities asymptotically decaying as power-laws), for which the standard
approach is not applicable. The Cauchy-Lorentz distribution, whose second and
higher even order moments diverge, constitutes a simple illustration of the
interest of this investigation. In this context, we also address some
mathematical subtleties with the aim of clarifying some aspects of an
interesting non-linear generalization of the Fourier Transform, namely, the
so-called $q$-Fourier Transform.
