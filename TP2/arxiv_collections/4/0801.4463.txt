In this paper we give a new derivation of the generalized Luscher F-term
formula from a summation over quadratic fluctuations around a given soliton.
The result is very general providing that S-matrix is diagonal and is valid for
arbitrary dispersion relation. We then apply this formalism to compute the
leading finite size corrections to the giant magnon dispersion relation coming
from quantum fluctuations.
