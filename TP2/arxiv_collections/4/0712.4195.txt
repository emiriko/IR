Optical vortices as topological objects exist ubiquitously in nature. In this
paper, by making use of the $\phi$-mapping topological current theory, we
investigate the topology in the closed and knotted optical vortices. The
topological inner structure of the optical vortices are obtained, and the
linking of the knotted optical vortices is also given.
