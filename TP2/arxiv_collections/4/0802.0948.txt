Exotic cluster decay of very heavy nuclei has been studied in the microscopic
Super-Asymmetric Fission Model. Relativistic Mean Field model with the force
FSU Gold has been employed to obtain the densities of the cluster and the
daughter nuclei. The microscopic nuclear interaction DDM3Y1, which has an
exponential density dependence, and the Coulomb interaction have been used in
the double folding model to obtain the potential between the cluster and the
daughter. Half life values have been calculated in the WKB approximation and
the spectroscopic factors have been extracted. The latter values are seen to
have a simple dependence of the mass of the cluster as has been observed
earlier. Predictions have been made for some possible decays.
