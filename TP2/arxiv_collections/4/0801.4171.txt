Nonequilibrium Green's functions represent underutilized means of studying
the time evolution of quantum many-body systems. In view of a rising computer
power, an effort is underway to apply the Green's functions formalism to the
dynamics of central nuclear reactions. As the first step, mean-field evolution
for the density matrix for colliding slabs is studied in one dimension. The
strategy to extend the dynamics to correlations is described.
