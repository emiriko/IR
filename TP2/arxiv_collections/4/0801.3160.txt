Using local density approximation (LDA) calculations we predict
GdFeO$_3$-like rotation of TiO$_6$ octahedra at the $n$-type interface between
LaAlO$_3$ and SrTiO$_3$. The narrowing of the Ti $d$ bandwidth which results
means that for very modest values of $U$, LDA$+U$ calculations predict charge
and spin ordering at the interface. Recent experimental evidence for magnetic
interface ordering may be understood in terms of the close proximity of an
antiferromagnetic insulating ground state to a ferromagnetic metallic excited
state.
