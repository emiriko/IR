We discuss the naturalness of exponential potentials for quintessence,
showing that the resulting almost flat direction in the space of scalar fields,
as well as the small time dependent cosmon mass, can be related to an anomalous
dilatation symmetry. We argue that the physics of the cosmological constant is
Planck scale physics, and comment on the role of quantum fluctuations. We
present three higher dimensional scenarios how a runaway of the ``cosmological
constant'' to zero can be combined with stable particle physics properties,
leading at most to small variations of the ``fundamental couplings''.
