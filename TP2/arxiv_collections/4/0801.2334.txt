Contour dynamics is a classical subject both in physics and in complex
analysis. We show that the dynamics provided by the L\"owner-Kufarev ODE and
PDE possesses a rigid algebraic structure given by the Virasoro algebra.
Namely, the `positive' Virasoro generators span the holomorphic part of the
complexified vector bundle over the space of univalent functions, smooth on the
boundary. In the covariant formulation they are conserved by the
L\"owner-Kufarev evolution. The `negative' Virasoro generators span the
antiholomorphic part. They contain a conserved term and we give an iterative
method to obtain them based on the Poisson structure of the L\"owner-Kufarev
evolution. The L\"owner-Kufarev PDE provides a distribution of the tangent
bundle of non-normalized univalent functions, which forms the tangent bundle of
normalized ones. It also gives an explicit correspondence between the latter
bundle and the holomorphic eigen space of the complexified Lie algebra of
vector fields on the unit circle. Finally, we give Hamiltonian and Lagrangian
formulations of the motion within the coefficient body in the field of an
elliptic operator constructed by means of Virasoro generators. We also discuss
relations between CFT and SLE.
