Simple supersymmetric grand unified models based on the gauge group SO(10)
require --in addition to gauge and matter unification-- the unification of
t-b-\tau Yukawa couplings. Yukawa unification, however, only occurs for very
special values of the soft SUSY breaking parameters. We perform a search using
a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique to investigate model parameters and
sparticle mass spectra which occur in Yukawa-unified SUSY models, where we also
require the relic density of neutralino dark matter to saturate the
WMAP-measured abundance. We find the spectrum is characterizd by three mass
scales: first/second generation scalars in the multi-TeV range, third
generation scalars in the TeV range, and gauginos in the \sim 100 GeV range.
Most solutions give far too high a relic abundance of neutralino dark matter.
The dark matter discrepancy can be rectified by 1. allowing for neutralino
decay to axino plus photon, 2. imposing gaugino mass non-universality or 3.
imposing generational non-universality. In addition, the MCMC approach finds 4.
a compromise solution where scalar masses are not too heavy, and where
neutralino annihilation occurs via the light Higgs h resonance. By imposing
weak scale Higgs soft term boundary conditions, we are also able to generate 5.
low \mu, m_A solutions with neutralino annihilation via a light A resonance,
though these solutions seem to be excluded by CDF/D0 measurements of the B_s\to
\mu^+\mu^- branching fraction. Based on the dual requirements of Yukawa
coupling unification and dark matter relic density, we predict new physics
signals at the LHC from pair production of 350--450 GeV gluinos. The events are
characterized by very high b-jet multiplicity and a dilepton mass edge around
mz2-mz1 \sim 50-75 GeV.
