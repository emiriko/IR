We report a high-statistics measurement of the relative branching fraction
B(D0->pi+pi-pi0)/B(D0->K-pi+pi0) using a 532 fb^{-1} data sample collected with
the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy e+e- collider. The measured
value of the relative branching fraction is B(D0->pi+pi-pi0)/B(D0->K-pi+pi0) =
(10.12 +/- 0.04(stat) +/- 0.18(syst))x10^{-2} which has an accuracy comparable
to the world average. We also present a measurement of the time-integrated CP
asymmetry in D0->pi+pi-pi0 decay. The result, A_{CP} = (0.43 +/- 1.30)%, shows
no significant CP violation.
