Since the introduction at Crypto'05 by Juels and Weis of the protocol HB+, a
lightweight protocol secure against active attacks but only in a detection
based-model, many works have tried to enhance its security. We propose here a
new approach to achieve resistance against Man-in-The-Middle attacks. Our
requirements - in terms of extra communications and hardware - are surprisingly
low.
