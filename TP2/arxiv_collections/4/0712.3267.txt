In this paper we elucidate the optical response resulting from the interplay
of charge distribution (ionicity) and Peierls instability (dimerization) in the
neutral-ionic, ferroelectric phase transition of tetrathiafulvalene-chloranil
(TTF-CA), a mixed-stack quasi-one-dimensional charge-transfer crystal. We
present far-infrared reflectivity measurements down to 5 cm-1 as a function of
temperature above the phase transition (300 - 82 K). The coupling between
electrons and lattice phonons in the pre-transitional regime is analyzed on the
basis of phonon eigenvectors and polarizability calculations of the
one-dimensional Peierls-Hubbard model. We find a multi-phonon Peierls coupling,
but on approaching the transition the spectral weight and the coupling shift
progressively towards the phonons at lower frequencies, resulting in a
soft-mode behavior only for the lowest frequency phonon near the transition
temperature. Moreover, in the proximity of the phase transition, the
lowest-frequency phonon becomes overdamped, due to anharmonicity induced by its
coupling to electrons. The implications of these findings for the neutral-ionic
transition mechanism is shortly discussed.
