Gauss-Bonnet gravity provides one of the most promising frameworks to study
curvature corrections to the Einstein action in supersymmetric string theories,
while avoiding ghosts and keeping second order field equations. Although
Schwarzschild-type solutions for Gauss-Bonnet black holes have been known for
long, the Kerr-Gauss-Bonnet metric is missing. In this paper, a five
dimensional Gauss-Bonnet approximation is analytically derived for spinning
black holes and the related thermodynamical properties are briefly outlined.
