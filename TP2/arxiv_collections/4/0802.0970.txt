We calculate the dynamic structure factor S (omega, q) of spinless fermions
in one dimension with quadratic energy dispersion k^2/2m and long range
density-density interaction whose Fourier transform f_q is dominated by small
momentum-transfers q << q_0 << k_F. Here q_0 is a momentum-transfer cutoff and
k_F is the Fermi momentum. Using functional bosonization and the known
properties of symmetrized closed fermion loops, we obtain an expansion of the
inverse irreducible polarization to second order in the small parameter q_0 /
k_F. In contrast to perturbation theory based on conventional bosonization, our
functional bosonization approach is not plagued by mass-shell singularities.
For interactions which can be expanded as f_q = f_0 + f_0^{2} q^2/2 + O (q^4)
with finite f_0^{2} we show that the momentum scale q_c = 1/ | m f_0^{2} |
separates two regimes characterized by a different q-dependence of the width
gamma_q of the collective zero sound mode and other features of S (omega, q).
For q_c << q << k_F we find that the line-shape in this regime is
non-Lorentzian with an overall width gamma_q of order q^3/(m q_c) and a
threshold singularity at the lower edge.
