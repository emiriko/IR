Large spin cold atom systems can exhibit novel magnetic properties which do
not appear in usual spin-1/2 systems. We investigate the SU(4) resonating
plaquette state in the three dimensional cubic optical lattice with spin-3/2
cold fermions. A novel gauge field formalism is constructed to describe the
Rokhsar-Kivelson type of Hamiltonian and a duality transformation is used to
study the phase diagram. Due to the proliferation of topological defects, the
system is generally gapped for the whole phase diagram of the quantum model,
which agrees with the recent numerical studies. A critical line is found for
the classical plaquette system, which also corresponds to a quantum many-body
wavefunction in a "plaquette liquid phase".
