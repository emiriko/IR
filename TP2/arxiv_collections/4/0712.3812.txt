Low-energy universality in atomic few-body systems as a result of a large
two-body scattering length has gained a lot of attention recently. Here, I
discuss recent progress in describing the three-body recombination of cold
atoms in terms of a finite set of universal scaling functions and review
results for the recombination length of cesium-133 atoms obtained with these
functions. Furthermore, I will consider the inclusion of effective range
corrections and the relevance for further calculations in atomic and nuclear
physics.
