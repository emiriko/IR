We present an ab-initio formalism for the calculation of transport properties
in compositionally disordered systems within the framework of the
Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker non-local coherent potential approximation. Our
formalism is based upon the single-particle Kubo-Greenwood linear response and
provides a natural means of incorporating the effects of short-range order upon
the transport properties. We demonstrate the efficacy of the formalism by
examining the effects of short-range order and clustering upon the transport
properties of disordered $AgPd$ and $CuZn$ alloys.
