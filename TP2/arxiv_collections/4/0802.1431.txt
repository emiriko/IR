We investigate a network model based on an infinite regular square lattice
embedded in the Euclidean plane where the node connection probability is given
by the geometrical distance of nodes. We show that the degree distribution in
the basic model is sharply peaked around its mean value. Since the model was
originally developed to mimic the social network of acquaintances, to broaden
the degree distribution we propose its generalization. We show that when
heterogeneity is introduced to the model, it is possible to obtain fat tails of
the degree distribution. Meanwhile, the small-world phenomenon present in the
basic model is not affected. To support our claims, both analytical and
numerical results are obtained.
