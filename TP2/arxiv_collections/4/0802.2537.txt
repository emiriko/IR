Several arguments have been proposed some years ago, attempting to prove the
impossibility of defining Lorentz-invariant elements of reality. I find that a
sufficient condition for the existence of elements of reality, introduced in
these proofs, seems to be used also as a necessary condition. I argue that
Lorentz-invariant elements of reality can be defined but, as Vaidman pointed
out, they won't satisfy the so-called product rule. In so doing I obtain
algebraic constraints on elements of reality associated with a maximal set of
commuting Hermitian operators.
