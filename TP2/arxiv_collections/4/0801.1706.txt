We study the equivalence of quantum states under local unitary
transformations by using the singular value decomposition. A complete set of
invariants under local unitary transformations is presented for several classes
of tripartite mixed states in KxMxN composite systems. Two density matrices in
the same class are equivalent under local unitary transformations if and only
if all these invariants have equal values for these density matrices.
