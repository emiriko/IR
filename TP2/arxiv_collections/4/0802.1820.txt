Hirsch has introduced the h-index to quantify an individual's scientific
research output by the largest number h of a scientist's papers that received
at least h citations. In order to take into account the highly skewed frequency
distribution of citations, Egghe proposed the g-index as an improvement of the
h-index. I have worked out 26 practical cases of physicists from the Institute
of Physics at Chemnitz University of Technology and compare the h and g values.
It is demonstrated that the g-index discriminates better between different
citation patterns. This can also be achieved by evaluating Jin's A-index which
reflects the average number of citations in the h-core and interpreting it in
conjunction with the h-index. h and A can be combined into the R-index to
measure the h-core's citation intensity. I have also determined the A and R
values for the 26 data sets. For a better comparison, I utilize interpolated
indices. The correlations between the various indices as well as with the total
number of papers and the highest citation counts are discussed. The largest
Pearson correlation coefficient is found between g and R. Although the
correlation between g and h is relatively strong, the arrangement of the data
set is significantly different, depending on whether they are put into order
according to the values of either h or g.
