We derive and analyze the Born-Markov master equation for a quantum harmonic
oscillator interacting with a bath of independent two-level systems. This
hitherto virtually unexplored model plays a fundamental role as one of the four
"canonical" system-environment models for decoherence and dissipation. To
investigate the influence of further couplings of the environmental spins to a
dissipative bath, we also derive the master equation for a harmonic oscillator
interacting with a single spin coupled to a bosonic bath. Our models are
experimentally motivated by quantum-electromechanical systems and micron-scale
ion traps. Decoherence and dissipation rates are found to exhibit temperature
dependencies significantly different from those in quantum Brownian motion. In
particular, the systematic dissipation rate for the central oscillator
decreases with increasing temperature and goes to zero at zero temperature, but
there also exists a temperature-independent momentum-diffusion (heating) rate.
