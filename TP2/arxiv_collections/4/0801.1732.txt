For identical bosons with a large scattering length, the dependence of the
3-body recombination rate on the collision energy is determined in the
zero-range limit by universal functions of a single scaling variable. There are
six scaling functions for angular momentum zero and one scaling function for
each higher partial wave. We calculate these universal functions by solving the
Skorniakov--Ter-Martirosian equation. The results for the 3-body recombination
as a function of the collision energy are in good agreement with previous
results from solving the 3-body Schroedinger equation for 4He atoms. The
universal scaling functions can be used to calculate the 3-body recombination
rate at nonzero temperature. We obtain an excellent fit to the data from the
Innsbruck group for 133Cs atoms with a large positive scattering length.
