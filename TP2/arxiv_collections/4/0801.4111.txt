We consider the entanglement entropy for a sub-system in d+1 dimensional
SU(N) lattice gauge theory. The 1+1 gauge theory is treated exactly and shows
trivial behavior. Gauge theories in higher dimensions are treated within
Migdal-Kadanoff approximation. We consider the gauge theory in the confinement
phase. We demonstrate the existence of a non-analytical change from the short
distance to long distance form in the entanglement entropy in such systems
(d>2) reminiscent of a phase transition. The transition is manifested in
nontrivial change in the RG flow of the character expansion coefficients
defining the partition function.
