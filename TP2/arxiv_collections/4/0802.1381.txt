Up to our knowledge -since about 126 years we were lacking of classical type
combinatorial interpretation of Fibonomial coefficients as it was Lukas
\cite{1} - to our knowledge -who was the first who had defined Finonomial
coefficients and derived a recurrence for them (see Historical Note in
\cite{2,3}). Here we inform that a join combinatorial interpretation was found
\cite{4} for all binomial-type coefficient - Fibonomial coefficients included.
