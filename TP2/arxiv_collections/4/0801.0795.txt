Glassy dynamics was investigated for thin films of atactic polystyrene by
complex electric capacitance measurements using dielectric relaxation
spectroscopy. During the isothermal aging process the real part of the electric
capacitance increased with time, whereas the imaginary part decreased with
time. It follows that the aging time dependences of real and imaginary parts of
the electric capacitance were primarily associated with change in volume (film
thickness) and dielectric permittivity, respectively. Further, dielectric
permittivity showed memory and rejuvenation effects in a similar manner to
those observed for poly(methyl methacrylate) thin films. On the other hand,
volume did not show a strong rejuvenation effect.
