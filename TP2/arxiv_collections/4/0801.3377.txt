We investigate the charge- and spin dynamical structure factors for the 2D
one-band Hubbard model in the strong coupling regime within an extension of the
Dynamical Cluster Approximation (DCA) to two-particle response functions. The
full irreducible two-particle vertex with three momenta and frequencies is
approximated by an effective vertex dependent on the momentum and frequency of
the spin/charge excitation. In the spirit of the DCA, the effective vertex is
calculated with quantum Monte Carlo methods on a finite cluster. On the basis
of a comparison with high temperature auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo data
we show that near and beyond optimal doping, our results provide a consistent
overall picture of the interplay between charge, spin and single-particle
excitations.
