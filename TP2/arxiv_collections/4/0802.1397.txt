We evaluate the complex frequencies of the normal modes for the massive
charged scalar field perturbations around a Reissner-N\"ordstrom black hole
surrounded by a static and spherically symmetric quintessence using third order
WKB approximation approach. Due to the presence of quintessence, quasinormal
frequencies damp more slowly. We studied the variation of quasinormal
frequencies with charge of the black bole, mass and charge of perturbating
scalar field and the quintessential state parameter.
