We investigate the role of higher multipole excitations in the
electromagnetic dissociation of one-neutron halo nuclei within two different
theoretical models -- a finite range distorted wave Born approximation and
another in a more analytical method with a finite range potential. We also
show, within a simple picture, how the presence of a weakly bound state affects
the breakup cross section.
