We study and analyse the questions regarding breakdown of global symmetry on
noncommutative sphere. We demonstrate this by considering a complex scalar
field on a fuzzy sphere and isolating Goldstone modes. We discuss the role of
nonlocal interactions present in these through geometrical considerations.
