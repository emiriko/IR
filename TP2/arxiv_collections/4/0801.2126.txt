The criteria determining the sign of entropy change in the open system are
formulated. The concepts of entrostat, degree of openness, critical level of
ordering are entered. The opportunity of occurrence of entropy oscillations in
a stationary status is shown. The important role of considered of entropy laws
in formation of the global tendencies.
