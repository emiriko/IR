Reaction--diffusion equations with a fractional Laplacian are reduced near a
long wave Hopf bifurcation. The obtained amplitude equation is shown to be the
complex Ginzburg-Landau equation with a fractional Laplacian. Some of the
properties of the normal complex Ginzburg-Landau equation are generalised for
the fractional analogue. In particular, an analogue of Kuramoto-Sivashinsky
equation is derived.
