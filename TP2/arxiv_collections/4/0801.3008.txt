I revisit an automated proof of Andrews' pentagonal number theorem found by
Riese. I uncover a simple polynomial identity hidden behind his proof. I
explain how to use this identity to prove Andrews' result along with a variety
of new formulas of similar type. I reveal an interesting relation between the
tri-pentagonal theorem and items (19), (20), (94), (98) on the celebrated
Slater list. Finally, I establish a new infinite family of multiple series
identities.
