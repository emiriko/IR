In recent years there have been reports of anomalous electrical resistivity
and the presence of superconductivity in semiconducting InN layers. By a
careful correlation of the temperature dependence of resistivity and magnetic
susceptibility with structural information from highresolution x-ray
diffraction measurements we show that superconductivity is not intrinsic to InN
and is seen only in samples that show traces of oxygen impurity. We hence
believe that InN is not intrinsically a superconducting semiconductor.
