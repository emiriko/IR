We review the direct CP and T violation in the three-body baryonic B decays
in the standard model. In particular, we emphasize that the direct CP violating
asymmetry in $B^\pm\to p\bar p K^{*\pm}$ is around 22% and the direct $T$
violating asymmetry in $\bar B^0 \ra \Lambda \bar p \pi^+$ can be as large as
12%, which are accessible to the current B factories at KEK and SLAC as well as
SuperB and LHCb.
