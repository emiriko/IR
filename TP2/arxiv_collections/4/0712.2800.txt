We establish existence of travelling waves to the gradient system $u_t =
u_{zz} - \nabla W(u)$ connecting two minima of $W$ when $u : \R \times
(0,\infty) \larrow \R^N$, that is, we establish existence of a pair $(U,c) \in
[C^2(\R)]^N \by (0,\infty)$, satisfying \[ \{{array}{l}
  U_{xx} - \nabla W (U) = - c U_x
  U(\pm \infty) = a^{\pm}, {array}. \] where $a^{\pm}$ are local minima of the
potential $W \in C_{\textrm{loc}}^2(\R^N)$ with $W(a^-)< W(a^+)=0$ and $N \geq
1$. Our method is variational and based on the minimization of the functional
$E_c (U) = \int_{\R}\Big\{{1/2}|U_x|^2 + W(U) \Big\}e^{cx} dx$ in the
appropriate space setup. Following Alikakos-Fusco \cite{A-F}, we introduce an
artificial constraint to restore compactness and force the desired asymptotic
behavior, which we later remove. We provide variational characterizations of
the travelling wave and the speed. In particular, we show that $E_c(U)=0$.
