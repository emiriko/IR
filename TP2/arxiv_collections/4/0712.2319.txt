Arrays of Fe-nanoparticles grown by STM-assited CVD have been placed on top
of a narrow stripe of Py. The magnetic coupling between the nanoparticles and
the underlying Py film results in distinct negative jumps of the Py
magnetoresistance. The switching of the magnetization orientation of individual
particles is clearly reflected in the Py magnetoresistance as a consequence of
AMR and DWMR, with a homogeneous particle magnetization orientation yielding
the highest resistances.
