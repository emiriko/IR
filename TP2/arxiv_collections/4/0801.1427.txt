A kinetic theory of homogeneous crystal nucleation in unary droplets is
presented taking into account that a crystal nucleus can form not only in the
volume-based mode (with all its facets within the droplet) but also in the
surface-stimulated one (with one of its facets at the droplet surface). The
previously developed thermodynamics of surface-stimulated crystal nucleation
rigorously showed that if at least one of the facets of the crystal is only
partially wettable by its melt, then it is thermodynamically more favorable for
the nucleus to form with that facet at the droplet surface rather than within
the droplet. So far, however, the kinetic aspects of this phenomenon had not
been studied at all. The theory proposed in the present paper advocates that
even in the surface-stimulated mode crystal nuclei initially emerge (as
sub-critical clusters) homogeneously in the sub-surface layer, not
"pseudo-heterogeneously" at the surface. A homogeneously emerged sub-critical
crystal can become a surface-stimulated nucleus due to density and structure
fluctuations. This effect contributes to the total rate of crystal nucleation
(as the volume-based mode does). An explicit expression for the total
per-particle rate of crystal nucleation is derived. Numerical evaluations for
water droplets suggest that the surface-stimulated mode can significantly
enhance the per-particle rate of crystal nucleation in droplets as large as 10
microns in radius. Possible experimental verification of the proposed theory is
discussed.
