The STM tunneling through a quantum wire (QW) with a side-attached impurity
(atom, island) is investigated using a tight-binding model and the
nonequilibrium Keldysh Green function method. The impurity can be coupled to
one or more QW atoms. The presence of the impurity strongly modifies the local
density of states of the wire atoms, thus influences the STM tunneling through
all the wire atoms. The transport properties of the impurity itself are also
investigated mainly as a function of the wire length and the way it is coupled
to the wire. It is shown that the properties of the impurity itself and the way
it is coupled to the wire strongly influence the STM tunneling which is
reflected in the density of states and differential conductance.
