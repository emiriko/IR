A beta-ray detecting nuclear quadrupole resonance system has been developed
at NSCL/MSU to measure ground-state electric quadrupole moments of short-lived
nuclei produced as fast rare isotope beams. This system enables quick and
sequential application of multiple transition frequencies over a wide range.
Fast switching between variable capacitors in resonance circuits ensures
sufficient power delivery to the coil in the beta-ray detecting nuclear
magnetic resonance technique. The fast switching technique enhances detection
efficiency of resonance signals and is especially useful when the polarization
and/or production rate of the nucleus of interest are small and when the
nuclear spin is large.
