The probability of successfully controlled teleportating an unknown qubit
using a general three-particle state is investigated. We give the analytic
expressions of maximal probabilities of successfully controlled teleportating
an unknown qubit via several kinds of tripartite states including a tripartite
GHZ state and a tripartite W-state.
