We present a direct derivation of the two-point correlation function of the
vector current in the soft wall model by using the AdS/CFT dictionary. The
resulting correlator is exactly the same as the one previously obtained from
dispersion relation with the same spectral function as in this model. The
coefficient $C_2$ of the two-dimensional power correction is found to be
$C_2=-c/2$ with $c$ the slope of the Regge trajectory, rather than $C_2=-c/3$
derived from the strategy of first quantized string theory. Taking the slope of
the $\rho$ trajectory $c\approx0.9{GeV}^2$ as input, we then get
$C_2\approx-0.45{GeV}^2$. The gluon condensate is found to be
$<\alpha_sG^2>\approx0.064{GeV}^4$, which is almost identical to the QCD sum
rule estimation. By comparing these two equivalent derivation of the correlator
of scalar glueball operator, we demonstrate that the two-dimensional correction
can't be eliminated by including the non-leading solution in the
bulk-to-boundary propagator, as was done in \cite{Colangelo2}. In other words,
the two-dimensional correction does exist in the scalar glueball case. Also it
is manifest by using the dispersion relation that the minus sign of gluon
condensate and violation of the low energy theorem are related to the
subtraction scheme.
