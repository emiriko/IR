We have investigated anisotropy in magnetic and electrical transport
properties of Fe1-xCrxSb2 (0<= x <=1) single crystals. The magnetic ground
state of the system evolves from paramagnetic to antiferromagnetic with gradual
substitution of Fe with Cr. Anisotropy in electrical transport diminishes with
increased Cr substitution and fades away by x=0.5. We find that the variable
range hopping (VRH) conduction mechanism dominates at low temperatures for
0.4<= x <=0.75.
