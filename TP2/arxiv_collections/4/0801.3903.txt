A description of mesoscopic fluctuations of the pairing gap in finite-sized
quantum systems based on periodic orbit theory is presented. The size of the
fluctuations are found to depend on quite general properties. We distinguish
between systems where corresponding classical motion is regular or chaotic, and
describe in detail fluctuations of the BCS gap as a function of the size of the
system. The theory is applied to different mesoscopic systems: atomic nuclei,
metallic grains, and ultracold fermionic gases. We also present a detailed
description of pairing gap variation with particle number for nuclei based on a
deformed cavity potential.
