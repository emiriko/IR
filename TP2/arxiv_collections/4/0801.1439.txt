We study thermodynamic quantities of an acoustic black hole and its
thermodynamic stability in a cavity based on the generalized uncertainty
principle. It can be shown that there is a minimal black hole which can be a
stable remnant after black hole evaporation. Moreover, the behavior of the free
energy shows that the large black hole is stable too. Therefore, the acoustic
black hole can decay into the remnant or the large black hole.
