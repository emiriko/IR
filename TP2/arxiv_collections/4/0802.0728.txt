We investigate tunneling properties of Bogoliubov phonons in a Bose-Einstein
condensate. We find the anomalous enhancement of the quasiparticle current
$J_{\rm q}$ carried by Bogoliubov phonons near a potential barrier, due to the
supply of the excess current from the condensate. This effect leads to the
increase of quasiparticle transmission probability in the low energy region
found by Kovrizhin {\it et al.}. We also show that the quasiparticle current
twists the phase of the condensate wavefunction across the barrier, leading to
a finite Josephson supercurrent $J_{\rm s}$ through the barrier. This induced
supercurrent flows in the opposite direction to the quasiparticle current so as
to cancel out the enhancement of $J_{\rm q}$ and conserve the total current
$J=J_{\rm q}+J_{\rm s}$.
