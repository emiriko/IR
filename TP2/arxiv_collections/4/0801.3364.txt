We present a useful method for the construction of cosmological models by
solving the differential equations arising from calculating the kinematical
invariants (shear, rotation, expansion and acceleration) of an observer field
in proper time description. As an application of our method we present two
generalizations of the G\"odel spacetime that follow naturally from our
approach.
