Contradiction is often seen as a defect of intelligent systems and a
dangerous limitation on efficiency. In this paper we raise the question of
whether, on the contrary, it could be considered a key tool in increasing
intelligence in biological structures. A possible way of answering this
question in a mathematical context is shown, formulating a proposition that
suggests a link between intelligence and contradiction.
  A concrete approach is presented in the well-defined setting of cellular
automata. Here we define the models of ``observer'', ``entity'',
``environment'', ``intelligence'' and ``contradiction''. These definitions,
which roughly correspond to the common meaning of these words, allow us to
deduce a simple but strong result about these concepts in an unbiased,
mathematical manner. Evidence for a real-world counterpart to the demonstrated
formal link between intelligence and contradiction is provided by three
computational experiments.
