We report that in YBa2Cu3Oy and La2-xSrxCuO4 there is a spatially
inhomogeneous response to magnetic field for temperatures T extending well
above the bulk superconducting transition temperature Tc. An inhomogeneous
magnetic response is observed above Tc even in ortho-II YBa2Cu3O6.50, which has
highly ordered doping. The degree of the field inhomogeneity above Tc tracks
the hole doping dependences of both Tc and the density of the superconducting
carriers below Tc, and therefore is apparently coupled to superconductivity.
