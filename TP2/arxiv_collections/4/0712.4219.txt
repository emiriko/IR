The genetic code markup is the assignment of stop codons. The standard
genetic code markup ensures the maximum possible stability of genetic
information with respect to two fault classes: frameshift and nonsense
mutations. There are only 528 (about 1,3% of total number) optimal markups in
the set of markups having 3 stop codons. Among the sets of markups with
1,2,...,8 stop codons, the standard case having 3 stop codons has maximum
absolute number of optimal markups.
