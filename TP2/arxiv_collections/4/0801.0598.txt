We present a quantum theory of frustrated diamond lattice antiferromagnets.
Considering quantum fluctuations as the predominant mechanism relieving spin
frustration, we find a rich phase diagram comprising of six phases with
coplanar spiral ordering in addition to the N\'eel phase. By computing the
specific heat of these ordered phases, we obtain a remarkable agreement between
$(k,k,0)$-spiral ordering and the experimental specific heat data for the
diamond lattice spinel compounds MnSc$_2$S$_4$, Co$_3$O$_4$ and CoRh$_2$O$_4$,
i.e. specific heat data is a strong evidence for $(k,k,0)$-spiral ordering in
all of these materials. This prediction can be tested in future neutron
scattering experiments on Co$_3$O$_4$ and CoRh$_2$O$_4$, and is consistent with
existing neutron scattering data on MnSc$_2$S$_4$. Based on this agreement we
infer a monotonically increasing relationship between frustration and the
strength of quantum fluctuations.
