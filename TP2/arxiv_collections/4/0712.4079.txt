The vortex state of mesoscopic three-dimensional superconductors is
determined using a minimization procedure of the Ginzburg-Landau free energy.
We obtain the vortex pattern for a mesoscopic superconducting sphere and find
that vortex lines are naturally bent and are closest to each other at the
equatorial plane. For a superconducting disk with finite height, and under an
applied magnetic field perpendicular to its major surface, we find that our
method gives results consistent with previous calculations. The matching
fields, the magnetization and $H_{c3}$, are obtained for models that differ
according to their boundary properties. A change of the Ginzburg-Landau
parameters near the surface can substantially enhance $H_{c3}$ as shown here.
