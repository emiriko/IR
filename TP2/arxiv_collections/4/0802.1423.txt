The technological settings of a modified sol-gel method for preparation of
highly fine homogeneous powder Ca2CuO3 doped with uranium 238 (x=0-0.05) is
presented. The analysis of structure, purity of phases and the justification
for the role of uranium in the given compounds are provided together with
almost complete classification of observed optical phonons by means of the
Raman, IR measurements and ab initio calculation. The significant reduction in
particle size was achieved by doping and the strong correlation between
resistivity and doping concentration was observed and explained using the
phonon-assisted electron hopping conduction model. The persistence of covalent
insulation state in all compounds is a key feature of this class of compounds.
