We consider the adiabatic pumping of charge through a mesoscopic one
dimensional wire in the presence of electron-electron interactions. A two-delta
potential model is used to describe the wire, which allows to obtain exactly
the scattering matrix coefficients, which are renormalized by the interactions.
Two periodic drives, shifted one from another, are applied at two locations of
the wire in order to drive a current through it in the absence of bias.
Analytical expressions are obtained for the pumped charge, current noise, and
Fano factor in different regimes. This allows to explore pumping for the whole
parameter range of pumping strengths. We show that, working close to a
resonance is necessary to have a comfortable window of pumping amplitudes where
charge quantization is close to the optimum value: a single electron charge is
transferred in one cycle. Interactions can improve the situation, the charge
$Q$ is closer to one electron charge and noise is reduced, following a $Q
(1-Q)$ behavior, reminiscent of the reduction of noise in quantum wires by $T
(1-T)$, where $T$ is the energy transmission coefficient. For large pumping
amplitudes, this charge vanishes, noise also decreases but slower than the
charge.
