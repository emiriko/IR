We study the approximability of predicates on $k$ variables from a domain
$[q]$, and give a new sufficient condition for such predicates to be
approximation resistant under the Unique Games Conjecture. Specifically, we
show that a predicate $P$ is approximation resistant if there exists a balanced
pairwise independent distribution over $[q]^k$ whose support is contained in
the set of satisfying assignments to $P$.
