From the free surface Navier-Stokes system, we derive the non-hydrostatic
Saint-Venant system for the shallow waters including friction and viscosity.
The derivation leads to two formulations of growing complexity depending on the
level of approximation chosen for the fluid pressure. The obtained models are
compared with the Boussinesq models.
