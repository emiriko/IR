Polar weighted homogeneous polynomials are the class of special polynomials
of real variables $x_i,y_i, i=1,..., n$ with $z_i=x_i+\sqrt{-1} y_i$, which
enjoys a "polar action". In many aspects, their behavior looks like that of
complex weighted homogeneous polynomials. We study basic properties of
hypersurfaces which are defined by polar weighted homogeneous polynomials.
