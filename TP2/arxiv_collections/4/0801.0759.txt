Density profiles are the most common measure of inhomogeneous structure in
confined fluids, but their connection to transport coefficients is poorly
understood. We explore via simulation how tuning particle-wall interactions to
flatten or enhance the particle layering of a model confined fluid impacts its
self-diffusivity, viscosity, and entropy. Interestingly, interactions that
eliminate particle layering significantly reduce confined fluid mobility,
whereas those that enhance layering can have the opposite effect. Excess
entropy helps to understand and predict these trends.
