For finite systems, the real part of the conductivity is usually decomposed
as the sum of a zero frequency delta peak and a finite frequency regular part.
In studies with periodic boundary conditions, the Drude weight, i.e., the
weight of the zero frequency delta peak, is found to be nonzero for integrable
systems, even at very high temperatures, whereas it vanishes for generic
(nonintegrable) systems. Paradoxically, for systems with open boundary
conditions, it can be shown that the coefficient of the zero frequency delta
peak is identically zero for any finite system, regardless of its
integrability. In order for the Drude weight to be a thermodynamically
meaningful quantity, both kinds of boundary conditions should produce the same
answer in the thermodynamic limit. We shed light on these issues by using
analytical and numerical methods.
