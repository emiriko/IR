Using a general parametrization of the spin structure of the matrix element
for the elastic $e^-+^4He$ scattering and for the annihilation $e^++e^-\to
\pi^++\pi^-$ reactions in terms of two complex amplitudes, we derive general
properties of the observables in presence of two--photon exchange. We show that
this mechanism induces a specific dependence of the differential cross section
on the angle of the emitted particle. We reanalyze the existing experimental
data on the differential cross section, for elastic electron scattering on
$^4He$, in the light of this result.
