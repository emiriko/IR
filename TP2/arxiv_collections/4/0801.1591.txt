Using the WZ method we present simpler proofs of Koecher's, Leshchiner's and
Bailey-Borwein-Bradley's identities for generating functions of the sequences
$\{\zeta(2n+2)\}_{n\ge 0}, \{\zeta(2n+3)\}_{n\ge 0}.$ By the same method we
give several new representations for these generating functions yielding faster
convergent series for values of the Riemann zeta function.
