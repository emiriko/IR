Coherent structures, such as solitary waves, appear in many physical
problems, including fluid mechanics, optics, quantum physics, and plasma
physics. A less studied setting is found in geophysics, where highly viscous
fluids couple to evolving material parameters to model partially molten rock,
magma, in the Earth's interior. Solitary waves are also found here, but the
equations lack useful mathematical structures such as an inverse scattering
transform or even a variational formulation.
  A common question in all of these applications is whether or not these
structures are stable to perturbation. We prove that the solitary waves in this
Earth science setting are asymptotically stable and accomplish this without any
pre-exisiting Lyapunov stability. This holds true for a family of equations,
extending beyond the physical parameter space. Furthermore, this extends
existing results on well-posedness to data in a neighborhood of the solitary
waves.
