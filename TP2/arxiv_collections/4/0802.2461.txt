We address the issue of a consistent power counting scheme in manifestly
Lorentz-invariant baryon chiral perturbation theory. We discuss the inclusion
of vector mesons in the calculation of the nucleon electromagnetic form
factors. We comment on the chiral expansion of the nucleon mass to order
O(q**6).
