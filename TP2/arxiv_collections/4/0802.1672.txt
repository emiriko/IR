The WZW functional in D=4 can be derived directly from the Chern-Simons
functional of a compactified D=5 gauge theory and the boundary fermions it
supplants. A simple pedagogical model based on U(1) gauge groups illustrates
how this works. A bulk-boundary system with the fermions eliminated manifestly
evinces anomaly cancelations between CS and WZW terms.
