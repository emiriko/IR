In this work we study the nonlinear dynamics of the static and the driven
ellipse. In the static case, we find numerically an asymptotical algebraic
decay for the escape of an ensemble of non-interacting particles through a
small hole due to the integrable structure of the phase space of the system.
Furthermore, for a certain hole position a saturation value in the decay that
can be tuned arbitrarily by varying the eccentricity of the ellipse is observed
and explained. When applying harmonic boundary oscillations this saturation
value caused by librator type orbits is gradually destroyed via two fundamental
processes which are discussed in detail. As a result, an amplitude dependent
emission rate is obtained in the long time behavior of the decay, suggesting
that the driven elliptical billiard can be used as a controllable source of
particles.
