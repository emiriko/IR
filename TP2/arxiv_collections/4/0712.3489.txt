The Myers-Pospelov (MP) model is an effective field theory, including
dimension five operators, which describes the phenomenology of active Lorentz
invariance violation produced by a preferred reference frame. We concentrate
here in the case of the modified electrodynamics. The point of view taken in
this work is that the Lorentz violating part of the action in the MP model,
which includes higher order time derivative (HOTD) operators, is to be
considered as a perturbation over the dynamics described by standard
Electrodynamics, particularly in the quantum case. In order to cope with the
challenges posed by HOTD theories it will be necessary to deal with a modified
perturbation scheme which is well described in the literature. We apply such
methods to this specific model providing a quantization of the free sector of
the theory. The calculation of interacting processes, together with radiative
corrections, is beyond the scope of the present article.
