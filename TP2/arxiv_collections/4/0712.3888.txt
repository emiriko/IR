The conditions under which a linear anisotropic polarization element
orthogonalizes several polarization states of input totally polarized light
were studied in the paper. The criterion for orthogonalization was obtained in
the form of inequality for anisotropy parameters. Orthogonalization properties
of polarization elements with the most important anisotropy types were
investigated. The parameters under which orthogonalization occurs, and the
states that are orthogonalized were found. The loci of these states on the
Poincare sphere were given for sake of illustration in each case.
