In this paper, we show how thread partitioning helps in proving properties of
mobile systems. Thread partitioning consists in gathering the threads of a
mobile system into several classes. The partitioning criterion is left as a
parameter of both the mobility model and the properties we are interested in.
Then, we design a polynomial time abstract interpretation-based static analysis
that counts the number of threads inside each partition class.
