In this paper we study a parametric class of stochastic processes to model
both fast and slow anomalous diffusion. This class, called generalized grey
Brownian motion (ggBm), is made up off self-similar with stationary increments
processes (H-sssi) and depends on two real parameters alpha in (0,2) and beta
in (0,1]. It includes fractional Brownian motion when alpha in (0,2) and
beta=1, and time-fractional diffusion stochastic processes when alpha=beta in
(0,1). The latters have marginal probability density function governed by
time-fractional diffusion equations of order beta. The ggBm is defined through
the explicit construction of the underline probability space. However, in this
paper we show that it is possible to define it in an unspecified probability
space. For this purpose, we write down explicitly all the finite dimensional
probability density functions. Moreover, we provide different ggBm
characterizations. The role of the M-Wright function, which is related to the
fundamental solution of the time-fractional diffusion equation, emerges as a
natural generalization of the Gaussian distribution. Furthermore, we show that
ggBm can be represented in terms of the product of a random variable, which is
related to the M-Wright function, and an independent fractional Brownian
motion. This representation highlights the $H$-{\bf sssi} nature of the ggBm
and provides a way to study and simulate the trajectories. For this purpose, we
developed a random walk model based on a finite difference approximation of a
partial integro-differenital equation of fractional type.
