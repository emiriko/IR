Network intrusion detection systems are themselves becoming targets of
attackers. Alert flood attacks may be used to conceal malicious activity by
hiding it among a deluge of false alerts sent by the attacker. Although these
types of attacks are very hard to stop completely, our aim is to present
techniques that improve alert throughput and capacity to such an extent that
the resources required to successfully mount the attack become prohibitive. The
key idea presented is to combine a token bucket filter with a realtime
correlation algorithm. The proposed algorithm throttles alert output from the
IDS when an attack is detected. The attack graph used in the correlation
algorithm is used to make sure that alerts crucial to forming strategies are
not discarded by throttling.
