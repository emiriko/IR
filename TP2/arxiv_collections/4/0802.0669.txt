We consider Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering (DVCS) on nucleons and nuclei
in the framework of generalized vector meson dominance (GVMD) model. We
demonstrate that the GVMD model provides a good description of the HERA data on
the dependence of the proton DVCS cross section on Q^2, W (at Q^2=4 GeV^2) and
t. At Q^2 = 8 GeV^2, the soft W-behavior of the GVMD model somewhat
underestimates the W-dependence of the DVCS cross section due to the hard
contribution not present in the GVMD model. We estimate 1/Q^2 power-suppressed
corrections to the DVCS amplitude and the DVCS cross section and find them
large. We also make predictions for the nuclear DVCS amplitude and cross
section in the kinematics of the future Electron-Ion Collider. We predict
significant nuclear shadowing, which matches well predictions of the
leading-twist nuclear shadowing in DIS on nuclei.
