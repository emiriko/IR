A polymer chain tethered to a surface may be compact or extended, adsorbed or
desorbed, depending on interactions with the surface and the surrounding
solvent. This leads to a rich phase diagram with a variety of transitions. To
investigate these transitions we have performed Monte Carlo simulations of a
bond-fluctuation model with Wang-Landau and umbrella sampling algorithms in a
two-dimensional state space. The simulations' density of states results have
been evaluated for interaction parameters spanning the range from good to poor
solvent conditions and from repulsive to strongly attractive surfaces. In this
work, we describe the simulation method and present results for the overall
phase behavior and for some of the transitions. For adsorption in good solvent,
we compare with Metropolis Monte Carlo data for the same model and find good
agreement between the results. For the collapse transition, which occurs when
the solvent quality changes from good to poor, we consider two situations
corresponding to three-dimensional (hard surface) and two-dimensional (very
attractive surface) chain conformations, respectively. For the hard surface, we
compare tethered chains with free chains and find very similar behavior for
both types of chains. For the very attractive surface, we find the
two-dimensional chain collapse to be a two-step transition with the same
sequence of transitions that is observed for three-dimensional chains: a
coil-globule transition that changes the overall chain size is followed by a
local rearrangement of chain segments.
