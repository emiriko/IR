The Littelmann path moel gives a realization of the crystals of integrable
representations of symmetrizable Kac-Moody Lie algebras. Recent work of
Gaussent-Littelmann and others has demonstrated a connection between this model
and the geometry of the loop Grassmannian. The alcove walk model is a version
of the path model which is intimately connected to the combinatorics of the
affine Hecke algebra. In this paper we define a refined alcove walk model which
encodes the points of the affine flag variety. We show that this combinatorial
indexing naturally indexes the "cells" in generalized Mirkovic-Vilonen
intersections.
