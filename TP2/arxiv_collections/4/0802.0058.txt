In this paper, we establish an optimal dual version of trace estimate
involving angular regularity. Based on this estimate, we get the generalized
Morawetz estimates and weighted Strichartz estimates for the solutions to a
large class of evolution equations, including the wave and Schr\"{o}dinger
equation. As applications, we prove the Strauss' conjecture with a kind of mild
rough data for $2\le n\le 4$, and a result of global well-posedness with small
data for some nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation with $L^2$-subcritical
nonlinearity.
