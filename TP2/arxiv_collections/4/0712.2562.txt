The high temperature superconductivity in cuprate materials1 has puzzled
scientists over twenty years. We must find a new way to understand
superconductivity. It is found the spin-charge correlation may dominate the
superconductivity2, and we base our judgment upon the features of various
superconductors. Thus we presented the idea that superconductivity could be
described by correlations. To develop this idea into a quantitative theory, the
first work is to give a model and show that various superconductivities can be
included in this model. Moreover, superconductivity can originate from the
spin-singlet pairing3 or from the spin-triplet pairing4. The spin-singlet
pairing favors to appear at the border of antiferromagnetism5, while the
spin-triplet pairing favors to appear at the border of ferromagnetism6. The
coexistence between superconductivity and magnetism is also possible7,8.
Therefore, the second work is to reveal the relation between superconductivity
and magnetism.
