The article is devoted to stochastic processes with values in finite- and
infinite-dimensional vector spaces over infinite fields $\bf K$ of zero
characteristics with non-trivial non-archimedean norms. For different types of
stochastic processes controlled by measures with values in $\bf K$ and in
complete topological vector spaces over $\bf K$ stochastic integrals are
investigated. Vector valued measures and integrals in spaces over $\bf K$ are
studied. Theorems about spectral decompositions of non-archimedean stochastic
processes are proved.
