A thermal position sensor was fabricated and evaluated. The device consists
of an array of temperature sensing elements, fabricated entirely on a plastic
substrate. A novel fabrication technology was implemented which allows direct
integration with read out electronics and communication to the macro-world
without the use of wire bonding. The fabricated sensing elements are
temperature sensitive Pt resistors with an average TCR of 0.0024/C. The device
realizes the detection of the position and the motion of a heating source by
monitoring the resistance variation of the thermistor array. The application
field of such a cost-effective position sensor is considered quite extensive.
