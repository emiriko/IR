The ground state of the quantum rotor model in two dimensions with random
phase frustration is investigated. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations are
performed on the corresponding (2+1)-dimensional classical model under the
entropic sampling scheme. For weak quantum fluctuation, the system is found to
be in a phase glass phase characterized by a finite compressibility and a
finite value for the Edwards-Anderson order parameter, signifying long-ranged
phase rigidity in both spatial and imaginary time directions. Scaling
properties of the model near the transition to the gapped, Mott insulator state
with vanishing compressibility are analyzed. At the quantum critical point, the
dynamic exponent $z_{\rm dyn}\simeq 1.17$ is greater than one. Correlation
length exponents in the spatial and imaginary time directions are given by
$\nu\simeq 0.73$ and $\nu_z\simeq 0.85$, respectively, both assume values
greater than 0.6723 of the pure case. We speculate that the phase glass phase
is superconducting rather than metallic in the zero current limit.
