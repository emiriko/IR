Estimating probabilistic deformable template models is a new approach in the
fields of computer vision and probabilistic atlases in computational anatomy. A
first coherent statistical framework modelling the variability as a hidden
random variable has been given by Allassonni\`ere, Amit and Trouv\'e in [1] in
simple and mixture of deformable template models. A consistent stochastic
algorithm has been introduced in [2] to face the problem encountered in [1] for
the convergence of the estimation algorithm for the one component model in the
presence of noise. We propose here to go on in this direction of using some
"SAEM-like" algorithm to approximate the MAP estimator in the general Bayesian
setting of mixture of deformable template model. We also prove the convergence
of this algorithm toward a critical point of the penalised likelihood of the
observations and illustrate this with handwritten digit images.
