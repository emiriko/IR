We calculate the probability of recoilless emission and detection of
neutrinos (Mossbauer effect with neutrinos) taking into account the boundedness
of the parent and daughter nuclei in the neutrino source and detector as well
as the leptonic mixing. We show that, in spite of their near monochromaticity,
the recoillessly emitted and captured neutrinos oscillate. After a qualitative
discussion of this issue, we corroborate and extend our results by computing
the combined rate of $\bar{\nu}_e$ production, propagation and detection in the
framework of quantum field theory, starting from first principles. This allows
us to avoid making any a priori assumptions about the energy and momentum of
the intermediate-state neutrino. Our calculation permits quantitative
predictions of the transition rate in future experiments, and shows that the
decoherence and delocalization factors, which could in principle suppress
neutrino oscillations, are irrelevant under realistic experimental conditions.
