We study stochastic equations of non-negative processes with jumps. The
existence and uniqueness of strong solutions are established under Lipschitz
and non-Lipschitz conditions. The comparison property of two solutions are
proved under suitable conditions. The results are applied to stochastic
equations driven by one-sided Levy processes and those of continuous state
branching processes with immigration.
