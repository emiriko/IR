We have successfully grown epitaxial La$_{1.67}$Sr$_{0.33}$NiO$_4$ films with
a small crystalline mosaic using pulsed laser deposition. With synchrotron
radiation, the x-ray diffraction peaks associated with charge stripes have been
successfully observed for relatively thick films. Anomalies due to the
charge-ordering transition have been examined using four-point probe
resistivity measurements. X-ray scattering provides direct evidence for
suppression of the stripe phase in thin samples; the phase disappears for film
thicknesses $\leqslant$ 2600 ~\AA{}. The suppression appears to be a result of
shrinking the stripe phase domains. This may reflect the stripe phase
progressing from nematic to isotropic.
