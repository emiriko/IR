Modular double of quantum group U_q (sl(2)) with deformation parameter
q=e^{i\pi\tau} is a natural object explicitly taking into account the duality
\tau -> 1/\tau. The use of the modular double in CFT allows to consider the
region 1<c<25 for the central charge of the Virasoro algebra when |\tau|=1. In
this paper a new discrete series of representations for the modular double of
U_q (sl(2,R)) is found for such \tau.
