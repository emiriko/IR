We study the quantum walk in momentum space using a coin arranged in
quasi-periodic sequences following a Fibonacci prescription. We build for this
system a classical map based on the trace of the evolution operator. The
sub-ballistic behavior of this quantum walk is connected with the power-law
decay of the time correlations of the trace map.
