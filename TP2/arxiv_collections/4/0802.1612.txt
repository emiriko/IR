We detail the theory of Discrete Riemann Surfaces. It takes place on a
cellular decomposition of a surface, together with its Poincar\'e dual,
equipped with a discrete conformal structure. A lot of theorems of the
continuous theory follow through to the discrete case, we define the discrete
analogs of period matrices, Riemann's bilinear relations, exponential of
constant argument and series. We present the notion of criticality and its
relationship with integrability.
