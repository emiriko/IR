It is shown that the support of an irreducible weight module over the
Schr\"{o}dinger-Virasoro Lie algebra with an infinite-dimensional weight space,
coincides with the weight lattice and that all nontrivial weight spaces of such
a module are infinite-dimensional. As a side-product, it is obtained that every
simple weight module over the Schr\"{o}dinger-Virasoro Lie algebra with a
nontrivial finite-dimensional weight space, is a Harish-Chandra module.
