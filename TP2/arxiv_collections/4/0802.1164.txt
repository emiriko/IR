We study the visibility of Aharonov-Bohm interference in an electronic
Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) in the integer quantum Hall regime. The
visibility is controlled by the filling factor $\nu$ and is observed only
between $\nu \approx 2.0$ and 1.0, with an unexpected maximum near $\nu=1.5$.
Three energy scales extracted from the temperature and voltage dependences of
the visibility change in a very similar way with the filling factor, indicating
that the different aspects of the interference depend sensitively on the local
structure of the compressible and incompressible strips forming the quantum
Hall edge channels.
