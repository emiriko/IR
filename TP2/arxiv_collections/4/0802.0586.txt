Cotunneling current through a resonant level coupled to either normal and
superconducting or to two superconducting leads is studied for the domain of
bias voltages, V, exceeding the superconducting gap, 2\Delta. Due to the
on-site repulsion in the resonant level, cotunneling of an electron is
accompanied by creation of a quasiparticle in a superconducting lead. Energy
conservation imposes a threshold for this inelastic transport channel:
V_c=3\Delta for N-S case and \tilde{V}_c=4\Delta for the S-S case. We
demonstrate that the behavior of current near the respective thresholds is
nonanalytic, namely, \delta I^{in}(V)\propto (V-V_c)^{3/2}\Theta(V-V_c) and
\delta I^{in}(V) \propto (V-\tilde{V}_c)\Theta(V-\tilde{V}_c). Stronger anomaly
for the S-S leads is the consequence of the enhanced density of states at the
edges of the gap. In addition, the enhanced density of states makes the
threshold anomalies for two-electron cotunneling processes in the
Coulomb-blockaded regions more pronounced than for the N-N leads.
