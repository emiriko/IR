We propose a new numerical approach to compute nonclassical solutions to
hyperbolic conservation laws. The class of finite difference schemes presented
here is fully conservative and keep nonclassical shock waves as sharp
interfaces, contrary to standard finite difference schemes. The main challenge
is to achieve, at the discretization level, a consistency property with respect
to a prescribed kinetic relation. The latter is required for the selection of
physically meaningful nonclassical shocks. Our method is based on a
reconstruction technique performed in each computational cell that may contain
a nonclassical shock. To validate this approach, we establish several
consistency and stability properties, and we perform careful numerical
experiments. The convergence of the algorithm toward the physically meaningful
solutions selected by a kinetic relation is demonstrated numerically for
several test cases, including concave-convex as well as convex-concave
flux-functions.
