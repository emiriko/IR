The structure and dynamics of froths have been subjects of intense interest
due to the desire to understand the behaviour of complex systems where
topological intricacy prohibits exact evaluation of the ground state. The
dynamics of a traditional froth involves drainage and drying in the cell
boundaries, thus it is irreversible. We report a new member to the froths
family: suprafroth, in which the cell boundaries are superconducting and the
cell interior is normal phase. Despite very different microscopic origin,
topological analysis of the structure of the suprafroth shows that statistical
von Neumann and Lewis laws apply. Furthermore, for the first time in the
analysis of froths there is a global measurable property, the magnetic moment,
which can be directly related to the suprafroth structure. We propose that this
suprafroth is a new, model system for the analysis of the complex physics of
two-dimensional froths.
