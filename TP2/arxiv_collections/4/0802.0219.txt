The purpose of this paper is to provide a discussion, with illustrating
examples, on Bayesian forecasting for dynamic generalized linear models
(DGLMs). Adopting approximate Bayesian analysis, based on conjugate forms and
on Bayes linear estimation, we describe the theoretical framework and then we
provide detailed examples of response distributions, including binomial,
Poisson, negative binomial, geometric, normal, log-normal, gamma, exponential,
Weibull, Pareto, beta, and inverse Gaussian. We give numerical illustrations
for all distributions (except for the normal). Putting together all the above
distributions, we give a unified Bayesian approach to non-Gaussian time series
analysis, with applications from finance and medicine to biology and the
behavioural sciences. Throughout the models we discuss Bayesian forecasting
and, for each model, we derive the multi-step forecast mean. Finally, we
describe model assessment using the likelihood function, and Bayesian model
monitoring.
