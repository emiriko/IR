An analysis of the optical response of periodically arrayed monolayers
composed of dielectric spheres with low refractive index is herein presented.
The reflectance spectra of two-dimensional square and triangular lattices are
obtained by means of the vector Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker method, both spectra
showing very similar qualitative features for photon energies below the onset
of diffraction spots. In this energy region, the same number of peaks of
unitary amplitude in the reflectance spectra are predicted for both kinds of
monolayers, suggesting that this must be a universal feature independent of the
particular geometry of the lattice. The origin of these high reflectance peaks
is investigated. It is found that the resonances of TM and TE modes due to
dipolar, quadrupolar and octupolar interaction inside the monolayer are largely
responsible for the peak structure observed in the reflectance spectra.
