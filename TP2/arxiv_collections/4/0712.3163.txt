We report on the calculation of the next-to-leading order QCD corrections to
the production of W-boson pairs in association with a hard jet at hadron
colliders, which is an important source of background for Higgs and new-physics
searches. If a veto against the emission of a second hard jet is applied, the
corrections stabilize the leading-order prediction for the cross section
considerably.
