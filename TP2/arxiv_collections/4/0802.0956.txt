The method of scaling transformations permitting to carry out the
reconstruction of cross sections of $\gamma N$ and $\gamma\gamma$ interactions
on the basis of cross sections of nucleon-(anti)nucleon interactions is
suggested. The photon--hadron scaling violation is a consequence of dependence
of scaling transformation parameter $\bar n(s)$ on the energy. The universal
function $\bar n(s)$ is interpreted as the multiplicity of photohadronization.
This function is established by processing the data on $\gamma p$ cross
sections in the low energy region $\sqrt{s}< 20 \GeV$ and is extrapolated to
the high energy region up to $\sqrt{s}\sim 200 \GeV$. The results of the
reconstruction of $\gamma N$ cross sections at high energies and of
$\gamma\gamma$ ones at all energies are in a remarkable agreement with
available experimental data.
