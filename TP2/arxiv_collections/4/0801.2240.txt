With the mechanism of pairwise scattering of photons between two atoms, we
propose a novel scheme to highly entangle the motional state between two
ultracold neutral atoms by a single photon scattering and detection. Under
certain conditions, it is shown that an arbitrary amount of entanglement can be
obtained with this scheme.
