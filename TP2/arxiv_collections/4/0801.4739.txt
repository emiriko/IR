We give a detailed study of axion-photon and photon-axion conversion
amplitudes, which enter the analysis of ``light shining through a wall''
experiments. Several different calculational methods are employed and compared,
and in all cases we retain a nonzero axion mass. To leading order, we find that
when the photon frequency $\omega$ is very close to the axion mass $m$, there
is a threshold cusp which significantly enhances the photon to axion conversion
amplitude, by a factor $\omega/\sqrt{\omega^2-m^2}$ relative to the
corresponding axion to photon conversion process. When $m=0$, the enhancement
factor reduces to unity and the results of previous calculations are recovered.
Our calculations include an exact wave matching analysis, which shows how
unitarity is maintained near threshold at $\omega=m$, and a discussion of the
case when the magnetic field extends into the ``wall'' region.
