We derive general expressions for non-energy weighted and energy-weighted
cluster sum rules for systems of three charged particles. The interferences
between pairs of particles are found to play a substantial role. The
energy-weighted sum rule is usually determined by the kinetic energy operator,
but we demonstrate that it has similar additional contributions from the
angular momentum and parity dependence of two- and three-body potentials
frequently used in three-body calculations. The importance of the different
contributions is illustrated with the dipole excitations in $^6$He. The results
are compared with the available experimental data.
