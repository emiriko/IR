We re-confirm, for the case of the unit p-ball of R^n, one of recent
conjectures of G.Kuperberg on centrally symmetric convex bodies.This conjecture
was very recently confirmrd for this particular case by D.A.Gutierrez using
polygamma functions and convexity theory.We present another proof using only
the basic properties of gamma function and mildly advanced classical analysis
tools.
