We prove a strong form of the equivalence of ensembles for the invariant
measures of zero range processes conditioned to a supercritical density of
particles. It is known that in this case there is a single site that
accomodates a macroscopically large number of the particles in the system. We
show that in the thermodynamic limit the rest of the sites have joint
distribution equal to the grand canonical measure at the critical density. This
improves the result of Gro\ss kinsky, Sch\"{u}tz and Spohn, where convergence
is obtained for the finite dimensional marginals. We obtain as corollaries
limit theorems for the order statistics of the components and for the
fluctuations of the bulk.
