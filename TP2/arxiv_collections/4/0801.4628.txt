Let $F$ be a smooth foliation on a closed Riemannian manifold $M$, and let
$\Lambda$ be a transverse invariant measure of $F$. Suppose that $\Lambda$ is
absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure on smooth
transversals. Then a topological definition of the $\Lambda$-Lefschetz number
of any leaf preserving diffeomorphism $(M,F)\to(M,F)$ is given. For this
purpose, standard results about smooth approximation and transversality are
extended to the case of foliation maps. It is asked whether this topological
$\Lambda$-Lefschetz number is equal to the analytic $\Lambda$-Lefschetz number
defined by Heitsch and Lazarov which would be a version of the Lefschetz trace
formula. Heitsch and Lazarov have shown such a trace formula when the fixed
point set is transverse to $F$.
