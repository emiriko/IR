We observe spin-valve-like effects in nano-scaled thermally evaporated
Co/AlOx/Au tunnel junctions. The tunneling magnetoresistance is anisotropic and
depends on the relative orientation of the magnetization direction of the Co
electrode with respect to the current direction. We attribute this effect to a
two-step magnetization reversal and an anisotropic density of states resulting
from spin-orbit interaction. The results of this study points to future
applications of novel spintronics devices involving only one ferromagnetic
layer.
