The electron transport through the parabolic quantum wire placed in
longitudinal magnetic field in the presence of the system of short-range
impurities inside the wire is investigated. Using approach based on the
zero-range potential theory we obtained an exact formula for the transmission
coefficient of the electron through the wire that allows to calculate such the
transport characteristics as the conductance and differential thermopower. The
dependencies of conductance and thermopower on the chemical potential and
magnetic field are investigated. The effect of elastic scattering due to
short-range impurities on low-temperature conductance and thermopower is
studied. It was shown that the character of the electron transport essentially
depends on the position of the every scattering center. The presence even
isolated impurity leads to destruction of conductance quantization. In some
cases it is possible that thermopower can change the sign in dependence on
chemical potential and magnetic field.
