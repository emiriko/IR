The Fermi-point scenario of emergent gravity has the following consequences:
gravity emerges together with fermionic and bosonic matter; emergent fermionic
matter consists of massless Weyl fermions; emergent bosonic matter consists of
gauge fields; Lorentz symmetry persists well above the Planck energy;
space-time is naturally 4-dimensional; Universe is naturally flat; cosmological
constant is naturally small or zero; underlying physics is based on discrete
symmetries; `quantum gravity' cannot be obtained by quantization of Einstein
equations; there is no contradiction between quantum mechanics and gravity;
etc.
