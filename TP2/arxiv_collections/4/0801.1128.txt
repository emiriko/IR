Determination of the orbital angular momentum of the proton is a difficult
but important part of understanding fundamental structure. Insight can be
gained from suitable models of the gluon asymmetry applied to the Jz = 1/2 sum
rule. We have constrained the models of the asymmetry to gain possible
scenarios for the angular momentum of the proton's constituents. Results and
phenomenology for determining Lz are presented.
