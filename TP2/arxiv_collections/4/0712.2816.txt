This paper has two agendas. Firstly, we exhibit new results for coverage
processes. Let $p(n,m,\alpha)$ be the probability that $n$ spherical caps of
angular radius $\alpha$ in $S^m$ do not cover the whole sphere $S^m$. We give
an exact formula for $p(n,m,\alpha)$ in the case $\alpha\in[\pi/2,\pi]$ and an
upper bound for $p(n,m,\alpha)$ in the case $\alpha\in [0,\pi/2]$ which tends
to $p(n,m,\pi/2)$ when $\alpha\to\pi/2$. In the case $\alpha\in[0,\pi/2]$ this
yields upper bounds for the expected number of spherical caps of radius
$\alpha$ that are needed to cover $S^m$. Secondly, we study the condition
number ${\mathscr{C}}(A)$ of the linear programming feasibility problem
$\exists x\in\mathbb{R}^{m+1}Ax\le0,x\ne0$ where
$A\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times(m+1)}$ is randomly chosen according to the standard
normal distribution. We exactly determine the distribution of
${\mathscr{C}}(A)$ conditioned to $A$ being feasible and provide an upper bound
on the distribution function in the infeasible case. Using these results, we
show that $\mathbf{E}(\ln{\mathscr{C}}(A))\le2\ln(m+1)+3.31$ for all $n>m$, the
sharpest bound for this expectancy as of today. Both agendas are related
through a result which translates between coverage and condition.
