Using a novel many-body approach, we report lattice dynamical properties of
UO2 and PuO2 and uncover various contributions to their thermal conductivities.
Via calculated Grueneisen constants, we show that only longitudinal acoustic
modes having large phonon group velocities are efficient heat carriers. Despite
the fact that some optical modes also show their velocities which are extremely
large, they do not participate in the heat transfer due to their unusual
anharmonicity. Ways to improve thermal conductivity in these materials are
discussed.
