We consider the NMR signal from a permeable medium with a heterogeneous
Larmor frequency component that varies on a scale comparable to the
spin-carrier diffusion length. We focus on the mesoscopic part of the
transverse relaxation, that occurs due to dispersion of precession phases of
spins accumulated during diffusive motion. By relating the spectral lineshape
to correlation functions of the spatially varying Larmor frequency, we
demonstrate how the correlation length and the variance of the Larmor frequency
distribution can be determined from the NMR spectrum. We corroborate our
results by numerical simulations, and apply them to quantify human blood
spectra.
