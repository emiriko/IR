We show that bipartite concurrence for rank-2 mixed states of qubits is
written by an observable which can be exactly and directly measurable in
experiment by local projective measurements, provided that four copies of the
composite quantum system are available. In addition, for a tripartite quantum
pure state of qubits, the 3-tangle is also shown to be measurable only by
projective measurements on the reduced density matrices of a pair of qubits
conditioned on four copies of the state.
