We consider the parity-violating two-pion-exchange potential obtained from
the covariant formalism in the past and the state-of-the-art effective field
theory approach. We discuss the behavior of the potential in coordinate space
and its application to the parity-violating asymmetry in $\vec{n} p \to d
\gamma$ at threshold.
