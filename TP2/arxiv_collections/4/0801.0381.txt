We present density-functional theory (DFT) and quantum Monte Carlo (QMC)
calculations designed to resolve experimental and theoretical controversies
over the optical properties of H-terminated C nanoparticles (diamondoids). The
QMC results follow the trends of well-converged plane-wave DFT calculations for
the size dependence of the optical gap, but they predict gaps that are 1-2 eV
higher. They confirm that quantum confinement effects disappear in diamondoids
larger than 1 nm, which have gaps below that of bulk diamond. Our QMC
calculations predict a small exciton binding energy and a negative electron
affinity (NEA) for diamondoids up to 1 nm, resulting from the delocalized
nature of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital. The NEA suggests a range of
possible applications of diamondoids as low-voltage electron emitters.
