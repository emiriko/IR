A proposed ground state for the Kagome Lattice Heisenberg Model (KLHM)
consists of a Valence Bond Crystal (VBC) with a 36-site unit cell. We calculate
the low-lying triplet and singlet excitations in the VBC phase for the
infinite-lattice model and for the 36-site cluster. For the infinite lattice,
the lowest triplet excitation is found to have a spin gap of approximately
$0.08 \pm 0.02 J$ and a bandwidth of only about $0.01 J$. For the 36-site
cluster, consisting of a single unit cell with periodic boundary conditions,
there are substantial finite-size effects: the spin gap there is estimated to
be approximately $0.2 J$, close to the exact diagonalization result of $0.164
J$. The triplet excitations attract one another and form many bound states in
the spin-singlet channel. We find a large number of such bound states for the
36-site cluster, many of which appear to lie below the spin gap, again in
agreement with the results from exact diagonalization.
