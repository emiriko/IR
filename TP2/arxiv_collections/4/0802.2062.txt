Based on analyzing various physical examples for 1/f noise we found that the
1/f noise is caused by generating conditions as resonance in acoustics and the
effect of matter carrier is secondary. All the physical reasons are summarized
into The surge of background energy, then the 1/f noise is separated from
matter carrier. Therefore the attention is focus on the general characters of
1/f noise and the following viewpoints and results are of universal
significance. The work about cause for 1/f Noise came to a universal
relationship.
  All the question about 1/f noise were solved completely and systematical.
Follow-up study indicates that the crux of 1/f noise is a special phase whose
entropy is very small.
