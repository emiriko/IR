We exploit the expression for the anomalous (chiral) effective action to
obtain the Hawking radiation from the GHS (stringy) blackhole falling in the
class of the most general spherically symmetric blackholes $(\sqrt{-g}\neq1)$,
using only covariant boundary condition at the event horizon. The connection
between the anomalous and the normal energy-momentum tensors is also
established from the effective action approach.
