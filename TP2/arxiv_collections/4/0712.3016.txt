Spin entanglement between two spatially separated electrons can be generated
in nonequilibrium interacting quantum dots, coherently coupled to a common
lead. In this system entangled two-electron states develop which are Werner
states with an imbalance between singlet and triplet probabilities. We propose
a multi-terminal, multiply-connected setup for the generation and detection of
this imbalance. In particular, we identify a regime in which the formation of
spin entanglement leads to a cancellation of Aharonov-Bohm oscillations.
