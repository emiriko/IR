Due to the incompatibility of the nonlinear realization of superconformal
symmetry and dilatation symmetry with the dilaton as the compensator field, in
the present paper it shows an alternative mechanism of spontaneous breaking the
N=2 superconformal symmetry to the N=0 case. By using the approach of nonlinear
transformations it is found that it leads to a space-filling brane theory with
Weyl scale W(1,3) symmetry. The dynamics of the resulting Weyl scale invariant
brane, along with that of other Nambu-Goldstone fields, is derived in terms of
the building blocks of the vierbein and the covariant derivative from the
Maurer-Cartan oneforms. A general coupling of the matter fields localized on
the brane world volume to these NG fields is also constructed.
