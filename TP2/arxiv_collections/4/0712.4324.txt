The absorption of electromagnetic radiation of an anisotropic quantum dot is
theoretically investigated taking into account the processes associated with
simultaneous scattering from ionized impurities. It is shown that the
scattering of electrons by impurities leads to the resonance absorption even if
we have only one impurity in the quantum dot. Explicit formula is derived for
the absorption coefficient. The positions of the resonances peaks are found.
The effects of external magnetic field on the resonance absorption are studied.
