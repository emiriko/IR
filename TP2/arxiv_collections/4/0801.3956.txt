Optimal set of 1050 rovibronic energy levels for 35 triplet electronic states
of $D_2$ has been obtained by means of a statistical analysis of all available
wavenumbers of triplet-triplet rovibronic transitions studied in emission,
absorption, laser and anticrossing spectroscopic experiments of various
authors. We used a new method of the analysis (Lavrov, Ryazanov, JETP Letters,
2005), which does not need any \it a priory \rm assumptions concerning the
molecular structure being based on only two fundamental principles:
Rydberg-Ritz and maximum likelihood. The method provides the opportunity to
obtain the RMS estimates for uncertainties of the experimental wavenumbers
independent from those presented in original papers. 234 from 3822 published
wavenumber values were found to be spurious, while the remaining set of the
data may be divided into 20 subsets (samples) of uniformly precise data having
close to normal distributions of random errors within the samples. New
experimental wavenumber values of 125 questionable lines were obtained in the
present work. Optimal values of the rovibronic levels were obtained from the
experimental data set consisting of 3713 wavenumber values (3588 old and 125
new). The unknown shift between levels of ortho- and para- deuterium was found
by least squares analysis of the $a^3\Sigma_g^+$, $v = 0$, $N = 0 \div 18$
rovibronic levels with odd and even values of $N$. All the energy levels were
obtained relative to the lowest vibro-rotational level ($v = 0$, $N = 0$) of
the $a^3\Sigma_g^+$ electronic state, and presented in tabular form together
with the standard deviations of the empirical determination. New energy level
values differ significantly from those available in literature.
