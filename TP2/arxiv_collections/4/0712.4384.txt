We analyze available experimental data on the total and differential
charged-current cross sections for quasielastic neutrino and antineutrino
scattering off nucleons, measured with a variety of nuclear targets in the
accelerator experiments at ANL, BNL, FNAL, CERN, and IHEP, dating from the end
of sixties to the present day. The data are used to adjust the poorly known
value of the axial-vector mass of the nucleon.
