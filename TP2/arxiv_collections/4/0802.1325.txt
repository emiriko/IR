In this short communication, a new type of two-channel cavity QED model is
derived. Two-channel models are important for they often lead to quantum
interference phenomena. The previous models relied on the use of two or more
modes of the quantized electromagnetic field, partially because of energy and
parity restrictions. As it is shown in this work, such restrictions may be
overcome with the use of properly chosen configurations of atomic levels and
the aplication of classical external fields. Competing one- and two-photon
processes involving one single mode may be obtained.
