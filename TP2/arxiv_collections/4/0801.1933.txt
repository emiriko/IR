The path integral formulation in quantum mechanics corresponds to the first
quantization since it is just to rewrite the quantum mechanical amplitude into
many dimensional integrations over discretized coordinates $x_n$. However, the
path integral expression cannot be connected to the dynamics of classical
mechanics, even though, superficially, there is some similarity between them.
Further, the field theory path integral in terms of many dimensional
integrations over fields does not correspond to the field quantization. We
clarify the essential difference between Feynman's original formulation of path
integral in QED and the modern version of the path integral method prevailing
in lattice field theory calculations, and show that the former can make a
correct second quantization while the latter cannot quantize fields at all and
its physical meaning is unknown.
