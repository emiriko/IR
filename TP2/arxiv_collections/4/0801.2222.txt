We present a first principle study of new class of high-$T_c$ half-heusler
ferromagnets NiCrZ (Z = Si, P, Ge, As, Te). The structure and magnetic
properties are investigated through the calculation of the electronic
structure, equilibrium lattice constant, magnetic exchange interaction $J_{ij}$
and Curie temperature $T_c$. The role of $sp$-elements and the influence of
lattice expansion/compression are also studied. In alloys having 20 valence
electrons, a pseudo-gap of the majority band can be formed at Fermi level.
Otherwise, the half-metallicity and ferromagnetism at temperatures much higher
than room temperature are found to be stable in a wide range of lattice
expansion. Based on these results, NiCrZ can be expected to be promising
materials for spintronics.
