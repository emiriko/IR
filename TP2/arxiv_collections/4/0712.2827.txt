We present data for the dielectric relaxation of 43 glass-forming organic
liquids, showing that the primary (alpha) relaxation is often close to
square-root-time relaxation. The better an inverse power-law description of the
high-frequency loss applies, the more accurately is square-root-time relaxation
obeyed. These findings suggest that square-root-time relaxation is generic to
the alpha process, once a common view, but since long believed to be incorrect.
Only liquids with very large dielectric losses deviate from this picture by
having consistently narrower loss peaks. As a further challenge to the
prevailing opinion, we find that liquids with accurate square-root-time
relaxation cover a wide range of fragilities.
