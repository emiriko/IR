Exclusive $\pi^o$ electroproduction and related processes are suggested to
investigate the chiral odd transversity distributions of quarks in the
transversely polarized nucleon, $h_1(x)$, and its first moment, the tensor
charge. The connection between a description based on partonic degrees of
freedom, given in terms of generalized parton distributions, and Regge
phenomenology is explored.
