Faster-than-light communication is possible via quantum entanglement in an
EPR experiment if one can overcome nature's "quantum modesty" and gain
knowledge concerning the quantum state of a single photon. Using a special EPR
source that produces precisely timed doublets of EPR photons (biphotons), I
show how one can gain additional information about the photon's polarization
state--information not accessible using the conventional one-photon-at-a-time
EPR setup. Using the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect that describes how two identical
photons combine at a neutral beamsplitter (NBS), I show how Bob can obtain
enough polarization information about his B photons to unambiguously ascertain
the polarization basis of Alice's distant measurement device which she has
deployed to measure her A photons. I am proposing, in short, that EPR + HOM =
FTL. Version 2 concludes with a refutation of its FTL claim due to Lev Vaidman.
