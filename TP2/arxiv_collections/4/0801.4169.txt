In this paper we present an improved lattice Boltzmann model for compressible
Navier-Stokes system with high Mach number. The model is composed of three
components: (i) the discrete-velocity-model by Watari and Tsutahara [Phys Rev E
\textbf{67},036306(2003)], (ii) a modified Lax-Wendroff finite difference
scheme where reasonable dissipation and dispersion are naturally included,
(iii) artificial viscosity. The improved model is convenient to compromise the
high accuracy and stability. The included dispersion term can effectively
reduce the numerical oscillation at discontinuity. The added artificial
viscosity helps the scheme to satisfy the von Neumann stability condition.
Shock tubes and shock reflections are used to validate the new scheme. In our
numerical tests the Mach numbers are successfully increased up to 20 or higher.
The flexibility of the new model makes it suitable for tracking shock waves
with high accuracy and for investigating nonlinear nonequilibrium complex
systems.
