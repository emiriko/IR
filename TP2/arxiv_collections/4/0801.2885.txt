Apply the T-duality and smeared twist to the D3-brane solution one can
construct the supergravity backgrounds which may dual to supersymmetric or
non-supersymmetric non-commutative dipole field theory. We introduce D7-brane
probe into the dual supergravity background to study the chiral dynamics and
meson spectrum therein. We first find that the non-commutative dipole field
does not induce the chiral symmetry breaking even if the supersymmetry was
completely broken, contrast to the conventional believing that the chiral
symmetry will be broken in the non-supersymmetric theory. Next, we find that
the dipole field does not modify the meson spectrum in the supersymmetric
theory while it will reduce the meson bound-state energy in the
non-supersymmetric theory. We also evaluate the static quark anti-quark
potential and see that the dipole field has an effect to produce attractive
force between the quark and anti-quark.
