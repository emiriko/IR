We present a new truncation scheme for the Schwinger-Dyson equations of QCD
that respects gauge invariance at any level of the dressed loop expansion. When
applied to the gluon self-energy, it allows for its non-perturbative treatment
without compromising the transversality of the solution, even when entire sets
of diagrams (most notably the ghost loops) are omitted, or treated
perturbatively.
