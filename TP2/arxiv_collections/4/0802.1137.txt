We provide a simple example of dilaton stabilization in the framework of
heterotic string theory. It requires a gaugino condensate and an up-lifting
sector similar to the one postulated in type IIB string theory. Its signature
is a hybrid mediation of supersymmetry breakdown with a variant of a mirage
pattern for the soft breaking terms. The set-up is suited for the discussion of
heterotic MSSM candidates.
