The aging behavior is investigated for thin films of atactic polystyrene
through measurements of complex electric capacitance. During isothermal aging
process the real part of the electric capacitance increases with aging time,
while the imaginary part decreases with aging time. This result suggests that
the aging time dependence of the real and imaginary parts are mainly associated
with change in thickness and dielectric permittivity, respectively. In thin
films, the thickness depends on thermal history of aging even above the glass
transition. Memory and `rejuvenation' effects are also observed in the thin
films.
