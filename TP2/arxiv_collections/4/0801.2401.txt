We study mesons in N=4 super Yang-Mills theory with fundamental flavors added
at large 't Hooft coupling using the gauge/gravity correspondence. High-spin
mesons are well described by using semiclassical string configurations. We
determine the meson spectrum at finite temperature and in a background magnetic
field.
