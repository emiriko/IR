We analyze the electromagnetic scattering of massive particles with and
without spin wherein one particle (or both) is electrically neutral. Using the
techniques of effective field theory, we isolate the leading long distance
effects, both classical and quantum mechanical. For spinless systems results
are identical to those obtained earlier via more elaborate dispersive methods.
However, we also find new results if either or both particles carry apin.
