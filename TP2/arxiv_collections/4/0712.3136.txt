This paper presents analogous results for stochastic fast-diffusion
equations. Since the fast-diffusion equation possesses weaker dissipativity
than the porous medium one does, some technical difficulties appear in the
study. As a compensation to the weaker dissipativity condition, a Sobolev-Nash
inequality is assumed for the underlying self-adjoint operator in applications.
Some concrete examples are constructed to illustrate the main results.
