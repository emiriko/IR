We demonstrate an organic memory-transistor device based on a pentacene-gold
nanoparticles active layer. Gold (Au) nanoparticles are immobilized on the gate
dielectric (silicon dioxide) of a pentacene transistor by an amino-terminated
self-assembled monolayer. Under the application of writing and erasing pulses
on the gate, large threshold voltage shift (22 V) and on/off drain current
ratio of ~3E4 are obtained. The hole field-effect mobility of the transistor is
similar in the on and off states (less than a factor 2). Charge retention times
up to 4500 s are observed. The memory effect is mainly attributed to the Au
nanoparticles.
