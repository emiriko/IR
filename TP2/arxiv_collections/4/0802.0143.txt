We make use of the first-quantized wave-packet formulation of the full
counting statistics to describe charge transport of noninteracting electrons in
a mesoscopic device. We derive various expressions for the characteristic
function generating the full counting statistics, accounting for both energy
and time dependence in the scattering process and including exchange effects
due to finite overlap of the incoming wave packets. We apply our results to
describe the generic statistical properties of a two-fermion scattering event
and find, among other features, sub-binomial statistics for nonentangled
incoming states (Slater rank 1), while entangled states (Slater rank 2) may
generate super-binomial (and even super-Poissonian) noise, a feature that can
be used as a spin singlet-triplet detector. Another application is concerned
with the constant-voltage case, where we generalize the original result of
Levitov-Lesovik to account for energy-dependent scattering and finite
measurement time, including short time measurements, where Pauli blocking
becomes important.
