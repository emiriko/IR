We expand the triaxial projected shell model basis to include
triaxially-deformed multi-quasiparticle states. This allows us to study the
yrast and gamma-vibrational bands up to high spins for both gamma-soft and
well-deformed nuclei. As the first application, a systematic study of the
high-spin states in Er-isotopes is performed. The calculated yrast and
gamma-bands are compared with the known experimental data, and it is shown that
the agreement between theory and experiment is quite satisfactory. The
calculation leads to predictions for bands based on one- and two-gamma phonon
where current data are still sparse. It is observed that gamma-bands for
neutron-deficient isotopes of 156Er and 158Er are close to the yrast band, and
further these bands are predicted to be nearly degenerate for high-spin states.
