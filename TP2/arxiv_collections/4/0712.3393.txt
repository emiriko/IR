Temperature, pressure, and magnetic field dependencies of the resistivity of
BaVS$_3$ were measured above the critical pressure of $p_{cr}$=2 GPa, which is
associated with the zero temperature insulator-to-metal (MI) transition. The
resistivity exhibits the $T^n$ temperature dependence below $T_g\approx$15 K,
with $n$ of 1.5 at $p_{cr}$, which increases continuously with pressure towards
2. This is interpreted as a crossover from non-Fermi (NFL) to Fermi-liquid (FL)
behavior. Although the spin configuration of the $e_g$ electrons influences the
charge propagation, the NFL behavior is attributed to the pseudogap that
appears in the single particle spectrum of the $d_z^2$ electrons related to
large quasi-one dimensional (Q-1d) 2$k_F$-CDW fluctuations. The non-monotonic
magnetic field dependence of $\Delta$$\rho$/$\rho$ reveals a characteristic
field $B_0\approx$12 T attributed to the full suppression of the pseudogap.
