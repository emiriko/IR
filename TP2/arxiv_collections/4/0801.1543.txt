We present an analytical device model for a field-effect transistor based on
a heterostructure which consists of an array of nanoribbons clad between the
highly conducting substrate (the back gate) and the top gate controlling the
source-drain current. The equations of the model of a graphene nanoribbon
field-effect transistor (GNR-FET) include the Poisson equation in the weak
nonlocality approximation. Using this model, we find explicit analytical
formulas for the spatial distributions of the electric potential along the
channel and for the GNR-FET current-voltage characteristics (the dependences of
the source-drain current on the drain voltages as well as on the back gate and
top gate voltages) for different geometric parameters of the device. It is
shown that the shortening of the top gate can result in a substantial
modification of the GNR-FET current-voltage characteristics.
