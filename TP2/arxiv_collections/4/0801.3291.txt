Classification of complex wave functions of infinite variables is an
important problem since it is related to the classification of possible quantum
states of matter. In this paper, we propose a way to classify symmetric
polynomials of infinite variables using the pattern of zeros of the
polynomials. Such a classification leads to a construction of a class of simple
non-Abelian quantum Hall states which are closely related to parafermion
conformal field theories.
