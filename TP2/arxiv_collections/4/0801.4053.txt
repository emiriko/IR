Two avowable quantum communication schemes are proposed.
  One is an avowable teleportation protocol based on the quantum cryptography.
In this protocol one teleports a set of one-particle states based on the
availability of an honest arbitrator, the keys and the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen
pairs shared by the communication parties and the arbitrator. The key point is
that the fact of the teleportation can neither be disavowed by the sender nor
be denied by the receiver. Another is an avowable quantum secure direct
communication scheme. A one-way Hash function chosen by the communication
parties helps the receiver to validate the truth of the information and to
avoid disavowing for the sender.
