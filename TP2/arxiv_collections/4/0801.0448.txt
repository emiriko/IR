It is shown that Einstein field equations give two solutions for cosmology.
The first one is the standard well known representative of the present status
of cosmology. We identify it with the local point of view of a flat Universe
with the values for the cosmological omega parameters (k = 0, lambda = 2/3, m =
1/3). The second one is a new one that we identify with a cosmic point of view,
as given by free photons, neutrinos, tachyons and gravity quanta. We apply a
wave to particle technique to find the matter propagation equation. Then we
prove that all gravitational radii are constant, regardless of the possible
time variations of the physical properties like the speed of light c, the
gravitational constant G or the mass m of fundamental particles. We find two
cosmological constants, c^3 /G and mc, with the condition that the field
equations be derived from the action principle. With this result, and the
integration of the Bianchi identity, we prove the existence of the two
solutions for cosmology. We then validate Weinberg relation and prove that the
speed of light c is proportional to the Hubble parameter H, a cosmological
view. Thus, the cosmic observer (free photons and the like) are found to see
accelerated photons with a numerical value that has been observed as an
anomalous acceleration of the Pioneer 10/11 spacecrafts. An initial inflation
is present which converts the Planck size into the present size of the Universe
in about 140 initial tic-tac.
