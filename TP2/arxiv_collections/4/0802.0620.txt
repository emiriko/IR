The formalism of nonequilibrium perturbation theory was constructed by
Schwinger and Keldysh and then was developed with the diagrammatical technique
by Lifshitz and Pitaevskii. Until now there has been widespread application to
various researches in physics, condensed matter, plasmas, atoms and molecules,
nuclear matter etc.. In spite of this, the formalism has not been established
as perturbation theory. For example, there is no perturbative method to derive
arbitrary self-energy properly. In addition, the connection with other
formalism, e.g., the Matsubara imaginary-time perturbative formalism is
uncertain. Although there must be the relationship between self-energies in the
perturbative formalism, such basic problems remain to be solved. The solution
is given by the present work. The real-time perturbative expansion is performed
on the basis of the adiabatic theorem. As the results, the requirements of
self-energies as functions in time are demonstrated and the formulated
self-energies meet the known relations. Besides, it gives exact agreement with
functions derived by perturbative expansion in imaginary-time and analytical
continuity. As a consequence, it implies that the present formalism can be
generalized.
