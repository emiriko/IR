We revisit inflationary cosmology of axion models in the light of recent
developments on the inflaton decay in supergravity. We find that all the
cosmological difficulties, including gravitino, axino overproduction and
axionic isocurvature fluctuation, can be avoided if the saxion field has large
initial amplitude during inflation and decays before big-bang nucleosynthesis.
