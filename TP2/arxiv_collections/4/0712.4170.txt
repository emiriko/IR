The miniaturization process of various sensing devices has become a reality
by enormous research and advancements accomplished in Micro Electro-Mechanical
Systems (MEMS) and Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) lithography. Regardless
of such extensive efforts in optimizing the hardware, algorithm, and protocols
for networking, there still remains a lot of scope to explore how these
innovations can all be tied together to design Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN)
for smartening the surrounding environment for some practical purposes. In this
paper we explore the prospects of wireless sensor networks and propose a design
level framework for developing a smart environment using WSNs, which could be
beneficial for a developing country like Bangladesh. In connection to this, we
also discuss the major aspects of wireless sensor networks.
