Proposed is system of consistent mathematical models describing physical laws
of a system of energy emitting bodies in dynamics, relativity and nuclear
physics. It is shown the use of developed models for the description of
systems, consisting of stable as well as of radioactive bodies and permitting
to improve the quality of predicting the binding energy of light stable
nuclides using modified semi-empirical equation. Experimental verification of
proposed approach with respect to some nuclei of the Periodic Table elements in
the first approximation confirms its validity.
