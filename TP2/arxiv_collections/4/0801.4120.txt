We study theoretically the electronic structure, transport and optical
properties for a zigzag single-wall carbon nanotube connected to two normal
conductor leads under the irradiation of an external electromagnetic field at
low temperatures, with particular emphasis on the features of high-frequency
response. Using the standard nonequilibrium Green's function techniques, we
examine the time-averaged density of states, the conductivity, the dielectric
function and the electron energy loss spectra for the system with photon
polarization parallel with the tunneling current direction, respectively.
Through some numerical examples, it is shown that the density of states is
strongly dependent on the incident electron energy, the strength and frequency
of the applied field. For higher electron energies in comparison with
lead-nanotube coupling energy, the system conductance decreases with increasing
the field strength and increases with increasing the field frequency
respectively, and shows some oscillation structures. Moreover, the optical
functions for the system have also a rich structure with the variation of field
frequency. It may demonstrate that this transport dependence on the external
field parameters can be used to give the energy spectra information of carbon
nanotubes and to detect the high-frequency microwave irradiation.
