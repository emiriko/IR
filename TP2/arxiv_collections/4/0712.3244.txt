In this communication we present a first principle study of
Pr$_{1-x}$Sr$_{x}$MnO$_3$ with $x = 0.25$. While the parent compounds of this
system are antiferromagnetic insulators with different structural and magnetic
ground states, the $x = 0.25$ is in the colossal magnetoresistance regime of
the Pr$_{1-x}$Sr$_{x}$MnO$_3$ phase diagram [C. Martin, A. Maignan, M. Hervieu,
B. Raveau, Phys. Rev. B 60 (1999) 12191]. Our band structure calculations for
the end-point compounds matches well with the existing theoretical and
experimental results [C. Martin, A. Maignan, M. Hervieu, B. Raveau, Phys. Rev.
B 60 (1999) 12191; Rune Sondena, P. Ravindran, Svein Stolen, Tor Grande,
Michael Hanfland, Phys. Rev. B 74 (2006) 144102]. Interestingly, our
calculations show that the Pr$_{0.75}$Sr$_{0.25}$MnO$_3$ has a half-metallic
character with a huge band gap of 2.8 eV in the minority band. We believe this
result would fuel further interest in some of these special compositions of
colossal magnetoresistive manganites as they could be potential candidates for
spintronic devices. We discuss the half-metallicity of the
Pr$_{0.75}$Sr$_{0.25}$MnO$_3$ in the light of changes in the orbital
hybridization as a result of Sr doping in PrMnO$_3$. Further, we highlight the
importance of half-metallicity for a consolidated understanding of colossal
magnetoresistance effect.
