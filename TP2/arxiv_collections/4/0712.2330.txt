Using reflection positivity techniques we prove the existence of minimizers
for a class of mesoscopic free-energies representing 1D systems with competing
interactions. All minimizers are either periodic, with zero average, or of
constant sign. If the local term in the free energy satisfies a convexity
condition, then all minimizers are either periodic or constant. Examples of
both phenomena are given. This extends our previous work where such results
were proved for the ground states of lattice systems with ferromagnetic nearest
neighbor interactions and dipolar type antiferromagnetic long range
interactions.
