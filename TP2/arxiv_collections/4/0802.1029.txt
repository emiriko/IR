We describe the data acquisition system for the MuLan muon lifetime
experiment at Paul Scherrer Institute. The system was designed to record muon
decays at rates up to 1 MHz and acquire data at rates up to 60 MB/sec. The
system employed a parallel network of dual-processor machines and repeating
acquisition cycles of deadtime-free time segments in order to reach the design
goals. The system incorporated a versatile scheme for control and diagnostics
and a custom web interface for monitoring experimental conditions.
