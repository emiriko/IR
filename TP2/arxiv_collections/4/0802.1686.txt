We present the results of a novel model-independent fit to elastic
proton-proton differential cross section data at $\sqrt s$ = 52.8 GeV. Taking
into account the error propagation from the fit parameters, we determine the
scattering amplitude in the impact parameter space (the proton profile
function) and its statistical uncertainty region. We show that both the real
and imaginary parts of the profile are consistent with two dynamical
contributions, one from a central dense region, up to roughly 1 fm and another
from a peripheral evanescent region from 1 to 3 fm.
