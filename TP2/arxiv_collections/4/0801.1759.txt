Living communities can be considered as complex systems, thus a fertile
ground for studies related to their statistics and dynamics. In this study we
revisit the case of the rhythmic applause by utilizing the model proposed by
V\'azquez et al. [A. V\'azquez et al., Phys. Rev. E 73, 036127 (2006)]
augmented with two contradicted {\it driving forces}, namely: {\it
Individuality} and {\it Companionship}. To that extend, after performing
computer simulations with a large number of oscillators we propose an
explanation on the following open questions (a) why synchronization occurs
suddenly, and b) why synchronization is observed when the clapping period
($T_c$) is $1.5 \cdot T_s < T_c < 2.0 \cdot T_s$ ($T_s$ is the mean self period
of the spectators) and is lost after a time. Moreover, based on the model, a
weak preferential attachment principle is proposed which can produce complex
networks obeying power law in the distribution of number edges per node with
exponent greater than 3.
