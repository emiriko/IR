To each oriented closed combinatorial manifold we assign the set (with
repetitions) of isomorphism classes of links of its vertices. The obtained
transformation L is the main object of study of the present paper. We pose a
problem on the inversion of the transformation L. We shall show that this
problem is closely related to N.Steenrod's problem on realization of cycles and
to the Rokhlin-Schwartz-Thom construction of combinatorial Pontryagin classes.
It is easy to obtain a condition of balancing that is a necessary condition for
a set of isomorphism classes of combinatorial spheres to belong to the image of
the transformation L. In the present paper we give an explicit construction
providing that each balanced set of isomorphism classes of combinatorial
spheres gets into the image of L after passing to a multiple set and adding
several pairs of the form (Z,-Z), where -Z is the sphere Z with the orientation
reversed. This construction enables us, for a given singular simplicial cycle
of a space R, to construct explicitly a combinatorial manifold M and a mapping
$\phi:M\to R$ such that $\phi_*[M]=r[\xi]$ for some positive integer r. The
construction is based on resolving singularities of the cycle $\xi$. We give
applications of our main construction to cobordisms of manifolds with
singularities and cobordisms of simple cells. In particular, we prove that
every rational additive invariant of cobordisms of manifolds with singularities
admits a local formula. Another application is the construction of explicit
(though inefficient) local combinatorial formulae for polynomials in the
rational Pontryagin classes of combinatorial manifolds.
