Adiabatic quantum algorithms are often most easily formulated using many-body
interactions. However, experimentally available interactions are generally
two-body. In 2004, Kempe, Kitaev, and Regev introduced perturbative gadgets, by
which arbitrary three-body effective interactions can be obtained using
Hamiltonians consisting only of two-body interactions. These three-body
effective interactions arise from the third order in perturbation theory. Since
their introduction, perturbative gadgets have become a standard tool in the
theory of quantum computation. Here we construct generalized gadgets so that
one can directly obtain arbitrary k-body effective interactions from two-body
Hamiltonians. These effective interactions arise from the kth order in
perturbation theory.
