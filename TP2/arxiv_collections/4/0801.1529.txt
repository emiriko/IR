Cross-section and analyzing power data from 197 MeV $(p,p')$ scattering and
longitudinal and transverse form factors for electron scattering to low lying
states in $^{10}$B have been analyzed as tests of the structure of the nuclear
states when they are described using a no-core $(0+2)\hbar\omega$ shell model.
While the results obtained from the shell model clearly show the need of other
elements, three-body forces in particular, to explain the observed spectrum,
the reasonable level of agreement obtained in the analyses of the scattering
data suggest that the wavefunctions from our shell model using only a two-body
potential are credible. Any changes to the wavefunctions with the introduction
of three-body forces in the shell model Hamiltonian should therefore be
relatively minor.
