For a car manufacturer, reducing the weight of vehicles is an obvious aim.
Replacing steel by aluminium moves towards that goal. Unfortunately,
aluminium's stamping numerical simulation results are not yet as reliable as
those of steel. Punch-strength and spring-back phenomena are not correctly
described. This study on aluminium validates the behaviour law Hill 48
quadratic yield criterion with both isotropic and kinematic hardening. It is
based on the yield surface and on associated experimental tests (uniaxial test,
plane tensile test, plane compression and tensile shearing).
