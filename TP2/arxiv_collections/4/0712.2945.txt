Numerical simulations are performed for a rotating two-species Bose
condensate confined by a harmonic potential. The particle numbers of each
species are unequal. When the rotational speed exceeds a critical value, the
majority species reside in the center of the potential while the minority
species is pushed out to the outskirts, forming a giant vortex hole to contain
the majority species. A novel annular Skyrmion forms at the interface of the
two species.
