We introduce a natural equivalence relation on the space $\sH_0$ of
horofunctions of a word hyperbolic group that take the value 0 at the identity.
We show that there are only finitely many ergodic measures that are invariant
under this relation. This can be viewed as a discrete analog of the
Bowen-Marcus theorem. Furthermore, if $\eta$ is such a measure and $G$ acts on
a space $(X,\mu)$ by p.m.p. transformations then $\eta \times \mu$ is virtually
ergodic with respect to a natural equivalence relation on $\sH_0\times X$. This
is comparable to a special case of the Howe-Moore theorem. These results are
applied to prove a new ergodic theorem for spherical averages in the case of a
word hyperbolic group acting on a finite space.
