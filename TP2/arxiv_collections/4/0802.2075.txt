We study the combined effects of both strong and electroweak dimension six
effective operators on flavour changing top quark physics at the LHC. Analytic
expressions for the cross sections and decay widths of several flavour changing
processes will be presented, as well as an analysis of the feasibility of their
observation at the LHC.
