The broadband ferromagnetic resonance measurement using the rectifying effect
of Ni81Fe19 wire has been investigated. One wire is deposited on the center
strip line of the coplanar waveguide (CPW) and the other one deposited between
two strip lines of CPW. The method is based on the detection of the
magnetoresistance oscillation due to the magnetization dynamics induced by the
radio frequency field. The magnetic field dependences of the resonance
frequency and the rectification spectrum are presented and analytically
interpreted on the standpoint of a uniform magnetization precession model.
