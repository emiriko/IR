Fermionic atoms in 2D optical lattices and electrons in HTc cuprates may both
be described by the Hubbard model. However, if Coulomb frustration is
responsible for the striped phases in 2D cuprates the phase diagrams will
differ markedly. Two representative scenarios are described by a simple stripe
model without phase separation and a mean field model with phase separation in
the absence of Coulomb frustration. When Coulomb frustrated both models display
antiferromagnetism (AF) and stripe phases with d-wave superfluidity, whereas
neutral atoms in optical lattices will only do so in the stripe model. Radii
and densities of the various phases in harmonically confined optical lattices
are calculated for the two models and have very different Mott plateaus and
density discontinuities. We discuss observation of antiferromagnetic, stripe
and superfluid phases in density and momentum distributions and correlations
from time-of-flight experiments.
