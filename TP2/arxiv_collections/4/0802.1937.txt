We investigate the effects of scalar and vector unparticles on top quark spin
correlations via the process $e^{+}e^{-}\to t \bar{t}$. In addition to the
Standard Model diagrams, there is a new contribution to top-antitop quark
production process mediated by unparticle in the s-channel. It is shown that
scalar and vector unparticle contribution leads to a considerable deviation of
the top spin correlations from the Standard Model one.
