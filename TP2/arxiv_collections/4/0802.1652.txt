We compute the Frobenius trace functions of mirabolic character sheaves
defined over a finite field. The answer is given in terms of the character
values of general linear groups over the finite field, and the structure
constants of multiplication in the mirabolic Hall-Littlewood basis of symmetric
functions, introduced by Shoji.
