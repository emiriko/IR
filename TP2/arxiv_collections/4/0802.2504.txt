The interpretation of quantum mechanics is an area of increasing interest to
many working physicists. In particular, interest has come from those involved
in quantum computing and information theory, as there has always been a strong
foundational element in this field. This paper introduces one interpretation of
quantum mechanics, a modern `many-worlds' theory, from the perspective of
quantum computation. Reasons for seeking to interpret quantum mechanics are
discussed, then the specific `neo-Everettian' theory is introduced and its
claim as the best available interpretation defended. The main objections to the
interpretation, including the so-called ``problem of probability'' are shown to
fail. The local nature of the interpretation is demonstrated, and the
implications of this both for the interpretation and for quantum mechanics more
generally are discussed. Finally, the consequences of the theory for quantum
computation are investigated, and common objections to using many worlds to
describe quantum computing are answered. We find that using this particular
many-worlds theory as a physical foundation for quantum computation gives
several distinct advantages over other interpretations, and over not
interpreting quantum theory at all.
