The comparison between parameterisations of the perturbation results for the
decay width of the Standard Model Higgs boson to \bar{b}b-quarks pairs, based
on application of \bar{MS}-scheme running quark mass and pole b-quark mass, are
presented. In the case of the latter parameterisation taking into account of
order O(\alpha_s^3) term is rather important. It is minimising deviations of
the results obtained at the O(\alpha_s^2) level from the results, which follow
from the running quark mass approach
