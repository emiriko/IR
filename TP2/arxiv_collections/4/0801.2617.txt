The effects of planar hole content, p (= x), on the static magnetic
susceptibility, chi(T), of polycrystalline La2-xSrxCu1-yZnyO4 compounds were
investigated over a wide range of Sr (x) and Zn (y) contents. The magnetic
behavior caused by Zn was found to depend strongly on the hole content. The
apparent magnetic moment induced by Zn was larger in underdoped
La2-xSrxCu1-yZnyO4, decreased quite sharply around p ~ 0.19, and did not change
much for further overdoping. This is interpreted in terms of the effect of the
pseudogap on the Zn-induced magnetic behavior, as there is growing evidence
that the pseudogap vanishes quite abruptly at p ~ 0.19 +/- 0.01. From a
detailed analysis of chi(T) data the Zn-induced magnetic contribution was found
to be rather complex and showed non-Curie-like features over a wide range of
temperature. The observed behavior was scrutinized in terms of two scenarios
(a) that of independent localized-moments and (b) low energy quasiparticle
resonances associated with each Zn atom. Our study points towards the latter
scenario and more generally suggests that there is a re-distribution of
quasiparticle spectral weight due to Zn substitution, the features of which are
greatly influenced by the presence and magnitude of the pseudogap.
