Helical spin textures in a $^{87}$Rb F=1 spinor Bose-Einstein condensate are
found to decay spontaneously toward a spatially modulated structure of spin
domains. This evolution is ascribed to magnetic dipolar interactions that
energetically favor the short-wavelength domains over the long-wavelength spin
helix. This is confirmed by eliminating the dipolar interactions by a sequence
of rf pulses and observing a suppression of the formation of the short-range
domains. This study confirms the significance of magnetic dipole interactions
in degenerate $^{87}$Rb F=1 spinor gases.
