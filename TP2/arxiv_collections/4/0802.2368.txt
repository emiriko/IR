We present in this talk recent results of the vector and axial-vector
transitions of the nucleon to the pentaquark baryon Theta^{+}, based on the
SU(3) chiral quark-soliton model. The results are summarized as follows:
K^{*}-N-Theta vector and tensor coupling constants turn out to be g_{K^{*}N
Theta} = 0.81 and f_{K^{*}N Theta}=0.84, respectively, and the KN Theta
axial-vector coupling constant to be g_{A}^* = 0.05. As a result, the total
decay width for Theta^+ to NK becomes very small: Gamma_{Theta -> NK} = 0.71
MeV, which is consistent with the DIANA result Gamma_{Theta -> NK}=0.36 +- 0.11
MeV.
