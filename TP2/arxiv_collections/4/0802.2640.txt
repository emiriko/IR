Basing on Ginzburg-Landau approach we generalize the Kittel theory and derive
the interpolation formula for the temperature evolution of a multi-domain
polarization profile P(x,z). We resolve the long-standing problem of the
near-surface polarization behavior in ferroelectric domains and demonstrate the
polarization vanishing instead of usually assumed fractal domain branching. We
propose an effective scaling approach to compare the properties of different
domain-containing ferroelectric plates and films.
