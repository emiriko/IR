The ALICE experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) will allow the
study of resonance production in nucleus-nucleus and proton-proton collisions.
This paper presents results based on physics performance studies to discuss
prospects in ALICE for $\phi$(1020) meson production in pp interactions during
the LHC startup.
