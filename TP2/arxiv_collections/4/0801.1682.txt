In this work we have shown bulk superconductivity and studied the anisotropy
in both the normal and superconducting states in quasi-1D conductor Nb2Se3.
Electron - electron Umklapp scattering dominates electronic transport along the
direction of Nb metal chains as well as perpendicular to it. The
superconducting state is rather anisotropic with possible multi - band
features.
