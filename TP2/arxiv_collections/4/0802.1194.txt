The dynamics of the electron loss to the continuum (ELC) from the light
neutral projectile positronium (Ps) atom in collision with the He atom is
studied in the framework of the post collisional Coulomb Distorted Eikonal
Approximation (CDEA). Both the fully differential (TDCS) and the double
differential (DDCS) cross sections are investigated in the intermediate and
high incident energies. Results are compared with the existing experiment and
other theories, where possible.
