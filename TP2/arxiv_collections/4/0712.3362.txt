A new method to amplify the photon-axion conversions in magnetic field is
proposed using a buffer gas at a specific pressure. As a first result, new
bounds for mass and coupling constant for purely laboratory experiments aiming
to detect any hypothetical scalars and pseudo-scalars which can couple to
photons were obtained at 95% confidence level, excluding the PVLAS result newly
disclaimed.
