Most methods for modelling dynamics posit just two time scales: a fast and a
slow scale. But many applications, including many in continuum mechanics,
possess a wide variety of space-time scales; often they possess a continuum of
space-time scales. I discuss an approach to modelling the discretised dynamics
of advection and diffusion with rigorous support for changing the resolved
spatial grid scale by just a factor of two. The mapping of dynamics from a
finer grid to a coarser grid is then iterated to generate a hierarchy of models
across a wide range of space-time scales, all with rigorous support across the
whole hierarchy. This approach empowers us with great flexibility in modelling
complex dynamics over multiple scales.
