We verify explicitly that UV/IR mixing for noncommutative gauge theory can be
understood in terms of an induced gravity action, as predicted by the
identification [1] of gravity within matrix models of NC gauge theory. More
precisely, we obtain the Einstein-Hilbert action by integrating out a scalar
field in the adjoint. It arises from the well-known UV/IR mixing of NC gauge
theory, which is carefully re-analyzed and interpreted in terms of gravity. The
matrix model therefore contains gravity as an IR effect, due to UV/IR mixing.
