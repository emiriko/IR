We study cluster algebras that are associated to unpunctured surfaces with
coefficients arising from boundary arcs. We give a direct formula for the
Laurent polynomial expansion of cluster variables in these cluster algebras in
terms of certain paths on a triangulation of the surface. As an immediate
consequence, we prove the positivity conjecture of Fomin and Zelevinsky for
these cluster algebras. In the special case where the cluster algebra is
acyclic, we also give a formula for the expansion of cluster variables as a
polynomial whose indeterminates are the cluster variables contained in the
union of an arbitrary acyclic cluster and all its neighbouring clusters in the
mutation graph.
