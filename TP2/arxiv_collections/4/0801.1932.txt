In this article, we calculate the strong coupling constants $g_{B_{s0} B_s
\eta}$ and $g_{B_{s1} B^*_s \eta}$ with the light-cone QCD sum rules. Then we
take into account the small $\eta-\pi^0$ transition matrix according to
Dashen's theorem, and obtain the small decay widths for the isospin violation
processes $B_{s0}\to B_s\eta\to B_s\pi^0$ and $B_{s1}\to B_s^*\eta\to
B_s^*\pi^0$. We can search the strange-bottomed $(0^+,1^+)$ mesons $B_{s0}$ and
$B_{s1}$ in the invariant $B_s \pi^0$ and $B^*_s \pi^0$ mass distributions
respectively.
