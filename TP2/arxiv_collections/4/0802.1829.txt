We review the connection between statistical mechanics and the analysis of
random optimization problems, with particular emphasis on the random k-SAT
problem. We discuss and characterize the different phase transitions that are
met in these problems, starting from basic concepts. We also discuss how
statistical mechanics methods can be used to investigate the behavior of local
search and decimation based algorithms.
