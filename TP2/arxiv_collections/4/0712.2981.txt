As the past decade barely dawned, a fundamentally novel view of cancer
relating to signal transduction through intracellular hormones/growth factors
and their subunits began to unfold. Further along, it gained additional
substance with the advent of the interdisciplinary fields of particle biology
and peptide strings which explain (onco)protein dynamics in spacetime, for
instance insulin-driven sub- and trans-cellular carcinogenesis, by physical
principles. Here, this new understanding is expanded to introduce the concept
of "oncoprotein metastasis" preceding cancer cell spread and, thereby, a
particular emphasis is placed on its potential role in the emergence of the
pre-metastatic niche. Consistent with this perception, yet unlike currently
advocated treatments that target cancer cells only, future antineoplastic
strategies should aim to mimic natural tumor suppressors as well as involve
both (morphologically) normal and malignant cells. If validated in human
patients with advanced cancer disease, its otherwise frequently lethal course
may be halted and reversed just in time.
