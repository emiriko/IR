In a ferromagnetic spin chain, the control of the local effective magnetic
field allows to manipulate the static and dynamical properties of entanglement.
In particular, the propagation of quantum correlations can be driven to a great
extent so as to achieve an entanglement transfer on demand toward a selected
site.
