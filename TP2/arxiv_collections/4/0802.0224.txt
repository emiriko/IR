An optimized method for estimating path-ensemble averages using data from
processes driven in opposite directions is presented. Based on this estimator,
bidirectional expressions for reconstructing free energies and potentials of
mean force from single-molecule force spectroscopy - valid for biasing
potentials of arbitrary stiffness - are developed. Numerical simulations on a
model potential indicate that these methods perform better than unidirectional
strategies.
