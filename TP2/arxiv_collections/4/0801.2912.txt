In this Reply to the preceding Comment of Klimchitskaya and Mostepanenko (cf.
also quant-ph/0703214), we summarize and maintain our position that the Drude
dispersion relation when inserted in the Lifshitz formula gives a
thermodynamically satisfactory description of the Casimir force, also in the
limiting case when the relaxation frequency goes to zero (perfect crystals).
