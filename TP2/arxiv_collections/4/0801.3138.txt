The Michelson-Morley experiment is considered via a single photon
interferometer and a hypothesis of the dragging of the permittivity of free
space and permeability of free space. The Michelson-Morley experimental results
can be interpreted using de Broglie-Bohm picture. In the global positioning
system (GPS) experiment, isotropic constancy of the speed of light, c, was
confirmed by direct one way measurement. That is, Michelson-Morley experiments
without interference are confirmed every day; therefore the hypothesis of frame
dragging is a suitable explanation of the Michelson-Morley experimental
results.
