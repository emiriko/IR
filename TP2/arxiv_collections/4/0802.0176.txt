Among all the theories proposed to explain the 'anomalous' perihelion
precession of Mercury's orbit announced in 1859 by Le Verrier, the general
theory of relativity proposed by Einstein in November 1915, alone could
calculate Mercury's 'anomalous' precession with a precision demanded by
observational accuracy. Since Mercury's precession was a directly derived
result of the full general theory, it was viewed by Einstein as the most
critical test of general relativity, amongst the three tests proposed by him.
With the advent of the space age, the observational accuracy level has improved
further and it became possible to detect this precession for other planetary
orbits of the solar system -- viz., Venus and the Earth. This conclusively
proved that the phenomenon of 'anomalous' perihelion precession of planetary
orbits is really a relativistic effect. Our previous papers presented the
mathematical model and the computed value of the relativistic perihelion
precession of Mercury's orbit using an alternate relativistic gravitational
model, which is a remodeled form of Einstein's relativity theories, and which
retained only experimentally proven principles and has been enriched by the
benefits of almost a century-long relativity experimentation including the
space age experiments. Using this model, we present in this paper the computed
values of the relativistic precession of Venus and the Earth, which compare
well with the predictions of general relativity and also are in agreement with
the observed values within the range of uncertainty.
