We examine dynamic structure factors of spin-1/2 chains with nearest-neighbor
interactions of XX and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya type, and with periodic and random
changes in the sign of these interactions. This special kind of inhomogeneity
can be eliminated from the Hamiltonian by suitable transformation of the spin
variables. As a result, the dynamic structure factors of periodic or random
chains can be computed from those of the uniform chains. Using the exact
analytical and precise numerical results available for the uniform systems we
illustrate the effects of regular alternation or random disorder on dynamic
structure factors of quantum spin chains.
