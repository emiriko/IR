Starting with an extended version of the Anderson lattice where the
f-electrons are allowed a weak dispersion, we examine the possibility of a Mott
localization of the f-electrons, for a finite value of the hybridization $V$.
We study the fluctuations at the quantum critical point (QCP) where the
f-electrons localize. We find they are in the same universality class as for
the Kondo breakdown QCP, with the following notable features.
  The quantum critical regime sees the appearance of an additional energy scale
separating two universality classes. In the low energy regime, the fluctuations
are dominated by massless gauge modes, while in the intermediate energy regime,
the fluctuations of the modulus of the order parameter are the most relevant
ones. In the latter regime, electric transport simplifies drastically, leading
to a quasi-linear resistivity in 3D and anomalous exponents lower than T in 2
D. This rather unique feature of the quantum critical regime enables us to make
experimentally testable predictions.
