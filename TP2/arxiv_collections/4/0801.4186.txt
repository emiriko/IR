We present a two-flavor QCD calculation of $B_K$ on a $16^3 \times 32$
lattice at $a\sim 0.12$ fm (or equivalently $a^{-1}\sim$1.67 GeV). Both valence
and sea quarks are described by the overlap fermion formulation. The matching
factor is calculated non-perturbatively with the so-called RI/MOM scheme. We
find that the lattice data are well described by the next-to-leading order
(NLO) partially quenched chiral perturbation theory (PQChPT) up to around a
half of the strange quark mass ($m_s^{\rm phys}/2$). The data at quark masses
heavier than $m_s^{\rm phys}/2$ are fitted including a part of
next-to-next-to-leading order terms. We obtain $B_K^{\bar{\rm MS}}(2 {\rm
GeV})= 0.537(4)(40)$, where the first error is statistical and the second is an
estimate of systematic uncertainties from finite volume, fixing topology, the
matching factor, and the scale setting.
