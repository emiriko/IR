The quantum chromodynamics (QCD) sum rules for the Delta baryons are analyzed
by taking into account the finite-width effects, through explicit utilization
of the Breit-Wigner shape. We apply a Monte-Carlo based analysis to the
'traditional' and the parity-projected sum rules. The first Delta excitation
state is also considered as a sub-continuum resonance and the widths are
calculated using the mass values as input.
