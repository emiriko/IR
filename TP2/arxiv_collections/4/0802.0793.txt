A variable group Y is assumed to depend upon R thematic variable groups X 1,
>..., X R . We assume that components in Y depend linearly upon components in
the Xr's. In this work, we propose a multiple covariance criterion which
extends that of PLS regression to this multiple predictor groups situation. On
this criterion, we build a PLS-type exploratory method - Structural Equation
Exploratory Regression (SEER) - that allows to simultaneously perform dimension
reduction in groups and investigate the linear model of the components. SEER
uses the multidimensional structure of each group. An application example is
given.
