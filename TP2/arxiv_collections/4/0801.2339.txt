We propose a construction of the spherical subalgebra of a symplectic
reflection algebra of an arbitrary rank corresponding to a star-shaped affine
Dynkin diagram. Namely, it is obtained from the universal enveloping algebra of
a certain semi-simple Lie algebra by the process of quantum Hamiltonian
reduction. As an application, we propose a construction of finite-dimensional
representations of the spherical subalgebra.
