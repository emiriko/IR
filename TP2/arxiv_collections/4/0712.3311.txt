We propose to combine and slightly extend two existing "Les Houches Accords"
to provide a simple generic interface between beyond-the-standard-model
parton-level and event-level generators. All relevant information - particle
content, quantum numbers of new states, masses, cross sections, parton-level
events, etc - is collected in one single file, which adheres to the Les Houches
Event File (LHEF) standard.
