Geometrical model for quantum objects is suggested. It is shown that
equations for free material Dirac field and for Maxwell electromagnetic field
can be considered as relations describing propagation of the space topological
defects. This interpretation explains irrational properties of quantum objects
such as wave-corpuscular duality, stochastic behavior, instantaneous nonlocal
correlation in EPR-paradox, the light velocity invariance and so on. It is
shown also that Dirac equation for hydrogen atom can be also considered as
relation describing the space topological defect. Electromagnetic potentials
appears within this approach as connectivities of the defect universal covering
space and gauge invariance of electromagnetic field happens to be a natural
consequence of topological interpretation. Proposed approach can be also
considered as a nonlocal model with hidden variables. Preliminary results were
published by parts early, and here they are presented completely.
