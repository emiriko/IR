We present a fully microscopic study of the $^{16}$O+$^{208}$Pb fusion using
the density-constrained time-dependent Hartree-Fock theory. The calculated
fusion cross-sections are in good agreement with the experimental data for the
entire energy range indicating that the incorporation of dynamical effects is
crucial in describing heavy-ion fusion.
