Given the recent tragedy involving a 350 pound Siberian Tiger and the death
of teenager Carlos Souza Jr., one must ask a fundamental question: Can a tiger
overcome an obstacle that is thirty-three feet away and twelve and a half feet
tall? Are these dimensions sufficient enough to protect the zoo-visitors from a
potential escape and/or attack? To answer these questions we use simple
two-dimensional projectile motion to find the minimum velocity a tiger needs in
order to clear the obstacle. With our results we conclude that it is highly
likely that the tiger was able to leap over the obstacle with ease!
