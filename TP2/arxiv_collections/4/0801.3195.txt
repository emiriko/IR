We present new measurements of the total and partial fragmentation cross
sections in the energy range 0.3-10 A GeV of 56Fe, 28Si and 12C beams on
polyethylene, CR39 and aluminum targets. The exposures were made at BNL, USA
and HIMAC, Japan. The CR39 nuclear track detectors were used to identify the
incident and survived beams and their fragments. The total fragmentation cross
sections for all targets are almost energy independent while they depend on the
target mass. The measured partial fragmentation cross sections are also
discussed.
