The tri-bimaximal mixing is a good approximation for the present data of
neutrino mixing angles. The deviation from the tri-bimaximal mixing is
discussed numerically in the framework of the A4 model. Values of
\tan^2\theta_{12}, \sin^2 2\theta_{23} and |U_{e3}| deviate from the
tri-bimaximal mixing due to the corrections of the vacuum alignment of flavon
fields. It is remarked that \sin^2 2\theta_{23} deviates scarcely from 1 while
\sin^2\theta_{12} can deviate from 1/3 considerably and \sin\theta_{13} could
be near the present experimental upper bound. The CP violating measure J_{CP}
and the effective Majorana neutrino mass m_{ee} are also discussed.
