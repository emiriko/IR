We describe how protonium, the quasi-stable antiproton-proton bound system,
has been synthesized following the interaction of antiprotons with the
molecular ion H$_2^+$ in a nested Penning trap environment. From a careful
analysis of the spatial distributions of antiproton annihilation events in the
ATHENA experiment, evidence is presented for protonium production with sub-eV
kinetic energies in states around $n$ = 70, with low angular momenta. This work
provides a new 2-body system for study using laser spectroscopic techniques.
