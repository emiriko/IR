Using heat kernel methods developed by Vaillant, a local index formula is
obtained for families of d-bar operators on the Teichmuller universal curve of
Riemann surfaces of genus g with n punctures. The formula also holds on the
moduli space M{g,n} in the sense of orbifolds where it can be written in terms
of Mumford-Morita-Miller classes. The degree two part of the formula gives the
curvature of the corresponding determinant line bundle equipped with the
Quillen connection, a result originally obtained by Takhtajan and Zograf.
