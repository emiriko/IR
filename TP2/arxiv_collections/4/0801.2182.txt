We study one-dimensional models of particle diffusion and
attachment/detachment from islands where the detachment rates gamma(m) of
particles at the cluster edges increase with cluster mass m. They are expected
to mimic the effects of lattice mismatch with the substrate and/or long-range
repulsive interactions that work against the formation of long islands.
Short-range attraction is represented by an overall factor epsilon<<1 in the
detachment rates relatively to isolated particle hopping rates [epsilon ~
exp(-E/T), with binding energy E and temperature T]. We consider various
gamma(m), from rapidly increasing forms such as gamma(m) ~ m to slowly
increasing ones, such as gamma(m) ~ [m/(m+1)]^b. A mapping onto a column
problem shows that these systems are zero-range processes, whose steady states
properties are exactly calculated under the assumption of independent column
heights in the Master equation. Simulation provides island size distributions
which confirm analytic reductions and are useful whenever the analytical tools
cannot provide results in closed form. The shape of island size distributions
can be changed from monomodal to monotonically decreasing by tuning the
temperature or changing the particle density rho. Small values of the scaling
variable X=epsilon^{-1}rho/(1-rho) favour the monotonically decreasing ones.
However, for large X, rapidly increasing gamma(m) lead to distributions with
peaks very close to <m> and rapidly decreasing tails, while slowly increasing
gamma(m) provide peaks close to <m>/2$ and fat right tails.
