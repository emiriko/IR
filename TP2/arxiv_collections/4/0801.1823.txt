In order to generate initial data for nonlinear relativistic simulations, one
needs to solve the Einstein constraints, which can be cast into a coupled set
of nonlinear elliptic equations. Here we present an approach for solving these
equations on three-dimensional multi-block domains using finite element
methods. We illustrate our approach on a simple example of Brill wave initial
data, with the constraints reducing to a single linear elliptic equation for
the conformal factor $\psi$. We use quadratic Lagrange elements on
semi-structured simplicial meshes, obtained by triangulation of multi-block
grids. In the case of uniform refinement the scheme is superconvergent at most
mesh vertices, due to local symmetry of the finite element basis with respect
to local spatial inversions. We show that in the superconvergent case
subsequent unstructured mesh refinements do not improve the quality of our
initial data. As proof of concept that this approach is feasible for generating
multi-block initial data in three dimensions, after constructing the initial
data we evolve them in time using a high order finite-differencing multi-block
approach and extract the gravitational waves from the numerical solution.
