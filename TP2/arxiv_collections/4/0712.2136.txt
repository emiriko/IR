We investigate dynamics of semi-quantal spin systems in which quantum bits
are attached to classically and possibly stochastically moving classical
particles. The interaction between the quantum bits takes place when the
respective classical particles get close to each other in space. We find that
with Heisenberg XX couplings quantum homogenization takes place after a time
long enough, regardless of the details of the underlying classical dynamics.
This is accompanied by the development of a stationary bipartite entanglement.
If the information on the details of the motion of a stochastic classical
system is disregarded, the stationary state of the whole quantum subsystem is
found to be a complete mixture in the studied cases, though the transients
depend on the properties of the classical motion.
