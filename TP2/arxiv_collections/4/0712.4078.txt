We show that asymmetrical mesoscopic superconductors bring new insight into
vortex physics where we found the remarkable coexistence of long and short
vortices. We study an asymmetrical mesoscopic sphere, that lacks one of its
quadrants, and obtain its three-dimensional vortex patterns by solving the
Ginzburg-Landau theory. We find that the vortex patterns are asymmetric whose
effects are clearly visible and detectable in the transverse magnetization and
torque.
