To study the electron-phonon mechanism of superconductivity in NaxCoO2, we
perform semiquantitative analysis of the electron-phonon interaction (EPI)
between relevant optical phonons (breathing and shear phonons) and t_{2g}
electrons (a_{1g} and e_g' electrons) in the presence of trigonal distortion.
We consider two kinds of contributions to the EPI; the EPI originating from the
Coulomb potential of O ions and that originating from the d-p transfer integral
between Co and O in CoO_6 octahedron. We find that the EPI for shear phonons,
which induces the interorbital hopping of electrons, is large in NaxCoO_2
because of the trigonal distortion of CoO_2 layer. For this reason, Tc for
s-wave pairing is prominently enlarged owing to interorbital hopping of Cooper
pairs induced by shear phonons, even if the top of e_g' electron band is close
to but below the Fermi level as suggested experimentally. This mechanism of
superconductivity is referred to as the valence-band Suhl-Kondo (SK) mechanism.
Since the SK mechanism is seldom damaged by the Coulomb repulsion, s-wave
superconductivity is realized irrespective of large Coulomb interaction U~5 eV
at Co sites. We also study the oxygen isotope effect on Tc, and find that it
becomes very small due to strong Coulomb interaction. Finally, we discuss the
possible mechanism of anisotropic s-wave superconducting state in NaxCoO2,
resulting from the coexistence of strong EPI and the antiferromagnetic
fluctuations.
