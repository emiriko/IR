The transport properties of highly oriented pyrolitic graphite (HOPG) and
polycrystal graphite have been studied. The electric conductivity of HOPG is
several times larger than that of the polycrystal graphite. Along with the
large magnetoresistances (MR), the polycrystal graphite show the accordant
semiconductor-like character in a wide temperature (roughly range from 20K to
120K) under 0, 4, 8, 12 T applied magnetic field, while the
magnetic-field-induced metal-semiconductor-like transition was only found in
HOPG. The difference of transport properties originates from the Coulomb
interaction quasipartical in HOPG graphite layers in contrast with the grain
boundary scattering in the polycrystal graphite.
