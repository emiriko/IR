Despite the spontaneity of some in vitro protein folding reactions, native
folding in vivo often requires the participation of barrel-shaped multimeric
complexes known as chaperonins. Although it has long been known that chaperonin
substrates fold upon sequestration inside the chaperonin barrel, the precise
mechanism by which confinement within this space facilitates folding remains
unknown. In this study, we examine the possibility that the chaperonin mediates
a favorable reorganization of the solvent for the folding reaction. We begin by
discussing the effect of electrostatic charge on solvent-mediated hydrophobic
forces in an aqueous environment. Based on these initial physical arguments, we
construct a simple, phenomenological theory for the thermodynamics of density
and hydrogen bond order fluctuations in liquid water. Within the framework of
this model, we investigate the effect of confinement within a chaperonin-like
cavity on the configurational free energy of water by calculating solvent free
energies for cavities corresponding to the different conformational states in
the ATP- driven catalytic cycle of the prokaryotic chaperonin GroEL. Our
findings suggest that one function of chaperonins may be to trap unfolded
proteins and subsequently expose them to a micro-environment in which the
hydrophobic effect, a crucial thermodynamic driving force for folding, is
enhanced.
